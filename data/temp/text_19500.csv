The program is being described as a conservative counterpunch to Media Matters, the Obama-linked organization that focuses on silencing conservatives in the media. “For too long, we’ve played by the Marquess of Queensberry rules, allowing the left to stifle the truth and silence truth tellers in the name of their politically correct narrative. Now we’re taking the battle to their home turf — and we will do so aggressively and unwaveringly, every single day. This is just another avenue for applying Breitbart’s fighting spirit to the battle against those who would destroy what America stands for,” Shapiro said. Shapiro will maintain his position and all of his duties at Breitbart News as well.

One of the founders of the New Left in the 1960s, David Horowitz has become an icon in the conservative movement, famed for his deep understanding of the ideology and strategy of the modern left in America. He has led the Freedom Center since its inception as the Center for the Study of Popular Culture in 1988.

“We could not be more excited to be working with Ben on this project,” Horowitz told Breitbart News. “Andrew Breitbart was a fantastic friend to the Freedom Center and an indispensable warrior in the battle against the anti-America, socialist left and its allies in the universities, the unions and the Democratic Party, and Breitbart News carries on his legacy. We look forward to working with our friends at Breitbart in continuing the fight for America’s future.”

Horowitz and Breitbart worked together on the film Occupy Unmasked, which looked behind the scenes at the institutional left’s control of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Horowitz’s life’s work in exposing the mendacity of the left was a key part of the film. “Occupy Unmasked shows how closely David and Andrew were on their work of exposing and defeating the forces of the institutional left in America. We consider Ben Shapiro’s leading role at ‘Truth Revolt’ to be nothing more than a continuation of that work,” said Stephen K. Bannon, Executive Chairman of Breitbart News.

“Ben Shapiro is a charter member of the Breitbart News ‘Fight Club’ and has been instrumental in the explosive growth the site has experienced over the past 18 months,” said Bannon. “Ben’s ‘voice’ and fighting spirit will also be central in our building out both the site and the company in the years ahead.”

“As was so often the case, Andrew spotted and mentored important conservative voices long before they percolated up to a national level,” said Breitbart News President and CEO Larry Solov. “Ben, who when Andrew met him was a college student at UCLA, is one such voice. Ben has the fight and the intellectual heft to land devastating body blows to the institutional Left and the biased media, which is such a crucial part of what we do here at Breitbart News. We have encouraged Ben to take a leading role with David Horowitz in TruthRevolt to complement his ongoing work at Breitbart News where he will continue to help the grow the company and carry on the fighting spirit and legacy of Andrew Breitbart.”

Shapiro, a mentee and friend of Andrew Breitbart since age 17, became Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News in February 2012. Shapiro, 29, is the New York Times bestselling author of Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America (2013), as well as Primetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV (2011), Project President: Bad Hair and Botox on the Road to the White House (2008), Porn Generation: How Social Liberalism Is Corrupting Our Future (2005), and Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America’s Youth (2004). Shapiro began his career as the youngest syndicated columnist in the nation with Creators Syndicate, graduated Harvard Law School at 23, and hosts The Morning Answer on KRLA 870 in Los Angeles.

Shapiro has been widely praised across the conservative movement. Sarah Palin says that Americans should “consider Ben’s advice about how we must stand up and push back twice as hard against this bullying.” Sean Hannity says to join Ben Shapiro and “fight back!” against liberal bullying. Glenn Beck calls Shapiro a “warrior for conservatism, against those who use fear and intimidation to stifle honest debate. I’ve never known him to back down from a fight.” And Michelle Malkin says Shapiro is “infused with the indomitable spirit of his friend and mentor Andrew Breitbart.” Even the liberal Washington Post, in the aftermath of Shapiro’s devastating destruction of Piers Morgan on national television, conceded that Shapiro is a “foe of extraordinary polemical agility.”"

There is no doubt whatsoever about what Republicans, personified by Ralph Hudgens, are doing here. They are using and abusing the powers they possess in order to sabotage this law.

We can compare their behavior to that of Democrats after the passage of Medicare Part D—championed by George W. Bush. Democrats, although most of them opposed the law, engaged in no such attempts to sabotage its rollout. They fought on the floor of the House and Senate, but once they lost, they accepted that the law is the law in a democracy. But that's not how Republicans operate.

Perhaps the most egregious and potentially effective measure in the effort to obstruct Obamacare comes out of the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives. The House Energy and Commerce Committee last week submitted a request for a huge amount of irrelevant information from navigators—the people whose job it is to guide and educate citizens about how Obamacare can work for them. The fact that Republicans at the state and federal level have focused on throwing up roadblocks in the way of the navigators shows just how important they will be to the success of Obamacare.

The request from the Energy and Commerce Committee came in less than a month before the new Obamacare health insurance exchanges go live on Oct. 1, and serves no purpose other than to drain time, energy and resources away from navigators in the run-up to that date. Of course, the Committee has largely targeted states where the highest percentage of the population lacks insurance. In case you were wondering, yes, Texas is the worst offender. Go conservatism!

Law professor and health reform advocate Timothy Jost had this to say about the House's efforts:

Look at item 6 and the accompanying sheet defining documents subject to the request. This could include hundreds of documents and emails and could take days to locate and compile. It might have been reasonable to ask them to describe what they do and how they intend to do it. This is a much more intrusive and extensive request. It is also important to note that most of these organizations are doing this on a comparative shoestring, and this is the busiest time in their existence. They just got their grants, they are concluding cooperative agreements with HHS, they are hiring, training their employees, getting them certified, setting up security systems, making contacts, and even to have to take a day off to respond to this is too much. And the committee knows this. This is not about gathering information. It is about trying to stop a program. (Emphasis mine)

The time has come to put a stop to these kinds of actions. The Republicans have taken a power that is designed to be applied reasonably and judiciously, namely Congress' authority to oversee the executive branch, and abused it beyond recognition. They have twisted that authority into an instrument to defy democracy, to render null the laws passed by the people's elected representatives.

This abuse cannot be allowed to stand. It is a perversion of democracy. The time has come to fight back. What can we do about it? If I were the president, I'd want to do whatever was in my power to fight back. And here's my idea:

Yes, Congress has the power to issue these demands for information. There is no limit on their oversight power, other than that they cannot violate a citizen's civil liberties. In fact, if the navigators do not comply, they can be held in contempt of Congress, a federal charge. Fine. But the President can checkmate this move with one of his own.

The Constitution, in Article II, Section 2, describes the President's power to pardon, according to which he or she:



shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.

There is no other limit on that power. The president can issue a pardon as soon as a crime has been committed, there is no need to wait for any charges to be brought.

President Obama should announce that:



1) The request from the House Energy and Commerce Committee to the Obamacare navigators is nothing more than a blatant attempt to prevent Americans from obtaining health insurance. 2) The request is part of a broader Republican scheme to sabotage Obamacare -- which is the law of the land. 3) The request is an abuse of power, plain and simple. Our government cannot function properly if one side is allowed to abuse its power in order to prevent duly enacted laws from functioning properly.

The president should declare that, for these reasons, he authorizes all the targeted parties to ignore the request from the House of Representatives. Furthermore, he will issue immediate, full, and complete pardons to anyone that the House attempts to prosecute for ignoring their request, or any other similar requests that the President deems equally abusive and designed to sabotage duly passed laws.

This would be a serious step, and it is not one I advocate lightly. Of course, Barack Obama wouldn't the first president to try and get around a congressional subpoena. We are talking about something different here, however, than what George W. Bush did. Congressional oversight is about checks and balances, making sure that no branch of government gains too much power. The request from the House Energy and Commerce Committee is part of an attempt by one party to undo legislation even though it lacks the votes to do so. If they succeed, there will be no point to even having elections. What I have proposed is a defensive measure, one that fights fire with fire rather than something designed to cover up misdeeds.

When one side keeps punching below the belt, the other side eventually has no choice but to do whatever it can to defend itself. In this case, the White House would be defending its signature law, which really means defending the people who wouldn't be able to get health insurance without it. Furthermore, the president would be defending democracy against an opponent that has shown time and again that it does not care how it obtains power.

The Marquess of Queensbury and his rules ain't welcome at this contest. It's a street fight. It's time for the White House to get ugly. Long past time.

The question for President Obama is the same one the Chicago beat cop put to the G-Man in The Untouchables:

Illegal immigrants make up a tiny portion of the 7.1 million people in federal housing, according to government statistics. But authorities may be unaware of thousands more, and critics say no illegal immigrant should get housing benefits. The issue made headlines in November with news that Zeituni Onyango, an aunt of President-elect Barack Obama, was living in Boston public housing while in the country illegally. The federal government, which funds the lion's share of the nation's public housing, requires only that illegal immigrants share a home with at least one family member who is in the country legally and pay their share of the rent. While there are no hard numbers on illegal immigrants in public housing, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reports that 29,570 people — 0.4% of all those in federally funded housing — are ""ineligible noncitizens."" Some may be on temporary visas, such as highly educated workers or college students, but many are believed to be illegal immigrants. Frank Bean, director of the University of California, Irvine's Center for Research on Immigration, Population and Public Policy, estimates at least half of ineligible noncitizens — or about 15,000 — are illegal immigrants with U.S.-born children. Anyone born on U.S. soil is automatically a citizen, making their families eligible for federal housing. The HUD tally does not offer a full picture of how many illegal immigrants are in public housing. It doesn't include housing funded by state and local governments, where eligibility requirements vary. Massachusetts, where Obama's aunt occupied one of about 50,000 state-funded units, doesn't ask immigration status under a 1977 federal consent decree in a class-action lawsuit that prohibits the state from denying the benefit to illegal immigrants. Other illegal immigrants may live in public housing without notifying authorities. ""It seems that the larger concern would be those who we don't know about that may be in the U.S. illegally and living in federal housing, yet never risk presenting themselves to HUD,"" said Jonathan Graffeo, a spokesman for Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala. Some prospective tenants and advocates of immigration restrictions are angry about U.S. citizens waiting for housing aid that some number of illegal immigrants are enjoying. New York City has about 260,000 people in line for housing aid. Chicago recently opened its waiting list for the first time in about 10 years and collected 259,000 names in four weeks for 40,000 slots. ""As long as that waiting list includes American citizens or legal immigrants, there's no reason an illegal alien should occupy any of that housing,"" said Rosemary Jenks, director of government relations for NumbersUSA, a group that supports curbs on immigration. In San Diego, applicants are told they can expect to wait five to seven years. ""I don't think we should take a second seat to anyone,"" said Daryl Ford, who applied for housing aid last year and lives in a San Diego homeless shelter. ""We send money to everyone else in the world but we're struggling here."" Some say the costs of illegal immigration in public housing are overstated. Tanya Broder, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, said illegal immigrants are reluctant to seek government benefits because they keep low profiles. Even some legal immigrants shun public housing, fearing reprisals against them or their families, she said. Illegal immigrants get free public education through high school and emergency medical care, but are denied many other services, like food stamps and broad Medicaid coverage. Elliotte Skinner, 48, applied for public housing in San Diego in 2000 and lives in a cramped studio with a shared shower. He says focusing on illegal immigrants misses the point. ""There's too much blame on illegals for the country's problems,"" he said. ""Their numbers are so small (in federally funded housing) they don't even make a difference. The real problem is we don't have enough affordable housing."" Elena Salmon, 45, lives at a San Diego home where about 30 women share four bathrooms while she waits for public housing, but she said it would be inhumane to deny housing to illegal immigrants. ""That's not what America is about,"" she said. ""Why should we kick them out, even if they are taking up some space?"" HUD declined to break down the number of ineligible noncitizens by city or state. The New York City Housing Authority reports 2,471 families with at least one ineligible noncitizen, or 0.9% of the 289,000 households on vouchers or in housing developments. The San Diego Housing Commission reports 658 of the 37,120 people on federal housing vouchers are ineligible noncitizens, or 1.8%. The San Francisco Housing Authority has 148 ineligible noncitizens among its 28,611 people in federal housing, or 0.5%. Housing agencies in Miami-Dade County and Chicago each reported serving less than 50 ineligible noncitizens. The Boston Housing Authority reports 288 of its 45,100 families on federal housing assistance are ineligible noncitizens, or 0.6%. Onyango, the half-sister of Obama's late father, applied for public housing in 2002 while she was in the country legally seeking asylum from her native Kenya, said Lydia Agro, spokeswoman for the Boston Housing Authority, which has a waiting list of nearly 20,000 people. Onyango moved into federally funded housing in 2003 and stayed there after 2004, when, The Associated Press learned, an immigration judge denied her asylum application and ordered her to leave the country. Onyango transferred to an apartment funded only by the state, which cannot ask about immigration status under the court order. In November, her attorney said she was staying with relatives in Cleveland and would fight her deportation order. Copyright 2009 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

State lawmakers, however, did manage to ban the sale of shark fins and slap a new tax on strip clubs.

The two measures are among more than 150 laws taking effect Tuesday. That number is down by about 50 compared with a year ago — 2012 was an election year, and with all House and Senate seats on the ballot, self-preservation was a primary focus for many at the Capitol.

Still, now on the books are laws to increase license plate sticker fees, prevent employers from requesting access to workers' social networking accounts and crack down on drivers who illegally use handicap parking placards.

Lawmakers also sought additional protections for some of the state's most vulnerable, including tougher penalties for parents who don't report their children missing to police in a timely manner. That legislation was inspired by the death of 2-year-old Caylee Anthony, of Florida, whose mother waited a month before alerting officials that her daughter was missing in a case that captured the nation's attention.

Here's a closer look at some of the new laws:

Pocketbook issues

Following years of budget cuts that led to severe maintenance problems at state parks, lawmakers approved several new fees aimed at easing the money crunch. Drivers will see $2 tacked on to the cost of a license plate sticker, and commercial fishermen and those who want to use all-terrain vehicles on state land also will see new fees.

The Illinois Department of Natural Resources hopes to raise as much as $55 million a year to chip away at a roughly $750 million backlog in maintenance projects at parks. The fees were proposed as an alternative to charging admission to visit Illinois parks, though out-of-state visitors still may be asked to pay an entrance fee.

Meanwhile, strip clubs that sell booze or let people drink alcoholic beverages will face a new tax. Club operators have the option of adding a $3 admission fee or paying taxes based on how much money they make. A strip club bringing in $2 million or more a year would pay a $25,000 tax. Ones making $500,000 to $2 million would pay $15,000 a year. Establishments making less than $500,000 would face a $5,000 tax.

The money will be used to support rape crisis centers, which have had funding cuts the past several years.

Consumer issues

Land-line telephone customers could see some relief after lawmakers outlawed ""cramming,"" a practice in which third-party companies place unwanted and unauthorized charges on phone bills.

The surprise charges often go unnoticed, but can cost customers $5 to $45 for services such as voice mail and extended warranties that they never signed up for. The charges usually appear after customers provide their phone number online for things like free recipes or pizzas. Companies use the phone number as a sort of credit card, passing along fees that appear on a customer's bill.

Historically, phone companies looked the other way because they got a piece of the profits, but that changed after the practice drew wider attention. Phone companies helped negotiate the cramming ban in Illinois, the second state to make the practice illegal. The law doesn't apply to cellphones, however.

Illinois also will become the first state without an ocean shore to ban the sale and possession of shark fins, a delicacy in Chinese culture. Environmentalists said the measure is necessary to protect shark populations.

The workplace

A new measure will make it easier for spouses of military members to get professional licenses when they move to Illinois. State regulators will be able to issue temporary licenses for those who are credentialed in other states to practice things like nursing and plumbing. That means family members of military personnel can begin immediately searching for jobs instead of waiting months for the state to vet their qualifications. The effort was inspired by first lady Michelle Obama's campaign to support military families.

Employers won't be allowed to request passwords to social networking sites of workers or job applicants, or they could face fines that start at $200. The idea is to protect the privacy of employees who use Facebook and similar sites. Bosses still can request user names to review public posts, but are not allowed to seek access to restricted portions of an account. It's unclear how many companies in Illinois were asking workers or prospective employees for such passwords.

Crime and punishment

Drivers who illegally use handicap parking plates and decals will face greater fines and penalties, including the possibility of having their licenses revoked. Fines for the unauthorized use of placards for people with disabilities will increase to $600 from $500. Fines for those caught making counterfeit placards or using parking passes in the absence of a qualified holder double to $1,000.

Additionally, doctors who submit false paperwork to help someone get a disabled plate or placard who doesn't need it will face a new $1,000 fine. Those who use handicap placards of people who have died face an even tougher punishment, with fines starting at $2,500 combined with a mandatory suspension of driving privileges for six months. Repeat offenders could have their license revoked for one year. Enforcement is key, however.

Parents and guardians of children 13 or younger who go missing could face felony charges if they fail to alert authorities within 48 hours. The time frame narrows to one hour for adults responsible for children 2 and younger. Dubbed Caylee's Law, the measure is in response to the 2008 death of 2-year-old Caylee Anthony, who was missing for a month before police were alerted. Casey Anthony was charged with her daughter's death, but a jury found her not guilty in July 2011.

It also will be easier for police officers to obtain permission to secretly record suspects when investigating drug crimes. Instead of getting a court order to eavesdrop from a judge, they can seek approval from a state's attorney. Advocates say it will speed up a process that sometimes takes so long a crime is committed before police can get it recorded.

Child victims of sex trafficking will have more time to seek justice under a new law that extends the statute of limitations for those crimes to one year after the victim turns 18 or three years after the crime was committed if the victim was 16 or 17. Before, victims had only three years to seek legal action after the crime.

Meanwhile, judges will have the ability to assign first-time, nonviolent offenders to a two-year diversion program instead of sending them to jail. The plan will operate similarly to probation and allow those who successfully complete community service, drug counseling or other programs to have their criminal record expunged. The idea is to keep low-level offenders out of prison and help them find jobs."
"http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-supreme-court-copyright-law-20130319,0,5654337.story",2013-03-19 07:00:00,[],Supreme Court issues major copyright ruling on foreign sales,"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court, in a major ruling on copyright law, has given foreign buyers of textbooks, movies and other products a right to resell them in the United States without the permission of the copyright owner.

The 6-3 decision is a victory for a former USC student from Thailand, Supap Kirtsaeng, who figured he could earn money by buying textbooks at lower costs in his native country and selling them in the United States.

He was sued by publisher John Wiley & Sons for violating its copyright protection. A jury in New York agreed with the publisher, and the former student was assessed damages of $600,000 for willfully violating the company’s copyrights.

But the Supreme Court reversed that judgment today in Kirtsaeng vs. John Wiley and ruled the student had the better interpretation of the law.

The decision helps book buyers and merchants who resell goods purchased abroad, but it could prove to be a setback for American companies that sell copyrighted goods overseas.

Until now, these U.S. copyright holders have maintained that they can sell copyrighted works abroad -- and sometimes, at much lower prices -- and prevent them from being re-imported for sale in this country without their permission.

But the justices decided Tuesday that the holders’ rights expire when their copyrighted product is lawfully sold overseas. Under the so-called “first sale” doctrine, a copyright holder has a right to profit from the first sale of a book, but not its resale.

Justice Stephen Breyer noted the textbooks at issue were lawfully made overseas with the permission of the copyright owner. They were not pirated copies. In that instance, the “first sale” doctrine applies, he said, so that buyer was free to resell the books he had lawfully purchased.

Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy dissented.

The Senate has provided a bipartisan bill, and the House is working on reform. The key issues are border security and a legal pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million who are here illegally.

The political reasons for the House to negotiate a deal are many. A recent Gallup poll showed that 87% of Americans support comprehensive reform that includes a pathway to citizenship. Moreover, growing numbers of Latino voters in key states turned out in historic numbers for Obama in last year’s election, which strongly suggests that, in the long run, Republicans need to address this constituency or continue to lose votes.

However, Speaker John A. Boehner, the Republican’s point man in the House, doesn’t have the luxury of operating in the long term. The conservative bloc of House Republicans is digging in against reform that includes a pathway to citizenship, and with what promises to be a bloody spending fight with Democrats looming, the speaker needs to strengthen his position with his conference.

It’s no wonder the speaker has instructed his committee chairmen to send up smaller, incremental bills for consideration, with a final decision on the path forward to come this fall.

Advertisement

Regardless of what Boehner and the committee chairmen come up with, most of the millions of unauthorized immigrants here now will almost surely stay because it is expensive and time-consuming to deport them. The immigration enforcement system is currently funded to deport roughly 400,000 immigrants a year, funding that’s unlikely to increase in difficult budgetary times, and it can take years to get many cases in front of immigration judges.

In part for those reasons, the Department of Homeland Security does not treat all deportations equally. In recent years, the agency has expanded its use of prosecutorial discretion in immigration enforcement, focusing on recent border crossings and public safety threats. Today, deportations of immigrants with strong connections to the U.S. are unlikely.

Indeed, prosecutorial discretion is a guiding principle of this administration’s immigration enforcement policy. With it, the administration has moved immigration enforcement from an ad hoc system in which individuals are removed indiscriminately to one that prioritizes criminals, recent border crossers and fugitives. In 2012, 96% of all removals were based on these priorities. Opponents of the policy call it amnesty, but with limited resources, it’s obvious why an agency charged with protecting the homeland is focusing its deportation efforts on national security and public safety.

For Obama, expanding prosecutorial discretion in deportations has been good policy and politics. It might just be the trump card he needs to bring House Republicans to the negotiating table.

Last summer, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which established the first program in which a subset of those here illegally could come forward and register with the government. If you were brought here as a child, are currently in school or the military and have no criminal record, you can get protection from deportation and you can petition for work authorization.

This program, aimed at so-called Dreamers, triggered a wave of enthusiasm in the Latino community, and many political analysts believe it helped the president weather 50% disapproval ratings last summer and win a historic 75% of the Latino vote in November. Nearly 520,000 people have received relief under this program since it was announced.

Now the president should turn again to this playbook and expand the program to other sympathetic categories of immigrants, such as those with a longtime presence in the United States or those with U.S.-citizen family members. The legal parameters and operational protocols have been established, and because this program, like the original Deferred Action program, would be funded from immigrants’ fees, it would not require a congressional appropriation. An expanded Deferred Action program could be up and running within weeks.

Of course, those committed to defeating reform would trot out the tired criticism that the president doesn’t enforce the laws on the books. They conveniently forget that both parties share the blame for the current system, and they ignore the record-low estimates of border crossing attempts and the record-high number of deportations. (A recent Pew Hispanic Center analysis found net migration from Mexico has fallen to zero in recent years.) Nothing the administration does would change their minds.

It is a near-certainty that expansion of prosecutorial discretion will occur if the House defeats all reform efforts or the House and Senate can’t reach an agreement. Perhaps the president can force negotiations by reminding critics that, in the absence of real reform, a president — any party’s president — still has to govern. For Boehner and the House GOP, the alternative to negotiating would be expanding “amnesty” without any of the security and business enhancements that the Republicans want and the nation desperately needs.

If the president acts boldly, he might be able to wrest a bill from Congress that could establish his legacy and, more important, secure the real immigration policy changes this country needs.

Will Obama suffer the ‘second-term curse’?

Recent events suggest that the 44th president may not be immune to the phenomenon that historians call the “second-term curse.”

Not four months after his ambitious inaugural address, President Obama finds himself struggling to move his legislative agenda through an unbudging Congress.

And over the past week, two flaring controversies — one over his administration’s handling of the killing of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans in Libya, the other over Internal Revenue Service employees targeting tea party groups for special scrutiny — have dominated the discussion in Washington.

It is far from clear how big a political liability either will turn out to be.

At a minimum, they represent diversions working against a president who is keenly aware of how little time he has left to achieve big things. And they are a test of the insular Obama team’s skill at keeping its footing in an environment of hyperpartisan politics and hair-trigger media.

On Friday, for instance, news of the IRS admission and developments surrounding the Benghazi attack turned White House press secretary Jay Carney’s daily briefing into a feeding frenzy and drowned out coverage of a speech that Obama was giving that day on the implementation of the health-care law that stands as his biggest achievement.

“After the election, the president said he was familiar with the literature on second-term difficulties,” said presidential historian Michael Beschloss. “We scholars may be about to see whether knowledge of that history can help a president when they begin to strike.”

“What we’ve seen in the past week reignites the question scholars ask about problematic second terms,” Beschloss added. “Is it mainly a coincidence that every president of the past 80 years has had a hard time after getting reelected? Or is it somehow baked into the structure of a second-term presidency that some combination of serious troubles is going to happen?”

White House officials acknowledge that the history of modern second-term presidencies is a sobering one, replete with scandal and failure.

But they insist that they have seen nothing to suggest that Obama will fall into the traps that have ensnared so many of his predecessors: nothing that rivals the Watergate investigation that drove Richard M. Nixon out of office in 1974, the Iran-contra scandal that nearly derailed Ronald Reagan’s presidency in 1986,or the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998.

The current furor will serve only to make Obama’s opponents look bad, they predict.

“Partisan investigations by the Republicans have been a part of daily life around here since the Republicans took over the House in 2011. Every time they jump up and down and scream, ‘Watergate,’ they end with egg on their face,” said White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer. “I don’t see this as a second-term phenomenon. It’s just life with the GOP in charge.”

But even some of Obama’s allies worry privately that his difficulties may be made worse by his lack of deep relationships on Capitol Hill, notwithstanding his round of dinners with members lately. His congressional liaison, Miguel Rodriguez, came to the job virtually unknown by lawmakers. The president himself has a tendency to hunker down with a tight circle of loyalists.

“I don’t think he has adequate people questioning him on these things,” said one close Obama ally and Washington veteran. He agreed to speak frankly on the condition that he not be identified.

Obama’s aides remain optimistic about his ability to rack up major achievements, starting with the successful implementation of the health-care law enacted during his first term and including the passage of a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system.

“From the president on down, we all understand that controversies and distractions are going to arise,” said White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri. “But we try to keep a good sense of understanding the difference between what people care about and what is just politics.”

The current political culture “creates more froth around these controversies, but what is the impact?” added Palmieri, a Clinton White House veteran. “Things definitely move quickly now and go away faster than they used to.”

It is true that the president’s adversaries are already predicting the most dire consequences, particularly from the questions that have arisen over the administration’s forthrightness in its response to the Benghazi attack.

“I believe that before it’s all over, this president will not fill out his full term,” former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee predicted on his radio show. “As bad as Watergate was because it broke the trust between the president and the people, no one died. This is more serious because four Americans did in fact die. And President Obama has yet to explain why did they die.”

Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) has labeled the Benghazi case “the most serious and most egregious coverup in American history.”

“We may be starting to use the I-word before too long,” Inhofe told conservative talk radio host Rusty Humphries, referring to the possibility of impeachment.

But the unease is no longer confined to the right, particularly after three State Department officials appeared before Congress last week and criticized administration actions before, during and after the Sept. 11 attacks in Libya. E-mails from that chaotic period that have come to light through media reports in recent days suggest there was furious infighting among various agencies over the talking points presented as the administration’s first explanation of the events.

“There is no evidence the White House is hiding the truth about what occurred in Benghazi,” journalist David Corn wrote in left-leaning Mother Jones magazine. “But the White House has indeed been caught not telling the full story.”

Meanwhile, the IRS’s admission that it singled out tea party groups for special scrutiny in deciding whether to grant tax-exempt status has confirmed accusations by some of those organizations that they were treated improperly.

The agency insists that decision was made by low-level career employees in its Cincinnati office and was not done for political purposes. But the revelation set off an outcry over what Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called “thuggish practices.”

An inspector general’s report set to be released this week says senior IRS officials knew that agents were giving special attention to conservative groups in 2011, nine months before then-commissioner Douglas H. Shulman told Congress that the agency was not doing so.

“Benghazi and the IRS, each one taken in isolation is in the ankle-biting category,” said historian David Kennedy. “But if you add up enough ducks, they can peck you to death. It’s a sea of trouble.”

Chris Lehane, one of the “masters of disaster” who ran the damage-control operation in the Clinton White House, said Obama’s staff has failed to follow some basic rules for dealing with a potential scandal: avoid putting out a narrative that will not be sustained by the facts and get in front of damaging information by making it public before your adversaries do.

For instance, “if they had put those [Benghazi] e-mails out on their own terms, they would have gotten a little more of the benefit of the doubt,” Lehane said. “There’s no question that if they had basically applied the fundamentals of crisis management, they would be in a different situation today.”

But with the attack happening less than two months before voters went to the polls last year, “they may have made the decision that it was better to win the presidential election and deal with the fallout on the other side,” Lehane said.

History suggests that rocky terrain lay ahead on that other side.

“Every second-term president, at least since Eisenhower with the U-2 [spy plane shot down in Soviet airspace] has somehow gone into a ditch,” said Ken Duberstein, who was White House chief of staff during Reagan’s second term.

“The suggestions that Obama is in a deep ditch are probably premature,” Duberstein added. “But when you get in a ditch, you need to stop digging. You need to put down the shovel.”

Mui', 'December', 'Ylan Q. Mui Was A Financial Reporter At The Washington Post Covering The Federal Reserve', 'The Economy. She Left The Post In January']",Benefits to end Saturday for long-term jobless,"Kathy Biscotti tries to remain positive as she continues to job hunt in person and online in Baltimore, MD on December 23, 2013. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)

Kathy Biscotti cut back to two meals a day after losing her job over the summer. On Saturday, she must swallow an even more bitter pill: the end of her federal unemployment benefits.

An estimated 1.3 million long-term unemployed workers like Biscotti are expected to be affected when the program expires. The extended benefits, staunchly opposed by Republicans, were left out of the bipartisan federal budget agreement reached this month. Senate Democrats have vowed to make the issue a top priority when they return to Washington in January, but Biscotti says she can’t wait that long.

“I could be out on the street by then,” said the 51-year-old Baltimore resident, who lost her job as an office assistant at a real estate company in June. “I have no control over this. It’s all up to Congress.”

The emergency unemployment benefits have been a staple of Washington’s efforts to cushion Main Street from the blows of the recession for the past five years. Lawmakers have extended the program 11 times, never allowing it to lapse — until now.

Support for the benefits waned as the recovery strengthened and hiring picked up. During negotiations over the federal budget, Democrats agreed to cut the program in hopes of averting the political gridlock that led to the government shutdown in the fall. The Senate is expected to vote on a bill next month that would reinstate the benefits for three months, but recipients face, at best, a delay in their checks.

The emergency unemployment benefits were instituted by President George W. Bush in 2008 as the financial crisis ramped up and the jobless rate started up toward the 10 percent peak it would hit the following year. Typically, states provide insurance payments to unemployed workers for up to six months. But as the nation spiraled into recession, and then the recovery struggled to gain traction, the federal government offered repeated extensions, each lasting a period of several months, allowing some people to stay on for 99 weeks. The program has paid out $225 billion in benefits.

The ranks of the long-term unemployed peaked at more than 6.7 million in the spring of 2010, according to government data. The number has since declined to about 4 million, but they still account for more than a third of those who are out of work.

It takes the average job hunter almost eight months to get hired, data show, compared to less than five months before the recession.

Ending the benefits could encourage some workers to take part-time work or lower-paying jobs than they would have otherwise, economists say. But many are expected to give up looking for work altogether. Some may even apply for disability benefits instead.

“This will likely lead to an artificial decline in the overall unemployment rate,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. “It would be giving a little bit of a false signal of the labor market improving.”

Analysts say the decline in the unemployment rate could range from a quarter to a half a percentage point.

Cutting the benefits is also likely to slow economic growth next year, Anderson said. The reduced consumer spending will shave two-tenths to four-tenths of a percentage point from the nation’s gross domestic output — effectively negating the boost from the budget deal, he said.

Still, most economists are calling for stronger growth in 2014, making the benefits program an increasingly tough sell on Capitol Hill. Businesses have created nearly 200,000 jobs during the past four months despite the federal government shutdown and uncertainty emanating from Washington. The economy grew faster than expected during the third quarter, and forecasts for the final months of the year have brightened.

Some economists say that ending the benefits could encourage companies to hire more people because employers would be under less pressure to offer higher wages. But others say the benefits are too small to deter workers from taking a job — and too critical to eliminate.

“Even though those benefits are modest, it’s what puts food on the table and pays the heating bills,” said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project. “A lot of people are living on the edge.”

Biscotti receives $332 a week in unemployment insurance — about half of what she was bringing home from her last job. Most of the money goes toward renting the small apartment in Baltimore that she shares with her adult son. Whatever is left is carefully divided between utilities and groceries.

“I just feel like they pulled the rug out from all the unemployed Americans. They need to give us a warning period,” she said.

Biscotti said she spends up to five hours a day on her job hunt, applying for about 30 jobs a week and frequenting career centers and workshops. She estimates she has gone on 20 job interviews since June, but nothing has panned out.

She was hoping to find something that paid at least $9 an hour. But now, facing the end of her benefits, she said she will do anything.

“I’m trying to find a job that will pay my bills. I’m looking for anything that I’m remotely qualified for,” she said. “There’s just nothing out there.”

For most of her life, Biscotti was a waitress. But in 2004, in the middle of the housing boom, she took her first desk job, as an office assistant at Morgan Stanley. She got laid off when the recession hit, and it took two years for her to find her job at the real estate company. Now, she is back at square one.

Her travails underscore the central concern economists have over the lingering number of long-term unemployed: The longer workers have been out of a job, the harder it is for them to get hired. According to a report by the White House, those who have been unemployed for five weeks or less have a 1-in-3 chance of finding a job in a given month. The odds are only 1 in 10 for those who have been unemploy­ed for more than a year.

Academics cite several reasons, including the erosion of skills and professional networks and bias on the part of employers. The result, they worry, is a class of workers that gets left farther and farther behind.

Biscotti said she wants to prove them wrong — but time is no longer on her side.

“The hardest job I’ve ever had,” she said, “is looking for a job.”"

“We have a chance to prove to the rest of the Congress that we can produce bills,” Representative Harold Rogers, the Kentucky Republican who is the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said in an interview.

The past few years have proved frustrating for members of the spending panels. With House Republicans unable to come to terms with Senate Democrats on a budget, the government has mainly functioned under a series of continuing resolutions that have taken the Appropriations Committees out of the game.

“It has been a real struggle and tough at times,” Mr. Rogers said.

While most members of Congress have scattered for the holidays, the panels’ bipartisan leadership and senior staff members have been assembling a $1 trillion measure that splits an extra $45 billion between military and domestic needs under the terms of the overarching budget deal reached this month and signed into law by President Obama on Thursday."

Not necessarily, according to Dr. Scott Haltzman, author of ""The Secrets of Surviving Infidelity."" In fact, according to the author, ""many people will say that working through the affair made the marriage stronger than before.""

""Once an affair happens you realize, 'Hey, my marriage can’t run on auto-pilot,'"" Haltzman told HuffPost Divorce via e-mail. ""Succeeding at marriage after infidelity is akin to surviving a trauma; you often never realize your strength or resiliency until it is called on. And that’s worth something!""

But there are several large hurdles between the affair and post-infidelity marital bliss, beginning with telling your spouse about your indiscretions.

We asked Haltzman about whether or not it's important to cop to the infidelity, and how to go about having that emotional conversation. Below, he shares his answers.

Huffington Post Divorce: Should you tell your spouse if you've had an affair? Why or why not?

Dr. Scott Haltzman: In most cases, you should tell your spouse you had an affair. It goes without saying that marriages are based on openness, and affairs are based on secrets. Choosing openness is a potent step toward honoring your wedding vows.



Usually by the time you’re thinking of revealing all, your mate has already begun to figure out something is wrong. By telling your partner the truth, you free him or her up from the constant wondering, “what’s going on with you?” For the person having an affair, verbalizing your actions makes the impact more real, and moves you from “what will I do when my spouse finds out,” to “what’s the next step toward resolution”?

HP: Is there ever a time where you shouldn't tell your spouse that you cheated?

Haltzman: If the infidelity was in the remote past, it has no impact on your current marriage, you've done the emotional ""work"" to make sense of what led to it and took the necessary steps to prevent it from happening again, then it's not clear that the marriage will benefit from telling the truth.

If there's a good likelihood the the revelation will lead to domestic violence, or threaten the life of the person you had an affair with, then it is not a good idea to be entirely truthful, although you must commit to working individually to get the marriage back on track.



HP: If you've decided to tell your spouse, how should you go about telling him or her? How many details of the affair should you reveal? Should you be completely honest?

Haltzman: Your mate is about to find out that his or her world is turned inside out. Is there any right way to do it? In a word, no. But you can try. When possible, revealing an affair should take place in a home, not a park, restaurant or other public place. It's more than likely that you will unfurl a litany of emotions; your spouse should not feel constrained to control emotions by the environment.

You should be direct; no matter how you phrase it, it’s going to hurt. Once you’ve revealed your news, it may take a long time to sink in. Be prepared to answer as many questions as your partner has.

Once you have come clean about the affair, the general policy is “do ask, do tell.” Let your spouse decide what he or she wants to hear. Many people try to protect their spouse (and themselves) from the harsh realities by holding back hurtful details. Don’t do that. Once an affair has been revealed, the most important element in rebuilding a marriage is establishing trust. Trust is built on complete honesty.



HP: If your spouse reacts badly, how should you respond?



Haltzman: There’s no predictable reaction to finding out your spouse had an affair, and, with the exception of physical violence, no right or wrong way to react. A partner who has had an affair must be prepared for any kind of reaction when the truth is told. Your partner’s pain must be recognized and prioritized. It is important to not try to minimize your spouse’s feelings by saying such things as, “It’s not that big a deal” or, “It happened only once,"" or by comparing feelings (“I didn’t get that upset when you told me about your affair”) or invalidating the feeling (“You shouldn’t feel that way.”) Remember that all feelings are valid because they are real within your mate. Your role is to listen, try to understand, be as strong as you can be -- although it’s OK to break down if it is in sympathy with your mate. At some point the dust will settle, and then you will need to be there to help pick up the pieces.



HP: What's the most important thing to remember before having this conversation?



Haltzman: The most important thing to remember about having this conversation is that it is a beginning, not an end. Revealing the truth about an affair is a necessary first step toward moving the marriage back on track.

“What is the true state of our union? Though this may sound harsh, I’ll speak the truth here,” Palin wrote. “We are a country going bankrupt to fund a bloated, distant, and often corrupt federal government led by venal politicians more concerned with paying off their campaign cronies and consolidating their own power than in preserving the constitutional republic that so many have fought and died for (including our brave men and women in uniform who were barely mentioned last night).”

Palin has assailed the “permanent political class” since her landmark speech in Indianola, Iowa in 2011 that introduced that language into the political bloodstream. Director Stephen K. Bannon and Peter Schweizer’s Government Accountability Institute have assailed D.C. as a “boomtown” that produces nothing but continues to get wealthier by expanding the size and scope of government.

During the State of the Union address on Tuesday, Palin live-tweeted with the “#SOTUGottaBKiddingMe” hashtag, assailing Obama and Washington, D.C.’s permanent political class for their cronyism. After the speech, Palin called out Obama for not honoring slain ex-Navy Seal Chris Kyle or U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens during the address. After attending Kyle’s funeral on Monday, Palin said Obama needed to “pay his respects” to the fallen American hero.

“If you missed President Obama’s State of the Union address last night, you didn’t miss much – especially if you watched any of his past four State of the Union addresses,” Palin wrote. “We heard the same recycled rhetoric, and we heard his Orwellian declaration that the cornucopia of new federal programs he proposed, as well as his intention to eradicate world poverty, wouldn’t ‘increase our deficit by a single dime.'”

Palin also referenced Paul Krugman, “one of President Obama’s economic cheerleaders at the New York Times,” who last week was “remarkably candid” when he said “death panels and taxes is how we do this.”

“But wait, I thought there’d be no such thing as ‘death panels,’ liberal liars?” Palin asked sardonically.

“This is the long-term forecast for the state of America under Obama’s failed policies: middle class taxes and death panels,” Palin wrote.



Left-wing politicians and journalists ridiculed Palin when she predicted the Affordable Care Act would lead to bureaucratic death panels rationing treatment. Politifact named “death panels” its Lie of the Year in 2009.

“Our country didn’t weather a Revolution, two World Wars, a Civil War, a Great Depression, and countless other political and economic storms, just to be sunk by the dangerous policies of this current administration,” Palin wrote. “We’re stronger than this. As President Reagan said, ‘I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing.'”

Palin concluded by urging Republicans to get ready for the 2014 midterm elections: “So, do something. 2014 is just around the corner. Get motivated! Get organized. America, don’t retreat. In the words of yet another White House program, ‘Let’s move.'”"

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/04/boehner-accused-tilting-toward-amnesty-with-new-hire/,2013-12-04 00:00:00,[],Boehner accused of tilting toward 'amnesty' with new hire,"Foes of illegal immigration accused House Speaker John Boehner of signaling his willingness to consider an ""amnesty"" bill after his office hired a longtime policy aide who has advocated legalizing undocumented immigrants.

The speaker's office announced Tuesday that it had hired Rebecca Tallent as a point person for immigration issues. Tallent previously was director of immigration policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center -- but before that, worked for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and played a role in the drafting of the 2006 and 2007 immigration reform bills, which provided a pathway to legal status for some illegal immigrants.

The Federation for American Immigration Reform and other groups claimed the hiring was a sign that the House would consider an ""amnesty"" bill, despite pledges by Boehner that the House and Senate would not try to reconcile the differences between their bills through a process known as ""conference."" Foes of illegal immigration had been concerned that this process would allow a select group of negotiators to include a pathway to legal status for illegal immigrants even if the House previously opposed it.

""President Obama and Senate leaders have already said that they do not care what bill serves as the vehicle to get them to their desired objective of amnesty and massive immigration increases, just as long as they get there,"" FAIR said in an email blast Tuesday. ""It is clear, as a result of Tuesday's announcement by Boehner, that the legislative vehicle will be different, but the destination will be the same.""

Boehner spokesman Michael Steel defended the hire, telling The Washington Times that Tallent is a ""well-known expert in this field of public policy"" and a ""great addition to our team and that effort.""

He reiterated that Boehner wants ""step-by-step, common-sense immigration reforms.""

While the House has been sitting on the immigration issue for months, leadership is under heavy pressure by immigrant advocates to move legislation -- and to include a provision to address the millions of illegal immigrants currently in the United States.

In mid-November, Boehner ruled out negotiating with the Senate, saying “We have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill.”

With just a few working days remaining before Congress adjourns for winter break, any House action would probably come next year. Some Republicans might want to wait until after the November elections to keep from having to take a tough vote on the issue before the midterms.

Any effort to push a bill perceived by conservatives as too light on border security and too lenient on legalization is sure to face stalwart opposition from some outspoken party members including Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and Reps. Steve King, of Iowa, and Trey Gowdy, of South Carolina.

House Republicans have been under heavy pressure over the past several weeks to vote on a bill, with President Obama and big business leading the way.

On Friday, Obama visited a group of immigration activists staging a hunger strike at the base of Capitol Hill to push for a vote. And last week, the president restated his case in a speech in San Francisco’s Chinatown neighborhood.

The Democrat-controlled Senate passed its sweeping immigration bill earlier this year, led by New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, whom Republicans fear would get House negotiators to adopt his bill should the chambers go to conference."

Story highlights The pundits and comedians of Twitter weigh in on Monday's Inauguration Day events People commented on first-family fashion, TV anchor gaffes, president's speech NASA tweeted a link to a photo of the National Mall taken from space

Maybe it didn’t have quite the grandeur of President Barack Obama’s historic inauguration four years ago. But Monday’s Inauguration Day events showcased the pomp and circumstance of the U.S. government at its finest.

We may not have royal weddings in the States, but this is about as close as it gets.

And, where there is public spectacle, there is Twitter, the rapid-fire platform where the world’s online social critics record their musings. Twitter said its users sent 1.1 million inauguration-related tweets during Monday’s swearing-in ceremony, way up from 82,000 in 2009, when Twitter hadn’t yet been widely adopted.

From politicos to comedians to ordinary citizens, some offered heartfelt thoughts on the historical importance of the day, while others jockeyed for a cheap laugh and a few retweets.

Here are some of our favorites. (We’ll be adding to this list as the day goes on.)

Pat Quinn, in full re-election mode, took the unusual step of showing up in court today for the first hearing in lawmakers' effort to get their paychecks restored after the governor suspended their pay citing a lack of action on pension reform.



The hearing before Cook County Judge Neil H. Cohen was brief and laid out the schedule of paperwork to be filed before oral arguments take place on Sep. 18. That means lawmakers stand to miss at least one more paycheck (on Sept. 1) before a ruling comes down on their request to turn the paycheck spigot back on.



Last month, Quinn used his veto power to eliminate salaries for all 177 lawmakers, arguing they weren't doing their job by refusing to act on pension reform and therefore shouldn't get paid. Senate President John Cullerton and House Speaker Michael Madigan, both Chicago Democrats, sued last week, arguing the move violates the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branch.



Lawyers for the Democratic legislative leaders have asked the judge for a preliminary injunction that would allow Comptroller Judy Baar Topinka to cut checks. They are also seeking interest on the lost pay. The first monthly check they missed was supposed to be issued on Aug. 1.



Following the hearing, Quinn argued that instead of focusing on a lawsuit, lawmakers should cut a compromise on pensions and then vote to override his veto of their pay. Legislators argue that would only validate a move they say is unconstitutional, contending future governors could decide to withhold lawmaker pay any time they don't get what they want.



""We had to take dramatic and drastic action because the legislature has had months and months of opportunity to act and they've failed to act,"" Quinn said. ""I think the taxpayers of Illinois know full well what the principle is, you don't get paid if you don't do your job.""



Quinn faces a Democratic primary next year against Bill Daley, a former chief of staff to President Barack Obama. The governor's lawmaker paycheck move represents a return to his populist roots --- one lawmakers have ripped as political grandstanding."

Ms. Palin, the former Alaska governor and Republican vice-presidential candidate, has returned to Fox News as a paid contributor, Roger Ailes, the channel’s chairman, announced on Thursday afternoon. Her first appearance will come Monday on “Fox and Friends,” the channel’s conservative morning show.

The announcement came about five months after Ms. Palin’s contract with Fox News expired. That contract, signed barely a year after Ms. Palin’s unsuccessful 2008 bid for vice president, was said to be worth $1 million a year, making her the highest-paid pundit at the channel.

Her new contract is almost certainly less costly for Fox, since Ms. Palin does not have the star power she once did. (Fox’s news release on Thursday noted that in 2010, the year she joined Fox the first time, Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world.)"

The House and Senate are both moving on fiscal matters

A deal to keep the government open is likely

The next showdown will probably be this summer

WASHINGTON — Congress is on track to approve competing party-line budget blueprints as well as legislation to fund the government and prevent a shutdown March 27, but newfound fiscal momentum on Capitol Hill is a temporary reprieve from the budget battles that will renew this year.

The Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-controlled Senate will approve respective ten-year budget plans with vastly different views on spending, taxes and entitlement programs before adjourning for a two-week spring recess.

The House will begin debating on Wednesday a conservative blueprint authored by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., that would eliminate the annual deficit in 10 years without raising taxes but through deep cuts to non-defense spending. The bill would convert Medicare into a premium support system where seniors are given federal subsidies to buy their own health care.

""This budget stops spending money that we simply do not have,"" said Rep. Scott Garrett, R-N.J.

Senate Democrats' budget plan is a less ambitious road map without major federal overhauls. It includes an equal ratio of about $1 trillion in spending cuts and revenue raised through closing tax loopholes. The combination would allow Congress to turn off the $1.2 trillion automatic, across-the-board spending cuts that kicked in March 1. Their budget does not achieve balance in the 10-year window but lowers the national debt to less than 3% of the overall economy, a metric many economists consider stable. ""It is a path towards a bipartisan deal that the American people are looking for,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the budget's author.

Budget resolutions are non-binding and do not have the force of law. The two chambers are highly unlikely to reconcile the two visions, considering their vast differences, but Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said budget negotiators would try. ""I think there's going to be a real effort,"" he said.

The effort is aided in part by reinvigorated personal efforts by President Obama to find a longer-term agreement for the nation's fiscal future. Obama wants to replace the unpopular automatic cuts with both spending cuts and revenue, but Republicans oppose any new revenue from taxes and want spending cuts and entitlement changes.

Gene Sperling, director of the White House National Economic Council, told USA TODAY ""Capital Download"" that Republicans would have to budge on revenue if there was any hope for compromise.

""If the Republican leadership that controls the House of Representatives says ... that from now on, every single penny of deficit reduction has to come from things like Medicare, education, research; that there can't be one single penny that comes from closing a loophole or a tax expenditure for a very well-off American — that is the type of absolute position that makes that kind of compromise very difficult,"" he said.

The battle is likely to resume over the summer when Washington faces another deadline to increase the federal debt ceiling, the nation's borrowing authority to pay its bills. ""I think between now and midsummer, we'll be having these discussions again,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who lauded the president's recent private meetings with lawmakers but acknowledged compromise remains elusive. ""(Obama) knows what needs to be done, and we await his taking the steps he needs to take."""

The big moment happened during an an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Tapper's new show, ""The Lead."" Boehner initially tried to blame President Obama for the sequester, saying that ""he forced this process [sequestration] to occur."" Then something truly unexpected happened: Tapper pointed out that President Obama didn't want the sequester cuts ... and Boehner conceded the point:



Well, no, he didn't want the cuts. But, uh, we have the sequester as a result of his demands. And I've told my colleagues in the House that the sequester will stay in effect until there's an agreement that will include cuts and reforms that will balance the budget over the next ten years.

So the good news is that Boehner admits the obvious fact that the President Obama didn't and doesn't want the sequester cuts to occur. Nonetheless, he insists on blaming the president for the sequester, a position that makes absolutely no sense given that he also says the president doesn't want the sequester cuts. Moreover, Boehner made it clear that while the president doesn't want the sequester cuts, Boehner does—and that he'll insist on keeping them in place until even harsher budget cuts are enacted. (To achieve balance, the House budget plan cuts an additional $4.6 trillion on top of the $1 trillion in sequester cuts.)

Basically, Boehner just give his stupid #Obamaquester blame game a big old kiss goodbye. Now that he's admitted that President Obama doesn't want the sequester but that Republicans do, he's taking full and complete ownership. And unless he changes his mind, the only way we'll be able to get rid of the sequester is by winning the 2014 elections."
http://news.yahoo.com/sarah-palin-relevant-162431270.html,,[],Does Sarah Palin still matter?,"She hasn't held public office in four years. She hasn't run for public office in five.



Yet there Sarah Palin was earlier this week, on NBC's ""Today"" show, sparring with Matt Lauer about Obamacare (""This broken website I think is symbolic of a broken administration""), the tea party and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (he's ""no Ronald Reagan"").



There she was on CNN, telling Jake Tapper she was ""taken aback"" by recent ""liberal"" statements made by Pope Francis, as well as by Christie's ""extreme"" weight.



There she was on Fox News (where Palin is a paid contributor) telling Sean Hannity that congressional Republicans unwilling to stand with Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee during the partial government shutdown ""threw the good guys under the bus.""



And there she was on Fox again, this time on the ""Fox & Friends"" couch, holding hands with the show's hosts, Steve Doocy, Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Brian Kilmeade, while promoting ""Good Tidings and Great Joy,"" her holiday book about the war on Christmas (tagline: ""It's OK to wish me Merry Christmas!""), before embarking on a 15-city book tour.



Palin is in the public eye again with her book, armed with tea party-friendly, Twitter-sized sound bites about, well, just about anything.



On the national debt: ""There is another definition of slavery and that is being beholden to some kind of master that is not of your choosing. And the national debt will be like slavery when the note comes due.""



On President Barack Obama: ""I'll never forget Bill Clinton saying about Barack Obama and his story, his agenda, that it was the biggest fairy tale he'd ever seen. And he was right, because Barack Obama was not qualified, he was not prepared, and the manifestation of that today is the problem that we see left and right in our economy.""



On congressional Republicans: ""They threw the good guys under the bus. Ted Cruz, Mike Lee willing to stand strong on planks of the platform they ran on in addition to so many other politicians running on the idea of repealing and replacing ObamaCare. They finally had an opportunity to stand up and defund it and get America to debate the issue. And then they were thrown under the bus.""



On Christie hugging Obama during Superstorm Sandy: ""Perhaps it hurt Mitt Romney. I think it was unnecessary to literally be embracing Barack Obama at the time of such national import when it came to that campaign season. But, again, more important has been anyone on the GOP ticket who could support these policies of Barack Obama when it comes to granting amnesty to illegal aliens, for instance, or thwarting our Second Amendment rights or growing national debt.""



On GOP leadership: ""I want the Republican Party, kind of that leadership of the machine of the party, to really stiffen its spine and not be squishy.""



On the 'war on Christmas': ""You see the ACLU letters that get sent around to all the school districts now, warning them, you know, you'd better not acknowledge that Jesus is the reason for the season and don't — heaven forbid — you sing a song about Bethlehem or 'Silent Night,' because somebody may take offense.""



On the pope: ""He's had some statements that, to me, sound kind of liberal. It has taken me aback.""



But does anything the former Alaskan governor and ex-vice presidential candidate say really matter, particularly to the GOP? And is she relevant?



""She's so compelling,"" CNN contributor and Democratic strategist Paul Begala said on Wednesday. ""She is. You can't turn away. She tends to say these things that either people love or that they hate.""



And, don't look now, but Palin ""plunged herself into the heart of a debate roiling the Republican Party between the moderate establishment on one hand and tea party fist-raisers on the other,"" David Freedlander wrote on the Daily Beast. ""As the Palin bus rolls into town, political observers on the ground are wondering if the former governor of Alaska will offer a few kind words, or even a photo op, for the candidate of their choice.""



But other pundits believe Palin's time has come and gone.



“Sarah Palin is an entertainer,"" Bloomberg Businessweek's Justin Green said on MSNBC. ""She is not a politician anymore. She is the equivalent of Skid Row or one of those ’80s bands that is out on the state festival circuit with the carnies and the farm animals playing their greatest hits and trying to earn a dollar.”



Palin's supporters, though, say she is just as relevant today, perhaps more, than she was in 2008.



“Her message resonates with the average person,” Ron Devito, who runs the website US4Palin, told Freedlander. “She supports limited government, free markets, low taxes and our Constitution.”



Still, Devito condeded, Palin “has to decide what her place in the GOP galaxy is, and I am not sure that has been decided, either by her or by anyone else. ... The tea party people already know her message. She needs to get her message out beyond her comfort zone.”



That's part of the idea of the book tour, which began Tuesday in Bethlehem, Pa., (where at least 600 people turned out for Palin's signing), with planned stops in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Georgia, Florida, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska and Minnesota — all before Thanksgiving. The other part is selling books. Palin's 2009 memoir, ""Going Rogue,"" sold more than 2 million copies."

This advice comes as fast-food workers from 100 cities across the nation push for $15-an-hour pay, a far cry from the wages most earn, in a mass strike on Thursday.

The tipping guide from etiquette maven Emily Post on McDonald's website lists several high-ticket suggestions for givers during the holiday season, including ""a gift from your family (or one week's pay), plus a small gift from your child"" for an au pair, ""one day's pay"" for a housekeeper and ""cost of one cleaning"" for a pool cleaner.

The site also lists suggestions for dog walkers, massage therapists and personal fitness trainers.

In an email to CNBC, McDonald's spokeswoman Lisa McComb said: ""This is content provided by a third-party partner and quotes from one of the best-known etiquette gurus, Emily Post. We continue to review the resource and will ask the vendor to make changes as needed.""

In total, the tips add up to hundreds, if not more than a thousand dollars of gift suggestions for McDonald's workers, many of whom earn just above minimum wage. To be fair, though, the restaurant chain does advise employees, ""What you give, if anything at all, should be dictated by your relationship with the serviceperson, how often you utilize the services, and most importantly, your budget.""



These tips would be far out of the budget for many employees since on average, U.S. food-preparation and serving workers, including those in fast food, earn $9 an hour, according to May 2012 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The tone-deaf advice is the latest is a series of gaffes surrounding its employee resource site. Last month, McDonald's suggested employees get out of holiday season debt by returning unopened purchases. Earlier, it published a budget guide that included no money for heat and $20 a month for health care.

Update: The McDonald's tipping article appears to have been removed by mid-afternoon Thursday following CNBC's post.

On the play, San Diego lined up with seven men on one side of the snapper. This should have been penalized as an illegal formation by the defense. Rule 9, Section 1, Article 3 (b) (1) of the NFL Rule Book (page 51) states that “No more than six Team B players may be on the line of scrimmage on either side of the snapper at the snap.” The penalty for illegal formation by the defense is a loss of five yards. This is not subject to instant replay review. Had the penalty been assessed, it would have resulted in a fourth-and-seven from the San Diego 18 with 0:04 remaining, enabling the Chiefs to attempt a 36-yard field goal.

—

The NFL will reportedly concede on Monday that its officials may have cost the Pittsburgh Steelers a playoff spot when they failed to penalize the San Diego Chargers for having more than six players on one side of the long snapper on Kansas City Chiefs kicker Ryan Succop’s game-winning field goal attempt with eight seconds remaining in regulation on Sunday in San Diego.

ProFootballTalk’s Mike Florio reported on NBC’s Sunday Night Football that the NFL will admit on Monday that the officials in the game should have given the Chargers a five-yard penalty on Succop’s missed 41-yard field goal attempt because San Diego had seven players (pictured) on one side of the line of scrimmage when NFL rules only allow six. The referees did not throw a flag, and Succop missed the field goal that could have sent the Steelers into the playoffs. He should have gotten a re-kick–a 36-yard field goal attempt. And had Succop made the attempt he should have been awarded, Pittsburgh would have miraculously made the playoffs.

Here is the NFL rule in question:

(a) When Team A presents a punt, field-goal attempt or a Try Kick formation, a Team B player, who is within 1 yard of the line of scrimmage, must have his entire body outside the snapper’s shoulder pads at the snap. (b) When Team A presents a field-goal or Try Kick formation: (1) No more than six Team B players may be on the line of scrimmage on either side of the snapper at the snap; Penalty: For illegal formation by the defense, loss of 5 yards from the previous spot. (2) Team B players cannot push teammates on the line of scrimmage into the offensive formation. Penalty: For unnecessary roughness, loss of 15 yards from the previous spot

Earlier in the year, New England Patriots rookie Chris Jones was penalized 15-yards for pushing his teammate during a New York Jets field-goal attempt that decided the game in favor of the Jets.

After starting the season 0-4 with injuries at numerous positions, all the Pittsburgh Steelers needed to do to sneak into the playoffs was to win on Sunday and then hope that the Miami Dolphins, the Baltimore Ravens, and the San Diego Chargers all lost.

Incredibly, that almost happened. The Steelers (8-8) almost got the sixth and final AFC playoff spot, but Succop missed that 41-yard field goal and San Diego beat the Chiefs 27-24 in a wild overtime in which the Chargers faked a punt inside their own territory on their first drive in overtime that was also controversial. Kansas City seemed to return what appeared to be a fumble on that play for a touchdown to win the game, but the officials ruled that San Diego’s Eric Weddle’s forward progress was stopped. Former NFL head of officiating Mike Pereira disagreed with that interpretation:

Replay did not stop the game because the ruling of forward progress is not reviewable. Should have been a strip and TD in my opinion. — Mike Pereira (@MikePereira) December 30, 2013

Earlier in the day, the Cincinnati Bengals defeated the Ravens, 34-17. The New York Jets defeated the Miami Dolphins, 20-7. The Steelers took care of business and defeated the Browns, 20-7.

That meant San Diego would make the playoffs with a win over the Chiefs or a tie while Pittsburgh would only make the playoffs with a Kansas City win over San Diego.

And Kansas City, which sat its starting quarterback, Alex Smith, running back, Jamaal Charles, and a host of other starters to rest for next week’s playoff game, was leading for most of the game before San Diego tied the game with less than five minutes left and eventually won the game, taking the sixth and final AFC playoff spot.

On Tuesday, the presidential inaugural committee announced that it had invited the Rev. Louie Giglio, head pastor of Passion City Church in Atlanta, to participate in the Jan. 21 ceremony. Soon afterward, the liberal website ThinkProgress posted excerpts and an audio file of a sermon Giglio gave in the mid-1990s, in which he criticizes homosexuality as profoundly antithetical to Christianity.

“You come to only one conclusion: Homosexuality is less than God’s best for his creation,” Giglio said in the sermon. “It is less than God’s best for us, and everything in our lives that is less than God’s best for us and his plan for us and his design for us is sin. That’s God’s voice.”

After having courted the gay and lesbian community during his first term with efforts like the elimination of the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, the president’s inclusion of Giglio, 54, in the inauguration quickly proved awkward. The Obama administration is already fending off criticism from some on the left over negative remarks made by secretary of Defense nominee Chuck Hagel in 1998 about a gay diplomat.

No one answered the phone Thursday at Passion City Church, whose ministry focuses on young people. But on the church’s website, Giglio wrote that after discussions between his team and the administration, he had decided to withdraw from the inauguration so as not to become a distraction.

“The issue of homosexuality (which a particular message of mine some 20 years ago addressed) is one of the most difficult our nation will navigate,” Giglio wrote. “However, individuals’ rights of freedom, and the collective right to hold differing views on any subject is a critical balance we, as a people, must recover and preserve.”

Typically, clergy members asked to participate in presidential events undergo rigorous vetting, but mistakes occasionally occur, said John Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron.

The Obama inauguration committee appeared to acknowledge the slip. “We were not aware of Pastor Giglio’s past comments at the time of his selection and they don’t reflect our desire to celebrate the strength and diversity of our country at this inaugural,” said spokeswoman Addie Whisenant. “Pastor Giglio was asked to deliver the benediction in large part for his leadership in combating human trafficking around the world.”

Gay rights activists praised Giglio’s departure. Evangelical groups condemned it. A rising star in the evangelical community, Giglio did not disavow the sermon, which represents the way many conservative Christians view homosexuality. For the last two decades, American Christianity has been divided, sometimes acrimoniously, over growing societal acceptance of gays and lesbians and what certain Old Testament verses say about same-sex interactions.

The country’s increased religious diversity, Green said, can make choosing clergy for an event like the inauguration exceedingly delicate.

“The symbolism is very important when clergy are involved in a presidential ceremony,” Green said. “Different kinds of clergy are invited to show that the president has support from and supports the religious diversity of America. You have to assemble a good program now that might not offend somebody. But because we have faith-based disagreements in America, that’s not easy to do.”

Elected to a second term earlier in the year in a campaign devoid of much of the racial heat that marked the 1983 contest, Washington had a majority of the city's 50 aldermen working with him. He was a Democratic political power, helping forge election tickets and exerting influence over careers. A racially divided city seemed to be accepting the reality of a black mayor.

Sitting in his fifth-floor office in City Hall on this morning, talking to a press aide, he suddenly slumped over, his face resting on the desktop. He had suffered a heart attack. Although he was rushed to a hospital emergency room, it was clear to all that Washington was dead. In the days that followed, the city came together as it never really had when he was alive. Thousands lined the frigid sidewalks outside City Hall, waiting to file through the rotunda where his body lay in state. The lines contained blacks, whites, Hispanics, friends, foes, the entire spectrum of Chicago's population.

During his time as mayor, Washington had chipped away at the Democratic machine's patronage system by appointing professionals, minorities and women to city positions. He had worked for economic development in neighborhoods rather than just downtown. But the bulk of his time had been spent fighting his opponents in the City Council.

The days following Washington's death were as raucous as the days of ""Council Wars,"" culminating in a marathon City Council session to name a new mayor. Finally, in the early-morning hours, the white aldermanic bloc chose Eugene Sawyer, a black alderman from the South Side, to take over as mayor until a special election could be held in 1989."

Beyonce, James Taylor, Kelly Clarkson to sing at Obama inauguration

They'll be performing the patriotic songs, including national anthem

Public swearing-in ceremony to take place Jan. 21 at the Capitol

Beyoncé, James Taylor and Kelly Clarkson will perform the patriotic songs at the second inauguration of President Obama on Jan. 21, the inauguration committee will announce today.

Beyoncé, who's also starring at the Super Bowl halftime show next month, will sing the national anthem, always a tough tune to pull off well.

Taylor, the Sweet Baby James icon of '70s folk-rock, will sing America the Beautiful.

And Clarkson, the first winner of American Idol (2002), will sing My Country, 'Tis of Thee, the song with different lyrics but the same tune as the British national anthem. At the first Obama inaugural ceremony in 2009, soul diva Aretha Franklin sang it while wearing a memorable hat.

More announcements about entertainment at the inauguration are expected in coming days.

All this will take place during the public swearing-in ceremonies on the Capitol steps, when President Obama delivers his second inaugural address before a crowd likely to top more than 1 million.

Obama will officially take the oath of office at the White House on Jan. 20, as per the Constitution, but the repeat swearing-in ceremony, the inaugural parade, the lunch with Congress and the inaugural balls will take place on Monday.

In 2009, an estimated 1.8 million people turned up on the National Mall to watch the historic inauguration of the nation's first black president; this time, in light of the economic situation, the inauguration will be more low-key, with fewer people expected and only two official balls."

“We are pleased to again welcome Governor Sarah Palin to CPAC in March,” ACU Chairman Al Cardenas said in a statement. “Governor Palin electrified the crowd in 2012 and we are thrilled to welcome her back this year.”

CPAC 2013 will be held Thursday, March 14 through Saturday, March 16, 2013 at its new location in National Harbor, MD at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center.

The non-Washington, D.C. location of this year’s conference is fitting for Palin, who blistered the permanent political class and crony capitalism during her 2012 address last year in the nation’s capital in her first appearance at the conference.

Last year, she was mobbed in the hallways before her speech. Palin stayed for nearly an hour after speaking, engaging conservatives and supporters who were there to listen to her. Reporters and observers at CPAC noted in 2012 they had not seen anyone who resonated with the conservative base more than Palin.

At CPAC 2012, Palin said Washington, D.C. had become “something that our forefathers never envisioned, and they would have sworn their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor to change.”

Palin said the “old Washington of our Founders” was a place where people “came to serve your government, not prosper over it and on it and from it and off of it.” She mentioned the country’s wealthiest counties were all around the D.C. region, a theme director Stephen K. Bannon and Peter Schweizer’s Government Accountability Institute would later document a year later in “Boomtown.”

She referenced her speech in Indianola, Iowa in 2011 when she spoke of “crony capitalism” that “isn’t the capitalism of free men and free markets, of risk and sacrifice, of innovation and hard work.” She said the new crony capitalism is one of “connections” and of “government bailout and handouts” and waste, “corporate welfare and corruption.”

After her Indianola speech, “crony capitalism” and “permanent political class” were injected into the political vocabulary.

“This is the capitalism of Barack Obama and the permanent political class,” Palin said at CPAC in 2012.

She lambasted the Occupy protesters who were at the conference in 2012, saying they should be instead protesting at Obama’s White House, which has “spurred the expansion of government which diminishes freedom and opportunity for all to rise and to succeed.”

Palin derided politicians who come to Washington, D.C. “denouncing the place as the cesspool of corruption” only to, after a year or two, see it as a hot tub.

“And they are hopping in and enjoying the jacuzzi,” Palin said, noting it was “time we drain the jacuzzi and throw the bums out with the bath water.”

After Palin turned down Fox News’ offer to renew her contract, she spoke exclusively to Breitbart News about her future. When asked what her response was to the mainstream media’s declarations that she and the Tea Party were “buried,” Palin said she was raised “to never retreat and to pick battles wisely, and all in due season.”

“When it comes to defending our republic, we haven’t begun to fight! But we delight in those who underestimate us,” Palin told Breitbart News last month."
http://news.yahoo.com/pot-guns-paparazzi-laws-run-gamut-us-070620163.html,,[],"Pot, guns and paparazzi: New laws run gamut in US","The new year is bringing a host of new laws taking effect in January or thereabouts. A look at some state and local laws that are making news:

____

ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA

COLORADO, MAINE AND WASHINGTON: Colorado pot stores open Jan. 1 as retailers usher in the nation's first legal recreational pot industry. Sales in Washington, which also legalized recreational marijuana, are expected to start later in the year. The laws still fly in the face of federal drug rules, but the federal government has said it's not going to fight to shut down pot shops for now. A law legalizing recreational marijuana went into effect in early December in Portland, Maine, but it's largely symbolic because the state has said it will continue to enforce its own ban.

ILLINOIS: It becomes the 20th state to legalize medical marijuana in a pilot project with some of the strictest standards in the nation. However, it may take more than a year to actually buy marijuana as separate state agencies draft rules that must be approved by a legislative committee.

WISCONSIN: Towns and cities may legalize pedal pubs, multiple-person bicycles that ferry riders to and from taverns. A driver steers while multiple riders sit at a bar mounted behind him, each with his or her own pedal-and-chain assembly.

___

TRANSGENDER RIGHTS

CALIFORNIA: It becomes the first state to give specific rights to transgender students starting in January unless opponents show they have gathered enough petition signatures to put a referendum before voters seeking to overturn the law. It lets transgender students choose which restroom to use and whether to play on boys' or girls' sports teams. Critics say that violates the privacy of other students.

___

GUNS

CONNECTICUT: Guns that are considered assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines that haven't been registered with Connecticut authorities will be considered illegal contraband as of Jan. 1. The law was passed in April in response to the massacre that left 26 people dead at Newtown's Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Story continues

NEW YORK: The state's new gun law, passed shortly after the Sandy Hook shooting, already banned high-capacity magazines and the purchase or sale of popular AR-15 semi-automatic rifles. By April 15, it will also require registration of weapons now classified as assault weapons by owners who previously bought them legally.

___

PAPARAZZI

CALIFORNIA: Photographers who harass celebrities and their children face tougher penalties under a law backed by actresses Halle Berry and Jennifer Garner, who testified in favor of it. Berry told lawmakers her daughter has been intimidated by aggressive photographers who follow them daily. Those who take photos and video of a child without consent and in a harassing manner could face up to a year in county jail and a fine of up to $10,000. They also can be sued for damages and attorney's fees under the new law, which media organizations opposed. Supporters say it also will help protect the children of police officers, judges and others who might be targets because of their parents' occupations.

___

IMMIGRATION

NEVADA: Immigrants living in the United States without legal permission can apply for driver authorization cards starting Jan. 2. State officials anticipate tens of thousands of people will apply under the program.

MARYLAND: In a program similar to Nevada's, immigrants living in the U.S. illegally will be able to obtain a state driver's license or identification card if they can provide evidence of a filed state income tax return or were claimed as a dependent for each of the preceding two years.

___

HEALTH COSTS

MAINE: Health care providers will have to provide patients who request it a list of prices of the most common health services and procedures, a law designed to boost transparency around medical costs.

DELAWARE: The state will limit patient copays for ""specialty tier"" prescription drugs to $150 a month for up to a 30-day supply.

___

WORKING AND WAGES

OHIO: The minimum wage for untipped employees rises from $7.85 to $7.95 an hour, while tipped employees will go from $3.93 to $3.98 an hour, plus tips.

CALIFORNIA: The minimum wage is being boosted to $9 an hour starting in July, the first of two dollar-an-hour boosts that will push the base minimum wage to $10 by 2016, making it one of the nation's highest minimums. Under another bill, domestic workers will have to be paid time and a half if they work more than nine hours in a day or more than 45 hours in a week; baby sitters are exempt."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/21/obama-applauds-reid-for-filibuster-overhaul-critics-warn-move-will-damage/,2013-11-21 00:00:00,[],"Obama applauds Reid for filibuster overhaul, critics warn move will 'damage' Senate","President Obama, openly expressing his frustration with Senate Republicans, applauded Majority Leader Harry Reid's success Thursday at invoking the so-called ""nuclear option"" as Democrats voted to strip the minority party of its primary power to block nominations -- the filibuster.

Obama, even invoking former President Bush, said it's critical to ""change the way that Washington is doing business.""

But Republicans and even some Democrats warned that the Senate may have just opened a Pandora's box -- and with little debate, approved a change that could haunt the chamber for years to come.

""This was nothing more than a power grab,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said.

In a rapid-fire set of developments on Thursday, the Senate narrowly approved a rule change that would limit the ability of the minority party to block key presidential appointments. Instead of needing 60 votes to break a filibuster, Democrats will now need only 51.

More On This...

Speaking Thursday from the White House briefing room, Obama said the change was needed to deal with Republicans' ""unprecedented pattern of obstruction."" He cited the record of George W. Bush, claiming his predecessor had an easier time getting nominees confirmed.

Obama cited, among other stand-offs, the bid by Republicans to filibuster his nomination of Chuck Hagel, a former GOP senator, for Defense secretary.

""For the sake of future generations, we can't let it become normal,"" he said.

Republicans, though, argued that while it took Bush an average of 211 days to get a nominee confirmed, it's taken Obama 228 days -- just 17 days more. Judicial nomination statistics show that Obama has a confirmation percentage of 76 percent -- though majority leaders have had to try to break a filibuster far more in the last five years than in recent decades.

Following the vote Thursday, even some Democrats emerged as tough critics of the decision.

While Republicans were furious that their ability to hold up appointments had been scrambled, moderate Democrats were concerned more about how Reid was able to pull off the maneuver.

Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., one of three Democrats who opposed the move, said it could ""permanently damage"" the Senate.

""This institution was designed to protect -- not stamp out -- the voices of the minority,"" he said.

Reid used what is known in Senate slang as the ""nuclear option."" To change Senate rules of this kind, it typically takes 67 votes. But Reid used a highly controversial shortcut and did it with just 51 votes.

Retiring Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a prominent and influential moderate, put out a 2,300-word statement explaining in great detail why Reid's action Thursday could cause lasting damage.

""Changing the rules, in violation of the rules, by a simple majority vote is not a one-time action,"" he warned. ""If a Senate majority demonstrates it can make such a change once, there are no rules that bind a majority, and all future majorities will feel free to exercise the same power, not just on judges and executive appointments but on legislation.""

Levin argued that the move opened the floodgates for the majority to change important rules on a whim going forward.

""Today, we once again are moving down a destructive path,"" he said. ""Pursuing the nuclear option in this manner removes an important check on majority overreach which is central to our system of government.""

Levin made clear that he thinks Republicans were acting irresponsibly by blocking Obama's judicial nominees, and supports getting those nominees an up-or-down vote.

But he said there were other ways for Reid to achieve that, including by forcing GOP foes to stage an old-fashioned filibuster on the floor.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was the other Democrat to oppose the rule change.

The filibuster, for better or worse, has been a defining feature of the Senate for decades. While this makes the Senate one of the slowest-moving legislative bodies in the world, it also prevents legislation and appointments from moving too fast.

The vote on Thursday vastly reduces the power of the minority to stall nominations and makes it easier for federal judges to get lifetime appointments. The move would not affect Supreme Court nominees.

The late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., presented a powerful case against changing the rules back in 2010, when he said doing so would ""destroy the uniqueness of this institution.""

""In the hands of a tyrannical majority and leadership, that kind of emasculation of the cloture rule would mean that minority rights would cease to exist in the U.S. Senate,"" he said."

It avoids meaningful criticism of Israel and Saudi Arabia. It pretends, quite extraordinarily, that the Latin American sovereignty movement, which has liberated so many from United States-backed plutocracies and dictatorships over the last 30 years, never happened. Referring instead to the region’s “aging leaders,” the book can’t see Latin America for Cuba. And, of course, the book frets theatrically over Washington’s favorite boogeymen: North Korea and Iran.

Google, which started out as an expression of independent Californian graduate student culture — a decent, humane and playful culture — has, as it encountered the big, bad world, thrown its lot in with traditional Washington power elements, from the State Department to the National Security Agency.

Despite accounting for an infinitesimal fraction of violent deaths globally, terrorism is a favorite brand in United States policy circles. This is a fetish that must also be catered to, and so “The Future of Terrorism” gets a whole chapter. The future of terrorism, we learn, is cyberterrorism. A session of indulgent scaremongering follows, including a breathless disaster-movie scenario, wherein cyberterrorists take control of American air-traffic control systems and send planes crashing into buildings, shutting down power grids and launching nuclear weapons. The authors then tar activists who engage in digital sit-ins with the same brush.

I have a very different perspective. The advance of information technology epitomized by Google heralds the death of privacy for most people and shifts the world toward authoritarianism. This is the principal thesis in my book, “Cypherpunks.” But while Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Cohen tell us that the death of privacy will aid governments in “repressive autocracies” in “targeting their citizens,” they also say governments in “open” democracies will see it as “a gift” enabling them to “better respond to citizen and customer concerns.” In reality, the erosion of individual privacy in the West and the attendant centralization of power make abuses inevitable, moving the “good” societies closer to the “bad” ones.

The section on “repressive autocracies” describes, disapprovingly, various repressive surveillance measures: legislation to insert back doors into software to enable spying on citizens, monitoring of social networks and the collection of intelligence on entire populations. All of these are already in widespread use in the United States. In fact, some of those measures — like the push to require every social-network profile to be linked to a real name — were spearheaded by Google itself.

THE writing is on the wall, but the authors cannot see it. They borrow from William Dobson the idea that the media, in an autocracy, “allows for an opposition press as long as regime opponents understand where the unspoken limits are.” But these trends are beginning to emerge in the United States. No one doubts the chilling effects of the investigations into The Associated Press and Fox’s James Rosen. But there has been little analysis of Google’s role in complying with the Rosen subpoena. I have personal experience of these trends.

The Department of Justice admitted in March that it was in its third year of a continuing criminal investigation of WikiLeaks. Court testimony states that its targets include “the founders, owners, or managers of WikiLeaks.” One alleged source, Bradley Manning, faces a 12-week trial beginning tomorrow, with 24 prosecution witnesses expected to testify in secret.

This book is a balefully seminal work in which neither author has the language to see, much less to express, the titanic centralizing evil they are constructing. “What Lockheed Martin was to the 20th century,” they tell us, “technology and cybersecurity companies will be to the 21st.” Without even understanding how, they have updated and seamlessly implemented George Orwell’s prophecy. If you want a vision of the future, imagine Washington-backed Google Glasses strapped onto vacant human faces — forever. Zealots of the cult of consumer technology will find little to inspire them here, not that they ever seem to need it. But this is essential reading for anyone caught up in the struggle for the future, in view of one simple imperative: Know your enemy."

Congress should let them.","Jose Andres is a chef and restaurant owner.

The first time I saw America was from my perch on the mast of a Spanish naval ship, where I could spot the Statue of Liberty reaching proudly into the open, endless American sky. At night, I would often wonder whether that sky was the explanation for the stars on the American flag — put there so the world would know that this is a place of limitless possibility, where anyone from anywhere can strive for a better life.

I recalled that starry sky on Nov. 13, when after 23 years in America, my wife, Patricia, and I were sworn in as United States citizens. The naturalization ceremony in Baltimore, attended by 72 other tearful immigrants from 35 countries, was a moment I had dreamed about since the day I arrived in America with little more than $50 and a set of cooking knives, determined to belong. I eventually settled in Washington, where my partners and I have been fortunate to build a restaurant business that now employs thousands of Americans across the country.

And yet, I have become a citizen at a time when legislation is stalled in Congress that would afford millions of other immigrants the chance to earn their citizenship, too. With this bill, which already has the support of many Republican and most Democratic senators, we are closer than ever to achieving immigration reform. So I’d like to address the members of Congress who still have concerns about passing the bill:

I understand that this is a difficult and complicated issue. But we are not asking for an open-door policy that allows unregulated immigration. Indeed, the bill before Congress would do more to secure our borders than any other law in history. What we’re asking is to give the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are already part of America’s DNA a chance — a chance to prove they are worthy of citizenship; a chance to contribute more to this incredible country; a chance to belong.

The fellow immigrants I’ve known and worked with over the years, those with legal status and those without, are here for the right reasons. They don’t want to cause any trouble, take any handouts or steal anyone’s job. Many already pay taxes and have jobs — tough, dirty, exhausting work that America depends on, such as picking our tomatoes, cleaning our fish or canning our products on cold factory floors for low wages and no benefits.

Because many of us took great risks to come here and support our families, immigrants tend to have an especially strong work ethic. My friend Rodolfo started his career in America tiling the floors at Jaleo, our first restaurant. But he soon began washing dishes and baking bread overnight, sometimes holding two or three jobs while he learned how to cook. And today, that construction worker from Bolivia is a head chef, a restaurant investor, a wonderful father and a proud American citizen.

If other immigrants had the chance to pursue their dreams like Rodolfo, all of America would benefit. As legal residents, immigrants would contribute more in taxes, spend more at our businesses, start companies of their own and create more jobs. Immigration is not a problem for us to solve but an opportunity for America to seize.

As immigrants, we understand better than most that to be an American is a privilege that conveys not just rights but responsibilities. Some of those responsibilities are pledging allegiance to our flag, obeying our laws and learning a new language. But we also have an obligation to give something back — to enrich the American mosaic with our unique cultures, traditions and ideas. It is for this reason I plan to reopen my restaurant, America Eats in a new location in celebration of the culinary contributions that immigrants have stirred into our nation’s ever-churning melting pot.

For the menu, I researched some of the earliest recipes brought to America, and as I came across one labeled “Gaspacho ” in an early-19th-century book titled “The Virginia Housewife,” I couldn’t help but think of the past — not just the first time I saw America as a sailor in the Spanish navy but the first time a Spaniard ever arrived on America’s shores.

Five hundred years have passed since Juan Ponce de León set foot in Florida looking for gold, and today I can proudly say that I have found mine: my wife and daughters, my friends and colleagues, and the new citizenship my wonderful country has given me. While I will always be proud of where I come from, I have never been more certain of where I belong.

Right now, the House of Representatives has a chance to make a difference in the lives of millions by allowing a vote on immigration reform, a difference that would benefit America for generations to come. I don’t envy Speaker John Boehner’s difficult position. I know he loves this country dearly, and I imagine the hopes he had when sweeping the floor of his father’s Cincinnati bar were not so different than those of a young Spanish sailor who believed that if he loved America, America would love him back. All I ask is that he considers the millions of immigrant families who hold those same hopes.

We may all come from different places and backgrounds, but we still look with awe to that same remarkable sky, and we want nothing more than the simple chance to reach for our own American dream.

From “The Virginia Housewife,” by Mary Randolph (1824): “Put some soft biscuit or toasted bread in the bottom of a salad bowl, put in a layer of sliced tomatas with the skin taken off, and one of sliced cucumbers, sprinkled with pepper, salt, and chopped onion; do this until the bowl is full, stew some tomatas quite soft, strain the juice, mix in some mustard and oil, and pour over it; make it two hours before it is eaten.”"

What caught our eye today in politics

Sarah Palin has done it again. She has the Republican establishment scratching its head and asking ‘is she serious’?

Palin told Sean Hannity’s radio show Tuesday that she is indeed considering a run for Senate in Alaska. “I've considered it because people have requested me considering it, but I'm still waiting to see, you know, what the lineup will be and hoping that, there again - there will be some new blood, new energy - not just kind of picking from the same old politicians in the state that come from political families,” Palin said. “Sen. Mark Begich has got to be replaced.”

Mark Begich is the Democratic incumbent senator who is in a fight to hold onto the seat he won in 2008.

We reached out to Jennifer Duffy, who is the Senior Editor of the Cook Political Report, where she is in charge of ranking the U.S. Senate races.

Gut Check: What do you think of Sarah Palin considering a run for Senate in Alaska?

Duffy: I think it’s nuts. Let’s look at the polling; she was fairly unpopular among Alaska voters and she hasn’t spent that much time in Alaska lately.

Gut Check: She does have money and name ID.

Duffy: There are good candidates in this race already. This is one of Republican Party’s best opportunities to pick up a seat, but this is problematic for the GOP.

Gut Check: Isn’t it better for her then?

Duffy: Yes, because she tends to run outside the party. The worst thing she could do is run as an independent. The great irony for her is that she said there was a need for new blood and new faces, because she isn’t one.

Gut Check: You have the race ranked as a LEAN Democrat. (LINK) If Palin gets into this race for real, would it change your rating for the race?

http://cookpolitical.com/senate/charts/race-ratings

Duffy: There would be no change to the race rating unless she wins the nomination. There would be money - just not a lot from Alaska…Look, Democrats want this to happen; this is their dream for one of their most vulnerable incumbents; they will be her first contribution: ‘How can we help?’

Gut Check: Is it a bluff?

Duffy: With Sarah Palin you never know; this puts her back where she likes to be, in the media spotlight. It’s a 50-50 proposition.

Gut Check: Can you imagine a Senate with Sarah Palin?

Duffy: She’d make Ted Cruz look establishment.

TRIVIA ANSWER from @DanMericaCNN

When William Jennings Bryan heard of Tennessee's Scopes trial, a case that pinned believers in creationism and believers in evolution against each other, the three-time Democratic presidential candidate and outspoken evangelical helped argue in favor of creationism.

John Thomas Scopes, a young Tennessee teacher, was accused of teaching his class about evolution - an action that broke Tennessee's Butler Act, which made teaching evolution in any public school illegal. He – along with the help of the ACLU – challenged the law and the Scopes trial began on this day in 1925.

Bryan had long been a supporter of the Butler Act. After it was signed into law, he praised the bill, stating ""the Christian parents of the state owe you a debt of gratitude for saving their children from the poisonous influence of an unproven hypothesis.""

The trial drew hordes of media attention to the small town of Dayton, Tennessee.

After eight days of testimony, a jury found Scopes guilty and forced him to pay a $100 fine. Although the defense appealed the case to the Tennessee Supreme Court, the high court upheld the statute that forbade the teaching of evolution.

Decades later, though, in the case Epperson v. Arkansas, the United States Supreme Court ruled that laws like the Butler Act violated the Establishment Clause, making them unconstitutional.

The Republican drubbing in November among Latino voters, the shifting demographics of the American electorate, and the rise of telegenic champions of the immigration changes like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, both Republicans, have changed the stakes as well as the political equation.

But in Mr. Sessions, they face an opponent with experience, one who reminds his staff every day that passage of immigration legislation was supposed to be inevitable in 2006 as well, and even more so in 2007. His tactics are the same as they were back then: organize the opposition, break down the bill section by section, raise questions over every aspect of it, slow progress on the floor to a crawl through procedural objections and a flurry of amendments, and hope that in the light of day a conservative backlash will crush final passage.

During the first official week of debate on the Senate floor last week, Senate leaders were able to hold all of one amendment vote — in large measure because of Mr. Sessions’s delaying tactics. “Sessions is taking a full-spectrum view of this bill, and his opposition is not just one section: it’s from Page 1 to Page 1,041,” said Tripp Baird, director of Senate relations at Heritage Action, the conservative Heritage Foundation’s political arm and a vociferous opponent of the immigration bill.

Mr. Sessions does not necessarily hold the same sway in the Senate as the lawmakers he is challenging. The leading champions of the immigration bill include the Senate’s No. 2 and No. 3 Democrats, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Charles E. Schumer of New York, along with a former Republican presidential nominee in Mr. McCain and one of the party’s brightest stars in Mr. Rubio.

Mr. Sessions, the son of a country-store owner from rural Alabama, is neither party leader nor telegenic star. He was elected to the Senate in 1996, a decade after that same body blocked his nomination by President Ronald Reagan to a Federal District Court judgeship amid accusations of racial insensitivity."

She was an NPR reporter from 1997-2001 and special assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2010-2011.

“Are you kidding me?”

I was always stunned to hear reporters ask me — as they did half a dozen times when I worked at the Pentagon — to show them some classified document or other. They’d just pop the question blithely, unfazed, without an apparent thought for the implications. My incredulous retort would usually reap an only half-sheepish answer: “Well, I had to ask.”

Countless national security officials have had some version of this conversation – including the State Department security adviser that Fox News correspondent James Rosen allegedly plumbed for information on North Korea. Rosen wrote in an e-mail that he’d “love to see some internal State Department analyses.”

I’ve served on both sides of the line, as an NPR reporter and a Defense Department official, and it’s from that split perspective that I’ve been observing the furor over the seizure of journalists’ telephone and e-mail records in Justice Department investigations of national security leaks. Especially troubling to some reporters and pundits is a search warrant application suggesting that Rosen was “an aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator” with his source. Commentators have decried the Justice Department for criminalizing journalism itself.

The value to democracy of a courageous and unfettered press poking into back corners that agencies would rather keep hidden is incontrovertible. But I find myself wondering why journalists shouldn’t shoulder some responsibility for transgressions they often goad their sources to commit.

Every government employee who obtains a security clearance receives a briefing on the rules about accessing and using classified information, and, as part of his or her terms of employment, must sign a piece of paper acknowledging the potential consequences of violating the law. Many officials, including me, have been subjected to a polygraph exam — an exceedingly unpleasant experience for anyone with a conscience or a literal mind. National security staffers’ careers can be wrecked over how they handle documents stamped SECRET.

Reporters, on the other hand, have little to lose when trawling for leaks. No American journalist has been prosecuted for publishing classified information. And the media could gain even greater protections under a shield law or new procedures now being hammered out with the Justice Department.

I’ve heard from reporters and senior government figures alike that the Obama administration’s leak investigations are having a chilling effect on officials who normally interact with journalists. That’s unfortunate, because regular conversations about the business of government, as well as the injection of alternative perspectives by way of the questions reporters ask, or their reflections on what they hear, are critical to a healthy state.

But the stakes might be clearer if sources knew that reporters had skin in the game, too: if they understood that journalists weren’t asking questions idly — in hopes of a passing scoop, or even happy to be made use of in some messaging campaign — but because the information is so critical to the public interest that they are willing to risk repercussions for finding and airing it.

Comparatively unfettered though the press may be in the United States, its courage is frequently lacking. Washington relationships cemented by orchestrated leaks and background innuendo can verge on the sycophantic. Then again, government disingenuousness has also been on display in the current imbroglio.

Far too much information is protected by unwarranted classification. It’s hard to take a system seriously that places so many gigabytes of material that are not critical to national security under the same umbrella as the few nuggets that are. I’ve seen a New Yorker article included among prep documents for a National Security Council meeting stamped SECRET//NOFORN (meaning that only cleared U.S. citizens were allowed to read it). I’ve had a colleague contradict a sunny e-mail he sent me on the unclassified system with a SECRET snarl. Such misuse makes a mockery of rules that the leak investigations seek to enforce.

At least as troubling is the double standard that has seemed to apply in the recent investigations. The six criminal prosecutions under the Obama administration have all targeted working-level government employees. Meanwhile, senior officials leak — or authorize leaks — with impunity.

In September 2010, a flurry of coverage in major U.S. newspapers reported a supposed government decision on how corruption in Afghanistan would be handled. Perusing the articles with growing wonder, I looked down at a memo on my desk. Not only were passages quoted from it classified, the document was also watermarked DRAFT. No decision had been made yet because debate on the draft had not even reached the level of Cabinet secretaries. It was a classic Washington case of offensive leaking. For months, I was convinced that the perpetrator was the late Richard Holbrooke, then special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan. But I kept asking reporters. Finally I traced the leak to a senior White House official, whose career has progressed untroubled.

Last year, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius was given an exclusive preview of 17 redacted documents that had been retrieved from Osama bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Ignatius wrote that the documents had been declassified but had not yet been made available to the public. More than six weeks later, those 17 documents — and only those 17, out of some 1.5 million scooped up at Abbottabad — were released. How does such selectivity square with a coherent declassification policy?

Perhaps the most remarkable example of disclosure of classified information in plain sight was the detail offered up to the media in the wake of the raid that killed bin Laden — capped off by briefings from then-White House chief counterterrorism adviser John Brennan. The superfluous specificity left a number of officials who had helped plan the raid aghast, including a longtime Washington insider, then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates.

The law, including regulations protecting national security secrets, should be taken seriously, and decisions to break it for reasons of conscience should not be taken lightly. But by the same token, the law should not be stretched for purposes far beyond its original, legitimate intent. And most important, it should be applied equally to all who vow to uphold it.

UPDATE: Saturday, June 1, 2013. Sarah Chayes writes: Thanks to all who have contributed great comments. This is just the type of debate such a fraught issue should generate. One thing I regret in this piece is not taking my argument about over-classification beyond criticism. Could any of you -- particularly with government experience -- suggest practical recommendations for how to reduce the amount of material that gets classified, and how to change the incentives for over-classification? Who should issue what directives? What type of implementation and follow-up mechanisms would have to be designed? Let’s use the comments forum to start hammering out a solution to this long-festering problem.

Marco Rubio is only a freshman senator, but his voter appeal and Cuban-American heritage -- combined with his focus on immigration reform and other key issues -- have made him a rising star in the Republican Party.

His ascension from junior Florida senator into the upper echelon of the party will be highlighted Tuesday night when he gives the Republican response to President Obama’s State of the Union address.

“Senator Rubio’s rise in the party has as much to do with his youth and ethnicity as it does with his intelligence and common-sense policy positions,” said Tyler Harber, a Republican strategist and partner in Harcom Strategies International. “Republicans realize their weakness lies with reaching younger and non-white voters. Rubio presents an opportunity to the party to coalesce around a leader who can bridge the divide.”

Time magazine recently put Rubio on its cover with the headline ""The Republican Savior"" and called him the new voice of the Republican Party.

Harber says Rubio also possesses a common-sense approach to issues that generally divide conservative and moderate wings of the party and nation.

Rubio has authored bipartisan jobs legislation, has plans for legislation on education and small business and has crafted an immigration plan likely to draw bipartisan support.

“I know both sides of this coin firsthand,” Rubio said last month on the Senate floor. “I didn't watch some movie last week about immigration. I lived this issue on a daily basis. I live in a family of immigrants, married into a family of immigrants, in a neighborhood of immigrants.”

Still, Rubio knows he must walk a political tightrope on the issue -- trying to show the welcoming face of the party on legal immigration while firmly discouraging illegal immigration.

He is expected to talk Tuesday night about a range of issues on which he's taken firm positions, including jobs, spending and taxes.

“He’s tried to walk the line between Tea Party and the establishment sides of the Republican Party, often offering a third position on policies that both groups can embrace,” Harber said.

Though Rubio was elected in 2010 as part of the Tea Party movement that helped Republicans take control of the House and is still referred to as the ""crown prince” of the movement, Republican Sen. Rand Paul will give the official Tea Party response.

The Kentucky senator will give his response to the president’s remarks a few minutes after Rubio.

Are they righting a wrong or wronging the Wrights?

The Connecticut Senate passed a bill just after midnight on Wednesday that would delete the Wright brothers from history, explicitly stripping recognition for the first powered flight from Orville and Wilbur and assigning it to someone else.

'At least in Connecticut, aviation history now appears to have been rewritten.' — Aviation historian John Brown

“The Governor shall proclaim a date certain in each year as Powered Flight Day to honor the first powered flight by [the Wright brothers] Gustave Whitehead and to commemorate the Connecticut aviation and aerospace industry,” reads House Bill No. 6671, which now sits on the Governor’s desk awaiting passage into law.

""There’s no question that the Wright brothers will retain their place in aviation history,"" Republican state Sen. Mike McLachlan told FoxNews.com. ""And rightfully so. They just weren't first.""

The Governor is likely to sign the bill as early as next week, McLachlan said.

Aviation historian John Brown unveiled in March what he calls photographic proof that Whitehead flew over Connecticut in 1901, “two years, four months, and three days before the Wright brothers.”

""At least in Connecticut, aviation history now appears to have been rewritten,” Brown told FoxNews.com Wednesday. “I have no information about whether school books will be reprinted in time for the start of Fall classes.”

The Wright brothers soared into history books on Dec. 17, 1903, following their historic, 852-foot, 59-second flight at Kitty Hawk, N.C. -- an achievement for which the duo are widely described as being “first in flight.” But historians have long known that others were working on a variety of flying machines, including a fellow U.S. resident, German immigrant Gustave Whitehead (born Weisskopf).

Read the fine print

A 1948 contract between the Smithsonian museum and Orville Wright requires the museum to call the Wright Flyer the first real airplane, critics argue. Here, the relevant excerpt from the contract:

“Neither the Smithsonian Institution nor its successors, nor any museum or other agency ... or its successors shall publish or permit to be displayed a statement or label in connection with or in respect of any aircraft model or design of earlier date than the Wright Aeroplane of 1903, claiming in effect that such aircraft was capable of carrying a man under its own power in controlled flight.”

Read the full contract here.

Whitehead flew early in the morning of Aug. 14, 1901, Brown said. His winged, bird-like plane was called No. 21, or ""The Condor""; with wooden wheels and canvas wings stretched taut across bat-like wooden arms, it rose over the darkened streets of Bridgeport, Conn., and covered an estimated 1.5 miles at a height of 50 feet, he said.

Since Brown’s March revelation, controversy has swirled around his claims.

Historians with the Smithsonian Museum in particular -- curators of the Wright Brother’s plane -- continue to express doubts about Brown’s claims.

""I’m still absolutely convinced -- as I think most historians are -- that the Wrights were first, and Whitehead in all probability never left the ground,"" Tom Crouch, senior curator of aeronautics from the museum, told FoxNews.com. Besides, history is factual, not based on laws, he said.

""You don’t legislate history. History is a process. People make up their minds based, I hope, on some thought given to the evidence,"" he said.

""And I think when people do look seriously at the evidence for the Whitehead claims, they’ll see that it falls apart.""

McLachlan told FoxNews.com he found the information convincing enough.

""If more information comes along in history, we always change the history books. That’s been going on for years,"" he told FoxNews.com.

Brown trumpeted the bill, which he said was based not on partisan beliefs but on hard facts.

“These weren't just people cheering the home team,” he told FoxNews.com. “Several legislators -- from both parties -- contacted me before the vote … they'd clearly done their homework and asked hardball questions.”

“It was refreshing for me to see how seriously they took their vote,” Brown added.

While Kitty Hawk, N.C., has become well associated with flight thanks to Orville and Wilbur, Connecticut has a deep history in the aviation world as well. Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., maker of the Black Hawk helicopter, is headquartered mere miles from the site of Whitehead’s achievement.

""North Carolina’s license plate does say first in flight,"" McLachlan told FoxNews.com. ""I think we’ll now have a little bit of a discussion between Connecticut and North Carolina to verify who was first.""

""It’s a big deal that we have dislocated the Wright brothers as number one,"" he said."
http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/29/tech/web/revenge-porn-law/index.html,2013-08-29 00:00:00,['Heather Kelly'],California weighs making ‘revenge porn’ illegal,"Story highlights California debates a law that would make posting what's known as ""revenge porn"" illegal New Jersey is the only state with a similar law Distributing photos taken with permission falls into a gray legal area

(CNN) —

In the aftermath of a failed relationship, jilted lovers have been known to lash out by posting sexually explicit photos or videos of their exes online.

Called “revenge porn,” or the less-salacious “cyber revenge,” the trend has been around for years, spawning entire websites that profit off these images. But now, state laws could make this illegal.

Opinion: ‘Revenge porn’ should be a crime

This week, the California Legislature is debating a new bill that would make it a misdemeanor for people to distribute sexually explicit photos or videos they’d shot in order to cause others humiliation or distress. It has already passed the state Senate.

A similar bill was under consideration in Florida this year that would have made the act a felony, but it failed to muster the votes to become law. New Jersey is the only state that already has such a law on the books.

Advocate Holly Jacobs, a graduate student in Florida, began pushing for stronger laws after naked photos and videos of her were posted online that she had shared with an ex-boyfriend while they were together. The images went viral and were re-posted on hundreds of websites, along with identifying details such as her name, e-mail address and employer.

Jacobs suspects her ex was responsible, although she told CNN that he has denied any involvement. She spent years fighting to get the images removed from various websites.

A gray area

The reason it was so difficult is that these acts of vengeance frequently fall into a gray legal area.

In California, very few variations of revenge are already covered under state law. If a subject is under 18, such an act is covered by child pornography laws. It’s already illegal to shoot a video or photograph secretly of someone without permission anywhere there’s a reasonable expectation of privacy – in a bedroom or a store dressing room, for example, but not in a public park or on the street.

However, these laws don’t apply in most “revenge porn” situations, where the injured party gave permission to be photographed or videotaped during happier times.

There are cyberstalking statutes, but they require a pattern of behavior (multiple offenses) and implied threats that make the victim fear for his or her safety. Uploading a single nude photo to embarrass an ex wouldn’t apply.

As a final recourse, the man or woman shown in an explicit video could pursue a civil case against their ex or the sites hosting the images, but those cases can be costly and difficult to win.

The California bill, Senate Bill 255, targets anyone who photographs or records a sexual image with consent and then “subsequently distributes the image taken, with the intent to cause serious emotional distress, and the other person suffers serious emotional distress.”

Under the new law, distributing these types of videos and photos would become a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail or a $1,000 fine for first violation. A second offense could result in a year in jail and a $2,000 fine. The perpetrator would not become a registered sex offender.

“This is a very precisely drafted and narrowly drafted bill,” said UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh.

Legal pitfalls

The California bill is so narrow, in fact, that it doesn’t cover one of the more common revenge-porn situations: images originally shared through sexting. The law only applies when someone is the both the person who shoots the original image and the one who distributes it. If someone takes a photo of himself or herself, texts it to a girlfriend or boyfriend, and then the recipient later posts it, that act wouldn’t be considered a crime under this legislation.

Critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union have also expressed concerns about the bill, arguing such a law could have a negative impact on free speech.

“It’s possible in extremely unusual situations that this kind of speech might have serious value – you can imagine a political context or a video that reveals something criminal,” Volokh said.

There are other potential holes, such as when images are distributed for bragging rights or money instead of revenge.

“It does require intent to cause serious emotional distress,” Volokh said of the bill. “In certain situations, the reason people distribute this material is for money.”

Once an image is online it can spread quickly. The bitter ex could be charged with a crime, but getting websites to take down the image would still be a separate battle. The hope is that making distributing the images a crime will deter people from pursuing this type of revenge in the first place."

Officials say the $32-million high-technology system offers the Navy a weapon a fraction of the cost of its traditional arsenal -- cruise missiles, as well as rapid-fire Gatling guns.

“Our conservative data tells us a shot of directed energy costs under $1,” Chief of Naval Research Rear Adm. Matthew Klunder said in a statement. “Compare that to the hundreds of thousands of dollars it costs to fire a missile, and you can begin to see the merits of this capability.”

The laser’s power also can be scaled down, presenting the Navy a non-lethal alternative to ward off threats such as pirates, terrorists and smugglers.

“Because lasers run on electricity, they can be fired as long as there is power and provide a measure of safety as they don’t require carrying propellants and explosives aboard ships,” the Navy said.

The technology, called the Laser Weapon System, was developed by engineers and scientists from the Navy, defense industry and academia. It involves commercial fiber solid state lasers and has already successfully shot down a flying target (see the video above).

It will be deployed on board USS Ponce in 2014.

The announcement to utilize the laser comes as military researchers continue to try to make progress on directed energy weapons.

In 2011, the Navy had success with another laser system mounted on a warship when it fired and set fire to an empty motorboat as it bobbed in the Pacific Ocean. It was the first time in history the Navy pulled off the feat.

In what was once considered the stuff of science fiction, the development of laser technology has been fraught with setbacks.

Last year, the Missile Defense Agency’s airborne laser program was canceled after more than 15 years of development and $5 billion in federal funding.

The program involved a Boeing 747 jumbo jet equipped with an advanced tracking system and a massive laser gun on its nose to identify and obliterate enemy missiles as they blast off. But the program experienced a series of cost overruns and delays. It never went beyond testing.

The Navy’s desired targets with the Laser Weapon System are far smaller and slower.

Following next year’s USS Ponce demonstration -- which comes two years ahead of schedule -- Navy and Pentagon officials said they will continue to research ways to integrate affordable laser weapons into the fleet.

Harry Reid and Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer were not invited by former President George W. Bush to Thursday's high-profile ceremony unveiling his presidential library, Capitol Hill sources told HuffPost.

Hoyer, the Democratic House whip who represents southern Maryland, complained privately to colleagues about the slight earlier Thursday, HuffPost was told. A second House source confirmed the lack of an invitation to Pelosi and Hoyer, and a Reid aide said that the Senate majority leader was not invited.

""I wanna welcome members of Congress here,"" Bush said Thursday, opening his speech in Dallas. ""I thank the speaker for coming.""

The snub is a reminder of the tense relationship that Bush had with Democrats as president. Reid famously called him a ""liar,"" and Pelosi made no attempt to conceal her contempt for him. Bush, for his part, showed little interest in a relationship with congressional Democrats, preferring to marshal only Republican votes on behalf of his agenda.

""Guess there is no section in the library about the failed effort to privatize Social Security,"" quipped one top Democratic aide.

Along with Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Bush also invited all the living former presidents and the current White House occupant, as well as a host of former top foreign leaders -- Australia's John Howard, Britain's Tony Blair, Israel's Ehud Olmert and Italy's Silvio Berlusconi, who left office in disgrace."

Circuit Court,"WASHINGTON -- The White House officially withdrew President Barack Obama's nomination of Caitlin Halligan to serve on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. A statement issued on Friday comes after repeated attempts to confirm the former New York state solicitor general were filibustered by Senate Republicans.

In a statement, Obama said he was ""deeply disappointed"" that a minority of senators had blocked Halligan's nomination for almost two and a half years, and called the vacancies on what is arguably the country's second-highest federal court ""unacceptable.""

""Today, I accepted Caitlin Halligan's request to withdraw as a nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,"" Obama said in an emailed statement. ""This unjustified filibuster obstructed the majority of Senators from expressing their support. I am confident that with Caitlin's impressive qualifications and reputation, she would have served with distinction.""

Republicans objected to Halligan's nomination because of what they claim is her history of legal advocacy, having focused specifically on a lawsuit in which she participated that would make gun manufacturers legally accountable for criminal acts of gun violence.

The most recent GOP filibuster incidentally came on the same day that Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) gained national media attention for his 13-hour talking filibuster. Democrats fell short of the required 60-vote threshold to end debate and bring Halligan's nomination to a vote, with only Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) breaking from her party in support of invoking cloture. Halligan was nominated on Sept. 29, 2010, to fill the long vacant D.C. Circuit seat previously held by current Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts; her nomination was first filibustered in 2011.

Shortly after the vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Halligan would ""bring that activism to the court.""

""Because of her record of activism, giving Ms. Halligan a lifetime appointment on the D.C. Circuit is a bridge too far,"" McConnell said.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) called it a ""shame"" that Republicans had succeeded in blocking an ""extraordinarily well-qualified"" woman, who he said would've made an ""outstanding judge.""

""Caitlin Halligan is a woman who is extraordinarily well-qualified and amongst the most qualified judicial nominees I have seen from any administration,"" Leahy said in a statement. ""It is a shame that narrow, special interests hold such influence that Senate Republicans for two years blocked an up-or-down vote on her confirmation.""

Black luxury car rammed a security barricade near the White House on Thursday

Incident ended 16 blocks away on Capitol Hill with police killing the woman driver

Police shot the driver after she got out of her vehicle and tried to flee

A chase that began with a black luxury car ramming a security barricade near the White House on Thursday ended 16 blocks away on Capitol Hill with police killing the woman driver, authorities said.

The Nissan Infiniti was registered to Miriam Carey, 34, of Stamford, Conn., according to a federal law enforcement official who was not authorized to comment publicly. Investigators believe she was the driver, and authorities were running fingerprint analysis to confirm her identity.

A child about a year old who was in car was taken to a local hospital and is in good condition, Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier said at an evening news briefing.

The incident caused a brief lockdown of the U.S. Capitol as Congress tried unsuccessfully to end the three-day government shutdown.

""This does not appear to be in any way an accident,"" Lanier said, noting that the woman twice tried to breach security barriers and struck a uniformed Secret Service officer near the White House.

U.S. Capitol Police chief Kim Dine said the incident ""appears to be an isolated, singular matter, with, at this point, no nexus to terrorism.""

The chaotic events began at 2:12 p.m. ET when the driver rammed a temporary barrier at 15th and E Streets NW, hitting the officer, said Secret Service chief Ed Donovan. Other Secret Service officers chased the woman east on Pennsylvania Avenue but did not shoot.

Lanier said Capitol Police officers pursued the speeding car eastbound and tried to stop it in Garfield Circle, just west of the Capitol lawn. A 23-year-veteran officer suffered non-life-threatening injuries when he crashed into a barrier.

Police had the woman's car surrounded but she escaped, ramming a Secret Service vehicle as she fled. Lanier said police then fired their first shots at the suspect.

The driver made her way onto Constitution Avenue before eventually stopping in the 100 blocks of Maryland Avenue NE, near the Hart Senate Office Building.

Police then killed the driver after she got out of her vehicle and tried to flee.

Two federal officials told USA TODAY that all shots were fired by law enforcement officers. One official said no gun was recovered from the Infiniti.

Terrance Gainer, the Sergeant at Arms of the U.S. Senate, said the woman's vehicle could not have reached the Capitol itself because ""there are barricades up all the time.""

As the chase unfolded, members of Congress and staff were told by Capitol police to ""immediately shelter in place."" Less than an hour later, a TV screen in the Senate press gallery flashed an ""all clear"" message.

Security was heightened at the White House as a precaution and President Obama was briefed on the incident, according to White House officials.

Larry Murr, a former Louisville resident living in Jacksonville, Fla., was visiting the Capitol building when he heard the gunfire, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported..

""We were standing there, looking at the building, and all of a sudden we heard a pop-pop-pop-pop,"" he said, saying he thought he heard four to five shots fired in rapid succession.

In a notice distributed by email, the U.S. Capitol Police advised everyone to ""close, lock and stay away from external doors and windows.""

Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who was on the balcony off of the speaker's lobby when the gunshots erupted, tells reporters that they sounded like ""fireworks.""

Rep. Bill Posey (R-Fla.), who was also on the balcony, said he heard ""five or six"" gunshots.

""Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!"" Posey told POLITICO. ""Then sirens went off, cops started going everywhere yelling 'get inside, get inside!'""

People standing outside the Supreme Court across the street from Congress were hurried into the court building by authorities.

Sometimes it works temporarily, as when Wendy Davis filibustered to kill a bill on a legislative deadline, only to watch the Republicans reset the clock, by booting up another special session, to get what they wanted a few days later.

Scratch this, and you’ll find people arguing both sides. After one or two sessions in the Texas Senate, each officeholder has been either the stomper or the stompee — in the minority on something and the majority on something else. Washington seems to always be in a partisan fight. In Austin, the majority-minority fights shift constantly. Redistricting debates are partisan. Debates over budgets for education break on rural and suburban lines, or on lines between big and little property tax bases. Water wars are all about geography.

So the federal scrap over what got tagged as the “nuclear option” was all about partisans. The state ruckus is more nuanced, and even the strong proponents of change are inclined to move slowly. Drop it to a smaller supermajority like 60 percent instead of killing it, they suggest.

The initial resistance is partisan. After all, Mr. Patrick, a Houston Republican who is running for lieutenant governor, is one of the most conservative senators, and Democrats are immediately suspect of anything he supports. A lower supermajority like 60 percent would put Republicans in control, given the current configuration. It would take 19 people to call up a bill. Today, there are 19 Republicans. With Ms. Davis, a Democrat from Fort Worth, running for governor, Republican chances of taking her district have improved. With the two-thirds rule in place, Republicans would still need a defector on partisan issues, even with one of their own representing the 10th Senate District.

Democratic senators think they would get squashed if the two-thirds rule disappeared. Republicans, during the 1990s, would have had the same reaction. The traditions in the Senate are strong, and that has kept the rule in place for all these years. Earlier this year, in fact, senators voted unanimously to keep the rule.

But others in the race for lieutenant governor have endorsed the lower number. That makes it an item for discussion when the Texas Senate convenes after next year’s elections. Those Republicans want to exercise the full power of the majority without a pesky minority throwing obstacles in their way. Who wouldn’t?

Just ask Mr. Reid and the Democrats in the United States Senate."

Instead, ""SNL"" took aim at itself.

The sketch, which opened on Jay Pharaoh's Barack Obama in the Oval Office, reeling from embarrassing political setbacks, quickly shifted gears with the arrival of Michelle Obama, then Oprah, then supposedly Beyonce. The catch? Kerry Washington was supposed to play all three of them, because ""SNL"" doesn't have any black women on its cast.

Cue the following mea culpa from the show's producers:

The Producers at ""Saturday Night Live"" would like to apologize to Kerry Washington for the number of black women she will be asked to play tonight. We made these requests only because Ms. Washington is an actress of considerable range and talent and also because ""SNL"" does not currently have a black woman in the cast. As for the latter reason, we agree that this is not an ideal situation, and look forward to rectifying it in the near future…unless, of course, we fall in love with another white guy first.

For all of ""SNL's"" staying power -- it has, after all, been on the air for most of four decades -- the one criticism it's never been able to escape is its startling lack of diversity. When ""SNL"" rolled out six new cast members in September, many voiced disappointment. Five of them are white men, and the one female addition, ""despite a heritage which includes Tunisian and Latina roots… has seemingly played just white characters onscreen,"" as NPR points out.

That criticism was renewed this week, as Kerry Washington, one of only a few leading black women on television, prepared to host.



Per the Associated Press:

The show has had four black women among its regular cast since coming on the air in 1975 with the last one, biracial Maya Rudolph, leaving in 2007. Both Pharoah and Thompson have recently addressed the situation in interviews, with Pharoah even lobbying for a specific comic to be added — Darmirra Brunson of the OWN sitcom ""Love Thy Neighbor.""

""It's not like it's not a priority for us,"" producer Lorne Michaels told the AP last week. ""It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.""

Good self-awareness, ""SNL."" Now do something about it!"

“Keep Santa Cruz Weird” was the longstanding, if unofficial, motto for this small beachfront city proud of its tolerance and its offbeat vibe. People came for Santa Cruz’s 1960s-imbued live-and-let-live attitude, its progressive politics, the great weather, the University of California campus, the hard-partying surfing scene and the freewheeling drug culture.

But “Keep Santa Cruz Safe and Clean” began appearing on bumpers in recent years as the city was rattled by acts of violence, its streets and parks seemingly overwhelmed by homelessness and drugs. To hear the supporters of the new slogan, Santa Cruz’s famous tolerance was guilty of enabling.

The dueling slogans captured the fight over the city’s politics and policies, as well as its spirit. The debate has only intensified since the recent killings of Sgt. Butch Baker and Officer Elizabeth Butler, the first two police officers to die on duty in the Santa Cruz Police Department’s 157-year history."
http://news.yahoo.com/ny-fire-dept-squirrel-kill-draws-complaints-225428605.html,,[],NY fire dept.'s squirrel kill draws complaints,"HOLLEY, N.Y. (AP) — A weekend squirrel-shooting contest in upstate New York is a sell-out, with all 1,000 tickets spoken for, organizers said, despite a push by animal rights groups and others to cancel the event.

The 7th annual ""Hazzard County Squirrel Slam"" will raise money for the volunteer Holley Fire Department, the event sponsor.

Prizes ranging from $50 to $200 will be given out Saturday for the largest squirrel shot and the heaviest group of five squirrels. Five rifles and shotguns are to be raffled off, according to a flier on the western New York fire department's website.

Critics have sought to stop the event through online petitions and protests, calling the event cruel and a bad example for children. The contest targeting red and gray squirrels is open to anyone over age 12 with a hunting license.

""Declaring someone a winner for killing the most animals influences children and the wider community to believe that wildlife is unimportant and killing for a monetary prize is meritorious,"" Brian Shapiro, New York state director of the Humane Society of the United States, wrote in a letter to Holley Fire Chief Pete Hendrickson.

Supporters say hunting is just part of life upstate, including in the largely rural village of 1,800 people on the Erie Canal.

""This is a community of hunters and they're going to hunt anyways. Why not hold a fundraiser that will reach our community,"" the event's chairwoman, Tina Reed, told the Democrat and Chronicle of Rochester. She said the event has grown each year: This year, 1,000 tickets were made available after it sold out of 200 tickets last year.

Participants must abide by New York's hunting regulations, hunting only where it is permitted and killing no more than six squirrels in a single day. Shooting will be followed by a weigh-in, then a dinner.

State Sen. Tony Avella, a Queens Democrat, called the contest insane during an Albany news conference with the group Friends of Animals earlier this week. The group planned to protest outside the Holley Fire House on Saturday afternoon.

Story continues

Avella's upstate colleague, Sen. George Maziarz, a Democrat who represents Holley, defended the fundraiser, saying hunting, fishing and shooting sports are part of the region's lifestyle.

""It's like a fishing derby but it's squirrels, not fish,"" Maziarz spokesman Adam Tabelski said Friday.

Neither the fire department nor members of its board of directors returned telephone and email messages from The Associated Press."

A former aide to Bob Filner filed a sexual harassment lawsuit

8th woman accuses Filner of unwanted advances

Council votes unanimously to reject request city pay Filner%27s legal costs

Council votes to go to court to have Filner cover any costs to city from suit

The San Diego City Council rejected Mayor Bob Filner's request that the city pay his legal bills Tuesday and voted to sue the mayor to recover any costs the city incurs over a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by his former communications director/.

The council took the actions on a pair of unanimous votes on the same day an eighth woman went public with accusations the mayor made unwanted advances.

""This is part of due process,"" City Attorney Jan Goldsmith said. ""If Bob Filner engaged in unlawful conduct and the city is held liable, he will have to reimburse us every penny the city pays and its attorney fees.""

The dispute over legal costs comes as a pair of competing recall efforts against Filner, who is accused by eight women of behavior such as groping, unwanted kissing and sexual advances, began in earnest Monday.

Lisa Curtin, director of government and military education at San Diego City College, became the eighth woman to go public with allegations about Filner when she told KPBS that he made unwanted advances to her during a meeting in 2011, when he was a Democratic member of Congress, the station reported.

Curtin said that Filner asked to meet with her privately at the conclusion of a business meeting, and that once alone with her he asked about the wedding ring she was wearing. She replied that she had been married for 25 years, she said.

""He then asked me if it could come off while I was in D.C. and if I would go out with him,"" Curtin said. ""I said I really didn't think so. And at that point, he pulled my hand closer to him and he reached over to kiss me. I turned my head at that moment and on the side of my face, I got a very wet, saliva-filled kiss including feeling his tongue on my cheek.""

Curtin said she did not report the incident to police at the time but has since reported it to the San Diego Sheriff's Department, which has established a hotline for reports of alleged misconduct by the mayor.

Irene McCormack Jackson, Filner's former aide, filed suit against the mayor and the city last week alleging, among other things, that the mayor told her he wanted to see her naked and asked her to work without wearing underwear.

Filner apologized for his behavior and said he would undergo ""intensive therapy"" for two weeks starting Aug. 5. The former Democratic congressman, who was elected to the city post in November, has rejected repeated calls to resign.

Seven of the nine San Diego City Council members have called on Filner to step down. Resignation calls have also come from top Democrats such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the state's senior senator, and national party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

""Intimidating women is not in Mayor Filner's job description,'' council member Kevin Faulconer said. ""His employer -- San Diego taxpayers -- shouldn't have to bail him out of the mess he created.''.

Filner has hired a private attorney, Harvey Berger, to defend him in the lawsuit.

Filner is the first Democratic mayor of the nation's eighth most populous city in 20 years.

Detroit Free Press

Recording combined from 2 tapes%2C enhanced by audio engineer

Military officials%2C Secret Service agents can be heard

Engineer believes parts of tapes have been edited out

DETROIT -- John F. Kennedy arrived in Dallas on Air Force One before noon on Nov. 22, 1963. Hours later, the slain leader was being flown back to Washington, D.C., as radio communications crackled back and forth between the plane and various officials on the ground.

""The president is on board, the body is on board, and Mrs. Kennedy is on board,"" a voice said at one point, starkly describing the just sworn-in Lyndon B. Johnson and the-now dead JFK.

This month, as events, books and TV specials mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination, a new piece of evidence has Kennedy researchers buzzing.

It's an 88-minute audio recording of Air Force One radio transmissions that's described as the most complete version of those communications yet.

And it may indicate that a longer version with fresh revelations is out there somewhere.

The recording is described on the JFKFacts.org website as among the most important pieces of assassination-related evidence to surface in the past five years.

It was enhanced for sound quality and combined from two separate tapes by audio/video forensic expert Ed Primeau of Primeau Forensics in Rochester Hills, Mich.

Like anything new about the JFK assassination, the recording is bound to be pored over by those fascinated by what a majority of Americans consider an unsolved mystery.

Conspiracy theories still exist that cast suspicions on everyone from the Cubans and the Russians to the mob and even portions of the U.S. government.

Primeau believes ""100 percent"" that there was editing done to the two tapes that were used in the 88-minute version.

Primeau, 55, has been an expert witness for criminal and civil cases across the country.

In fall 2012, he was contacted by author and JFK assassination researcher Bill Kelly, who wanted technical help in combining two audiotapes of Air Force One radio transmissions: one released in the 1970s from LBJ's presidential library and a longer one that came to light a couple of years ago from the belongings of Gen. Chester Clifton, a military aide to Kennedy.

Kelly transcribed the tapes. Primeau, working off and on starting in about January, spent time enhancing the sound quality.

Brad Finegan of Primeau Forensics combined the two tapes in chronological order using Kelly's transcripts and some overlapping as guides.

Last month, Kelly presented an analysis of the tapes at a 50th anniversary assassination symposium at Duquesne University's Cyril H. Wecht Institute of Forensic Science and Law in Pittsburgh.

""The Air Force One tapes are sort of like the black box of the assassination. It has all the basic information there you want to know of what happened at the highest levels of government in the two hours after the assassination. And it all should be right there but there's some that's missing,"" says Kelly, whose website is JFKcountercoup.blogspot.com.

""Spine chilling"" is how Primeau describes listening to the tapes, which are peppered with code names like Volunteer (for LBJ) and Lace (for Jacqueline Kennedy) and urgent efforts to make arrangements for things like a lift to remove the casket from the plane in D.C.

Generals, Secret Service members and radio operators can be heard. At one point, the airborne LBJ is patched through to JFK's mother, Rose, at the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport, Mass., to offer his condolences.

Primeau believes that the LBJ and Clifton recordings are what are called safety copies that don't contain the entire radio transmissions from Air Force One. ""As I listen to the recordings, I can hear edits.""

That raises questions. ""What was taken out, who took them out and where are they?"" he asks.

It also points to the possibility that the entire record of the radio transmissions is somewhere out there, says author and former Washington Post reporter Jefferson Morley, who has led the charge to have the CIA release still-classified material on the assassination.

""It's not the tape itself. It's what the tape tells us. And what the tape tells us is that there was a longer recording of the Air Force One communications on November 22. That was never known before,"" says Morley, who's written about the new recording for the site he moderates, JFKFacts.org.

The Air Force One recording is considered significant by those still looking for a credible explanation for the JFK assassination. But new information based on fact, not speculation, also interests conspiracy debunkers.

""Aside from what I might disagree with Kelly on, it's always a good thing to try to get the historical record in better shape, to clarify the material,"" says professor John McAdams of Marquette University, whose JFK assassination website appeals to those who believe accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

Primeau suspects the original source tapes of the Air Force One tapes may no longer exist. ""Will they ever surface? I don't think so. I think they're destroyed, like parts of the Watergate tapes were destroyed, permanently gone so that nobody could ever find out."""

Message: What IRS scandal? Not that the failure of Republicans, particularly Rep. Darrell Issa of California and the puppets in the right-wing media noise machine, will ever shut up about this no matter what is learned about the reality.

We've had months of ""investigations"" and allegations that there was a partisan effort by the IRS, coordinated by the White House, to target tea party organizations over their tax-exempt status. What have we learned? Democratic and independent groups were looked at in the IRS examination of tax status, not just tea party groups. None of the tea party groups were denied tax-exempt status. While bellyaching about the supposed partisan nature of the IRS's evaluation of these groups, Issa asked IRS Inspector General J. Russell George to confine himself to looking solely at conservative and tea party groups in his internal investigation into what happened.

As for Issa's claims that he would tie the ""scandal"" to the White House? Bupkis.

At a breakfast organized by the Christian Science Monitor on Wednesday, senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer had sharp words for the ""investigation"":



""The allegation was, by many Republicans, that the White House was directing the IRS to target Tea Party groups,"" he said. ""That was the allegation. And that has turned out to be completely false. There is no evidence to suggest that. And now it has turned out that the IRS was not just targeting conservative groups but also looking at a large number of progressive groups as well. So that changes the dynamic of what it was.""

Issa warned us in November 2010, gloated actually, just before he became head of the House Oversight committee, that he would be overseeing seven investigatory hearings a week, 40 weeks a year. Many of those since then have been overblown, partisan affairs at best and cheap-shot smear jobs of President Obama at worst. All of it designed to capture the limelight.

Government should be held accountable. Scandals should be exposed. Reforms should be instituted where problems are uncovered. But using government authority and wasting taxpayer resources to launch baseless attacks for partisan gain and public attention are themselves deserving of some official probing. Perhaps Congressman Issa could focus that Klieg light he loves to wield in another direction—on himself."

President%27s budget plan leaves projected troop levels in place

Mandatory cuts%2C known as the sequestration%2C not included in budget

Army will drop to 490%2C000 troops and the Marines to 182%2C100 by 2017

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon budget proposed by President Obama on Wednesday will assume that the automatic spending cuts that started March 1 will end and will contain no long-term reductions in troop levels beyond those already in motion, according to congressional sources.

Three aides on Capitol Hill who are not authorized to speak on the record about the budget, which will be released Wednesday, said the Army and Marine Corps plan to continue to thin their ranks over the next five years to reach targets of 490,000 soldiers and 182,100 Marines.

The Army has about 560,000 active-duty personnel now, while the Marines have about 197,000. The reduction was set in motion last year to accommodate the $487 billion reduction in Pentagon spending over the next decade.

Military leaders, starting with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and his predecessor, Leon Panetta, said the sequestration cuts could hollow out the military and leave the nation unable to meet its defense needs. Hagel said last week that the Pentagon will have to make serious cuts in personnel and other programs if the sequester stays in effect.

Sequestration will require about $500 billion in cuts from the Pentagon, including about $40 billion this year.

""The president's budget will replace the sequester, which was designed to be bad policy for everyone,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday.

Republicans, who control the House, have criticized Obama's budget before its release. House Republicans have passed their own budget, which includes sequestration cuts for non-defense items and higher defense spending, while the Senate passed a Democratic plan last month that included $240 billion in spending cuts over 10 years but did not specify troop levels.

The budgets produced by the Republicans and Democrats are ""not to be believed,"" said Thomas Donnelly, a defense analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. There is little reason to believe sequestration will be solved soon, making it likely that steep cuts in troop levels will occur. Moreover, about 50,000 troops are funded by supplemental war-spending budgets that will diminish with the withdrawal from Afghanistan, he said.

""There was no other way to do this budget. What alternative to the previous plan could they come up with, in the time allotted, with ongoing White House-congressional negotiations and the possibility of continued GOP unwillingness to give on taxes?"" says Michael O'Hanlon, defense expert at the Brookings Institution.

Last year, Gen. Raymond Odierno, the Army chief of staff, said his service could remain ready to fight with 490,000 soldiers if it had several years to implement the change.

The Army dropped to a low of 479,000 soldiers in 1999, Pentagon records show, but increases caused by the demands of fighting simultaneous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan led Congress and the Bush administration to call for an increase that peaked at 566,000 soldiers in 2010.

The Marines bottomed out in 1950, the first year of the Korean War, 74,000 Marines. That number jumped to 193,000 the following year and has never dipped below 173,000 since then.

Since the end of World War II in 1945, the military has seen significant fluctuations in troop levels, Pentagon records show. The Army reached 1,596,000 soldiers in 1952 and 1,570,000 in 1968, the peak years for the wars in Korea and Vietnam. Between those wars, the Army bottomed out at 859,000 soldiers in 1961. The Army's post-Vietnam peak came last in 1987, when it had 781,000 soldiers, records show."

USA TODAY

Chris Christie and Hillary Rodham Clinton are the ""hottest politicians"" in the nation, according to one new poll.

The coldest: Congressional leaders from both parties.

Christie, the New Jersey governor and potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, rates 53.1 degrees on what Quinnipiac University calls its ""thermometer of voters attitudes towards the nation's major political figures.""

Clinton, the former secretary of State, senator, first lady and potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, is second at 52.1 degrees.

A surprising third place: First-year Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., at 49.2 degrees.

President Obama is in fourth at 47.6 degrees, tied with Sen. Kristen Gillibrand, D-N.Y.

""Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's score is not surprising given her lengthy political career and especially strong support among Democrats and women,"" said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.

He added: ""But Gov. Christopher Christie's rating is impressive given that his experience -- less than four years as governor -- pales compared to Mrs. Clinton' s résumé. What is interesting is that only two of the 22 figures rate better than the absolute middle of the scale, not exactly a ringing endorsement of the nation's political establishment.""

The four lowest rated politicians in this survey are all congressional leaders: Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi (38.4); Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell (37.5); Republican House Speaker John Boehner (36.7); and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid (33.8).

The Quinnipiac ""thermometer,"" as measured in degrees:

Gov. Christie - 53.1

Secretary Clinton - 52.1

Sen. Warren - 49.2

President Obama - 47.6

Sen. Gillibrand - 47.6

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas - 46.8

Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida - 46.5

Vice President Joseph Biden - 46.2

http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/19/national/class/MARRIAGE-FINAL.html,2005-05-19 00:00:00,['Tamar Lewin'],"When Richer Weds Poorer, Money Isn't the Only Difference","Still, the relationship moved quickly. Mr. Croteau met Ms. Woolner in the fall of 1998 and moved into her comfortable home in Northfield the next spring, after meeting her condition that he sell his gun.

Even before Mr. Croteau moved in, Ms. Woolner gave him money to buy a new car and pay off some debts. ""I wanted to give him the money,"" she said. ""I hadn't sweated it. I told him that this was money that had just come to me for being born into one class, while he was born into another class."" And when he lost his job not long after, Ms. Woolner began paying him a monthly stipend -- he sometimes refers to it as an allowance -- that continued, at a smaller level, until last November, when she quit her longstanding job at a local antipoverty agency. She also agreed to pay for a $10,000 computer course that helped prepare him for his current job as a software analyst at the Cheshire Medical Center in Keene. From the beginning, the balance of power in the relationship was a sufficiently touchy issue that at Ms. Woolner's urging, a few months before their wedding in August 2001, they joined a series of workshops on cross-class relationships.

""I had abject terror at the idea of the group,"" said Mr. Croteau, who is blunt and intellectually engaging. ""It's certainly an upper-class luxury to pay to tell someone your troubles, and with all the problems in the world, it felt a little strange to sit around talking about your relationship. But it was useful. It was a relief to hear people talk about the same kinds of issues we were facing, about who had power in the relationship and how they used it. I think we would have made it anyway, but we would have had a rockier time without the group.""

It is still accepted truth within the household that Ms. Woolner's status has given her the upper hand in the marriage. At dinner one night, when her son Isaac said baldly, ""I always think of my mom as having the power in the relationship,"" Mr. Croteau did not flinch. He is fully aware that in this relationship he is the one whose life has been most changed.

Confusing Differences

The Woolner-Croteau household is just up the hill from the groomed fields of Northfield Mount Hermon prep school -- a constant local reminder to Mr. Croteau of just how differently his wife's sons and his daughters have been educated. Jonah is now a senior there. Isaac, who also attended the school, is now back at Lewis & Clark College in Oregon after taking a couple of semesters away to study in India and to attend massage school while working in a deli near home.

By contrast, Mr. Croteau's adult daughters -- who have never lived with the couple -- made their way through the Keene public schools.

""I sometimes think Jonah and Isaac need a dose of reality, that a couple years in public school would have shown them something different,"" Mr. Croteau said. ""On the other hand I sometimes wish I'd been able to give Maggie and Lael what they had. My kids didn't have the same kind of privilege and the same kind of schools. They didn't have teachers concerned about their tender growing egos. It was catch-as-catch-can for them, and that still shows in their personalities."""

It went down in history as perhaps the most crass response to this horrible moment in American history.





PAT ROBERTSON: Jerry, that's my feeling. I think we've just seen the antechamber to terror. We haven't even begun to see what they can do to the major population. JERRY FALWELL: The ACLU's got to take a lot of blame for this. PAT ROBERTSON: Well, yes. JERRY FALWELL: And, I know that I'll hear from them for this. But, throwing God out successfully with the help of the federal court system, throwing God out of the public square, out of the schools. The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked. And when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we make God mad. I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way--all of them who have tried to secularize America--I point the finger in their face and say ""you helped this happen."" PAT ROBERTSON: Well, I totally concur, and the problem is we have adopted that agenda at the highest levels of our government. And so we're responsible as a free society for what the top people do. And, the top people, of course, is the court system. JERRY FALWELL: Pat, did you notice yesterday the ACLU, and all the Christ-haters, People For the American Way, NOW, etc. were totally disregarded by the Democrats and the Republicans in both houses of Congress as they went out on the steps and called out on to God in prayer and sang ""God Bless America"" and said ""let the ACLU be hanged""? In other words, when the nation is on its knees, the only normal and natural and spiritual thing to do is what we ought to be doing all the time--calling upon God. PAT ROBERTSON: Amen

Apparently Pat Robertson never learns a lesson, nor anything else for that matter. On today's anniversary of the September 11th attacks, Pat takes a moment to shift blame away from the dirty liberals and gays to place it squarely on the entirety of the 1.6 billion adherents to the Muslim faith.





I remember when George Bush came on after 9/11 and said ""Don't blame Islam. Islam is a religion of peace"" and I said he was not appointed as Chief Theologian he was appointed as Chief Executive and he doesn't know what he is talking about. Islam does not mean peace, it means submission. And it means submission to Mohammad and it means submission to Sharia, it means submission to the Koran and all the teaching and tenants of that faith. That's what Islam is all about. And they believe that anybody who doesn’t submit is at war with them and they are prime targets, and for the Western nations to welcome this fifth column into their midst is just committing suicide. The reason is they have lost their faith in God, they have lost their faith in Jesus Christ, they don’t believe in what the Bible says and the core values of our society have gone away. We’ve done it here in America, we’ve abolished prayer in the schools, we’ve taken out Bible-reading in the schools and little by little by little we’ve eroded the rights—we keep talking about separation and this that and the other. But here in the country we've still got a great core of people who believe in foundational values. And that's the hope of the next generation.

Um, Pat. These people are Muslim. You are quite right that they don't believe in the Bible as that is not their holy book. They didn't lose their faith in Jesus Christ because they never placed faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ, you are an idiot. You know why we keep talking about ""separation and this that and the other?"" It is because it was written explicitly into our Constitution to keep people like you from turning our country into a Theocracy. That's why.

While the rest of the thinking world remembers this day and those who perished as a sad event perpetrated by madmen, Pat Robertson sees it as an opportunity to further his agenda of hate, this time towards blameless people who's only fault lies in adhering to a faith different than his. It is as tiresome as it is effective with his audience.

Yes, I have hope for the next generation. I have hope that they will overcome hatred and bigotry against people that aren't like themselves.

http://news.yahoo.com/menendez-says-reimbursed-donor-2-jaunts-081746547--politics.html,,[],Menendez says he reimbursed donor for 2 jaunts,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Robert Menendez's office says he reimbursed a prominent Florida political donor $58,500 on Jan. 4 of this year for the full cost of two of three trips Menendez took on the donor's plane to the Dominican Republic in 2010.

More details about the New Jersey senator's trips emerged as his office said unsubstantiated allegations that the senator engaged in sex with prostitutes in the Dominican Republic are false.

There had been no public disclosure of the two trips until now.

""The senator paid for the two trips out of his personal account and no reporting requirements apply,"" Menendez spokeswoman Tricia Enright said Wednesday night.

The FBI searched the West Palm Beach, Fla., office of the donor — eye doctor Salomon Melgen — on Tuesday night and early Wednesday, but it was unclear if the raid was related to Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat. In addition the FBI agents, investigators with the U.S. Health and Human Services Department also were seen carting boxes out of the office.

A third trip by Menendez aboard Melgen's plane — a campaign fundraising journey to the donor's residence in the Dominican Republic — took place in May 2010. That trip was reported to the Federal Election Commission as a $5,400 expenditure by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which Menendez chaired. The trip, for fundraising from the community of Americans in the region, took Menendez to Puerto Rico as well as the Dominican Republic, said Menendez's office. The $5,400 was paid to one of Melgen's companies, Vitreo Retinal Consultants.

Menendez categorized the other two trips as personal. The first was Aug. 6-9, 2010, a round trip from South Florida to the Dominican Republic. The second was Sept. 3-6, 2010, from New Jersey to the Dominican Republic and back.

Menendez could have invoked what is known as a ""friendship exemption"" regarding the two personal trips, which would have required the senator to report the travel to the Senate Ethics Committee as a gift. Instead, Menendez chose to reimburse the full cost of the two trips.

Story continues

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., turned aside questions about Menendez at a news conference Thursday, saying they should be directed to the New Jersey Democrat instead. On Tuesday — before the disclosures about the FBI raid and the trips — he had expressed skepticism about the allegations, telling reporters to consider the source.

White House press secretary Jay Carney declined to answer when asked whether the president still has full faith and confidence in Menendez. ""I don't have anything for you on that,"" Carney told reporters Thursday.

The Daily Caller, a conservative website, reported shortly before the November election that Menendez traveled on Melgen's private plane to the Dominican Republic to engage in sex with prostitutes. Some New Jersey Republicans filed a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee last fall in the wake of the allegations by The Caller. In response, Menendez's staffers searched records for trips by the senator and found the two additional trips that hadn't been reimbursed.

On Tuesday, Menendez became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, succeeding Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.

At FBI headquarters in Washington, spokesman Jason Pack said the bureau ""cannot comment on the existence or status of an investigation."" Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler also declined to comment.

Records filed in Palm Beach County show an Internal Revenue Service lien against Melgen of more than $11.1 million for unpaid taxes from 2006-09. Prior liens for taxes from 1998 to 2002 were subsequently withdrawn, records show.

Menendez's office said the accusations of engaging with prostitutes ""are manufactured by a politically motivated right-wing blog and are false.""

Menendez's office said Melgen has been a friend and political supporter of the senator for many years and said the three trips Menendez took have been ""paid for and reported appropriately."" Menendez's office later changed the statement's wording to specify that the trips had been ""paid for or reported appropriately,"" correcting the misimpression that all three trips had been publicly disclosed.

The Daily Caller began publishing stories about Menendez and Melgen on Nov. 1, when it reported that two women from the Dominican Republic said Menendez paid them for sex earlier in 2012. Prostitution is legal in the Caribbean nation.

Melgen is involved in numerous businesses, all sharing the same address in West Palm Beach, according to records filed with the Department of State in Florida.

Late Tuesday and early Wednesday, FBI agents were seen inside the West Palm Beach building, walking its halls and standing beside shelves full of files.

Melgen is listed as having an ownership interest in DRM Med Assist, which Federal Aviation Administration records show is the owner of a CL-600 Challenger plane. Flight records for the aircraft were not immediately available.

Melgen, a registered Democrat, has made $193,350 in political contributions since 1998, including $14,200 to Menendez, according to Federal Election Commission records. Menendez was chairman of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, which raises money for Democratic Senate candidates, from 2009-11.

Menendez, a lawyer, is a former mayor of Union City, N.J., and also served in the New Jersey state General Assembly and the New Jersey state Senate. He is divorced and has two children.

Melgen, 58, is a native of the Dominican Republic, where he earned his medical degree from the Universidad Nacional Pedro Henríquez Ureña in 1978. He has lived in the U.S. since at least 1980, holding an internship, residency and fellowship at hospitals in Connecticut, Missouri and Massachusetts, according to records filed with the Florida Department of Health.

Melgen has been licensed to practice in Florida since 1986 and purchased the West Palm Beach plot of land where he built his main office in 1991. Over the years, Melgen has become regarded as a top ophthalmologist, speaking at conferences and even operating on then-Gov. Lawton Chiles in 1997. The governor later appointed Melgen to a state panel on HMOs.

Calls to Melgen's offices Wednesday were forwarded to an answering service where receptionists told callers to try back Thursday. Calls to Melgen's home in North Palm Beach, which is appraised at $2.1 million, went unanswered.

On the website for his medical practice, Melgen writes: ""I am always asked what sets me apart from most other doctors, and I would have to say that I do not consider myself to be a 'cookbook' physician. My patients are my number one priority, and when I am looking to treat a diagnosis I try to look at all the data at hand and extrapolate the best treatment instead of solely adhering to what the current 'standard' of treatment may be.""

Recent tongue-in-cheek political science research shows there might actually be one.

Sunny The First Puppy

On Monday, the Obama administration announced the addition of Sunny, a second Portuguese Water Dog, to their family.

The whole issue of dogs and politics got a boost in the 2012 presidential election, when researchers and pundits debated the significance of stories about Mitt Romney’s adventure with his dog.

Romney drove 12 hours in 1983 with his dog, Seamus, on top of the family’s car in a dog carrier. When his opponent, President Barack Obama, joked about the incident, the political fur flew.

Related Story: Dog issues nothing new for presidential candidates

But the flap also brought to the public’s attention a July 2012 article in the journal Political Science and Politics, where researchers said the White House has used pets since the 1960s as public relations props during times of political scandal and international tension.

The researchers said more study has to be done on the topic, but called it a groundbreaking “contribution to a research program that will bring the dog into political analysis.”

The Washington Post’s Sarah Kliff broke down the research report about the timing of public appearances made by White House pets.

“They tend to get trotted out during times of international conflict and presidential scandal (no similar effect, it’s worth noting, was found for cats). Conversely, they tend to stay out of sight during tough economic times,” she said.

In an effort to maintain full disclosure, the journal did acknowledge that one of the study’s four authors owned a Portuguese Water Dog. The study is also notable for probably the most use of puns about pets ever in a research paper.

“We present a theoretical framework and statistical evidence to explore the conditions under which presidents are most likely to trot out their four-legged friends. We show that presidents carefully gauge the best and worst times to conduct a dog and pony show. In times of war or scandal, dogs are welcome public companions, but not so in periods of economic hardship,” said the authors.

Story continues

“In short, we find significant support for Harry Truman’s famous adage that ‘if you want a friend in Washington, get a dog,’” even if it is occasionally necessary to confine it to the doghouse,” they said.

To test their hypotheses, the researchers built a new data set of mentions of presidential pets between January 1961 and January 2011 in the Washington Post and the New York Times, and correlated them to major news events.

“When inserting public approval in the model, scandal, war, and the economic indicators remain significant variables and signed in the predicted direction,” they said.

The translation: the White House lets the dogs out in times of scandal and war, and sends them back to the doghouse when the economic going is tough.

They also pegged the public appearance of pets to about 50 events from the initial Watergate revelations in the Nixon administration to the Scooter Libby indictment in the George W. Bush administration.

For now, it’s unclear what role Sunny will play as a sidekick to Bo, the Obama’s other dog.

But the Obama administration faces plenty of public issues that might lead some dog-conspiracy theorists to claim the Sunny is just another diversion.

In its official press statement about Sunny, the White House said it expected Bo to be a good big brother to Sunny and that the puppy was expected to spend time in the Oval Office with the President.

Scott Bomboy is the editor-in-chief of the National Constitution Center.

She said the “arrogant” church of government does not have “faith in your ability to govern yourself,” so “you should not have faith in it” because “it does not have faith in us.”

Speaking at an Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition dinner, Palin said “enough is enough” of the “politically-correct police out there” and blasted the scrooges waging a “War on Christmas.”

Palin said Americans needed to take action to resist the “fundamental transformation” of society that many Americans “never signed up for.” Echoing themes from her book, Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas, which comes out on Tuesday, Palin said that “religious freedom is under attack,” and religion is “pushed out of the public square” and “censored.” Palin said one will see the censorship and double standards “blatantly come this holiday season.”

She said that the war on Christmas sounds like an oxymoron but it is real, “a symptom of a bigger issue,” and “just the tip of the spear in a larger battle.”

Palin then noted that the “scrooges who are too enlightened for religion” have a very “zealot-like faith in the church of big government.”

“What’s that done for you lately?” Palin asked.

She said the “church of big government” is run by the supposed “best and the brightest,” and she slammed the recent National Security Agency spying scandals, the barricading of the World War II Monument during the partial government shutdown, and the recent failures of Obamacare, which she said was the church of big government’s “crowning achievement” to date.

She blasted the “best and the brightest” in the Obama administration for believing “hicks in flyover country” or “hockey moms in Alaska” do not know what health insurance plans are best for their families or cannot run their own lives without government interference.

Palin also said the “lapdog media” allow the “best and the brightest” in the church of big government to “get away” with lies and bad policies, which has caused “irreparable damage” to the country.

She said under the “church of big government,” there have been “shuttered businesses and cities” and “poverty has gone up,” while a “record number of Americans are giving up and no longer bothering to look for work.”

“Where has that gotten you?” Palin asked.

She then blasted “immoral and unscrupulous” leaders who “ignore the Constitution in favor of their fundamental transformation agenda” while “enriching themselves and their cronies while their nation goes bankrupt… that’s dictatorship.”"

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/06/jodi-arias-verdict-prediction_n_2855214.html,2013-05-06 00:00:00,['Senior Crime Reporter'],Jodi Arias Guilty Or Not Guilty Of Murder? You Be The 13th Juror (VOTE),"PHOENIX -- For more than four months, they listened to endless hours of testimony in the case of State of Arizona v. Jodi Arias. On Friday, the lawyers and witnesses finally stopped talking, and the case was turned over to the 12 jurors.

Now it is up to those dozen men and women -- some in their 20s, others well into retirement age -- to determine Arias' level of guilt or innocence.

As to which side, defense or prosecution, did a more persuasive job, the jury may have already tipped its hand.

On days 28 and 29 of the trial, jurors submitted more than 100 questions to Arias that suggested they were skeptical of her testimony, delivered over two highly emotional weeks. Arizona is one of only three states that allow jurors to ask witnesses questions. Panel members submit their queries to the judge, who reads them to the witnesses.

In her testimony, Arias gave highly detailed descriptions of her sex life with Travis Alexander, the former boyfriend she killed. She claimed that he became increasingly demanding and abusive, and that she feared for her life. The prosecution argued that she murdered Alexander in a jealous rage.

One juror asked, ""After all the lies you have told, why should we believe you now?""

Indeed, Arias changed her story several times. At first, she vehemently denied any involvement in the death of Alexander, whose body was discovered June 9, 2008, at his Mesa, Ariz., home. Alexander had been shot in the head and stabbed 27 times. His throat had been cut from ear to ear.

When DNA proved Arias had been there, she then claimed that she and Alexander had been attacked by two masked killers in a home invasion. She said she didn't go to the police because she was still in fear of them.

It was not until years after his death that she admitted to killing Alexander in what she said was an act of self-defense.

""Lying isn't typically something I just do,"" Arias told the court. ""The lies I've told in this case can be tied directly back to either protecting Travis' reputation or my involvement in his death ... because I was very ashamed.""

The defense team has attacked Alexander's character in an attempt to show he was a sex-obsessed womanizer who masturbated to photos of little boys.

Although accusations of abuse and pedophilia can prove detrimental, the defense in this case has one problem: All such allegations came from one source -- Arias, an admitted liar who is on trial for her life.

The prosecutors seemed to have an easier time. Although they did not have a murder weapon, they did have a motive, contending Arias was consumed with jealousy, and they had Arias' confession to the slaying. For a first-degree murder charge to stick, however, jurors will have to conclude that she acted with premeditation.

The defense had to try to explain why someone acting in self-defense would stab her assailant multiple times, shoot him and cut his throat. That challenge was compounded by the fact that Arias claimed memory loss covering much of the day that Alexander was killed.

The prosecution, meanwhile, argued that she made attempts to clean up the crime scene and disposed of the handgun used in the shooting.

Other issues likely to come up in the jury room:

THE CUTS: There were cuts on Arias' fingers. She said she nicked herself at work when she broke a glass. Prosecutors alleged those lacerations came while knifing Alexander. A blood-covered knife typically becomes slippery and slides through the hand of the person wielding it, often resulting in wounds.

THE FINGER: Arias had a broken and disfigured finger. She said it happened months prior to Alexander's death and was a result of his physical abuse. Prosecutors allege she hurt herself during the killing, and that's why the injury is not visible in photos shown to the jurors that were taken after she claimed the injury occurred.

GAS CANS: Arias took two gas cans with her and purchased a third when she went on her final road trip to visit Alexander. Arias testified the cans were a precautionary measure, so she would not run out of fuel while traveling through the desert. Prosecutors said she had them so she would not have to make fuel purchases that could tie her to the area. Arias said she returned one can to Walmart and received a cash refund without a receipt. Prosecutors said the exchange never occurred and presented a Walmart employee who testified there was no record of the transaction.

THE GUN: Prior to Alexander's killing, a .25-caliber handgun was stolen from Arias' grandparents' home. Alexander was killed with a .25-caliber firearm, but Arias claimed it was Alexander's own gun, despite the lack of evidence that he had ever owned a firearm.

What is bizarre about some of Arias' claims is that they are irrelevant in the grand scheme. Once she admitted she had killed Alexander, why argue about some of these little things? In the case of her finger, Arias' version of events was an attempt to show prior domestic abuse, but it might have served her better if she had played it differently. As for the gas can, what was the point in saying she'd returned one and then being contradicted by a witness?

It is all these details that Arias has woven into her story that could ultimately be her undoing.

Although the prosecution appears to be ahead, anything is possible. Prosecutors must prove their case, after all. Many trial watchers were convinced Casey Anthony would be found guilty of murdering her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, but the jury held otherwise.

Nothing is certain until the moment the verdict is read, and in a death penalty case such as this, it could take a jury several days to weigh each factor."

The commissaries are grocery stores that offer food and other necessities at a discount to members of the military, their families and veterans. But as Congress tightens the purse strings, the stores could get caught in the budget battle.

Budget cutters say they don't yet know how much money the plan would save, but there are 178 commissaries in the United States -- and 70 overseas -- which receive a total of $1.4 billion in government funds.

The Defense Commissary Agency, responsible for administering all commissaries worldwide, says military families and retirees save an average of more than 30 percent on their grocery bills compared with those who shop at regular retail stores. The agency says those savings amount to thousands of dollars annually per family.

But families could also lose jobs if the stores close. Thirty percent of the employees at the commissaries are military spouses. The director of the Defense Commissary Agency says that they have already cut their budget by $700 million since 1993.

More On This...

Other military services -- including the Pentagon Channel and Stars and Stripes newspaper -- may also face cuts, along with Armed Forces Radio and Television, which broadcasts football games and news for service members overseas. Stars and Stripes, an independently edited military newspaper, has been around since the Civil War and has over 200,000 daily readers. It collects just $7.8 million a year in government subsidies. To put this number in perspective, the U.S. spent $135 million in fuel for the Afghan military this year -- part of the $4 billion the nation budgeted to support the entire Afghan military this year.

Defense officials say none of these cuts have been made yet and no final decision has been reached. But, according to Pentagon Spokesman Col. Steve Warren, ""everything has to be on the table.""

Still, Warren said: ""No commissaries have closed. No commissaries are about to close. As with every other program that's out there, we're taking a look at how we can save money. We're just taking a look. No one's decided to do anything.""

Any cuts to military benefits would ultimately have to be approved and passed by Congress.

Patrons offered mixed opinions about the proposed changes.

Officials at Joint Base Myer Henderson Hall in Arlington, Va., would not allow Fox News to interview shoppers at the on-post commissary, but passersby spoke to Fox News outside the Pentagon.

""I definitely think it's a bad thing to take away the commissaries, because that's a benefit that a lot of soldiers and family members utilize."" said Sgt Major Steven Scott. Scott said it's not only about lower costs, but it's also a matter of convenience for families who are able to shop on post.

Others who take advantage of the benefit, like Joseph Shubert, say it's a better option for cutting than some of the alternatives.

""I don't like it, but I understand that choices have to be made,"" Shubert said. ""So, if it's this or, say, cutting our retirement paychecks or things like that, you know one way or another I think this is one of the least bad options."""

Not clear what Schmidt hopes to accomplish in North Korea

Visit not seen as 'helpful' by State Department

LONDON -- Google chairman Eric Schmidt arrived in North Korea on Monday for what his delegation called a private visit aimed at gaining a first-hand look at the communist nation's economy and social media.

Schmidt is visiting the East Asia nation with former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, who is a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

Speaking in Beijing ahead of the flight to Pyongyang, Richardson described the visit as ""a private humanitarian mission."" The former governor, who has visited North Korea several times over the past 20 years, is expected to try to discuss the case of a U.S. citizen jailed in the country.

But Schmidt's participation in the trip is seen as more controversial and he has drawn criticism from some quarters, including the U.S. State Department, because the visit comes only weeks after North Korea launched a long-range rocket. The visit has also prompted speculation about what the businessman hopes to accomplish in the reclusive nation.

""We don't think the timing of the visit is helpful, and they are well aware of our views,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said.

When Richardson and Schmidt return, State Department officials may be interested in talking to them about the visit, Nuland said. ""We are always open to hear from Americans who've been to North Korea,"" she said.

Schmidt, a staunch proponent of Internet connectivity and openness, is expected to make a donation during the visit, while Richardson will try to discuss the detainment of a U.S. citizen jailed in Pyongyang, the Associated Press reported, citing members of the delegation who asked not to be named because the trip was a private visit.

In Beijing, Richardson said, ""This is not a Google trip, but I'm sure he's [Schmidt] interested in some of the economic issues there, the social media aspect. So this is why we are teamed up on this.""

Jared Cohen, director of Google Ideas, is also on the trip.

Actual improvements to Senate rules are coming out of this. We didn't get the big ones we were looking for—the real talking filibuster and flipping the burden—but we are not coming away empty-handed. It's now going to be easier to confirm judicial nominees, harder to kill legislation just by wasting time, there will be fewer points in the legislative process for hostage taking, and secret holds are gone forever.

We got Mitch McConnell to cave under duress. We got Mitch McConnell to agree to these changes because he was afraid that otherwise we would get even more. In other words, we got Senate Republicans to cave. That almost never happens on anything, but we just pulled it off. That is just hugely impressive.

We helped trigger the construction of a huge new advocacy coalition. We only got #2 to happen because there are now two coalitions (see here and here) advocating for real filibuster reform. This is pretty amazing, given that back in 2010 the first ""coalition"" meeting on filibuster reform consisted entirely of myself, David Waldman, and Darcy Burner. In short, while it wasn't long ago that filibuster reform was just bathrobe-wearing, Cheetos-munching, DFH blogger silliness, now it's the mainstream center-left position.

We are getting stronger. When we attempted filibuster reform two years ago, all we got was a ""gentleman's agreement"" between Reid and McConnell that accomplished exactly nothing. That's because two years ago we weren't powerful enough to scare McConnell into agreeing even to watered down reform. Now we are, and momentum is on our side.

The Daily Kos community played a foundational role in every step of this process. In the earliest days, we were the incubators of the idea that there should even be filibuster reform. Later on, we were instrumental in helping determine what specific reforms were needed, and also in bringing progressive groups together to push for these reforms. The rest of the way, as both a widely read blog and a grassroots activist community, we were essential in making sure filibuster reform was noticed by the public, the media and elected officials.

In short, we made change happen from scratch—how awesome is that? Further, every two years we will get another chance to build on these accomplishments, and the momentum for additional reform is unquestionably on our side.

I hope all 211,000 of you who took part in this fight feel excited and proud today, because in addition to being grateful to each and every one of you, that is exactly how I feel. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"

Story highlights NEW: Thomas covered White House with ""intensity and tenacity,"" Clintons say Thomas will be buried in Detroit She was a trailblazer on the White House press corps Her retirement in 2010 came amid controversy

(CNN) —

Trailblazing White House journalist Helen Thomas has died at age 92 after a long illness, sources told CNN Saturday.

Thomas covered 10 presidents over nearly half a century, and became a legend in the industry.

She was a fixture at White House news conferences – sitting front and center late in her career – where she frequently exasperated government spokesmen with her pointed questions.

Thomas began covering the White House for United Press International when John F. Kennedy became president in 1961 and was a fixture there until her retirement in 2010.

She was considered the dean of the White House press corps because she was the longest-serving White House journalist.

Thomas will be buried in Detroit, and a memorial service is planned in Washington in October, according to her family.

President Barack Obama said that it was “not just the length of her tenure, but her fierce belief that our democracy works best when we ask tough questions and hold our leaders to account,” that put her in high esteem.

In a written statement, Obama called Thomas a “true pioneer” and said she kept the presidents she covered – including himself – on their toes.

“Helen was just a living inspiration”

Her career, however, came to an end under a cloud of controversy.

Thomas, then working for the media conglomerate Hearst as a syndicated columnist, was blasted for comments she made regarding Jewish people.

In 2010, a YouTube video surfaced showing her saying that Israel should “get the hell out of Palestine,” and that the Jewish people should go home to “Poland, Germany … and America and everywhere else.”

Thomas apologized for her remarks, writing, “They do not reflect my heartfelt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance. May that day come soon.”

She announced her retirement one week later.

In 2012, Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi presented Thomas with an award.

She was a mentor to young journalists

Helen Thomas: Fast Facts

Thomas, the daughter of Lebanese immigrants, was born in Winchester, Kentucky, on August 4, 1920. She was one of nine children. Thomas was raised in Detroit, where she attended Wayne State University and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in 1942.

In October 1971, Thomas married Douglas Cornell; he died in 1982.

She wrote three books: “Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times” (1999); “Thanks for the Memories Mr. President: Wit and Wisdom from the Front Row at the White House” (2002); and “Watchdogs of Democracy? The Waning Washington Press Corps and How it Has Failed the Public” (2006).

Share your memories

In describing her job, Thomas once said, “I’ve never covered the president in any way other than that he is ultimately responsible.”

Along the way, she broke some barriers by becoming the first female president of the prestigious White House Correspondents’ Association and Washington’s Gridiron Club.

“I hope there are many women following me right in this same spot,” she said. Well into her 80s, she was a mentor to many young journalists.

Thomas left UPI in May 2000, when the wire service was sold to a company controlled by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the Korean founder and leader of the worldwide Unification Church.

Two months later, Hearst News Service hired her as a syndicated columnist, and she returned to the White House for fodder for her columns.

Former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, recalled Thomas’ “tough-minded dedication.”

“Helen was a pioneering journalist who, while adding more than her share of cracks to the glass ceiling, never failed to bring intensity and tenacity to her White House beat,” the Clintons said in a statement.

“… Her work was extraordinary because of her intelligence, her lively spirit and great sense of humor, and most importantly her commitment to the role of a strong press in a healthy democracy.”

No question seemed off-limits

Colleagues remember her as a genuinely fearless woman who asked the toughest questions of presidents, no matter their party.

In January 2009, as President George Bush was preparing to leave office, Thomas aimed her editorial guns at him and his administration.

Among her criticisms: that before the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, administration officials ignored “significant early warnings of an imminent strike against the U.S.”

Journalists remember Helen Thomas

In a commentary, she slammed Bush for what she considered his failings, including leading the country “into a senseless war against Iraq, a calamity still under way as he leaves office almost six years after the invasion.”

She considered him “the worst president ever.”

Thomas embraced the freedoms of a columnist with vigor.

“I censored myself for 50 years when I was a reporter,” Thomas told an audience at the Massachusetts of Technology (MIT) in late 2002. “Now I wake up and ask myself, ‘Who do I hate today?’”

One afternoon in October 2009, she targeted President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, during the daily briefing.

Health care reform was being debated at the time, and Thomas asked Gibbs every day whether a public option would be part of the package.

In the back-and-forth that ensued, Thomas said that she already had reached a conclusion but could not get a straight answer from the presidential spokesman.

“Then why do you keep asking me?” Gibbs inquired.

“Because I want your conscience to bother you,” Thomas replied.

The room broke into laughter as Gibbs turned red.

Several of the court’s more liberal justices sounded doubtful about a state law that imposes requirements beyond those called for by a federal law.

“Many people don’t have the documents that Arizona requires,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.

The Arizona law, enacted in 2004 by a ballot initiative, requires prospective voters to prove that they are citizens by submitting copies of or information concerning various documents, including birth certificates, passports, naturalization papers or Arizona driver’s licenses, which are available only to people who are in the state lawfully.

The question for the justices was whether that state law conflicted with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which allows voters to register using a federal form that asks, “Are you a citizen of the United States?” Prospective voters must check a box yes or no, and they must sign the form, swearing that they are citizens under penalty of perjury."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/11/john-boehner-budget-deal_n_4425979.html,2013-12-11 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']",John Boehner Slams Conservative Groups For 'Using' Lawmakers And The American People,"WASHINGTON -- House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) took a hard swing Wednesday at conservative groups opposing the newly announced bipartisan budget deal.

""You mean the groups that came out and opposed it before they ever saw it?"" he said in a response to a reporter's question.

Before the deal was even announced on Tuesday, Heritage Action and Americans For Prosperity stated their opposition to it. Following the announcement, Club For Growth said it would oppose the deal and include it on its congressional scorecard.

""They're using our members and they're using the American people for their own goals. This is ridiculous,"" Boehner said loudly. ""Listen, if you're for more deficit reduction, you're for this agreement.""

The deal reached by House Budget Chair Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Budget Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.) modestly raises spending levels from $967 billion to $1.014 trillion by 2015, counteracting approximately one-third of sequestration cuts. It also reduces the deficit by $20 to $23 billion by hiking airline fees and requiring federal workers and military personnel to kick in more for their pensions.

Boehner's tone toward the conservative groups was unusually aggressive, a further signal that he wants the deal to pass the House Republican caucus, where the groups hold sway among members.

Levi Russell, Director of Public Affairs for Americans For Prosperity, responded to Boehner's comments. ""AFP stood with House Republicans earlier this spring when they passed modest spending limits set by the sequester,"" Russell said. ""That bipartisan agreement was signed by President Obama and set spending levels at $967 billion. It’s disappointing to see leadership give up even those modest gains with nothing to show for it.""

“Americans are deeply concerned about the direction of the country. Over the next few days, lawmakers will have to explain to their constituents, many of whom are our members, what they’ve achieved by increasing spending, increasing taxes and offering up another round of promises waiting to be broken. That will be a really tough sell back home,"" said Dan Holler, communications director for Heritage Action.

Club For Growth released a statement as well. ""We stand with Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Tom Coburn, Rand Paul, members of the Republican Study Committee and every other fiscal conservative who opposes the Ryan-Murray deal,” said the group's president, Chris Chocola. “After carefully reviewing the budget deal, on which we never commented until it was complete, we determined that it would increase the size of government. We support pro-growth proposals when they are considered by Congress. In our evaluation, this isn’t one of those.”"

An article from the radical website DreamActivist.org will give you a quick lesson on how to lie about your status. It’s all part of the aggressive pro-illegal immigration ‘Dreamer movement’ that is leading the fight for “comprehensive” immigration reform, with a boost from President Barack Obama and many in Congress.

The “Dreamers” are illegal immigrants who were brought into the country by their parents. They’ve become the darlings of the media, garnering both positive press and an executive order by President Obama in 2012, offering them legal status if they met certain requirements and paid a $465 fee. Even that controversial end-run around Congress, however, wasn’t enough for the Dream activists as they pursued an agenda that rejects the idea of borders and deportation entirely.

The theatrical direct-actions of the Dreamers have intensified in recent months, including the ‘Dream 9’ activists who went to Mexico and then came back into the United States using an asylum claim. The avowed and proud illegal immigrants have used in-your-face social justice tactics for years, however, showing a dedication and a long-term view that opponents of amnesty would do well to note.

The Dreamer movement has been pushing the edge of the envelope in both their goals and tactics. They are gaining ground. The ACLU recently called Dreamers ‘the face of immigration reform movement’ and wrote:

But as important as their stories have been to the immigration reform movement, we can’t lose sight of the critical organizing DREAMers have been engaged in for years, pushing not only for the DREAM Act, but also for creating an environment where voices as disparate as Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) can vote “Yes” to move sweeping immigration reform legislation out of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

So, what sort of enviroment have they created? An example of the Dreamers long-term animosity towards any enforcement of immigration laws is a 2009 article on the DreamActivist.org site entitled Particulars and Universals #3: Tips on How to Lie Successfully.

The anonymous author of the article doesn’t see a problem with the fact that illegal immigrants are violating the law. The problem is they aren’t good at lying.

…many undocumented youths conceal their immigration status when faced with potentially awkward questions, but the problem is that they absolutely suck at it. When faced with an instance in which they have to lie, they come up with a myriad of half-hearted excuses that they think up on the spot.



In order to help solve the “problem” of bad lying, the Dream Activist site gives a few tips on lying more effectively. Tip #1 is ‘Think up a lie beforehand’, while Tip #3 is ‘Be consistent.’

Create lies that are close to the truth and easy to keep track of. Think up lies that you know you can be absolutely consistent about. Write them down in a notepad if you must.

The article also suggests that illegal immigrants can ‘pretend that you’re an international student who has been taking public education in the U.S. since elementary school.’

The article stresses ‘this post is for tips on how to lie only to your friends and acquaintances’ and suggests never lying to officials ‘in writing’ but also says:

I’d like to take a moment here and stress that not lying does not mean having to reveal the truth. You have the right to remain silent. In fact, do not confess that you’re undocumented if you’re approached by immigration officials; know your rights.

The author also says “I know that it’s a bit corruptive to give young people tips on how to lie well” but they justify it immediately by saying that illegal immigrants understandably want to lie so they don’t ‘feel very dispirited.’

Next step, fake emergency rooms.

California Republicans are desperate and shameless. In the past two weeks, GOP Assembly members have sent mailings out on what appears to be the state's dime to their constituents about health insurance. Only, they don't direct those people to CoveredCA.com to sign up. Instead, they send them to their own astroturf version with the url CoveringHealthCareCA.com. On their version, there are links to negative articles and twisted messages intended to sour people on signing up for health insurance before they ever land at the official health exchange site.

If you click on the ""Don't have health insurance"" tab on the front page, you're taken to a page that puts all the focus on the penalty and none on the benefits. In fact, they have a ""penalty calculator"" on that page, rather than a premium calculator.

Republicans are horrible people. Period. A fake health care site. A fake health care site intended to discourage the people on their own mailing lists from getting health insurance because fuck them, that's why.Other bits of logic include explaining to young people that by getting insurance they'll be subsidizing sick people, the goddamn leeching bastards. (On the other hand, if you cannot grasp that the central point of all insurance is pooling a little money from a large group of people in order to insure some level of security for those people in the pool that have something very bad happen to them, including for example you, perhaps removing you from the gene pool is not entirely a bad thing. If you are so nasty a person that you can't live with the thought of insuring yourself because it means some other person might get healthcare using one one hundredth of a cent of your money, the world will certainly not be missing you much after you are gone. Godspeed!)

This is yet another of the reasons the current incarnation of the Republican Party is little more than a political oozing sore. There is probably a downside to trying to kill off your own voters to score a momentary political point, but let's just say the members of the party brain trust in my state could meet in a closet and still have enough room for the vacuum and boxes of Christmas decorations."

William Swenson receives Medal of Honor at White House,"The Battle of Ganjgal remains one of the deadliest in the Afghan war.

This is his story. (The Washington Post)

The Battle of Ganjgal remains one of the deadliest in the Afghan war. Yet William Swenson, a former captain in the U.S. Army, managed to help fend off an onslaught of insurgents, saved lives, coordinated a rescue, and braved gunfire to retrieve fallen soldiers. This is his story. (The Washington Post)

It was a tender moment that demonstrated the brotherhood of the U.S. servicemen who fought for their lives in a remote Afghanistan province four years ago. In the heat of battle, Army Capt. William Swenson leaned in and kissed the head of a severely wounded comrade while loading him into an evacuation helicopter.

On Tuesday, President Obama cited that moment — captured in a video taken by a medevac crewman — as he presented Swenson, 34, with the Medal of Honor for heroic service in the Ganjgal valley in eastern Afghanistan. Swenson, who has since left the military, is credited with risking his life to help save other U.S. troops and Afghan allies and retrieve the bodies of four Americans who were killed Sept. 8, 2009.

“Amidst the whipping wind and the deafening roar of the helicopter blades, he does something unexpected. He leans in and kisses the wounded soldier on the head — a simple act of compassion and loyalty to a brother in arms,” Obama said of Swenson during a ceremony attended by 250 guests, including Vice President Biden, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, first lady Michelle Obama and several previous medal recipients.

Obama said that the nation has awarded the Medal of Honor, its highest military decoration, nearly 3,500 times, and that the video of Swenson “may be the first time that we can actually bear witness to a small fraction of those actions for ourselves.”

Swenson, who lives in Seattle, did not speak during the White House ceremony. Afterward, an Army spokesman confirmed that Swenson had asked to return to active duty more than two years after he left the service. “We are currently reviewing his request and processing it within established policy,” said the spokesman, George Wright. Swenson would have to undergo a routine drug test and background check.

Oct. 15, 2013 U.S. Army Capt. William Swenson bows his head for a prayer during his Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House. Swenson, 34, was honored for his service during a September 2009 battle in the Ganjgal Valley in eastern Afghanistan. Bill O’Leary/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

A return to active service would be a remarkable turnabout.

Swenson’s path to the White House ceremony was a rocky one . After he criticized his Army superiors, saying they failed to provide enough air and artillery support during the 2009 engagement, his medal nomination was delayed for years. Amy officials said his nomination packet was lost in a computer system for 19 months.

Swenson became the second service member to be awarded the Medal of Honor for the Ganjgal battle. The other recipient, former Marine Cpl. Dakota Meyer, who accepted the award in 2011, was not in attendance Tuesday. Swenson has expressed skepticism about the accuracy of Meyer’s account of the battle.

Two other Marines — Ademola Fabayo and Juan Rodriguez-Chavez, who helped Swenson and Meyer in the rescue effort — attended Tuesday’s ceremony. They both have received the Navy Cross for their actions.

During an interview with The Washington Post, Swenson said he would accept the medal to honor fellow soldiers and Marines and the family members of those who died. “It does not really belong to me; it belongs to that event and the people I stood with,” he said of the medal.

In the interview, he said he had no memory of kissing the head of Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth Westbrook, who had been shot in the cheek and shoulder, until he saw the video this year.“You could have told me it happened, and I wouldn’t have believed you,” he said. “But it did, and it was captured on film. And it offered a glimpse of the humanity that does occur on battlefields.”

Westbrook, the father of three, died about a month after the battle of complications from a blood transfusion. His wife, Charlene Westbrook, was in the audience at the White House on Tuesday. “Charlene will always be grateful for the final days she was able to spend with her husband,” Obama said.

Swenson and Westbrook had been working for a year as embedded trainers with the Afghan Border Police in Kunar province in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistani border. They were trying to prepare the Afghan forces to patrol remote tribal areas often teeming with insurgents and beyond the control of the Afghan national government.

On the day of the battle, about 11 U.S. trainers and 80 Afghan troops set out to meet with town elders. As soon as they reached the valley, they were ambushed by Taliban fighters hidden on the higher terrain that ringed the valley on three sides. Five Americans, 10 Afghan troops and an Afghan interpreter were slain.

Looking back on his last moments with Westbrook, Swenson said of the video: “To see him and to see me in that situation gives me comfort. . . . I would trade anything for that not to be our last moment, but that was our last moment, and I’ll always have that now.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/ark-governor-didnt-know-fugitives-health-231713310.html,,[],Ark. governor didn't know about fugitive's health,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe on Wednesday defended his request to have a 63-year-old fugitive returned from Michigan, even though the convicted killer is in poor health.

Beebe told The Associated Press he wasn't aware of Lester Stiggers' health issues when he sought to have him brought back to the Arkansas prison system he fled in 1970.

""We can't pick and choose which laws that we like and which laws that we don't like,"" Beebe told the AP. ""And once the Department of Correction was given information about his whereabouts, and ... they requested me to sign an extradition warrant, then that's my duty and that's the law and that's what we did.""

Stiggers was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison for killing his father as a teenager in 1965. When he was granted a five-day leave from prison for good behavior, he headed to Michigan, where his mother lived. He's been there ever since — thanks to a governor who, in 1971, refused to send him back to Arkansas and its then-notorious prison system.

The AP recently found Stiggers living in a one-bedroom apartment along a busy road in the Detroit suburb of Warren, Mich. He gets by on $700 a month in Social Security benefits, usually making trips outside only to see a doctor. He needs an inhaler and 10 pills a day for his diabetes, high blood pressure and other ailments. A stocky man with thick arms, Stiggers grappled with sewer lines as a plumber until two strokes ended his working days and made his speech difficult to understand.

He was astounded to learn that Arkansas has renewed its efforts to bring him back to prison — more than four decades after then-Gov. William Milliken blocked the state's initial request.

Beebe, a Democrat, sent a letter this year to Republican Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, seeking Stiggers after his Social Security benefits put him back on Arkansas' radar.

State prison officials said they didn't know that Stiggers was sick, either. But Department of Correction spokeswoman Shea Wilson told the AP that it's not the agency's role to make judgments about whether Stiggers should be brought back to Arkansas.

Story continues

""It's our job to carry out the mandates of the court,"" Wilson said. ""And that's simply what we're doing in our efforts to seek him.""

Sara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Snyder, said the matter was still under review and ""there's not currently a timeframe for when that may be concluded.""

The half-million-dollar tab was doled out to three firms that assisted the administration and UNC trustees in dealing with negative media attention. The PR help included tweaks to op-eds and running UNC-Chapel Hill Chancellor Holden Thorp through a four-hour session to prepare for questions he'd likely face from reporters. The News & Observer reports that the bill will be paid by UNC's privately funded foundation.

The majority of the money -- $367,000 -- went to The Fleishman-Hillard firm. Another $144,000 went to political consultant Doug Sosnik and $20,000 went to Sheehan Associates.

The News & Observer obtained the correspondence through an open records request, which also revealed a series of communications between UNC administrators and faculty involved in the academic fraud scandal.

The academic scandal involved courses being offered as ""paper"" classes that did not require attendance, and a number of unauthorized grade changes, the majority of which involved student athletes. It prompted several investigations, including those by former North Carolina Gov. James G. Martin, the National Association of Academic Advisors for Athletics and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

As a consequence of the scandal Thorp resigned and Bruce Carney left his post as executive vice chancellor and provost.

UNC's bill tops what Florida State University spent for its own academic fraud scandal: $300,000 between 2007 and 2010.

But as large as UNC's bill is for PR advice, it's nothing compared to the $2.3 million Rutgers University has already spent due to the scandal involving former basketball head coach Mike Rice.

Both Rutgers and UNC's costs are dwarfed by the $100 million (or more) in costs due to penalties, fees and lost revenue that Penn State University faces in the wake of Jerry Sandusky's sex crimes."

Thomas Perez would replace Hilda Solis

Perez heads the Justice Department%27s civil rights division

Perez says he will reach out to senators on both sides of the aisle

WASHINGTON -- President Obama has picked the Justice Department's top civil rights enforcer, Thomas Perez, to be his next Labor secretary.

Obama noted that under Perez, the civil rights division settled the three largest fair-lending cases for unfair mortgage lending practices. Perez also challenged voter identification laws in South Carolina and Texas and substantially increased enforcement of human trafficking laws.

Perez has a long career in public service. Before he was appointed to run the civil rights division at Justice in October 2009, Perez was chosen by Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley to head the state's Department of Labor. He also served on the Montgomery County (Md.) Council, spent time as an aide to Sen. Edward Kennedy, and spent nearly 12 years in federal government. Most of that time was spent as an attorney in the civil rights division.

""Tom's knowledge and experience will make him an outstanding secretary of Labor,"" Obama said. ""We are going to have to work very hard to make sure that folks find jobs with good wages and good benefits. We got to make sure that our veterans returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan have a chance to put their incredible skills and leadership to work at home. We need to build an immigration system that works for every employee and every family and every business. I am confident that Tom is going to be able to promote economic growth, but also make sure that that growth is broad-based.""

His nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, is expected to face tough scrutiny from Republicans following a Justice Department Inspector General report released last week that was sharply critical of Perez.

The report determined that Perez gave incomplete testimony to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in 2010 when he testified Justice's political leadership was not involved in the decision to dismiss three of the four defendants in a lawsuit the George W. Bush administration brought against the New Black Panther Party.

""We found that Perez's testimony did not reflect the entire story regarding the involvement of political appointees,"" the report said. ""We did not find that Perez intentionally misled the commission. Nevertheless, given he was testifying as a department witness before the commission, we believe that Perez should have sought more details.""

Following the release of the report last week, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, was sharply critical of Perez. On Monday, Grassley raised questions about Perez's role in persuading officials St. Paul, Minn. to drop a lawsuit seeking to limit fair housing claims there.

""Nominating somebody who is in the middle of a congressional investigations show the president isn't very serious about working together,"" Grassley said. ""I'm looking forward to hearing his testimony, because there are a lot of tough questions he should answer for the American people, including those regarding St. Paul.""

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala, on Monday called Perez ""the wrong man for this job.""

Sessions noted that Perez previously served as president of the board of Case de Maryland, an immigrant advocacy group that provides day labor centers and other services in the Washington, D.C., suburbs. Sessions charged the organization is ""a fringe advocacy group that has instructed illegal immigrants on how to escape detection, and also promoted illegal labor sites and driver's licenses for illegal immigrants.""

""This is an unfortunate and needlessly divisive nomination. The top priority of the secretary of Labor should be to create jobs and higher wages for American workers,"" Sessions said. ""But Mr. Perez has aggressively sought ways to allow the hiring of more illegal workers.""

A few of Obama's second-term Cabinet and agency appointees have already faced tough confirmations. Chuck Hagel was grilled about past comments he made about Israel during the hearings over his Defense nomination, and CIA Director John Brennan's confirmation was slowed over questions about the agency's drone program.

United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice, whom Obama was considering to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton at the State Department, removed herself from consideration after facing blistering criticism from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

The senators blasted Rice for inaccurate comments she made in the days after the Sept. 11, 2012, terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi that left Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans dead.

In brief remarks Monday, Perez struck a conciliatory tone and said he will reach out to senators on both sides of the aisle to talk about the Labor Department's ""key role in protecting and growing the middle class.""

""Over my career, I have found that true progress is possible if you keep an open mind, listen to all sides and focus on results,"" Perez said.

If confirmed, Perez, 51, will replace Hilda Solis, who announced her resignation from the post in January.

The pick could also ease pressure on Obama from Hispanic groups who have been urging the president to appoint a Latino to a Cabinet level position after the departures of Solis and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, who also recently announced he was stepping down.

""Thomas Perez is an eminently qualified public servant who has the professional experience and compelling personal story to serve at the highest levels of the administration,"" said Janet Murguía, president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights group. ""Mr. Perez's impeccable legal background in civil rights issues, particularly workers' rights, as well as his decades of service as an elected and appointed official make him uniquely prepared to address the policy complexities and management responsibilities at the Department of Labor.""

Democrats and labor leaders also praised the pick of Perez.

""At a time when our politics tilts so heavily toward corporations and the very wealthy, our country needs leaders like Tom Perez to champion the cause of ordinary working people,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.

Perez also has a remarkable personal biography. He is a Harvard educated lawyer and the son of immigrants from the Dominican Republic. His father died when he was 12, and he worked his way through undergraduate years at Brown University by working in a warehouse and as a garbage collector.



""His story reminds us of this country's promise,"" Obama said. ""If you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are, where you come from, what your last name is, you can make it if you try. Tom has made protecting that promise for everybody the cause of his life."""

Michelle Obama welcomed the 2013 holidays into the White House on Wednesday with military families, hot cider, hand-decorated cookies, a 300-pound gingerbread White House and an extremely friendly new family pet.

Sunny, the 1-year-old Portuguese water dog the Obamas got over the summer, bounded into a State Dining Room full of children dressed in sparkly shoes and lacy dresses and headed right for little Ashtyn Gardner, 2, from Mobile, Ala. All of a sudden the blond girl with ringlet curls, whose parents are both in the Navy, was down on the rug.

“Are you okay?” said a concerned Obama, mom-in-chief, tugging back on Sunny’s leash. But there was no need for damage control. Before Ashtyn could answer, she was back on her feet and Sunny was licking her face. All seemed well again, and the kids from military families could get back to frosting cookies and making paper poinsettia flowers with the first lady, crafty projects that have become a part of the Obama holiday traditions.

In this, the Obamas’ fifth holiday season at the White House, the customs of Christmas past were observed with a few twists. First, the preview was a party for military families, as it has been in the past. The theme this year for the White House holidays is “Gather Around: Stories of the Season,” described as telling tales of the country’s history and displaying decorations that reflect it. There are art displays and Christmas trees made of repurposed books. (The 450 books used in the decorations will be donated to a local school’s book drive after the holiday season.) Many ornaments are recycled and reused. This year’s additions included wooden frames holding silhouettes of landmarks such as Mount Rushmore and the Golden Gate Bridge. The Blue Room tree, an 181 / 2 -foot Douglas fir known as the official White House Christmas Tree, was laden with holiday greeting cards on which children living on military bases shared their favorite holiday traditions.

The colors of the ornaments and decorations on the 24 Christmas trees that line the public tour route are subdued, with lots of chocolate browns, pale blues and golds. Not only is there a gingerbread house, complete with chocolate versions of Bo — the Obamas’ first Portuguese water dog — and Sunny, but it is sitting on more than 1,200 Springerle cookies made into a custom-made hearth. The hearth is framed by sugar paste re-creations of the tiles commissioned for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s fireplace, to evoke memories of his “fireside chats.” According to Bill Yosses, the White House executive pastry chef, this is the first year the gingerbread house has running water — a carpenter rigged up a functioning replica of the North Lawn fountain, to which blue food coloring was added.

Eighty-three volunteers worked for five days to decorate the White House. Donna Perry, a lawyer from Louisville, Ky., said it was her first time as a volunteer. She was decorating the tree in the Blue Room when the president stopped by and was hugged by some excited volunteers who got glitter on his lapel.

At the start of the event, Michelle Obama addressed the military families in a gray-and-white dress and pearls. “Now, over the course of this season, about 70,000 people will come to see our holiday decorations. Not bad,” she said. “And I can’t imagine a better group of people than all of you to be our first guests.” (About 13,000 of those 70,000 people will be attending official White House receptions and parties.)

Obama mentioned that while many families will be reading classics to their kids by the fire, some military personnel will be doing it a different way.

“I’m thinking about the thousands of men and women in uniform serving abroad who wake up in the middle of the night in some remote part of the world to read a special holiday story to their children over Skype,” she said, calling it “new ways to make the season bright.”

Before taking the children to make crafts with White House florists, bakers and pastry chefs, Obama warned parents, “I’m going to take your kids . . . and we’re going to do some decorating.” She added, “I guarantee you we will not lose them, but I can’t guarantee you they will come back clean.”

She worked hard, though, to keep their party clothes from getting trashed. When she saw a little girl at the cookie-decorating table drop some gooey stuff on her outfit, Obama did what all moms would do. She whipped out a dish towel with a little water on it and tried to rub the goop out of the girl’s glittery sweater."
http://news.yahoo.com/yellen-didnt-tell-congress-why-matters-120140172--sector.html,,[],What Yellen didn't tell Congress and why it matters,"By Alister Bull WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The most revealing thing about Janet Yellen's widely praised Senate confirmation hearing performance last week might not have been what she said, but what she didn't say - and how she didn't say it. President Barack Obama's nominee to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve smiled and nodded her way through a two-hour hearing on Thursday without giving the Senate Banking Committee any real clues as to how she views near-term monetary policy choices. She made plain that she thought it important to maintain aggressive efforts to spur U.S. economic growth and hiring. But her comments went no further than last month's statement from the Fed's policy-setting committee. Senators asked her how long the central bank could keep buying bonds, and seemed satisfied with her mild observation that purchases could not go on forever. She provided no clues to whether she leans toward reducing them next month, or next year. Economists had not expected her to intentionally front-run decisions yet to be made by the Fed's policy-setting committee. For one thing, current Fed chief Ben Bernanke doesn't step down until January 31. Yellen is expected to comfortably secure confirmation by the full Senate to replace him. But successfully parrying questions before Congress without accidentally hinting on future policy was seen as an important first success for the 67-year-old former professor. ""She understood how to give an answer that was at least somewhat responsive to the question, without betraying any new information. It was an impressive performance,"" said Stephen Oliner, a former senior Fed economist. A second thing she didn't say anything about was her view on strengthening the Fed's forward guidance on when it might eventually raise interest rates. Here she owes a big assist to the senators. No one asked about it even though speculation is rife that the Fed will soon decide to keep rates near zero at least until the jobless rate drops to 6.0 percent. Its current threshold is 6.5 percent. Still, Yellen's performance on other issues left little doubt that if she had been asked, she would have offered an even-handed discussion on the economic literature around the issue, with scant information on where she stood. That was how she dealt with the query from Virginia Senator Mark Warner on lowering the interest the Fed pays on the excess reserves it holds for banks, which some officials think would be a way to give the economy a bit more stimulus. Yellen explained the pros and cons, reminded lawmakers that reducing IOER, as it is called, could be problematic for the money market mutual fund industry, and left them none the wiser. YELLEN FED Keeping calm under pressure is an important quality for a successful central banker. Fed watchers reckoned that it took Bernanke a year to really settle into the role, and recall the tell-tale quaver in his voice that betrayed the strain of being grilled by lawmakers. To be sure, Yellen got far kinder treatment than Bernanke often received. Perhaps that was because the Fed's Republican critics did not want to be seen baiting the first woman nominated to lead the central bank. Or perhaps they felt it would draw attention away from Obama's healthcare woes. But there was also interest in whether her reticence on shedding light on future policy might reflect a desire to avoid building expectations, which her colleagues at the Fed would subsequently have to either validate or ignore. In essence, will the Yellen Fed be more like the Bernanke Fed or the Fed under Alan Greenspan? Greenspan was much more likely to offer clues on where he wanted to lead policy. ""Greenspan would give a little wink and nod and then the committee would have to go along after the fact,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. ""It is a probably good thing for the committee overall that she can sit in front of Congress and answer questions in a way that does not make the committee feel like their next move has to deliver on expectations set by what the chairman had already said.""

A group representing more than a dozen Tea Party groups now suing the IRS released a sample of one of the letters overnight, after the official Lois Lerner was placed on administrative leave. According to one lawmaker, she was only placed on leave after she refused to resign.

Jay Sekulow, chief counsel with the American Center for Law and Justice, said the March 2012 letters show a ""paper trail"" that reveals her ""direct involvement in sending intrusive and harassing questionnaires.""

""It appears Lerner did nothing to stop the abusive conduct. And our evidence suggests she was actively participating in the improper targeting in March 2012,"" he said in a statement.

It was no secret that Lerner, as head of the exempt organizations division, was aware of the program that had developed in the Cincinnati office under her watch. A timeline provided in the inspector general's report on the practice showed she was first briefed in June 2011.

But while she apparently raised concerns at that briefing over the criteria used, the ACLJ said the March 2012 letters show she was still involved in carrying out the policy.

At the time, the program itself was in flux. Lerner had earlier ordered the criteria to be changed in June 2011. The criteria was then broadened, but somehow it was changed again in January 2012 ""without executive approval,"" according to the IG report.

After that, the unit in question sent out a new round of letters requesting additional information, while giving groups that had not responded to the prior requests an additional 60 days to comply. These appear to be the letters that, in some cases, Lerner signed.

A letter posted online by the ACLJ was sent March 16 to the Ohio Liberty Council Corp. Signed by Lerner, the letter gave the group 60 days to respond to a prior letter seeking information on the group's social media accounts, sponsored events, communications with lawmakers and other material.

Sekulow said their records show Lerner sent 14 other letters to 14 of his group's clients in March and April of that year. He said it's unclear why her signature is on some letters but not others.

Lerner, meanwhile, has maintained she did nothing wrong. She asserted her innocence in a brief statement at a House committee hearing Wednesday, before claiming her Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions.

""I have not done anything wrong,"" she said. ""I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.""

Committee leaders are trying to recall Lerner, claiming she waived her Fifth Amendment right by delivering an opening statement.

Sekulow said there are many questions she should answer, including why the letters were sent under her name in March 2012."

Cantor says there will be ""discussions on both sides"" ""We want to move quickly,"" a House Republican says

(CNN) —

Progress.

It’s been seemingly nonexistent in Washington for weeks, as Republicans and Democrats squabbled about funding the government and whether to raise its borrowing limit. Both sides drew their lines in the sand and talked vociferously at each other, but not to each other.

On Thursday, 10 days into the government’s partial shutdown, the tide appeared to turn. House Republicans offered a plan to temporarily stave off the threat of a first-ever U.S. debt default. President Barack Obama listened to them. Both sides agreed to keep on talking.

Said Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican: “We’re all working together now.”

Sessions spoke early Thursday evening after he and fellow House Republicans talked with Obama at the White House.

Afterward, the Obama administration described the session as “good” – saying the President listened to Republican proposals and the two sides discussed “potential paths forward.”

And House Majority Leader Eric Cantor called it “very useful.”

“We’re going to have more discussions on both sides tonight,” the Virginia Republican said.

The fact the two sides are talking, though, doesn’t mean they have agreed to anything yet.

After all, they have been bitterly divided on party lines for weeks, routinely throwing barbs but rarely trading proposals.

House Republicans initially passed a series of measures tying government funding to defunding or dismantling Obamacare, the president’s signature health care reform. And they’ve insisted that they won’t increase the nation’s borrowing limit without cuts first.

Obama, meanwhile, has been just as firm in his position: Pass “clean” – meaning no add-ons or qualifications – bills to fund the government and raise the debt limit, and only then will we talk.

One big deadline passed without an agreement – October 1, when the partial shutdown began no funding had been authorized to keep the government running.

And there seemed little movement toward addressing the next one – October 17, when the Treasury Department has said the government will run out of money to pay its bills unless something is done.

Now a plan from House Republicans to temporarily boost the nation’s borrowing limit and start talks about reopening the government shifted the dynamic.

What it didn’t do was meet Democrats’ demand to fund the government right away. Asked after attending a White House meeting of his own Thursday with the President about the prospect of the debt limit lifting while the government stays partially closed, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid didn’t mince words: “It’s not going to happen.”

Obama made clear, during his session with House Republicans, that he won’t give concessions to reopen the government, according to a Democratic source familiar with the meeting.

Yet no less than White House spokesman Jay Carney cheered the movement, saying Obama was “happy that cooler heads at least seem to be prevailing in the House” over the need to avoid a possible default.

Will 2014 election solve anything?

Deep into Thursday night, these heads were getting together to try to find a resolution. The White House hopes these initial staff-level discussions will let it know exactly what Republicans want, the Democratic source said.

Rep. Hal Rogers, a Kentucky Republican, said both sides are talking “in good faith” about not just the debt ceiling, but what it will take to restart the government.

“There was not a timeline set,” said Rogers. “But we want to move quickly.”

Anti-Obamacare provisions no longer in GOP plans

Optimism in Washington triggered relief on Wall Street as the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its biggest one-day gain of the year at 323 points. Investors have been nervous over the political stalemate and the possibility of a debt default and its potential economic consequences.

This came a day after Obama said in a separate meeting with House Democrats that he would consider a short-term deal to raise the federal borrowing limit, a Democratic lawmaker told CNN.

“If that’s what (House Speaker John) Boehner needs to climb out of the tree that he’s stuck in, then that’s something we should look at,” according to the lawmaker, who attended the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Some congressional Democrats have balked at the outline of the GOP offer, saying the government must reopen and the debt ceiling must be increased to get broader talks going.

“One way or another both of those have to happen,” said veteran Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan.

Another Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, said Obama “needs to press for the opening of the government.”

“Without a doubt the default would be much more catastrophic, but I’ve got constituents, a lot of whom work for the federal government who are going through catastrophes every hour,” Cummings said.

Paul Ryan steps into budget fight

One thing any budget resolution won’t include, it appears, is provisions targeting the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

Ryan, who was the Republican party’s vice presidential nominee last year, didn’t mention Obamacare in a Wall Street Journal op-ed – saying instead that politicians from both parties should focus on “modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code.”

As others have done in recent days, GOP Rep. James Lankford of Oklahoma told CNN on Thursday that going after the President’s signature health reform is “currently off the table.”

Yet Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas – one of the most vocal Republicans in the debate – wasn’t so ready to let the health care issue go. Speaking Thursday on CNN’s “Crossfire,” he said “Democrats in this town do not want to discuss Obamacare.”

On Obama’s signature health care reform and what’s happening in Washington generally, Cruz said that it’s House Republicans who “are listening to the millions of Americans” to do what’s best for them.

According to a GOP source, it’s not certain whether Boehner can gain support from some or most of his GOP caucus to support a plan without anything to do with Obamacare or other concessions. That could mean – if a proposal like the one floated Thursday proceeds – the Speaker may need Democratic votes to pass it.

Boehner demands cuts for debt limit increase

Failure to raise the debt ceiling by next week’s deadline would leave the government unable to borrow money to pay its bills for the first time in its history. And absent a breakthrough, the shutdown would continue at a cost estimated at up to $50 billion a month.

All of it is taking a toll on Washington’s reputation: A national CNN/ORC International survey released Monday indicated that Americans were blaming all parties in the fight, though Republicans got the worst of it.

http://news.yahoo.com/more-rutgers-faculty-seek-firings-coach-case-171625311--spt.html,,[],More Rutgers faculty seek firings in coach case,"NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) — The call from faculty members and politicians to oust top Rutgers University administrators grew louder, a day after men's basketball coach Mike Rice was fired for mistreating players, shoving them and berating them with gay slurs.

More than 50 faculty members signed a letter Thursday calling for the dismissal of Athletic Director Tim Pernetti and an explanation from President Robert Barchi for why he didn't fire Rice last year when he learned of a video showing Rice's behavior during practices.

State Senate President Stephen Sweeney also called for Pernetti to step down or be fired. He said Pernetti deserves credit for getting Rutgers into the Big Ten conference but mishandled this situation.

""This incident will continue to hang over Rutgers like a dark cloud for weeks, months and perhaps years to come,"" the Democrat said in a statement.

Meanwhile, the number of faculty members calling for Barchi to step down more than doubled Thursday to 28.

The letter calling for Barchi's resignation was sent to the university's governing boards on Wednesday. In it, the faculty members cite Barchi's ""inexcusable handling of coach Mike Rice's homophobic and misogynist abuse"" of players, his ""pattern of insensitivity and arrogance toward issues of diversity"" and the ""lack of transparency that he has exhibited in his relations"" with faculty, staff and students.

It's unclear what effect the calls might have on the president or the athletic director. Neither was willing to be interviewed by The Associated Press. Barchi also skipped a town hall meeting he'd been scheduled to attend Thursday at Rutgers' Newark campus and declined to comment when he left his office. Members of the university's two governing boards have been mum.

Barchi, a neuroscience researcher before he became a university administrator, was hired a year ago and took office Sept. 1 to lead the university, which has 58,000 students and 13,000 faculty members on three campuses. He had been president of Thomas Jefferson University, a Philadelphia health sciences university, and before that was an administrator at the University of Pennsylvania.

Story continues

He was brought to Rutgers as the university takes over two medical schools that are part of the separate University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. The ongoing reconfiguration of the state's higher education system is intended to expand Rutgers' life-science research prowess, and Barchi was chosen largely to oversee that.

He had never been an administrator, though, at a school with athletic scholarships.

Over the past decade, Rutgers' athletic program has grown increasingly ambitious and expensive, largely as the university's football team transformed from an also-ran to a power in the Big East conference. The school's teams are set next year to join the more prestigious Big Ten, a move engineered largely by Pernetti, a former TV sports executive.

Shortly after Barchi took office, he told reporters that high-profile sports teams are an important way to increase the university's visibility but that he wanted to gradually reduce the university's operating subsidy for sports, currently about $8 million per year, while continuing to pay for scholarships for athletes at a cost of about $10 million annually.

Barchi said in a statement Wednesday that Pernetti told him last year about the video of Rice made by a former basketball program employee, but he said he did not watch the video until Tuesday, the day it was made public. A university spokesman declined to comment on why Barchi didn't watch the video last year.

In December, after the university consulted lawyers and commissioned an independent report on Rice's actions, Barchi said he agreed to suspend the coach for three games, fine him and order him to anger management counseling.

He said that when he saw the video, he realized that Rice needed to be removed.

The faculty members calling for Barchi to step down said in their letter that he knew enough to remove the coach months ago.

""Although President Barchi is now suggesting otherwise, he has known about Coach Rice's homophobic, misogynist and abusive behavior for several months now,"" the letter said.

Ron Becker, head of special collections and university archives at Rutgers, said he believes the handling of the situation needs to be reviewed.

""The value of sports and the Division I atmosphere often trumps some of the basic needs of the university,"" he said. ""The pressure to win and succeed at athletics seems to trump (academics) around here.""

The university's student government association also released a statement saying that Rice deserved to be fired. It said it intended to work with Barchi and Pernetti ""to ensure that incidents like this never happen again.""

While practically everyone who has spoken publicly about the case says it was right to fire Rice, two players in interviews with The Associated Press on Thursday defended the coach, saying the snippets of video were taken out of context.

""I feel if people had a chance to see the other portions of practice, or had been at practice, their judgment would not be as severe,"" sophomore forward Austin Johnson said. ""I am not saying what he did wasn't wrong, because I do believe it was wrong. But it is also tough because it was a highlight reel of his worst moments.""

Junior Wally Judge said Rice, who apologized Wednesday, has treated him well and helped him grow as a person and a basketball player.

There also was a defense of Pernetti. According to Newark's The Star-Ledger, an athletic department fundraiser emailed Rutgers boosters asking them to contact Barchi and the head of the university's board of governors to voice support of him. University spokesman Greg Trevor would not comment on whether the email was sanctioned by the author's superiors.

A Rutgers assistant coach has resigned amid the scandal. According to The Star-Ledger, the assistant, Jimmy Martelli, could be seen on the video shoving a player.

Martelli said in a statement he was ""sickened that as an assistant coach I contributed in any way to an unacceptable culture,"" and he apologized to the players ""from the bottom of my heart.""

The Associated Press also obtained a letter Thursday from a lawyer for Eric Murdock, the former basketball program employee who gave the video to university officials and later ESPN. The letter to a lawyer for Rutgers, dated Dec. 27, said Murdock was fired for telling school officials about Rice's behavior and would accept $950,000 not to file a lawsuit against the school. The letter also complained that the university did not seem to investigate when Murdock first complained about Rice in July, when an interim president was in office.

Democratic state lawmakers, particularly Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver, have been calling for legislative hearings on why Rice was not fired sooner, but none had been scheduled.

Keeping the coach on through the season cost the university a portion of his salary — he was paid $622,500 in 2012 — and a $100,000 bonus for coaching the final game of the year. Athletic department spokesman Jason Baum said the university is contractually obligated to pay the bonus, due this month.

You though Rupert Murdoch was bad? Just wait till you meet the Kochtopus.

Think Progress Media:

The Koch brothers own Koch Industries, the second-largest private company in America, and bankroll a network of Tea Party groups and Republican political war chests.

In 2012, the brothers spent millions to defeat President Obama and even sent mailers to employees urging them to support Mitt Romney and other conservative candidates.

David and Charles Koch, billionaire industrialists who own Koch Industries, America's second-largest privately held company, have expressed interest in the Tribune Co. newspapers. The Chicago-based empire emerged from a long bankruptcy Dec. 31 and has hired investment firms Evercore and JPMorgan Chase as offers have come in for its print properties. Tribune Co. spent more than four years in bankruptcy after being purchased by Sam Zell. Following the company's emergence from chapter 11, it named TV industry veteran Peter Liguori, formerly of Fox Entertainment and News Corp., as its CEO. Several Hollywood figures sit on its board of directors, including Ross Levinsohn, CEO of Guggenheim Digital Media, parent company of THR.

The Koch brothers have long dominated American industry; their holdings include Georgia Pacific paper products as well as major fertilizer, refinery and oil pipeline companies. More recently they have become known for their financial support of Republican candidates, especially those from the Tea Party, and the fight against regulations and legislation aimed at curbing climate change.

The latest rumor about the next owner of the L.A. Times, which is for sale, is a doozy. A bombshell. It's a doozy wrapped in a bombshell exploding inside a Drudge siren. Multiple sources tell L.A. Weekly that Charles and David Koch -- the infamous right-wing billionaire brothers -- are considering an offer on either the Tribune Co. newspaper group, which includes the L.A. Times, the Chicago Tribune and the Baltimore Sun or the entire Tribune Co., which includes more than 20 stations like WGN and KTLA Channel 5. The Koch Brothers are most famous for spending boatloads of money on Republican and libertarian political candidates and causes, favoring lower taxes, fewer regulations and weakening union influence. It's hard to believe there's a chance that the liberal and Hollywood-adjacent Los Angeles Times might one day be owned by the Koch Brothers.

Maj. Gen. Michael T. Harrison was suspended by the Army chief of staff, Gen. Ray Odierno, and Army Secretary John McHugh, according to a statement. The Army provided no details about the alleged assault.

The move is the latest in a string of incidents and reports that have focused attention in Congress and at the White House on whether the military is aggressive enough in prosecuting sexual assaults, which have increased steadily in the armed forces in recent years.

The Pentagon estimated last month that as many as 26,000 military members may have received “unwanted sexual contact” in 2011, up from an estimated 19,000 assaults in 2011, an estimate based on an annual survey of military personnel.

Until the investigation of Harrison’s role is finished, Maj. Gen. James C. Boozer will take his place in Japan, the Army said.

Harrison, a 33-year Army veteran, has been commander of the small U.S. army contingent in Japan since 2010 and was due to leave the job to take over as deputy commander of the Army component of U.S. Central Command, based in Kuwait.

A decision on his next assignment or whether he will face punishment or forced retirement will await the completion of the investigation, said George B. Wright, an Army spokesman.

Separately, the Air Force announced Friday that Maj. Gen. Margaret H. Woodward would take over its office of sexual assault prevention. The last head of the office, Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, was relieved after he was arrested last month near the Pentagon and charged with groping a woman.

Woodward is the former commander of 17th Air Force, based in Germany, and she commanded the U.S. portion of the allied air campaign over Libya in 2011.

Bush made barnyard reference to Rick Perry Romney campaign got blunt advice from Chris Christie Some Republicans hoped late entry into race could replace Romney

Editor’s Note: This story contains references to potentially offensive language reportedly used by politicians during the 2012 campaign.

(CNN) —

“Double Down,” a behind-the-scenes account of the 2012 presidential race by the journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, is out Tuesday. It’s the sequel to “Game Change,” their 2008 campaign retrospective that became an HBO film by the same name.

The authors, self-styled ringmasters of Washington’s political media “Freak Show,” are skilled at creating buzz, packing their book with provocative tidbits and a range of splashy scoops – an impressive feat considering that the Barack Obama-Mitt Romney showdown was the most scrutinized national campaign in American history.

Read Peter Hamby’s review in the Washington Post

The book has already made headlines: The Obama campaign flirted with the idea of kicking Vice President Joe Biden off the ticket and replacing him with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Romney campaign was startled by what it dug up on Chris Christie in the process of vetting him to be the Republican vice presidential nominee.

Ann Coulter: I don’t believe Hillary story

But here are 10 other newsmaking items from the book that has Washington transfixed:

1. Obama: ‘I’m really good at killing people’

In late 2011, President Obama, “an inveterate list maker,” began writing up a list of his achievements on a yellow legal pad. Writing his thoughts down on paper “helped him to quiet his mind.” The purpose was to help himself and his advisers reason through the best ways to present his three-year track record to voters.

On September 30, the same day a Predator drone strike killed the American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, Obama presented a small stack of yellow legal pages to his aides gathered in the White House’s Roosevelt Room.

“Obama didn’t need to run through this preamble,” the authors write. “Everyone knew the litany of his achievements. Foremost on that day, with the fresh news about al-Awlaki, it seemed the president was pondering the drone program that he had expanded so dramatically and with such lethal results, as well as the death of bin Laden, which was still resonating worldwide months later.

” ‘Turns out I’m really good at killing people,’ Obama said quietly. ‘Didn’t know that was going to be a strong suit of mine.’ “

Bergen: Did Obama keep his drone promises?

2. Obama’s secret George Soros summit

Obama’s distaste for the ring-kissing demands of campaign fundraising is the stuff of legend among Democrats, so it’s no surprise that a meeting with liberal megadonor George Soros in 2010 came up empty.

In September 2010, the White House arranged “a secret summit” between the president and Soros at the Waldorf Astoria in New York, “in hope that Soros would be induced into serious check-writing on behalf of the Democrats ahead of the midterms.”

Soros lectured Obama for 45 minutes on the economy. Obama, the authors write, “was annoyed and bored.”

“Afterwards, he fumed, ‘If we don’t get anything out of him, I’m never f–king sitting with that guy again.’ “

As for Soros, the hedge-fund titan declined to pony up in any big way for the midterms.

3. George W. Bush called Rick Perry ’chicken-s–t’

After Texas Gov. Rick Perry jumped into the Republican presidential race, long-standing tensions between him and the Bush family began to burst into view. Perry wasn’t shy about criticizing the patrician roots of George W. Bush, his gubernatorial predecessor in Texas. Longtime Bush adviser Karl Rove, who thought Perry was unelectable, fired back at Perry

Publicly, the Bush clan claimed not to be offended by the sudden rise of Perry. But privately, Barbara Bush “was hyperventilating over Perry” up in Kennebunkport, Maine. And her son “was steaming.”

“At a dinner party in Washington, the 43rd president vented to a Romney ally. “You can’t take Perry seriously,” Bush said, according to the authors. “He’s a chicken-s–t guy.”

4. Chris Christie on Newt Gingrich: ‘He’s a joke’

After the once-fading Newt Gingrich returned with gusto in South Carolina and trounced Romney in the Republican primary, Romney’s campaign was forced to recalibrate and develop a game plan to eliminate Gingrich in Florida.

Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey called Romney to give him some advice.

“Get out of your crouch and kick the s–t out of this guy,” Christie said. “That’s what you should do. He’s a joke. And you’re allowing him to be taken seriously.”

Romney went on to trounce Gingrich in the Florida primary, drowning him in attack ads.

5. The white-knight scenario

In the darkest days of Romney’s Republican nomination fight, facing down a surprisingly robust conservative challenge from former Sen. Rick Santorum before the Michigan primary, Haley Barbour was alarmed.

The former Mississippi governor, one of the Republican Party’s most well-connected and well-respected insiders, worried that Romney was so feeble as a candidate that he would be unelectable once the general election rolled around.

So he consulted with Scott Reed, a veteran GOP fixer, about the “white-knight scenario” – recruiting a stronger candidate who could seize the nomination with a late entry into the race and a brokered convention in Tampa, Florida. Reed began investigating filing deadlines and ballot access rules for late primary states, circulating the details to Republican grandees around Washington. House Speaker John Boehner “was warm to the notion.”

And Barbour went even further. In Washington, he sat down with Christie and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels – two Republicans who had declined previous entreaties to enter the race – and asked them to reconsider. Both gave it serious thought but ultimately declined.

6. The Clinton ransom

Keenly aware of Bill Clinton’s popularity among Democrats and his comfort talking about middle-class issues, Obamaland worked overtime to get the 42nd president involved in the campaign.

But it wouldn’t come without a price.

Clinton’s then-gatekeeper, Doug Band, “issued an ultimatum to the Obamans: the price of WJC’s involvement in the campaign was the retirement of HRC’s balance due.”

In other words, Band was demanding that Obama help pay off Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign debt – at that point, about a quarter of a million dollars – in exchange for Bill Clinton’s help on the trail.

Though top members of the Obama campaign were flabbergasted at the demand – and held Band in especially low regard, calling him a nickname unfit for printing here – they eventually agreed to help retire Clinton’s debt.

McCain: Hillary Clinton is ‘formidable’ candidate’

7. The Ricketts plan

The story landed like a hydrogen bomb: The New York Times reported in May 2011 that Republican billionaire Joe Ricketts, the TD Ameritrade founder and Chicago Cubs co-owner, was proposing an eye-popping $10 million ad campaign designed to dredge up the 2008 controversy surrounding Obama’s former pastor, Jeremiah Wright.

The Obama campaign was furious that Republicans would consider playing the race card. But it turns out that Obamaworld was behind the story.

The Ricketts plan, it seems, was anonymously dropped off at the Chicago offices of Democratic direct-mail vendor Pete Giangreco by “a mystery brunette” carrying a manila envelope. Just who leaked it remains a mystery, Halperin and Heilemann write.

Giangreco promptly rushed over to Obama’s Michigan Avenue headquarters to hand off the document to Obama campaign manager Jim Messina. Obama high command then decided to slip the Ricketts plan to the media, in hopes of killing it with negative publicity before it could even get off the ground.

“The Obamans didn’t want their fingerprints on the disclosure, so they used a third-party cutout to funnel the Ricketts document to The New York Times,” the book reveals.

It worked. All hell broke loose, and the Obama rapid response operation had a field day prodding reporters to get Romney to disavow the proposed ad campaign and anything related to Wright.

8. The Eastwood ‘car crash’

Clint Eastwood’s rambling, incoherent, off-the-cuff speech-turned-performance-art appearance at the Republican National Convention caused heads to explode backstage.

Once Russ Schriefer, the campaign’s point person for convention planning, began to wrap his head around the scale of the disaster before him, “he was in a state of panic.”

“Rushing backstage to the control room to try to give Eastwood the hook, he ran into [Romney adviser Stuart] Stevens – who started screaming, ‘This is terrible! It’s a car crash!’ “

According to the authors, “Stevens lost all control. He was throwing things, howling, cursing, and weeping, until he dropped his head into his hands.”

Stevens also excused himself, made his way to another room, and vomited.

9. ‘Project Goldfish’

Romney’s search for a running mate began in April 2012 with about two dozen names compiled by his longtime adviser Beth Myers, who presided over the vice presidential search, code-named “Project Goldfish” after the snack food.

Presented with the initial list, Romney narrowed his possible choices down to 11 Republicans: New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, former Tennessee Sen. Bill Frist, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan.

After sorting through “preliminary research” on each of them, the Republican nominee drilled down on five final choices: Christie, Pawlenty, Portman, Rubio and Ryan. In keeping with the “Project Goldfish” theme, each potential running mate was given a code name. Christie’s was “Pufferfish.”

Once a larger group of advisers were brought into the process, “the overwhelming consensus” was for Ryan, who was eventually picked. Romney adviser Stevens, though, was “adamantly in favor of Christie.”

But Romney and Myers ultimately concluded, based on research compiled by attorneys on the vetting team, that Christie’s background was “littered with potential landmines” – and they pulled the plug on Christie.

10. The Huntsman debacle

Among the GOP cast of characters, no one emerges more sullied than Jon Huntsman, whose shameless ambition wilts under the grueling spotlight of a national campaign and clashes with his own staff.

As Obama’s ambassador to China, Huntsman apparently circumvented the Hatch Act – which prohibits high-ranking U.S. officials from engaging in partisan political activity – by using his wife, Mary Kaye, as a back channel to plot embryonic campaign strategy with John Weaver, his adviser-in-waiting back in the States.

In the fall of 2010, the authors write, “Mary Kaye began e-mailing Weaver and asking about 2012. Sometimes two or three times a day the missives hit his inbox: What’s the state of the race? Who’s in? What do you think? She referred to her husband as “HE,” a code that probably would not have provided much protection had the communications been exposed.”

Once a candidate, Huntsman and his family were taken aback by the drudgery of campaigning, particularly fundraising. They were also mortified by the fire-breathing anger of the tea party.

Instead, the Huntsmans were “like candle-drawn moths to the liberal glitterati,” cozying up to New York celebrities like Tina Brown, Arianna Huffington and Diane Von Furstenberg who ‘made them swoon.’ “

Mired in low single digits in national polls, Huntsman also decided at one point to abandon his Republican bid and run as an independent, but he was talked out of it by his family."

It is with my blessing and my elected position as sheriff of Hancock County, Ohio, that the right of the people in the county which I represent will continue to keep and bear arms for their defense and security, and that right will not be infringed upon by any enemy, foreign or domestic. ... Any edict, regulation, or so-called 'federal law' which infringes on the right of the citizens of Hancock County, Ohio to keep and bear arms for their security will not be tolerated, recognized or enforced by me or my office.

Yep, Sheriff Heldman not only implies President Obama and the Congress are enemies of the people, but he is actually telling the chief law enforcer of the United States that he will refuse to enforce any law or regulation of his choosing.

That takes balls. He is absolutely bonkers but ballsy. Sheriff Michael Heldman must resign his office.

Heldman needs to re-read the Constitution. Article III only allows review of laws by the courts.

And then we have Article VI, Clause 2 also called the Supremacy Clause:

This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.

Sheriff Heldman took an oath to enforce the laws as set by the local, state, and Federal legislatures. He can't pick and choose what laws he will enforce. He also isn't allowed to decide what laws are constitutional. That is for the courts to decide. Now if he wants to become a lawyer and then get appointed to a Federal court then he could make those decisions.

It's not like nullification is a new idea. It has been tried whenever a group of people have strongly disagreed with some laws.

During the nullification crisis of 1828 to 1834, South Carolina planter politicians formulated a new brand of slavery-based politics that would culminate in the formation of the southern confederacy. The crisis, which began as a dispute over federal tariff laws, became intertwined with the politics of slavery and sectionalism. Led by John C. Calhoun, a majority of South Carolina slaveholders claimed that a state had the right to nullify or veto federal laws and secede from the Union. Nullification and secession, according to Calhoun, were the reserved rights of the states and therefore constitutional. Calhoun's constitutional theories and the overtly proslavery discourse of the nullifiers laid the political and ideological foundation for southern nationalism. Nullification Crisis of 1828 to 1834

The result of the efforts of these attempts at nullification eventually led to the Civil War which the south lost and slavery was ended.

The US Supreme Court has also ruled nullification unconstitutional:

In the case of Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958), the Supreme Court rejected the Arkansas effort to use nullification and interposition. The state of Arkansas passed several laws in an effort to prevent the integration of its schools. The Supreme Court, in its only opinion to be signed by all nine justices, held that state governments had no power to nullify the Brown decision. The Supreme Court held that the Brown decision and its implementation ""can neither be nullified openly and directly by state legislators or state executive or judicial officers nor nullified indirectly by them through evasive schemes for segregation whether attempted 'ingeniously or ingenuously.'"" Cooper v. Aaron (1958)

One doesn't even have to go back that far to find Heldman needs to resign his office.

The Sheriff needs to review the US Constitution and the most recent court decisions about guns especially District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) where the US Supreme court held that the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects an individual's right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home and within federal enclaves and McDonald v. Chicago (2010) which extended that protection to the states.

Heldman also admitted to the Findlay Ohio Courier that the 1994 assault weapons ban wasn't enforced in Hancock county.

If an elected official, who took an oath to enforce all laws, can't, through moral or personal objections, enforce those laws, then that elected official needs to resign his office immediately.

Hancock County Ohio Sheriff Michael Heldman must resign.

Here's the letter:

Update

Thanks for getting this on the Rec List.

Some commentors have pointed out a few things. A local Sheriff doesn't generally enforce Federal laws and Heldman's proposed action isn't any different than some local law enforcers who look the other way about certain drugs laws, draconian immigration laws, or other laws that a police officer thinks is stupid.

Those are valid points and wasn't something I thought about when writing my post.

If Heldman wrote in his letter and said Obama sucked and he hated the gun laws or the invisible gun laws that Rush and Hannity say are coming then I wouldn't pay attention to the guy and chalk him up to just another winger - which he is anyway.

I know that police use discretion when they can about enforcing laws - more about time and place than filling the jails. Most people call it ""getting a break"". It just happens and if someone raises a stink then we are back to where Heldman is now.

However Heldman's public letter and implying that the government was the enemy smacked of George Wallace and the other segregationists from the civil rights era. ""Normal"" police discretion isn't publicly announced in this way. That is what made me write a post about it.

I personally think there is a difference between laws that benefit the public good and those that single out and punish a certain class of people. The legislature can and does make mistakes - DOMA anyone? But these are still laws on the books and until they are changed or repealed by the lawmakers or the courts, law enforcement is obligated to enforce them.

I see it the same no matter who does it and the reason why. Police who use their discretion in extreme ways also need to resign then. It isn't their job to decide what laws to enforce. They can complain about those laws and even participate like all voters can and petition lawmakers to change the laws, but they can't publicly come out and defy a law they don't like.

Heldman basically just gave a reason he shouldn't be Sheriff and he should resign.

Story highlights NEW: There'd better be a ""damned good explanation"" for subpoenas, Boehner spokesman says NEW: Federal review of AP phone records is unprecedented but looks legal, Toobin says The AP calls the subpoenas a ""massive and unprecedented intrusion"" It says federal agents collected records from bureau and personal phone lines

(CNN) —

The Justice Department secretly collected two months of telephone records for reporters and editors at The Associated Press, the news service disclosed Monday in an outraged letter to Attorney General Eric Holder.

The records included calls from several AP bureaus and the personal phone lines of several staffers, AP President Gary Pruitt wrote. Pruitt called the subpoenas a “massive and unprecedented intrusion” into its reporting.

“These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP’s newsgathering operations and disclose information about AP’s activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know,” wrote Pruitt, the news agency’s CEO.

The AP reported that the government has not said why it wanted the records. But it noted that U.S. officials have said they were probing how details of a foiled bomb plot that targeted a U.S.-bound aircraft leaked in May 2012. The news agency said records from five reporters and an editor who worked on a story about the plot were among those collected, but it said none of the information the government has shared with it suggested agents listened in on any reporters’ calls.

The news immediately raised questions among members of Congress.

“The First Amendment is first for a reason,” said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner. “If the Obama administration is going after reporters’ phone records, they better have a damned good explanation.”

The subpoenas were disclosed to the news agency on Friday, Pruitt wrote. In all, federal agents collected records from more than 20 lines, including personal phones and AP phone numbers in New York; Hartford, Connecticut; and Washington, he wrote.

“We regard this action by the Department of Justice as a serious interference with AP’s constitutional rights to gather and report the news,” he told Holder. Pruitt demanded that the department return all records collected and destroy all copies.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington responded that federal investigators seek phone records from news outlets only after making “every reasonable effort to obtain information through alternative means.” It did not disclose the subject of the probe.

“We must notify the media organization in advance unless doing so would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation,” it said. “Because we value the freedom of the press, we are always careful and deliberative in seeking to strike the right balance between the public interest in the free flow of information and the public interest in the fair and effective administration of our criminal laws.”

CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the Obama administration “has been incredibly aggressive” about prosecuting leakers, and there’s no privilege in federal law that allows reporters to protect their sources. But he said past administrations have avoided going that far.

“I have never heard of a subpoena this broad,” Toobin said. “It’s legal, as far as I can tell. The administration isn’t violating the First Amendment. But they are certainly doing more than has ever been done before in pursuing the private information of journalists. And we’ll see if there’s any political check on them, because there doesn’t appear to be any legal check on what they’re doing.”

The White House was unaware of the subpoenas, spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday night.

“We are not involved in decisions made in connection with criminal investigations, as those matters are handled independently by the Justice Department,” Carney said.

Holder announced in June 2012 that he had assigned two U.S. attorneys to lead investigations into the possible leaking of state secrets, and members of Congress have complained about disclosures of electronic warfare campaigns against Iran, U.S. drone attacks overseas and Obama’s personal involvement in “kill lists” of militants in Yemen and Pakistan.

But Pruitt wrote that most of the records collected from the AP “can have no plausible connection to any ongoing investigation,” and the American Civil Liberties Union called on the Justice Department to explain its actions.

“Obtaining a broad range of telephone records in order to ferret out a government leaker is an unacceptable abuse of power,” Ben Wizner, the head of the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said in a written statement. “Freedom of the press is a pillar of our democracy, and that freedom often depends on confidential communications between reporters and their sources.”

In a statement issued Monday night, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said, “I am very troubled by these allegations and want to hear the government’s explanation.”

“The burden is always on the government when they go after private information – especially information regarding the press or its confidential sources,” said Leahy, D-Vermont. “I want to know more about this case, but on the face of it, I am concerned that the government may not have met that burden.”

And Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, told CNN that the Justice Department already has the ability “to listen, very transparently, to all the government phones and government activities.”

“You can imagine if Congress wanted to know about leaks that obviously came out of the administration that ended up in the press, they would be outraged if we tried to get that information,” said Issa, a member of the House Judiciary Committee and a leading critic of Holder. “But that’s exactly what they’re doing. They’re looking at what is considered to be confidential.”"

(CNN) - While a Senate deal may be in the works, a key White House meeting is on hold. Still, government workers have received a reduced paycheck that reflects the furloughs, unemployment claims have skyrocketed, government-affiliated businesses are scrambling to stay afloat, states are dipping into their rainy-day funds. Oh, and markets are extremely nervous as the debt limit deadline is just three days away. Now, it’s getting serious.

Meanwhile in Washington, Republicans and Democrats have still not reached a final agreement.



Reid urges patience, remains optimistic over deal prospects

But top Senate leaders say they are optimistic.

Here’s what you need to know:



Up to speed

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his counterpart, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell appear closer to a deal. After a morning of negotiations, both Senate leaders expressed optimism that a deal is in the works. Reid called negotiations with McConnell “constructive,” adding that he’s “optimistic that we will reach an agreement.” McConnell said he “echo[s]” Reid’s remarks.

But until the hands shake, the clock keeps ticking.

Because momentum has increased, a meeting between President Obama and top House and Senate leaders was supposed to take place at the White House this afternoon has been postponed “to allow leaders in the Senate time to continue making important progress towards a solution.

While visiting a local charity in Washington, DC, Obama said “there's some progress on the Senate side.""

Reid, President Barack Obama and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi continue to demand that any proposal reopen the government and lift the debt ceiling with no strings attached.

Meanwhile, Maine Republican Susan Collins, continues to work with a bipartisan group of Senators on a plan. The framework of her proposal would lift the debt ceiling until 2014, fund the government until March and postpone a tax on medical devices.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, who is part of the Collins group, sounded an optimistic tone Monday morning saying “we’re 70%, 80% there.” He said they have a template and leadership needs to finalize the details, including how much Congress is going to allocate to fund the government.

Wondering about what happened to President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, who appeared to be close to a deal last week? Those talks fell apart Saturday morning when the President rejected Boehner’s plan to lift the debt limit for only six weeks.

Washington could learn from baseball strike

National outlook

After a loss in U.S. stock futures Monday morning, Wall Street is feeling the optimism expressed in Washington on prospects of a deal.

The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were all higher in afternoon trading.

U.S. Treasury markets are closed Monday because of Columbus Day.

Global outlook

Asian markets, which hold a high percentage of U.S. debt, are closed Monday. Again, Monday is a critical day for those markets as well.

European markets were mostly weaker in morning trading.

The top financial officials from around the world gathered in Washington over the weekend. And they were nervous about the U.S. inaction.

Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said Saturday the consequences of a failure to raise the debt limit would be dire for economies around the world.

""You know, I've just spent the last two days with representatives of about 188 countries around the world. I wouldn't say they are confident. I would say they are concerned, and they are very anxious to see this crisis resolved, because they know it's going to impact on their economy,"" Lagarde told CNN’s Richard Quest at an Institute of International Finance conference in Washington.

Personal outlook

CNN’s Alison Kosik said that if the U.S. defaults on its debt, ""A default interest rates for credit cards and student loans would spike as well and payments from the government would go up”

Number of the day

3 – At day 14, this is the third longest government shutdown in American history, according to a Democratic assessment.

Anger mounts

Protestors gathered Sunday at the World War II Memorial to protest its closure caused by the shutdown. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, whose demands to defund the president’s health care law was largely responsible for the shutdown, spoke at the event as did former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Cruz said the closure of the memorial was a political ploy.

The rally, billed as the ""Million Vet March on the Memorials,"" drew far fewer than a million people and evolved into a protest that resembled familiar tea party events from 2009, with yellow ""Don't Tread On Me"" flags throughout the crowd and strong anti-Obama language from the podium and the audience. And one speaker said the President should “put the Quran down,” implying that Obama is Muslim.

States step up

The state of New York dug into its own coffers to reopen the Statue of Liberty. New York state will pay $61,600 a day over the next several days from its tourism budget. Cuomo determined that the financial commitment was well worth it because of the economic gain to New York the 10,000 daily tourists bring to the state and local businesses.

People visit Utah to ski and visit its national parks. Their closure was too much for the state, so the state government is stepping in and filling the federal government’s void. Utah has reopened eight national parks. It will pay the National Park Service up to $166,572 per day to do so.

Citizens step up

A local charity in Calvert County, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, DC is feeding the furloughed. Thirty percent of the county’s residents are government employees and the local group End Hunger in Calvert County is distributing food to furloughed workers at a local food bank.

Peterson, founded the Jack in the Box fast-food chain She won and lost $1 billion playing video poker at casinos from 2000 to 2009

The first woman mayor of San Diego has acknowledged in court she misappropriated more than $2 million from her late husband’s foundation to fund a casino gambling habit with which she allegedly won and lost $1 billion over nine years.

Her attorney said a brain tumor affected Maureen O’Connor’s judgment in playing video poker. She’s now broke and suffering cognitive impairment following brain surgery and a stroke in 2011, prosecutors said.

O’Connor, mayor of San Diego from 1986 to 1992, reported to the IRS more than $1 billion in casino winnings but also reported losses bigger than those winnings, resulting in a net loss from 2000 to 2009, prosecutors said in court papers.

Those net losses amounted to $13 million, her attorney said.

O’Connor was married to Robert O. Peterson, founder of the Jack in the Box restaurant chain, from 1977 until his death in 1994, but court documents don’t disclose the size of the couple’s fortune that apparently funded O’Connor’s gambling habit.

O’Connor, 66, entered a deferred prosecution agreement Thursday in federal court in San Diego in which she admitted misappropriating money from the R.P. Foundation, on which she served as a trustee.

Under the agreement, she will repay the foundation $2,088,000, pay owed taxes, and be treated for her gambling addiction, prosecutors said.

O’Connor, however, is bankrupt and unable to work, court papers say. Her ability to repay the foundation is “limited,” they say.

In 2011, surgeons removed a large tumor from O’Connor’s brain, and she suffered complications that included cognitive impairment and a pulmonary embolism, prosecutors said. Magistrate Judge David Bartick found that her continuing health problems made it highly improbable she could be brought to trial, prosecutors said.

If O’Connor repays the foundation and satisfies the conditions of her deferred prosecution, the government will dismiss its prosecution in two years, prosecutors said.

She faces an unlawful monetary transaction charge carrying a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, documents say.

“Maureen O’Connor was a selfless public official who contributed much to the well-being of San Diego,” U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy of San Diego said in a prepared statement. “However, no figure, regardless of how much good they’ve done or how much they’ve given to charity, can escape criminal liability with impunity.”

O’Connor told reporters Thursday that for a while, she didn’t know she had a brain tumor.

“There were two Maureens – Maureen No. 1 and Maureen No. 2,” she said. “Maureen No. 2 is the woman that did not know she had a tumor growing in her head.”

She described that era as “the last chapter of my life where I lost my husband, I lost three of my siblings, I lost my two best friends and I had a difficult time.

“I think most of you who know me here would know that I never meant to hurt the city,” she told reporters. She began to choke up and cry.

O’Connor was described as “a public figure and a civic treasure to the San Diego community” for 30 years, according to court papers filed by her attorney.

She is the eighth of 13 children of a mother who was a registered nurse and a father, Jerome, who was a boxer known as “Kid Jerome” and later became a prominent businessman, defense documents said.

She was elected to city council at age 25 in 1971 and, later as mayor, “put our city on the map as a destination for international tourism,” partly by presiding over the completion of the city’s Convention Center, defense documents said.

O’Connor’s attorney attributed her gambling addiction to her medical condition.

“This was not, we think, a psychiatric problem or a characterological defect because there is substantial evidence that during this same time, there was a tumor growing in her brain, in the centers of the brain that affect and control, logic, reasoning and, most importantly, judgment,” attorney Eugene Iredale said at a news conference Thursday.

O’Connor sat next to him with her head lowered.

O’Connor didn’t plead guilty this week and the charge is played in abeyance for two years, Iredale said.

“It is fair to say in the last eight to 10 years a multiple amount of tragedies have befallen a person who was a great civic leader – one of the sweetest, funniest people who ever existed in our city’s history,” the attorney said. “She suffered from terrible loneliness. She began around 2001 to gamble heavily.”

“Although it’s not fair of us to say there is no moral culpability, Maureen acknowledges doing something she ought not to have done,” he added.

Photographs of her head after surgery show a fluid-filled cavity without brain matter at all, he said.

From 2000 to 2008, O’Connor gambled in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and San Diego casinos, court papers said. In 2008, when she became nearly broke, she began to siphon off funds from the R.P. Foundation and continued the activity into 2009, court documents said.

To fund her high-stakes gambling, she had liquidated her savings, sold several real estate holdings, auctioned valuables, and obtained a third mortgage on her home in La Jolla, California, the documents say.

O’Connor allegedly bankrupted the foundation and tried to avoid paying federal income taxes on the charity’s money by characterizing what she took as “loans,” court papers say.

“Despite having limited, if any, assets other than the funds misappropriated from the foundation, defendant continued high-stakes gambling,” the documents say.

By March 2009, O’Connor allegedly had paid off casinos’ gambling markers, or lines of credit, but hadn’t repaid the foundation, prosecutors said.

She then enjoyed a streak of “several large gambling winnings after March 2009 that were used to continue gambling, not bring the foundation out of bankruptcy,” court papers say.

Prior to 2008, the foundation funded such philanthropies as City of Hope, the Alzheimer’s Association, Sharp Healthcare, Little Wishes Foundation, San Diego Hospice and the John Burton Foundation, authorities said.

Police escorts and long motorcades of dark sedans.

This is not how Jerry Brown typically rolls.

But those are among the governor’s new realities this week as he moves from boardrooms to ballrooms amid the government meetings, signing ceremonies and formal banquets that will make up his swing through China.

The formal nature of the official state visit is something of an anathema to the governor’s trademark intellectual populism. Brown’s improvisational style has been curbed by carefully worded statements. A governor who has been known to eat food from other people’s plates is slated to sit through a handful of lavish multi-course banquets, complete with their own sets of cultural rituals.

The formalities began early Wednesday as Brown met with China’s minister of commerce, Gao Hucheng. Seated at a long conference table surrounded by top aides and untouched mugs of green tea, the two exchanged pleasantries and pledged deeper economic ties between China and California.

From there, his police-led motorcade made its way through the streets of Beijing to the Hunan Hotel, where in an ornate ballroom, Brown and six other regional Chinese leaders signed a memorandum also aimed at promoting future partnerships.

These types of non-binding memoranda are precisely the kind of thing Brown typically dismisses back home. State lawmakers have seen dozens of bills meet with the governor’s veto pen, dismissed with curt messages about their non-binding and mostly ceremonial nature.

But this is different, Brown’s aides say. These agreements are seen as significant in China, and lay the groundwork for what Brown hopes will be scores of new business deals in the years to come.

A lunchtime gathering at the tony Peninsula Hotel offered a brief respite. At a luncheon hosted by the Chamber of Commerce, in a room full of U.S. business people, Brown was at ease. He kept the crowd laughing with cracks about the state’s credit rating, the city of San Francisco and California’s propensity for lawsuits.

The governor made light of complaints about state regulations dating back to his first stint as governor that persisted through the 1980s and ‘90s when the state had Republican executives.

Seems the concert was put together on behalf of China National Petroleum Corp. for the entertainment of their executives working in Turkmenistan, according to a statement from J.Lo’s rep obtained by E! News, and “was not a government sponsored event or political in nature.”

“The event was vetted by her representatives, had there been knowledge of human rights issues of any kind, Jennifer would not have attended,” the statement continued. However, the corporation folks made a last-minute request for a “birthday greeting” before the singer took the stage, and President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov got a 56th birthday serenade.

The Human Rights Foundation criticized the performance in a strongly worded statement released Sunday, prompting the apology. According to the nonprofit, Berdymukhamedov has “ruled the country with an iron fist since 2006.”

The HRF statement, which listed the country’s alleged rights abuses and cited other groups’ rankings of the country among “the worst of the worst,” was not without a bit of snark.

“Lopez obviously has the right to earn a living performing for the dictator of her choice and his circle of cronies, but her actions utterly destroy the carefully-crafted message she has cultivated with her prior involvement with Amnesty International’s programs in Mexico aimed at curbing violence against women,” said the foundation’s president, Thor Halvorssen. “What is the next stop on her tour, Syria? The dictator of Kazakhstan’s birthday is July 6, maybe she will also pay him a visit?” Halvorssen asked.

TIMELINE: Summer’s must see concerts

It’s not the first time Lopez has found herself a focus of international attention linked to a concert in a situation where human-rights abuses have been alleged.

In July 2010, Lopez canceled a performance that was to celebrate the opening of a hotel in the breakaway northern part of the island of Cyprus. Some saw Lopez’s planned performance as an endorsement of the self-declared state.

“Jennifer Lopez would never knowingly support any state, country, institution or regime that was associated with any form of human rights abuse,” said a statement issued at the time of the cancellation.

That gig, scheduled for J.Lo’s 41st birthday, reportedly would’ve come with a $3-million paycheck.

“Bob Filner’s announcement that he will be taking a leave of absence prolongs the pain he is inflicting on our city at a time when San Diegans are calling for an end to this civic nightmare,” Council President Todd Gloria said in a statement.

Gloria said that although Filner has acknowledged his “serious disorder,” he must hold himself to a higher standard because he is a government leader.

“Since the City Charter hasn’t clearly spelled out how to handle this situation, it requires us to ask in the strongest terms possible for the Mayor’s resignation in a manner that allows the continuation of effective government for all San Diegans,” the statement said. “The time for indecisiveness and inaction is over. I again call upon the Mayor to resign.”

At a news conference at City Hall on Friday, Filner continued to refuse calls for his resignation. He said he would undergo two weeks of intensive therapy starting Aug. 5. He planned to return to work full time Aug. 19, but will continue to be briefed morning and evening on city business.

Filner did not answer questions at the news conference.

Filner is the first Democratic mayor in 20 years, elected on promises of improving neighborhood services and breaking up the “old boy’s network” that he says has run City Hall for decades.

He acknowledged Friday that, “I must become a better person.”

“I hope in becoming a better person, I hope I can be in a position to be forgiven,” he said.

But other council members also said they did not approve of his announcement on Friday.

“Two weeks of therapy will not end decades of bad behavior,” Councilman Kevin Faulconer said.

Seven women have accused Filner of sexual harassment. One former top aide filed a lawsuit Monday.

Veronica “Ronne” Froman, a retired Navy rear admiral who became the city’s chief operating officer under Filner’s mayoral predecessor, Jerry Sanders, said that during a meeting with Filner while he was in Congress, Filner “stopped me and he got very close to me. And he ran his finger up my cheek like this and he whispered to me, ‘Do you have a man in your life?’”

Froman said she rebuffed Filner but was so rattled that she told two men who were at the same meeting to “never leave me alone in a room with Bob Filner again.”

Joyce Gattas, dean of the College of Professional Studies and Fine Arts at San Diego State, told KPBS that Filner held her tightly, kissed her and put his hands on her knee. She also said she had seen Filner make “sexual comments to others.”

Also this week, a school psychologist and a political consultant accused Filner of inappropriate touching. The former said he tried to kiss her; the latter said he patted her buttocks.

Navarrette: In the case of Sergio Garcia, my heart says yes but my head won't go along He asks how does Garcia show respect for law when he has lived in defiance of rule of law? Navarrette: In the immigration debate, we must separate the individual from the idea

(CNN) —

Since I first became aware of the maddening case of 36-year-old Sergio Garcia, who seeks admission to the California Bar, I’ve tried to convince myself this accomplished young man – a law school graduate who passed the bar exam – should be able to practice law despite the inconvenient fact that he is an undocumented immigrant.

Yet, I can’t. My heart goes out to Garcia. But my head won’t go along.

This week, the California Supreme Court held a hearing to decide whether Garcia is eligible for a law license in California in a case that is certain to impact the fate of other undocumented immigrants in pursuit of legal careers.

Garcia is opposed by the Obama administration’s Justice Department, which cites a 1996 law that prohibits states from providing undocumented immigrants with public benefits, including professional licenses. He is supported by California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who argues the issuance of law licenses isn’t a federal matter but up to states to decide.

Courtesy San Diego Union Tribune Ruben Navarrette Jr.

A decision from the court is expected in the next 90 days.

Garcia came to the United States from Mexico with his family when he was a toddler. He returned to Mexico with his mother when he was 9 and came back to the U.S. when he was 17. He applied for citizenship. That was back in 1994, and he is still waiting to hear from Uncle Sam.

He told AP that he isn’t worried about being deported because his case is well-known and he had notified immigration officials that he is in the U.S. awaiting a decision on his citizenship.

While he waits, he has been working hard toward his goal of becoming a lawyer. He paid for his studies at Cal Northern School of Law in Chico, California, by working at a grocery store.

Yet, in the immigration debate, we must separate the individual from the idea. The individual – Garcia – looks like a keeper. The idea – that one who has lived most of his life outside the law can practice law – is problematic.

This young man wants to put his hand on a Bible and pledge the following: “I solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of an attorney and counselor at law to the best of my knowledge and ability.”

That oath comes from the California Bar Association, which states: “It is the duty of an attorney to … support the laws of the United States and of this state … maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers … (and) never to seek to mislead the judge or any judicial officer by an artifice or false statement of fact or law.”

How is Garcia supposed to uphold “the laws of the United States” when he is, by his mere presence in this country, in violation of federal law?

How does he pledge to show respect for “the courts of justice” when, for most of his life, he has lived here in defiance of the rule of law? And how can he claim that he won’t “mislead” a judge or judicial officer when living in the United States illegally requires deception on a daily basis?

If Garcia had more respect for the profession that he is seeking to join, he might have second thoughts about whether he is eligible to join it. Yet, he seems to feel entitled to a law license and everything that comes with it.

I’ve had contact with Garcia in the past, and I’m worried that he’s lived in the United States for so long that he’s picked up some bad habits from his fellow Americans.

Several months ago, Garcia posted on Facebook: “I have a career lined up with the potential of offering employment to U.S. Citizens, no criminal record anywhere and have been in limbo for the last 19 years. Where the hell is my American Dream? Lol”

I responded: “Not to pick a fight, Sergio. But your question is very much part of the problem. ‘Where’s mine? Where’s my American Dream? Gimme, gimme.’ You’re an American after all. I’ll tell the kid at Starbucks, the one with the sense of entitlement, to scoot over and make room.”

I continued: “If America gives you the chance to live the Dream, don’t you think it’s fair for her to ask for something in return? She decided that she wanted your RESPECT, and that this could be demonstrated by you respecting her laws – the same laws you say you want to spend your life serving and defending in a courtroom. Don’t you see the irony there?”

Garcia responded: “Let me get done with lunch so I can address your entitlement issues.”

He never got back to me. In his public comments, I haven’t seen evidence that Garcia has considered for one minute the possibility that this case is about issues larger than himself, his plans, his dreams.

I don’t think he has. And if the court decides in his favor, he never will.

http://news.yahoo.com/big-4-cellphone-carriers-unite-anti-texting-ads-042113131.html,,[],Big 4 cellphone carriers unite on anti-texting ads,"NEW YORK (AP) — The country's four biggest cellphone companies are set to launch their first joint advertising campaign against texting while driving, uniting behind AT&T's ""It Can Wait"" slogan to blanket TV and radio this summer.

AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint and T-Mobile will be joined by 200 other organizations backing the multi-million dollar ad campaign.

The campaign is unusual not just because it unites rivals, but because it represents companies warning against the dangers of their own products. After initially fighting laws against cellphone use while driving, cellphone companies have begun to embrace the language of the federal government's campaign against cellphone use by drivers.

AT&T and Verizon have run ads against texting and driving since 2009. In 2005, Sprint Nextel Corp. created an education program targeting teens learning to drive.

""Every CEO in the industry that you talk to recognizes that this is an issue that needs to be dealt with,"" AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said in an interview. ""I think we all understand that pooling our resources with one consistent message is a lot more powerful than all four of us having different messages and going different directions.""

Beyond TV and radio ads, the new campaign will stretch into the skies through displays on Goodyear's three blimps. It will also include store displays, community events, social-media outreach and a national tour of a driving simulator. The campaign targets teens in particular.

AT&T Inc. calls texting and driving an ""epidemic,"" a term it borrows from the federal Department of Transportation. The U.S. transportation secretary has been on a self-described ""rampage"" against cellphones since his term began in January 2009.

Stephenson said that ""texting while driving is a deadly habit that makes you 23 times more likely to be involved in a crash."" The figure refers to a 2009 government study of bus and truck drivers. It isn't based on crashes alone, but on the likelihood the drivers showed risky behavior such as lane drifting or sharp braking, sometimes culminating in a crash.

Story continues

The unified ad campaign comes as some researchers are starting to say that while texting and driving at the same time is clearly a bad idea, it's not contributing measurably to an increase in traffic accidents. The number of accidents is in a long-term decline, and the explosion of texting and smartphone use doesn't seem to be reversing that trend.

In the 2009 government study, texting, email and surfing on the cellphone was a factor in about 1 percent of crashes, well below epidemic levels.

""There's no question that phone use is causing crashes. But so far it doesn't appear to be adding to the overall crash problem,"" says Russ Rader, a spokesman for the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety, which is funded by the insurance industry. The institute's analysis is based in part on comparing accident rates before and after states enact bans on hand-held cellphone use while driving. Most states ban cellphone use at least for some drivers; 39 states and the District of Columbia ban text messaging for all drivers.

James Sayer, a research scientist at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, has suggested that the debate over driver distraction ""needs to address far more than cellphones. Only addressing the 'new' forms of distraction will have limited impact in terms of total lives saved."" Sayer made the remarks in a presentation to the National Transportation Safety Board.

Nonetheless, the cellphone industry and the federal government have focused their attention on cellphones.

The government's Distraction.gov site singles out cellphones as the greatest danger among all sources of driver distraction. In an interview last year with The Associated Press, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said that in 2010, 3,092 lives ""could have been saved if someone had the sense to put down their cellphone.""

That figure is based on a misunderstanding of the department's statistics, which showed that 3,092 people were killed in crashes involving distractions of all kinds, including eating, drinking, fiddling with the car stereo and talking to passengers. The number of deaths in 2010 that the Department of Transportation attributes to cellphone use was 408, or 1.2 percent of the total traffic death toll.

That figure could be an undercount, though, as it's hard for police to figure out after a crash if a cellphone was involved. Sayer suggested that the real share of traffic deaths caused by cellphones is 3.5 percent.

In campaigning against the use of their products, cellphone companies are in the company of liquor makers, which include discrete reminders not to drink and drive in their advertising. However, drunk driving remains a far bigger killer than cellphone use, accounting for 10,228 traffic deaths in 2010, or 31 percent of the total.

""We have people using our technology, and when they use our technology it has some rather traumatic impacts on society,"" Stephenson said in the interview. ""I think it's a logical place for us to engage.""

The four-way industry collaboration around the ""It Can Wait"" campaign will last until September, Stephenson said, but it could continue if the partners agree."

There’s no deadline. We want to get this done, and we want to get this done right,” another House leadership aide said.

You've got to love these two paragraphs from Chris Frates' National Journal piece on how Republican leadership is spinning their decision against moving forward with immigration reform:Actually, it's more like John Boehner decided against letting immigration reform come up for a vote because he was afraid doing so would cost him his job. The issue wasn't that it wouldn't pass the House—it's that it would pass, but mainly with Democratic votes. A majority of Republicans would have voted against it, and then next thing they would have done would have been to remove John Boehner from the speaker's office—probably even before President Obama signed the legislation into law.

That's why Boehner hasn't let immigration reform move forward. And that's why the real drama isn't whether the House can pass immigration reform, it's whether John Boehner will ever allow it to pass immigration reform—and, if he does, whether he'll figure out a way to save his job. I wouldn't be surprised if Boehner privately wants to see the Senate bill pass, but his private aspirations don't mean a thing if he can't deliver results.

Perhaps the jam-packed legislative calendar this fall will actually put enough balls in the air to create an opening for immigration reform, in which case Boehner will have pulled off the feat of both getting immigration reform done and keeping his job. But that's a pretty big if, and so far he hasn't been willing to take a personal risk in order to accomplish immigration reform.

One last thing worth noting: If Boehner fails, it won't be entirely accurate to say Republicans refused to address immigration reform, because they have. Earlier this year, they voted nearly unanimously in favor of Steve King's proposal to require President Obama to deport DREAM Act children. And that means that if Republicans don't change course this fall, Steve King really will be the face of Republican immigration policy, not just in tone, but also in substance."

[twitter-follow screen_name='BurkeCNN']

(CNN) - The son of a Florida megachurch pastor who is close to President Barack Obama has died, apparently of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to local police.

Isaac Hunter, 36, died Tuesday, according to Northland and Summit churches, two Orlando-area congregations with deep ties to his family.

Altamonte Springs Police Department spokesman Robert C. Pelton said officers responded to a call to check on the well-being of Hunter at 10:45 a.m. Tuesday. They found him dead, apparently of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Pelton said. The investigation is ongoing, and no foul play is suspected, he added.

Hunter is the son of Joel Hunter, an evangelical who has been a spiritual adviser to Obama since his 2008 presidential campaign. The president and the pastor speak nearly once a week, and Joel Hunter was an adviser to the White House Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships.

Isaac Hunter and his wife, Rhonda, were going through a divorce, according to Florida court records. Hunter resigned as senior pastor of Summit Church in 2012 after acknowledging a three-year affair with a member of the church staff.

""All of us are grieving for the Hunter family, and we will deeply miss Isaac. Words cannot express the sorrow we're feeling,"" said a statement by Vernon Rainwater, a pastor at Northland, which is based in Longwood, Florida.

""We love this family and are so grateful for the impact they have had on each of our lives. I have loved Isaac since he was a child, and I know this ... Isaac loved Jesus. And we are assured of his continuing relationship with Christ now in heaven.""

With several campuses in central Florida, Northland is one of the largest evangelical churches in the state. Like his father, Isaac Hunter had been an evangelical megachurch pastor, a leader of Summit Church in Orlando.

""By now you may have heard that our former Senior Pastor, Isaac Hunter, died today,"" Pastor Jeff Kern wrote on Summit's website. ""As I write these words, it is hard to express the deep sorrow we as a staff team are feeling for this tragic loss.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Rhonda, their three children and their extended family. We love them and it is our desire to support them in any way we can during this difficult time,"" Kern continued.

""As we look back on Isaac’s ministry here at Summit, we are profoundly grateful for the impact he had in all of our lives. We know that Isaac is deeply loved by Jesus, even in a time of brokenness ...,"" he wrote.

Cameron Strang, the founder of an Orlando-based evangelical magazine, described Isaac Hunter as a friend and former pastor who had ""some significant struggles.""

""Isaac was my pastor for several years. He was an amazing teacher,"" Strang, founder of Relevant magazine, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday evening.

""Around this time last year, Isaac resigned his position at our church amid some very public scandals. He had a wife of 13 years and (three) young kids, and the time since then has been incredibly difficult for our church. His family lives around the corner from me, and I see them often,"" Strang continued.

""Isaac loved Jesus and was a talented and dedicated pastor for more than a decade. But he had some significant struggles. The unfathomable news today is devastating for many. Please pray for his family. Please pray for our church. Pray for his kids,"" Strang said.

Friends of the Hunter family also expressed condolences on Twitter on Tuesday night.

Do we surrender without a fight our nation, our way of life, our childrens' and descendants' entire future, just because we're too damned lazy, apathetic, or thoroughly hypnotized to exercise our power? Our guests and household members all seem to understand what's at stake. We differ slightly on how we might deal with it politically, but the most interesting positions (to me) have to do with the rationalizations we've heard and possibly rejected. WHY are they doing this, WHAT is its purpose, and WHO exactly is doing it.

When my turn to opine came, my position as Matriarch and oldest living member of the tribe allows me quite a bit of leeway as well as more than polite attention. So I used the opportunity to talk about my experience growing up and becoming politically aware. Hub and I are certified 1951 Boomers. We grew up in the first generation post-WW2... or, post-nuclear WMDs if you prefer. ALL of our childhood years were spent living under the constant overt 'threat' of Instant Human Annihilation. If we didn't toe the line, 'they' would make humanity extinct. Just because they could.

Duck and Cover drills, endlessly. Back yard fallout shelters stocked with months' worth of water and provisions. The basement level of just about every solidly-built commercial building in town had its government-provided provisions, we had CD personnel in the police and fire departments, we were all totally familiar with the signs and instructions for when we'd need to seek shelter and obey our designated CD caretakers unquestionably...

I'd always had a bad attitude. Comes no doubt from being born to the U.S. Navy. Dad was Planning Officer at Subic during the Korean 'conflict' when I was born. That's why I am currently non-existent according to the federal imposed-to-state level, but that's another story altogether. Anyway, having an extensive experience with the military's take on such things, by the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis and Dad's first MIC corporate job after the Navy, I didn't spend any time being afraid of the public rhetoric. Dad taught physics and electrical engineering for awhile at The Citadel too, had been attached to the Pentagon when next younger sister was born, before he went through the revolving door to the contractor end where he eventually helped develop the ceramic heat tiles and computers for the Apollo missions. The nation's economy was booming, veterans from all backgrounds were quickly creating the greatest Middle Class the world had ever known, despite the underlying undercurrent of MAD. People generally didn't take it all THAT seriously. Until those six days in October...

I was in the sixth grade when it happened. First post-Navy 'new school', in a long line of new schools thus far. I was quite used to it. As the crisis developed, we got a new student in our class, a red-headed boy named Ira who had come with his mother to his grandparents house in our tiny town because they'd been evacuated from Gitmo Bay, where his father was stationed [Marines]. He and I became immediate friends, the only people in our western New York state class who sort of knew things about the game being played. We talked about it quite a lot, and made a pact not to be afraid.

It steadily got worse, day to day. The very first time a television tuned to the regular national broadcast news ever showed up in a classroom of mine, the teachers from 6th grade through high school (attached) let us just sit and watch all day long. The news was dire, the End Of The World was at hand, and all the adults in our lives became steadily more and more terrified. To which Ira and I reacted as we'd agreed to do - We Are Not Afraid.

We reasoned that there was nothing at all to be gained by making humanity extinct, since those making the decisions were also human. Still, they blustered and bloviated and acted all terrified. SuperCereal [ht: South Park] newscasters grimly reported every detail as it came in. It seemed like everyone was convinced we were ALL about to die. Ira and I didn't believe it for a moment.

That last long day I shook my fist at the sky during after-lunch on the playground - ""Drop it or shut up about it!"" Like a personal dare to those threatening everyone's life.

Sure enough, they didn't kill us all. Probably not because of my measly shaken fist. And at no point from there all the way through the ignoble end of the ignoble Cold War, they never again ventured that close to the edge. Even as the stockpiles and the yields kept going higher and higher, at more and more expense (conveniently covered by We The People). Fallout shelters fell out of favor outside Tornado Alley. Provisions in commercial basements rotted. Nobody gave a shit anymore, the threat had lost its existential punch.

Fast forward. Now they want me to be terrified of assorted unknown stateless actors somewhere, sometime. That's why they call 'em ""terrorists."" Yet it's a very simple google search to discover that I'm in more danger of being killed in any given year by lightning than faceless terrorists. And that doesn't even begin to compare to home accidents, auto mishaps, plain old murder, heart disease, cancer, or any other prominent cause of death in the world today.

I am not afraid.

I haven't been really afraid of teh gub'mint since. They do still piss me off fairly regularly. I wasn't afraid on 9-11. I'm not shaking in my boots now. Terrorists present little to no threat to me and mine. The government's paranoia, on the other hand, is definitely an issue. Because it has abrogated my rights. This is not okay with me.

There seems to be a rather large disconnect between some Kossacks and reality. It can't be simple blindness, because it's responsible for much of the pie-throwing over the past couple of weeks. I'm beginning to learn that this is some sort of ""Third Way"" thing, but I'd have to go looking to find out what that viewpoint dictates when teh gub'mint sends things FUBAR. Makes no obvious sense from here. Perhaps because...

I am not afraid.

What is at stake right now is the very same thing that was at stake in the bad old Cold War. If that was never really about human extinction, then today's overt goal(s) aren't about any big deal threat from random/anonymous 'terrorists'. It's about US, because we are the only ones with the real power to call an abrupt halt to it.

The existential 'threat' in my day was global nuclear war. That's a whole helluva lot more scary than assorted cave dwellers, desert nomads, possibly smart 'visitors' taking flying lessons, or even hard core domestic assholes like Tim McVeigh. Why on earth would anyone expect me to surrender now, if I haven't surrendered at any point between then and now? Again, absurd.

I am not afraid.

""The system of the Catholic clergy, for which I have great respect and to which I have given many years of my life, selects, cultivates, protects, defends, and produces sexual abusers."" - Richard Sipe

Richard Sipe, a former Benedictine monk and mental health counselor, lived in the catholic system for 18 years where he counseled his fellow priests. Sipe did a 25 year study examining celibacy in the priesthood.

What he found was that at any one time, no more than 50% of priests practice celibacy.



""They know that celibacy is not practiced"" they being Vatican authorities, Sipe said, ""you may not be keeping your celibacy but as long as it's secret, it's okay.""



Reverend Lawrence Murphy

The narrative is framed by the first known case of a priest being publicly accused of molestation — Father Lawrence Murphy of Milwaukee's St. John's School for the Deaf. There, we learn through the signed testimonials of four former pupils — Terry Kouhut, Gary Smith, Pat Kuehn and Arthur Budzinski — the boyish and beloved priest systematically raped and abused more than 200 pupils during his unstoppable 24-year tenure.

Reverend Lawrence Murphy sexually abused over 200 deaf children at St. John's school in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Not only were these young men unable to speak out about the abuses Father Murphy perpetrated on them, but in many cases, their own families did not know how to sign which put Father Murphy as interpretor between mother/father and son, leaving them absolutely no opportunity to tell.

His own moral depravity wasn't enough, Reverent Murphy enlisted older boys in an organized system of abuse. These older boys, who had been molested by Murphy, used threats to force little 7 year old boys to perform oral sex on him. In the documentary it was said these older boys were prepping the younger boys for Father Murphy.

Murphy eventually left the school of the deaf, but served as parish priest in another church near his cabin where he lived. This new church was never told of the accusations of pedophilia. Father Murphy continued abusing little boys.



In 1974, the very first public outcry against the abuses within the church came from three young deaf men who had been abused by Father Murphy.

Although deaf and unable to speak, these young men found their voice by plastering this image of Father Murphy in their deseperate attempt to stop him from hurting other little kids.



One of the biggest crimes featured in the film is that of Father Lawrence Murphy, who abused over 200 deaf children in a Milwaukee school that he was in charge of. The victims, years later as adults, brought the first public protest against clerical abuse in the United States. It ended up becoming a lawsuit against the pontiff himself.

""This wasn't a conspiracy, this was worse than a conspiracy - the policy was to keep this absolutely secret"" - Fr. Tom Doyle, Canon Lawyer

Father Tom Doyle, a Canon lawyer, became aware of the Murphy case and was asked to evaluate some of the information. The Vatican knew there was prior reports about Murphy - but failed to act.

Initially, Father Doyle attempted to work within the system, but was told ""we don't turn our priests in, this is our problem, we take care of it.""



Father Thomas Doyle, a canon lawyer at the Vatican, co-authored a report to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in 1985 warning that if the Church did not act on the problem of sexual-predator priests it would end up costing over one billion dollars. For his efforts he was made a military chaplain and sent to an American Air Force base in Germany. The corporate culture of the Catholic Church is to protect itself from scandal at all cost. To the men who run the Church, this means hiding their dirty secrets at all cost. They hoped that by paying the money, everyone would just go away. That didn’t happen.

At one point during the documentary, Fr. Doyle is asked if he ever represented the church. He replied ""yes, I represent the church every time I step into the courtroom, because I represent the people and the people are the church.""

Money is the root of all evil

Patrick J. Wall, Former Benedictine Monk, found out during his ordination that there were treatment centers around the world for priests who sodomized and raped kids. There were 55 child molesters in his monastery - more than 70 in the archdiocese. He was shocked that this information wasn't known publicly and was even more shocked by the special assignment he was tasked with.

Patrick Wall became the ""fixer"" for the church. He would travel to sites where priests were accused of childhood sexual abuse, given a budget of $250,000 to settle with the victims, (if you could get a confidentiality signed) and was to clean up the mess - remove the offending priest, put in a new priest and get everything back to normal.



""I thought I was going there to uncover the crimes, heal the wounds, offer pastoral care. I thought I was going to care for the afflicted, you know, what we are ordained for. But the people sending me in obviously had ulterior motives.""



InHe was never told to report abuse to authorities.

Many of the priests were sent to treatment centers, like the First Servants of the Paracletes. However, when Fr. Wall found out it didn't stop, that offending priests were allowed to stay in ministry, he left the priesthood.

First Servants of the Paraclete Center was opened by Father Fitzgerald to treat pedophile priests. He believed sexual predators who abuse children should be removed from the priesthood and forced to live a life of prayer and penance.

From the 1950s to the 1990s, the Servants of the Paracletes spent more than $80 million dollars treating more than 2000 pedophile priests.



The order, the Servants of the Paraclete, closed the New Mexico facility where many Los Angeles priests were sent amid a flood of lawsuits in the mid-1990s. A lawyer for the order indicated in a 2011 civil court filing that all treatment records were destroyed.

In the recent release of files from the Los Angeles Arch Diocese, letters from the Servants of the Paraclete to then Cardinal Roger Mahony, stating:



""Once more, we ask you to PLEASE DESTROY THESE PAGES AND ANY OTHER MATERIAL YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM US,"" the acting director of the order's treatment program wrote to Mahony in 1988 in a letter detailing therapists' reports about a prolific molester. ""This is stated for your own and our legal protection.""

Cover-up at the Highest Level

Prior to his election to Pope, Cardinal Razinger served as the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) from November 1981 through April 2005.

In 2001, Ratzinger put out a teaching approved by then pope John Paull II stating every sex abuse case that involves a minor comes to Ratzinger's desk.



The year before the Globe story, then-German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was designated to oversee complaints against priests from all over the world. In that job, he ordered that every sex abuse case in the church be brought to his attention, which means that the man who is now the head of the Roman Catholic Church was once in a position to know more than any other single individual in the church about the extent of the issue of pedophilic priests.

The CDF has documents from 4th century councils in Spain, that talks about sex abuse and children.

When will we stop protecting the pedophiles and start protecting the innocent children?

http://news.yahoo.com/fundraising-then-bipartisan-display-texas-200617324--politics.html,,[],"Fundraising, then bipartisan display in Texas","DALLAS (AP) — A day before sharing the stage with his Republican predecessor, President Barack Obama raised money for Democrats at a supporter's sprawling home in Texas.

Even as he sought to build up his party on Wednesday, Obama hinted at a more bipartisan tone set to envelop Dallas on Thursday, when the Obamas attend the dedication ceremony for former President George W. Bush's presidential library. He vigorously defended the Republican whose record as president he derided in both of his presidential campaigns.

""One of the things I will insist upon is that whatever our political differences, President Bush loves this country and loves his people, and shares that same concern, and is concerned about all people in America,"" Obama said. ""Not just some. Not just those who voted Republican.""

Riffing on immigration, education, gay rights and women's issues, Obama likened the Democratic Party's values to those displayed by Americans who rushed to help strangers in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings and the fertilizer plant explosion last week in West, Texas.

""The Democratic Party, at its best, tries to give expression to that,"" Obama said.

He lamented that the sense of national unity and communal obligation that often follows such tragedies evaporates so quickly. ""Wouldn't it be something if we could somehow capture and sustain that spirit beyond tragedy?"" he said.

Obama and first lady Michelle Obama arrived in Dallas on Wednesday, greeting supporters who gathered to welcome him to this heavily Republican state before headlining a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee, still millions in debt from fueling Obama's re-election victory in November.

About 60 donors paid between $10,000 to $32,000 per ticket, said a Democratic official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss party finances. Hosting the event was Naomi Aberly, a major Obama fundraiser and prominent supporter of Planned Parenthood who credited Obama for working to protect women's reproductive rights. Former Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk, who was Obama's first-term U.S trade representative, also attended.

Story continues

""Occasionally I may make some of you angry, because I am going to reach out to Republicans. I am going to keep on doing it, even if some of you guys think I'm a sap,"" Obama said. ""But what I also believe in is that when Democrats have the opportunity to set the agenda and we don't have a country where just a few are doing really, really well, we have a country where everybody has a chance to do well.""

Obama has made a point on recent trips outside Washington of raising money for his party, following through on a commitment to mount a concerted effort to help Democratic candidates in 2014. With a divided Congress still standing in the way of much of the time, Obama hopes that victory for Democratic candidates next year will shore up prospects for realizing his second-term agenda during his last two years in office.

""Unfortunately, right now, Washington — how do I put this charitably?"" Obama said. ""It's not as functional as it should be. It could do better.""

Before returning to Washington on Thursday, Obama will also travel to Baylor University in Waco, Texas, for a memorial service for victims of the fertilizer plant explosion last week in the nearby town of West. The blast left 14 people dead and hundreds more injured.

In a recent MSNBC interview, he restocked his pantry of excuses for his disappointing results, announcing that “we have these big agencies, some of which are outdated, some of which are not designed properly”:

“We’ve got, for example, 16 different agencies that have some responsibility to help businesses, large and small, in all kinds of ways, whether it’s helping to finance them, helping them to export. . . . So, we’ve proposed, let’s consolidate a bunch of that stuff. The challenge we’ve got is that that requires a law to pass. And, frankly, there are a lot of members of Congress who are chairmen of a particular committee. And they don’t want necessarily consolidations where they would lose jurisdiction over certain aspects of certain policies.”

The dawn is coming up like thunder as Obama notices the sociology of government. He shows no sign, however, of drawing appropriate lessons from it.

Big government is indeed big, and like another big creature, the sauropod dinosaur, government has a primitive nervous system: The fact of an injury to the tail could take nearly a minute to be communicated to the sauropod brain.

Obama, of whose vast erudition we have been assured, seems unfamiliar with Mancur Olson ’s seminal “The Rise and Decline of Nations,” which explains how free societies become sclerotic. Their governments become encrusted with interest groups that preserve, like a fly in amber, an increasingly stultifying status quo. This impedes dynamism by protecting arrangements that have worked well for those powerful enough to put the arrangements in place. This blocks upward mobility for those less wired to power.

Caption From Trayvon Martin to Obamacare: Take a look at a selection of the stories that caught readers’ interests over the past year. Why liberals are panicked about Obamacare If Obamacare fails, “It will discredit Obama’s new liberalism for years to come.” By Charles Krauthammer Jessica Rinaldi/Reuters Wait 1 second to continue.

Obama, startled that components of government behave as interest groups, seems utterly unfamiliar with public choice theory. It demystifies and de-romanticizes politics by applying economic analysis — how incentives influence behavior — to government. It shows how elected officials and bureaucrats pursue personal aggrandizement as much as people do in the private sector. In the public sector’s profit motive, profit is measured by power rather than money.

Obama’s tardy epiphanies do not temper his enthusiasm for giving sauropod government ever-deeper penetration into society. He thinks this serves equality. Actually, big government inevitably drives an upward distribution of wealth to those whose wealth, confidence and sophistication enable them to manipulate government.

The day before Obama shared with MSNBC his conclusion that big government defends its irrationalities but is insufficiently big, his speech du jour deplored today’s increasing inequality and distrust of government. He seems oblivious to the mutual causations at work.

Of course Americans distrust one another more as more and more factions fight one another for preferential treatment by government. Of course government becomes drained of dignity, and becomes corrosive of social cohesion, as it becomes a bigger dispenser of inequality through benefits to those sufficiently clever and connected to work its levers.

Obama correctly says that not only do we “tend to trust our institutions less,” we also “tend to trust each other less.” Of course there are parallel increases in distrust: Government’s dignity diminishes as government grows to serve factions of those sophisticated at manipulating its allocation of preferences. Social solidarity is a casualty of government grown big because it recognizes no limits to its dispensing of favors.

Obama’s speech denounced “trickle-down ideology” and deplored growth that “has flowed to a fortunate few.” But the monetary policy he favors — very low interest rates, driving money into equities in search of higher yields — is a powerful engine of inequality. Since the Dow closed at 7,949 on Inauguration Day 2009, it has doubled , benefiting the 10 percent who hold 80 percent of directly owned stocks. The hope is that some of this wealth will trickle down.

Suppose there were not 16 government agencies “to help businesses, large and small, in all kinds of ways.” Suppose there were none. Such barnacles on big government institutionalize the scramble for government favors; these agencies are a standing incitement to bend public power for private advantage. Hence they increase distrust of government, diminish social solidarity and aggravate the most indefensible inequality — that driven by government dispensations.

Michael McCaul (R-TX) told radio’s Laura Ingraham on Wednesday that he has told House Speaker John Boehner that he must publicly promise there will be no conference committee on the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill.

“I am not going to go down the road of conferencing with the Senate bill and I told Boehner that he needs to stand up and make that very clear,” McCaul said on Ingraham’s program on Wednesday morning. “We’re not going to conference with the senate period.”

McCaul said that he believes a conference committee on the Senate immigration bill is a “political trap” that President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are trying to set. McCaul said he does not want to be caught in the trap. “I was invited to the White House yesterday and I refused to meet with the President because I saw it as a political trap,” he said.

Boehner, House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor have publicly left the door open to conference, with Ryan actually publicly advocating for one. “A lot of people are saying, just pass the Senate bill,” Ryan said in July. “That’s not what the House is going to do. I think we can make it better.”

The Senate bill’s principal GOP sponsor, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), said this weekend in a Breitbart News exclusive that he is opposed to a conference committee and does not think the House should make efforts to save his immigration bill there. Rather, Rubio said, the House should focus on what Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Jeff Sessions (R-AL) have described as a true step-by-step piecemeal immigration reform, whereby individual pieces are passed and then implemented before other pieces are taken up by Congress."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/25/news/economy/shutdown-whats-essential/index.html,2013-09-25 00:00:00,['Jeanne Sahadi'],Shutdown: What happens on Day 1,"There's still a chance lawmakers will pass a short-term funding bill before Tuesday and prevent a government shutdown.

But if they don't, then what happens?

In one of the first orders of business, a dividing line will be drawn between the federal services and workers deemed essential and non-essential.

Or, in the more delicate language of those drawing up contingency plans, ""excepted"" and ""non-excepted.""

Those in the first category will carry on operations during the shutdown. The others will power down until Congress comes to its senses and funds the government.

Workers who stay on the job during the shutdown will be paid, but they may not get their check until after it is over. Those who are furloughed are furloughed without pay but Congress may decide after the shutdown to pay them for the time off anyway.

(Related: Are Social Security payments safe?)

Essential activities are defined as anything that protects life and property.

Also in this category is the actual act of shutting down an agency for the shutdown. After all, someone's gotta hit the light switch on the way out.

And it pertains to the issuance of benefits like Social Security, funding for which is not dependent on lawmakers' annual appropriations.

In all likelihood, the decisions agencies make about how to handle a shutdown will have to pass muster with the general counsel of the White House Office of Management and Budget, as was the case during the shutdowns in the mid-1990s.

""This was entirely handled by OMB and it was all a legal determination,"" said Charles Konigsberg, who was assistant director of OMB at that time.

In past shutdowns, essential meant many things, including: air traffic control and other transportation safety, national security, the handling of hazardous waste, food inspections, border protection, maintenance of the power grid and disaster assistance.

It meant the continued payment of entitlement benefits.

And it meant collecting taxes, issuing U.S. bonds plus anything else required for the preservation of the country's banking and monetary system.

(Related: Shutdown's impact on Main Street)

What exactly will happen this time if there's a shutdown?

Federal agencies have not publicly revealed their plans yet.

But if the plans they submitted in 2011 are any guide, fewer than 40% of federal employees would be furloughed. That still represents hundreds of thousands of people, however.

The percentage for a given agency may be far higher or far lower. It all depends on how many of its activities meet the legal definition of what's excepted.

The Department of Interior said in 2011 it would furlough about 76% of its employees. The department, which oversees national parks and the U.S. geological survey, said it would keep on 9,100 people to complete shutdown activities, provide for law enforcement and safety, among other things.

Another 8,000 employees would have been kept on because they were in positions that derive funding from something other than current-year appropriations.

The Department of Defense, by contrast, indicated all military personnel on active duty would be required to report to work. Most civilian personnel, however, would have been furloughed. And the only new contracts the department would issue would be for those performing excepted duties.

Meanwhile, some positions in the federal government are automatically exempt from furloughs, like the president of the United States and members of Congress."

He Left The Post In July']",Montgomery Council votes to increase minimum wage,"The Montgomery County Council voted overwhelmingly to establish the county’s own minimum wage Tuesday, approving a historic increase that will lift the hourly rate to $11.50 by 2017 — far above the current state and federal minimum of $7.25.

The council’s action, which followed nearly four hours of tense and occasionally acrimonious debate, is the leading edge of an unusual regional effort by Montgomery, Prince George’s County and the District to raise the wage. The Prince George’s County Council is expected to vote Wednesday, and an initial vote by the D.C. Council is set for Dec. 3.

It is also part of a national movement by state and local governments to address growing wage inequality where Congress has not. The federal minimum has not been raised in four years. New Jersey, California and New York have all approved minimum wage increases this year.

The Montgomery bill increases the wage in annual steps to $8.40 in October 2014, $9.55 in 2015, $10.75 in 2016 and $11.50 in 2017.

During debate, the measure was amended to extend the phase-in period from three to four years, reflecting concerns that the wage was being raised too high and too fast. At $11.50, an individual’s annual income is $23,600 — still well below what it takes to subsist in Montgomery, where living costs are significantly above the national average.

Council member Marc Elrich (D-At Large), the bill’s chief sponsor, said that it was not politically possible to do more at the moment and that he was satisfied.

“I’m very happy. It’s substantively what I wanted,” he said. “You can make a big difference to people.”

Two of his co-sponsors, Council President Nancy Navarro (D-Mid-County) and Valerie Ervin (D-Eastern County), expressed concern that the addition of the fourth year would damage the ­chances for regional action. But D.C. and Prince George’s leaders said Tuesday evening that plans remain intact.

“In 2016 or even 2017, it’s a victory for the region,” said D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D), who made calls to Montgomery council members Tuesday in advance of the vote.

On Monday, a D.C. Council committee unanimously passed a measure to reach $11.50 by 2016, and a super­majority of council members said afterward that they would support the bill in the initial vote by the full council next week.

Prince George’s postponed action last week to wait for Montgomery’s vote. Council Chair Andrea Harrison (D-Springdale) said through a spokesman Tuesday that the council “will likely make changes to mirror Montgomery County, as long as it lessens the impact on retail businesses in Prince George’s County.”

Council member Eric Olson (D-College Park) said he was “confident” Wednesday’s vote would end in approval.

“The objective here is to improve the economic conditions of our lowest-paid workers, and this would improve the situation. Legislation sometimes is about compromises. It would still be a big step forward for our lowest-income workers,” he said.

Montgomery’s vote represents a significant legislative achievement for Elrich, a former elementary school math teacher who is regarded as the most liberal on the left-leaning, all-Democratic council. As such, he has often been the lone opposing vote on many issues.

He received a chilly reception when he first announced his intention to introduce minimum wage legislation in late August, shortly before Labor Day. Many Montgomery council members maintained that the wage was strictly a state and federal matter.

But Elrich persisted and said he developed the idea of a regional approach after speaking with business leaders who expressed concern that unilateral action by Montgomery could put the county at a competitive disadvantage. He said he reached out to Harrison at a meeting of the Maryland Association of Counties in the summer and later spoke to Mendelson.

Elrich’s cause also benefited from a national and regional political climate favorably disposed to raising the wage. National polls showed Americans overwhelmingly in favor of President Obama’s unsuccessful attempt to secure an increase.

The Montgomery council’s final 8 to 1 vote — Phil Andrews (D-Gaithersburg-Rockville) opposed the measure — papered over serious differ­ences and legal uncertainties surrounding the bill.

County attorneys told council members that the bill was limited to covering employees doing work in the county for firms “operating and doing business in the county.” Council attorney Robert Drummer said some situations — such as a landscaping company from outside the county sending workers into Montgomery — might be “problematic” from a legal standpoint and vulnerable to a court challenge.

Andrews and council member Craig Rice (D-Upcounty) unsuccessfully pressed for the council to wait for the Maryland General Assembly to act.

But others maintained that delay was not an option.

“Delaying the bill is killing the bill,” Ervin said. “Let’s have the courage to do the right thing.”

The turning point came when council member Roger Berliner (D-Potomac-Bethesda) proposed amending Elrich’s bill by raising the wage to $10.75 in 2016 and the lesser of $11.50 or $1 over the state minimum in 2017. Rice, who was expected to join Andrews, Nancy Floreen (D-At Large), Hans Riemer (D-At Large) and George L. Leventhal (D-At Large) on Berliner’s resolution, suddenly switched and agreed to back $11.50 over three years.

Berliner’s motion passed 5 to 4, but Rice’s defection effectively collapsed the coalition, setting the stage for an amendment by Elrich to raise the minimum to $11.50 over four years with no conditions attached.

His amendment passed 6 to 3, allowing the final vote to approve the wage increase."
http://news.yahoo.com/politicians-beating-latest-polls-133806385.html,,[],Politicians take a beating in latest polls,"Polling numbers are starting to roll in after last week’s deal in Washington to end the shutdown and raise the debt ceiling. And it looks like the folks on Capitol Hill face some historically bad numbers that could foreshadow a rocky midterm election in 2014.

In a CNN/ORC International poll released Monday morning, the backlash seems to be mostly against Republicans, but other recent surveys spread the blame more equally.

The CNN poll said that 31 percent of those surveyed had more faith in House Republicans than President Obama to handle major problems facing the country. In comparison, 44 percent of people had more faith in President Obama.

That is actually a worse number than the GOP received in 1996, when Republicans faced criticism for a government shutdown that featured Speaker Newt Gingrich taking on President Bill Clinton. The bad feelings against the GOP in 1996 were seen as a contributing factor in Bob Dole’s defeat in that year’s election against Clinton.

Also in the CNN poll, 12 percent of people thought Congress was doing a good job, a number near its historic low of 10 percent, which was set last month. Back during the 1995-1996 shutdown, the congressional approval rating stood at 30 percent.

And in two other questions that might concern Republicans, the favorability rating of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, was up 4 percentage points from late September, despite headlines about its website problems and withering attacks on the ACA by Republicans.

Americans also are clearly unhappy with John Boehner, with 63 percent saying he should be removed as Speaker of the House.

A Pew Research poll from last week showed low numbers for President Obama and Democrats, as well as the Republicans.

“Approval ratings for President Obama (43 percent approve), Democratic congressional leaders (31 percent) and GOP leaders (20 percent) all are at or near all-time lows, yet are not substantially more negative than they were in early September, a month before the shutdown started,” Pew said.

Story continues

Pew said the 20 percent approval rating for GOP leaders was driven by unrest among Republicans.

In the Pew survey, 74 percent of Americans wanted to see most members of Congress defeated if they ran for re-election. That is a record in the survey for data gathered back to 1990 about midterm elections. (The previous record was 57 percent in 1996.)

Over at Gallup, polling data released Monday show that President Obama’s approval rating was down after the debt debacle, but not at its historic low.

It stands at 44.5 percent in his 19th quarter as president. In comparison, President George W. Bush had a 43.9 percent rating as the same point in his second term.

During the shutdown, other polls showed growing dissatisfaction with Congress.

An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll said 60 percent of those Americans surveyed said they would replace the entire Congress in the same election if they could—including their own representative. About 31 percent of those polled blamed Obama for the budget breakdown, while 44 percent blamed Republicans in Congress.

A Fox News poll from October 3 found that the disapproval rating of Congress stood at 81 percent. Fox said 45 percent of Americans had a favorable view of Democrats, in general, with the Republicans stood at 35 percent.

Another Gallup poll showed the favorability of the GOP fell 10 percent between September and October, to 28 percent, its lowest rating since Gallup started asking the question in 1992. The Democrats were down 4 percent to 43 percent for the same time period.

And in a telltale sign, 25 percent of Americans said they didn’t like either party.

About 60 percent of Americans—the same number that would vote out Congress—would favor the creation of a third political party.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/25/Christmas-Obama-pay-raise,2013-12-25 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],Santa Obama Gives Pay Raise to Federal Workers,"Just in time for Christmas, President Obama signed an executive order on Monday giving a 1 percent pay raise for federal employees. The raise follows a four year hiatus from salary increases for federal workers, although most federal employees have apparently seen their pay increase via promotion or performance. The first increased paycheck will kick in on January 1.

President Obama’s reward to the federal workforce follows his longstanding belief that government work ought to be a first option for Americans. Nonetheless, Obama’s decision to raise federal pay only widens the income inequality gap between federal workers and private sector employees; as of 2011, the average private sector employee made $59,804 in salary, and $28,000 in benefits, while the average federal workers made $74,436 in salary and $40,000 in benefits.

Furthermore, the gap between Washington, D.C. culture and the rest of the country is growing ever larger. Between 2000 and 2012, according to Census Bureau statistics, Washington, D.C. household income jumped 23.3%; the rest of the country, by contrast, dropped 6.6%. As the Wall Street Journal reported, “The Washington, D.C. metro area — which includes the surrounding suburbs in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia — has it even better, with a median household income of $88,233 that ranks highest among the U.S.’s 25 most populous metro areas.”

But Washington, D.C. remains completely dichotomous, with the percentage of residents living 50% below the poverty line increasing 1% during that period.

President Obama’s Christmas present to his federal friends will amount to nothing more than another lump of coal in the rest of America’s stocking.

(CNN) - President Barack Obama said Hillary Clinton will go down ""as one of the finest secretaries of state"" as he sat next to her in their first joint interview Sunday night on CBS's ""60 Minutes.""

""The main thing is I just wanted to have a chance to publicly say 'thank you,'"" he said when asked why he wanted to do the interview with his former political foe.



""It has been a great collaboration over the last four years,"" he continued. ""I'm going to miss her, wish she was sticking around, but she has logged in so many miles I can't begrudge her wanting to take it easy for a little bit.""

Nearly 1 million miles and 112 countries, in fact, she said Wednesday when she appeared before congressional committees to testify about last year's attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

Now, Clinton is set to depart the world stage - at least for now, as she has been floated as a presidential contender in 2016. She appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week in support of Sen. John Kerry, the man Obama tapped to replace her.

While Clinton has talked about the wear and tear of the job and recently had a health scare, she said in the ""60 Minutes"" interview that she found working with Obama and serving as her nation's top diplomat extremely satisfying.

""This has been just an extraordinary opportunity to work with him as a partner and friend and to do our very best,"" she said. ""It's something that I'm going to miss a great deal.""

While Clinton and Obama competed bitterly in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, the two have been highly complimentary of each other during the president's first term. In the interview that aired Sunday, Clinton said such a public sit-down would have been ""improbable"" a few years ago because ""we had that very long, hard primary campaign.""

""But, you know, I've gone around the world on behalf of the president and our country, and one of the things that I say to people - because I think it helps them understand - I say, look, in politics and in democracy, sometimes you win elections and sometimes you lose elections. And I worked very hard, but I lost. And then President Obama asked me to be secretary of state, and I said yes. And why did he ask me, and why did I say yes? Because we both love our country.""

Not only has Hillary Clinton played a big role in Obama's first four years of office, but her husband and former President Bill Clinton also was a crucial part of Obama's re-election bid last year. The 42nd president appeared on the stump for Obama in key swing states and had a prime-time speaking spot at the Democratic National Convention.

While admitting that their respective staffs may have had a difficult time getting over rancor from the 2008 primary, Obama said that it was not as hard for him.

The president said that even before they both ran for president, he had admired Clinton's ""discipline, her thoughtfulness, her ability to project and make issues that were clear."" Those attributes, as well as her standing as ""already a world figure,"" made her a smart choice for secretary of state - even if she didn't initially jump at the opportunity.

""We're both gluttons for punishment,"" she said jokingly of her decision to take the job despite numerous global challenges and the president having his hands full dealing with an economic crisis at home.

Obama said he had always respected Clinton and knew she would excel, but what changed over the years is that they became ""strong"" friends.

It was a sentiment echoed by Clinton, who described her relationship with her boss as ""very warm, close.""

""I think there's a sense of understanding that sometimes doesn't even take words,"" she said.

As a former popular first lady, U.S. senator and now secretary of state, experts say Clinton is well-positioned to be the Democratic frontrunner if she seeks a White House bid in 2016. But presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said much of her decision will largely depend on her health.

""She needs rest. She's exhausted,"" he said Sunday on CNN's Newsroom. Clinton returned to work earlier this month after being treated for illness, a concussion and blood clot near her brain. ""She needs to work on a memoir, she'll probably give speeches. At that point, in about 18 months or two years, they have a big decision to make.""

Brinkley described her as ""somebody who does not lack ambition"" and will be highly influenced by the ""ability to break the glass ceiling and be the first female president.""

""The question is whether she's up for the exhaustion of going to the Iowa caucus, in New Hampshire, in South Carolina and having (Monica) Lewinsky and other issues from the '90s come back and haunt her in some ways,"" Brinkley said. ""Does she have that fight in her?""

http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/07/us/pentagon-sexual-assault-report/index.html,2013-05-07 00:00:00,"['Steve Almasy', 'Ashley Fantz']",Survey indicates troubling trend in military sexual assaults,"Story highlights Study sought to survey 108,000 troops, only 24% responded Defense department extrapolated figures from results Hagel: ""One of most serious challenges"" for the armed services Air Force officials face tough questions from senators

(CNN) —

The number of service members anonymously reporting a sexual assault grew by more than 30% in the past two years, according to a Pentagon report released Tuesday.

The Defense Department estimated that more than 26,000 troops experienced an episode of “unwanted sexual contact,” a huge jump from the 19,300 figure in the 2010 report.

“Sexual assault is a despicable crime and one of the most serious challenges facing this department,” Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters at a briefing on the survey. “It’s a threat to the safety and the welfare of our people and to the health, reputation and trust of this institution.”

The actual number of sexual crimes reported in the fiscal year 2012 was 3,374, a 6% increase over the previous year, the report said. Military officials worry that many victims don’t come forward because they are frightened of retaliation. But the numbers might indicate that more victims are willing to report crimes than in the past.

After officer charged in sex assault, military faces questions

Hagel said victims need to be made confident they can rely on the military’s justice system and that commanders will be held responsible.

On Tuesday, lawmakers reiterated that it’s crucial that service members feel they can come forward when they’ve been violated.

The Defense Department has stepped up efforts to hold perpetrators accountable, establishing a special victims unit to handle cases, working to improve tracking of reports and speeding transfers for troops who report a sexual assault by a member of their unit.

But President Obama stressed that there must be a harder push in the military to reduce sexual assaults involving service members.

“I don’t want just more speeches or awareness programs or training but … if we find out somebody is engaging in this stuff, they are going to be held accountable,” Obama said. “Prosecuted, stripped of their positions, court-martialed, fired, dishonorably discharged. Period. It is not acceptable.”

Maj. Gen. Gary Patton, the head of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office for the military, said that while the prevalence rate was “unacceptably high,” the report did indicate one positive trend. The percentage of people who initially filed restricted reports (That remain confidential) but changed to unrestricted had risen.

After sex assault case, Hagel seeks changes to military legal process

“We see that as a sign of victim confidence, willingness to … take their case into the law enforcement realm,” he said.

The Defense Department data from 2010 to 2012 found that the prevalence of unwanted sexual contact increased for active duty women and remained unchanged for active duty men, and men and women in the reserves.

Meanwhile on Tuesday, top Air Force officials faced questions at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about an Air Force officer accused of sexual assault.

Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, 41, served as a branch chief for the service’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program. He was arrested and charged with sexual battery over the weekend and had been removed from current duty, an Air Force official said Monday. The official declined to be named because it is an ongoing law enforcement matter.

Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri asked Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh and Air Force Secretary Michael Donley what qualified Krusinski for the job in the sex assault prevention program.

Krusinski is a personnel officer by training and has spent the last two-and-a-half years working on Air Force staff in policy, Welsh replied.

“He was a force support squadron commander before coming to the Pentagon.” Force support squadron addresses issues such as sexual assault coordination councils in active Air Force units, Welsh said. “He’s been around the business his entire career as a personnel officer.”

Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York had strong words.

“If the man in charge for the Air Force in preventing sexual assault is being alleged to have committed a sexual assault this weekend obviously there’s a failing in training and understanding of what sexual assault is and how corrosive and damaging it is to good order and discipline and how it is undermining the credibility of the greatest military force in the world,” she said. “This is not good enough.”

McCaskill pressed Donley and Welsh.

“Did you look at his file for any kind of problems related – I mean, clearly, the accusation is that he was drunk and sexually attacked a complete stranger in a parking lot,” McCaskill said. “It is hard for me to believe that someone would be accused of that behavior by a complete stranger and not have anything in their file that would indicate a problem in that regard.

“Have you looked at his file and determined that his file was absolutely pristine?” the senator asked.

Military rape victims: Stop blaming us

“Senator, I looked at his officer record of performance which is all I could access last night. I talked to his current supervisor,” Welsh said. “I haven’t talked to people who knew him or supervised him in the past. There is no indication in his professional record of performance or his current work place that there’s any type of a problem like this.”

Earlier Tuesday, Welsh said sexual assault response efforts are critically important to the Air Force and the branch “would not quit working this problem.”

In March, members of the military who were sexually assaulted gave dramatic and anguished testimony to congressional lawmakers.

A former Army specialist described being raped in two different instances while she was in the service and how she felt that the military’s chain of command was failing at consistently prosecuting and convicting offenders.

At that hearing, high-ranking members of each branch assured lawmakers that they were working hard to end sexual assault in the armed forces.

Lt. Gen. Richard C. Harding, an Air Force judge advocate general, told lawmakers that the branch started a program in January that provides airmen who report being victimized with an attorney to represent them.

The attorneys operate independently of the prosecution’s chain of command, he said.

Sixteen presidents before Barack Obama got a second chance at giving an inaugural address for the ages. Here are some of them.

The President Obama who will be publicly inaugurated to a second term Monday is a very different political man than he was four years ago. He is harder and harder-edged, both more confident in what he can do and more aware of what he can’t. He remains a political pragmatist, but a far more wary one. He is older and, it would seem — politically, at least — wiser.

Put simply: Obama seems to have learned the right lessons from what was by any measure a surprisingly rocky first term in office. Below are the three main lessons that the past four years taught him and how they inform the man who will take the inauguration stage Monday.

● Stop negotiating with yourself. One of the defining characteristics of Obama’s first-term legislative agenda was his problematic approach to political negotiations. His strategy was flawed in two ways: (1) He started where he wanted to end up policy-wise, giving him little room to negotiate without giving away things he badly wanted, and (2) his attempt to kick-start stalled talks was to publicly (and privately) negotiate with himself, a move that further weakened his bargaining position.

Although Obama ultimately won big fights with Congress over the economic stimulus plan and health-care legislation, the political pain — both for him and for his party — was significant. And his willingness to extend the George W. Bush-era tax cuts for two years after the 2010 midterm elections was cast by the Democratic base as something close to a total capitulation.

Fast-forward to today. Obama’s unwillingness to back off his campaign pledge of raising taxes on the wealthy delivered him a political victory on the “fiscal cliff.” And his repeated assertion that the debt ceiling couldn’t be used as a bargaining chip for Republicans led the GOP to cave, setting up a vote to extend the nation’s credit limit through April 15.

View Graphic INTERACTIVE | The age of Obama: See how unabated stress has changed the president over the past four years.

● Partisanship > personality. When Obama won the presidency in 2008, he clearly believed that he could break the partisan deadlock in Congress solely by force of personality. His life up to that point provided him evidence for that belief — most notably the fact that he had upended former first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic nomination (a victory that was close to unimaginable even a year before it happened) and then cruised to a general-election victory to become the first African American president in the country’s history. Not too shabby.

But that seemingly unstoppable force of personality ran head-on into the immovable object of partisanship in the nation’s capital — and the immovable object won. No one, not even a figure who shot into the political stratosphere as quickly as Obama, was able to fundamentally alter the political process by personality alone.

In his first news conference of 2013, Obama acknowledged that reality when asked about whether he socialized enough with Republicans, and particularly with House Speaker John Boehner (Ohio). “When we went out and played golf, we had a great time, but that didn’t get a deal done in 2011,” the president said, adding later: “When I’m over here at the congressional picnic and folks are coming up and taking pictures with their family . . . we have a wonderful time, but it doesn’t prevent them from going onto the floor of the House and . . . blasting me for being a big-spending socialist.”

●You can’t control the message. Obama is the first president to govern in the age of social media and one of the first to govern at a time when political cable talk shows are all the rage. The pace at which news travels today would have been unimaginable to, say, George W. Bush when he first came into office — and that was little more than a decade ago.

What the explosion of Twitter as a news — or maybe the news — vehicle and cable television as the place where political stories are made or broken means for a president is that the idea of driving any particular message for a week (or even a day) is a thing of the past. Being president, or serving the president at a senior staff level, means having to be willing to change the plan to adjust to new realities. Given the way news can go viral in minutes, it’s impossible to distinguish a political molehill from a political mountain anymore.

And so you can’t ignore anything — even if you believe it to be beneath contempt — because it can keep churning without you doing a thing. Need proof? How about Obama’s decision to hold a media event in which he showed his birth certificate in an attempt to end chatter that he wasn’t born in the United States? Can you imagine any past president having to do such a thing for a “story” that was driven by a fringe of American politics?

Being flexible and hyper-aware is the name of the game. Messaging in the vortex of social media and cable television isn’t impossible, but it is in­cred­ibly difficult."

That’s a 7.4% increase from last year, with an average wait time of 273 days. Nationally there are 587,351 veterans who have waited more than 125 days.

In Cleveland where Tom’s disability was filed in 1971, then again in 1999, and for a 3rd time one year ago this month, there is a backlog of 25,273 claims, up 16.4% over last year, with a wait time of 334 days. Waiting more than 125 days are 18,971 disability claims. Tom’s claim has gone through that hurtle. The claims examiner ignored Tom’s psychiatric hospitalization and continued care since 1971 by saying that the military medical records from Germany were insufficient proof.

Tom now joins 273,714 whose claims have gone to the appeals process. Of that group 14% or 38,320 will be wrongly decided according to the VA. Hosea Roundtree shares Tom’s experience. Before you criticize the claims examiner, watch this YouTube [5:19 minutes long].



http://youtu.be/...

The difference between Hosea Roundtree and Tom is that Tom is on dialysis. He is so thin that normal body fat which cushions the impact of the needles required to administer the procedure are very painful. That pain makes him nauseous and the weight he needs to gain is never forthcoming.

How long Tom can last under these conditions is anyone’s guess – but, on average his case will take another 2 ½ years before it is heard. Here is the ugly truth: The VA has no reason to hurry these appeals. Should the veteran die before the case is adjudicated either initially or at the appeals level, the case dies with him. His spouse [and Tom has none] may get something but other heirs get nothing.

That’s just wrong. It is patently unfair. That needs to change. There ought to be a law. If a critically ill Veteran dies while their disability claim is pending an initial decision or if the claim has gone to the appeal level, as is the case with Tom, the case must survive as a part of the Veteran’s estate. There are 38,320 Veterans whose families deserve the chance to get a correct answer. So here’s my plea:



Please ask your Congressman and Senators to sponsor legislation that requires the Veterans Administration to make this change: Should a veteran die before their Veteran's disability case is adjudicated either initially or at the appeals level, the disability case survives as part of the Veteran’s estate.

From Richard Cranium:

It’s a sad day when an obscure, oddball 2010 Senate candidate from Delaware (who is NOT Christine O’Donnell) gets the VA benefits claim process workflow about right: 6. Did the veteran die or commit suicide?

- If Yes then the claim is complete.

- If No then go to step 7.

prev Image 2 of 2

President Barack Obama may have messed with the wrong stage mom.

Kim Kardashian’s momager Kris Jenner used her new talk show platform to slam the President over comments he made about Kim and her boyfriend Kanye West.

Back in July, Obama said in an interview that he feels Kardashian and West have negatively impacted children’s views of the world.

""I do think what's shifted is a notion that the wealthier you are, the more conspicuous consumption you engage in. The more successful you are, the more society should stay out of your way as you pursue the bigger house or the fancier jet or the bigger yacht,"" Obama said.

""Were there things that all of us might have liked to have? Sure. But partly, I think, there also has been a shift in culture. We weren't exposed to things we didn't have in the same way kids these days are. There was not that window into the lifestyles of the rich and famous,"" the president said. ""Kids weren't monitoring every day what Kim Kardashian was wearing, or where Kanye West was going on vacation, and thinking that somehow that was the mark of success.""

Jenner was not too pleased with the President’s analysis… to say the least.

""I bet the president has some friends with 10,000-square-foot houses and you probably wouldn't mind going over there, Mr. President while you were asking them to have a party for you when you were campaigning for dollars to run for president,"" Jenner fired back.

Plus, she noted, the President’s house is pretty nice too.



""I started thinking about her 10,000-square-foot house,"" Jenner said. ""I thought, wow, her job affords her to live in a 10,000-square-foot house. And I think, if I'm not mistaken, that Mr. President's job affords him to live in a 55,000-square-foot house. So basically my house would fit in his entry.""

She added that she did not see how Kardashian and West were ruining kids’ views of success.

Lindsey Graham for supporting immigration reform, a GOP group came to his aid. So did the other team.

“We came up with the money,” said Frank Sharry, founder and executive director of America’s Voice, a Washington-based group with close ties to the Obama White House. “We were just frustrated that nobody was doing anything, and Graham was under attack. We said, ‘Fine, we will put money in.’”

Sharry’s group, knowing an ad sponsored by a left-leaning advocacy group could hurt Graham, donated $60,000 to Republicans for Immigration Reform, a super PAC started by President George W. Bush’s former Commerce secretary, Carlos Gutierrez, and GOP fundraiser Charlie Spies.

An unprecedented collection of political bedfellows has coalesced this year on the reform side of the immigration debate: liberal Latino organizations and Republican operatives, the Chamber of Commerce and labor unions, faith groups and high-tech companies. And as with the Sharry contribution, some left-leaning groups are financing Republican pro-immigration groups.

The result is a flood of money for advertising, lobbying and field organizing aimed at convincing Republicans in Congress to create a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, authorize more temporary work visas and increase security on the border with Mexico.

During the first half of the year, reform backers outspent opponents in advertising by more than 3 to 1: $2.4 million to $700,000, according to Kantar Media’s Campaign Media Analysis Group. They also hired a battalion of lobbyists. In the second quarter, 527 businesses, advocacy groups and others reported lobbying on immigration, up from 389 in the first three months of the year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Some of that spending is about to show up in targeted campaigns in House districts. Advocates are trying to keep up the pressure when members are home during the five-week August recess — or “Action August,” as President Obama called it last month. But the biggest spending is likely to come this fall, when the House is expected to take up a series of immigration bills.

“We will see a significant ramp-up of activities in August and September,” said Tom Snyder, who runs the campaign effort for the labor giant AFL-CIO. Some Republican House members have already started to soften their opposition to reform, he said, especially in districts with tens of thousands of union members. “What you are seeing is not an avalanche but a stream starting to trickle in our direction.”

The last time Congress took up the issue, in 2007, anti-immigration groups mounted a fierce grass-roots campaign and succeeded in defining the bill as “amnesty” for lawbreakers. This time, advocates have launched a preemptive strike.

“I’ve heard it said, it could be lost in August but not won in August,” said Spies, a lawyer who formed Republicans for Immigration Reform to provide “political cover.”

The AFL-CIO has spent $418,998 to run ads in at least six states and plans to spend more than $1 million in August and September targeting 40 Republicans in the House. The Service Employees International Union started a $200,000 radio campaign aimed at Republican congressmen in 10 districts with growing Latino populations, including four Californians: Jeff Denham (Atwater), Howard P. “Buck” McKeon (Santa Clarita), Gary G. Miller (Diamond Bar) and David Valadao (Hanford).

Two moderate Republican organizations also have participated. The American Action Network spent $182,085 on television ads, and Americans for a Conservative Direction spent $105,251 for ads in six states, according to Kantar Media.

FWD.us, an advocacy group founded by Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and funded by top tech executives, announced plans last week to spend more than $500,000 on ads featuring a young Chicago man who wants to become a Marine but can’t because he came to the country illegally as a 7-month-old.

Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes boosting immigration levels, said his side was badly outgunned. The tide of corporate money has moved the debate away from the promise of the poem on the Statue of Liberty to welcome the tired, the poor and the freedom-seekers, he said.

“Now, it’s give us your industrial and farm workers who are low-wage and poorly educated, or give us the technical talent from somebody else’s economy,” Stein said.

The immigration debate has drawn attention, and money, from a vast array of businesses: notably the tech industry, which wants more H-1B visas for highly trained foreign workers, but also other industries that rely heavily on immigrant labor, including agriculture and hotels. Since March, companies and trade groups signed up 76 more lobbying firms, according to the Sunlight Foundation and the Center for Responsive Politics.

Microsoft Corp. has been among the most active. In addition to its in-house lobbying operation, the company has paid lobbyists from 15 firms this year to press the case on Capitol Hill.

Fred Humphries, vice president for government affairs, said Microsoft supported reform efforts that would increase high-tech visas because U.S. colleges do not graduate enough computer scientists. “In the U.S. today, Microsoft has approximately 3,500 research and engineering jobs we can’t fill,” he said.

The business lobby’s influence on Republican lawmakers was on vivid display this spring. In March, Utah’s Republican senators, Orrin G. Hatch and Mike Lee, urged the Senate to slow down on immigration reform. That didn’t sit well at the Salt Lake City Chamber of Commerce, where many members had been agitating to increase high-tech visas. At a news conference, the chamber’s president threatened to mount a recall of Hatch and Lee.

Hatch soon changed course. He became a key player in the talks that led the Senate to approve a bipartisan bill authorizing up to 180,000 high-tech visas — nearly triple the current number.

The business spending has been welcomed by immigration advocates.

“For the first time, I am seeing business actually put political muscle into this campaign. In the past, it was more like lip service,” said Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union and a key strategist for the immigration reform forces.

One congressman who has felt the squeeze is Rep. Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican elected in 2008 in the district once represented by the vociferously anti-immigration Tom Tancredo. In 2012, the district was redrawn to include Aurora, one of the most immigrant-dense cities in the state.

Among the pro-reform groups lobbying Coffman were evangelical church members, part of a grass-roots effort financed by Zuckerberg’s FWD.us, a Christian family foundation and a hedge-fund manager who is a major Republican donor.

“That has never happened before,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, which was the conduit for the money. Noorani’s organization typically draws financial support from progressives.

During the Senate debate this spring, Coffman’s Colorado office was deluged with calls and petitions, said Dustin Zvonek, his district director. Ten days in a row, evangelical churchgoers held prayer vigils in the office.

Coffman endorsed comprehensive reform last month.

That decision brought him $275,000 worth of positive TV commercials from Americans for a Conservative Direction — also funded by FWD.us. “On immigration, too many members of Congress argue with each other, but our congressman, Mike Coffman, listened to us,” the ad said.

Rob Jesmer, campaign manager for FWD.us and a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said the group would run other such ads to back lawmakers who took a political risk:

“We want to be helpful to members of Congress who are willing to take a courageous leadership position.”

State Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) has introduced legislation that could extend the last call for alcohol in some California cities until 4 a.m.

“This legislation would allow destination cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego to start local conversations about the possibility of expanding night life and the benefits it could provide the community by boosting jobs, tourism and local tax revenue,” Leno said.

Currently, the state allows the sale of alcohol from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. for bars, nightclubs and restaurants. Leno’s bill would let cities get permission from the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to allow their nightspots to extend their hours for serving alcohol.

Leno said the change could mean a boost to the California economy. He cited a study by the market research firm Technomic Inc. that found the top 100 grossing social and night life venues in the country generated $1.5 billion last year and 15 of them were in the Los Angeles area.

But all of the top 10 venues are in cities that have extended hours, including Las Vegas, New York and Miami, the firm found.

Not everyone is sold on the idea.

Leno’s proposal is “terrible,” said Alan Dymond, president of the Studio City Residents Assn. Dymond said many clubs and restaurants along Ventura Boulevard back up to homes affected by noise and traffic at closing time.

“For our members, that extension of hours would just increase the aggravation,” Dymond said.

Senate Republican leader Robert Huff of Diamond Bar said Leno’s proposal raises a lot of questions, including its effect on drunk driving rates, and needs more study.

Advertisement

Some of the same concerns explain the opposition to the idea by Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, according to spokesman Steve Whitmore. People, he said, “don’t need to have two more hours for drinking.”

SB 635 is supported by industry groups, including the California Restaurant Assn. and the San Francisco Council of District Merchants.

The change could mean a lot more revenue for California businesses and would make operations easier, said Tony Palermo, the owner of Tony P’s Dockside Grill in Marina del Rey.

“A lot of people don’t want to stop [drinking] at 2 a.m. and then you become the bad guy” enforcing the curfew, said Palermo, past president of the Los Angeles chapter of the California Restaurant Assn.

A likely possibility: An increase in a passenger security fee that industry lobbyists warn could add to the price of plane tickets.

Lawmakers face a January 15 deadline if they want to replace some of the automatic spending cuts known as the sequester. But that will require making other spending cuts or raising revenue to preserve the sequester's intended savings.

Airline advocates argue that an increase in the security fee to reduce deficits would do nothing to strengthen airport security or speed up long security lines.

Right now the passenger security fee per ticket is $2.50 for each leg of a trip. But the total fee to get to a destination is capped at $5.

Say you book a nonstop roundtrip to Chicago. You pay $2.50 on the way out and $2.50 on the way back. If you booked flights with stopovers each way, you'd pay $5 on the way out and $5 for your return home.

If Congress goes ahead with a hike in user fees, political analysts and the airline industry expect lawmakers would double the security fee to $5 per trip each way. That would effectively double the fee for nonstop flights, but leave the fee for multi-leg trips unchanged.

Related: Airlines rake in $27 billion in customer fees

It's not clear how much of the increase would be passed on to fliers.

""Each airline will take a different approach. It will manifest [either] as the passenger pays, the airline pays or a little bit of both,"" said Sean Kennedy, senior vice president for global government affairs at the trade group Airlines for America.

Doubling the passenger security fee for nonstop flights could raise about $13 billion over the next decade if it went into effect immediately, or $11 billion if it started in 2015, said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

But that would only make up for some of the budget cuts that lawmakers are seeking to replace.

That's why analysts expect that negotiators also may propose hikes in other user fees, as well as an increase in broadband spectrum sales, and higher federal worker retirement contributions, among other measures.

Raising users fees gives both parties a political out.

The Republicans can say that they guarded against any tax increases because higher user fees simply count as more revenue -- i.e., not an actual income tax increase on wages or investments.

And Democrats can say that they avoided deeper cuts in domestic programs as well as changes to Medicare and Social Security."

Levin, who had hoped to vote as early as Thursday, put it off after more than two dozen Republicans pressed Hagel to provide additional financial information about corporations and other organizations he's been associated with since leaving Congress.

Levin said he will send a letter to those Republicans informing them of his view and then schedule a vote.

Levin said he is ""confident"" Hagel will be confirmed and complained Republicans are trying to use their ""imagination"" and ""political creativity"" to block Hagel.

Hagel is on Capitol Hill Thursday meeting with as many as seven Democratic senators, a source familiar with the confirmation told CNN. The meetings were long planned and did not come as a result of the decision not to hold the committee vote today.

Among the senators who met with Hagel are: Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Tom Harkin of Iowa.

By the end of the week, Hagel will have met with about 75 senators to press his case, the source said.

Story highlights Congress spent more time in office this year but got less done Some Republicans argue that it's number of bad bills stopped that shows effectiveness ""It's been getting worse and worse every year,"" veteran Democrat says Long-time Republican says, ""I think we've been working less""

(CNN) —

Congress set off for a two-week recess Friday, flying out of Washington under a dark cloud: the “Do-nothing” label. But that term is too easy. If you take a closer look, it turns out the better fit may be the “wasted-time” Congress.

The terms “do-nothing” and “Congress” may be so cemented together that the phrase no longer tells us much. At the moment, it may sound redundant.

In 2013, Congress spent more time at the office but got less done with it than at any time in recent history.

How much got done?

Let’s start there. There are many measures of congressional activity, but one has sparked the “do-nothing” label: Bills passed.

• Bills passed 2013: 64

• Where does that place?: That is the lowest amount in modern history.

• What about recent years?: 148 (’12), 90 (’11), 258 ('10) and 125 ('09). The lowest figure during President George W. Bush’s term was 136, double the amount passed this year.

Lawmakers pass more blame than bills

Wait, bills passed does not mean “good” bills passed. This is true. And it is a key argument for Republicans especially.

“It’s not how many bills you pass,” Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, told CNN, “It’s how many you stop. A lot of them are bad.”

This is what we’re getting at here by bucking the “do-nothing” label. It does not capture the extent of the problem in Congress.

6 reasons why 2013 was a bad year for Obama

How else can you measure the mess on Capitol Hill?

By the hundreds of hours it took Congress to get so little done.

Days in session? We could look at the days in session, which were officially more than 150 for both the House and Senate. That is average for the Senate and way above average for the House.

But those figures can be misleading: They include “pro-forma” sessions when the House and Senate are not really in Washington.

Instead, consider time in session

• Senate time in session: More than 1,098 hours.

• House time in session: More than 786 hours. .

• Relatively: That’s higher than average for the Senate over the past 30 years. And lower than average for the House.

Senate clears key nominations, leaves town for Christmas

And there were issues that both parties pledged to address, but left unresolved in that work time. To name a few:

• Jobs, long-term unemployment

• Immigration

• Energy policy

In other words, Congress spent hundreds of hours in Washington – far more than average for the Senate – and still was not able to address most of the biggest issues of the day.

“It’s a lot of wasted time,” Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, told CNN, her frustrated tone at odds with her bright holiday red sweater. ” Ridiculous… It’s exhausting… It’s been getting worse and worse every year. Exponentially. There are so many issues we could be dealing with, and we’re so discouraged.”

This is perhaps the greatest area of bipartisan agreement: Congress is in Washington, but doing less.

“I think we’ve been working less, to be honest with you,” Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said as he left the last Senate vote of the year.

When asked about the increased hours in the Senate, he was quick to respond, “The number of hours doing nothing? Yes, absolutely.”

There is a pervasive sense of frustration mixed with no clear path toward a better, more able Congress.

“I think a majority of the members are trying… and hope that getting back to where the Congress does its job is just right around the next corner,” said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, who previously served as the Republican whip in the House. He lowered is voice. “And we keep turning that corner and finding out we’re not there yet. And that’s frustrating.”

It is a combination of doing relatively little, but taking an enormous amount of time doing it.

“A lot of wasted time to me,” Boxer repeated.

Voters don’t get to conduct a casting call or sift through hundreds of applicants until they identify the ideal candidate, but must instead choose from a field prescreened by the political and fundraising processes. This year that field fails to include a candidate who stands out as the obviously superior choice. The task for voters then becomes to scrutinize track records, eliminate the worst hazards and seek potential that can be forged, with the proper pressure and continued voter vigilance, into accomplishment.

The candidate with the most potential to rise to the occasion and lead Los Angeles out of its current malaise and into a more sustainable and confident future is Eric Garcetti.

Voters must be frank with themselves about Garcetti, who as a member of the City Council for nearly 12 years and its president for six must bear some responsibility for the city’s current fiscal problems, which were dramatically worsened when the council negotiated employee contracts that were unaffordable, leading to a budget too far out of balance, and leading, in turn, to deep cuts in services.

ENDORSEMENTS: Los Angeles City Elections 2013

But frankness also requires scrutiny of Garcetti’s role in beginning to correct the problems. For the most part, he has performed well. As council president, he worked behind the scenes to awaken his colleagues to the depth of the city’s financial crisis and to take action they did not want to take, imposing layoffs and requiring those remaining in the workforce to shoulder more of the burden of their medical and pension benefits. At times when Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa should have been on hand to close difficult negotiations, the task was left to Garcetti, and he came through. He antagonized his allies in labor, not because he wanted to but because he saw that he had to. That fact undermines the too-common chatter that he lacks backbone.

His style as council president was not always satisfying to outside observers, who like to hear leaders talk tough or watch them crack heads. Garcetti used finesse. He knew who he was leading, he knew how to get from them what was needed and he knew how to count votes. He knew how to get the job done, and he did it — or at least as much of it as could be done at the time. Los Angeles will look in vain for its Ed Koch or its Richard Daley, because the job here simply isn’t tailored for that kind of swagger. Successful mayors of Los Angeles — like Tom Bradley — must be experts in the art of finesse. Garcetti is such an expert.

They also must be experts in using the tools at their disposal to create a vibrant and livable city. Voters should be inspired by Garcetti’s stewardship of Council District 13. His predecessors may have laid the foundation for the revival of Hollywood, but Garcetti closed the deal with creative land-use decisions and community outreach that returned an edgy spark to the neighborhood while attracting new business and providing new housing for families living on the margins. Under his guidance, Atwater Village has blossomed, Glassell Park is on the verge, Silver Lake and Echo Park are cultural touchstones, East Hollywood neighborhoods have claimed their identity. He added many acres of badly needed park space. He brought to his job a deft mixture of community organizing, development, outreach and leadership. He has not left everyone in his district happy, because he has made choices — and that’s a good thing. It requires a measure of courage, and is an indication of leadership. Along the way he championed programs in his district to deter gang violence and fight quality-of-life crimes such as graffiti, and they became models for citywide successes.

VIDEO: Interviews with L.A.'s mayoral candidates

Many of Garcetti’s achievements have parallels in the downtown and South Los Angeles district of Jan Perry, who is also running for mayor. Perry’s warnings about the budget and employee compensation were earlier and firmer than Garcetti’s, and her penchant for speaking her mind, no matter the consequences, is appealing. So why not Perry for mayor? In large part because her strengths are also her weaknesses, and they too often undermine her. The highest-profile example is her battle with Garcetti’s successor as council president, Herb Wesson Jr., a fight that by her own account resulted in her district being redrawn as the city’s poorest, encompassing only a fraction of the resource-heavy downtown it previously did. Voters need not shy away from Perry merely because she can be combative, but they must ask themselves whether that characteristic has helped or hurt. Perry is often right, but being right is not enough. Garcetti, if elected, is more likely to be an effective and successful mayor.

Controller Wendy Greuel is smart and ambitious, and she has enjoyed the built-in advantage of being city government’s official critic, making her the chief advocate for voters and taxpayers. To some degree she has been an able fiscal watchdog, insisting, for example, that the city build up a prudent reserve fund as council members sought to instead spend down the inadequate reserve to avoid layoffs. But she has failed to fulfill her office’s potential.

Four years ago, she asserted that because she was less abrasive than her predecessor, Laura Chick, she would be more successful in getting City Hall to heed her audits and follow her advice. She now acknowledges that City Hall has not been responsive but claims that she could, as mayor, do what she could not do as controller. That is not an argument that inspires confidence.

Nor has Greuel been as innovative as Chick, who saw the potential of her office beyond performing audits and critiquing the status quo. For example, as others in City Hall read and prepared to shelve a report from the Advancement Project’s Connie Rice on dealing with the city’s growing gang problem, Chick studied it, championed it and demanded that failed programs be dropped and a new one based on Rice’s blueprint be housed directly in the mayor’s office. In so doing, Chick forced City Hall to rethink itself and to discover new, effective partnerships and protocols for measuring success. She made her office count. She showed the type of initiative and creativity demonstrated on the council by Garcetti. In comparison, Greuel has been overly cautious and less effective than she could have been. It is hard to see how she would rise to the challenge as mayor given her record as controller.

Also running is entertainment lawyer and talk radio host Kevin James, who, when confronted with the poor management and stifling bureaucracy that have gotten City Hall into trouble, sees full-scale corruption. He sees transfers of money from special funds to create an adequate reserve as corruption rather than prudence; he sees generous contracts to city employees as corruption rather than lazy bargaining and bad management.

It’s an approach well suited to radio and no doubt appealing to listeners and many voters, who would like to believe that if only the rascals are thrown out and replaced with untainted outsiders, everything in Los Angeles will fall into place. But running a city is a complicated business. James is interesting and his words are riveting, but his critique is wrong. City Hall has been too long without someone who knows how to run it, and a lack of leadership, a lack of mission and discipline, have led to low-quality work being delivered by a high-quality workforce.

James is at his best when he drops the talk of corruption and zeros in on one major cause of the city’s troubles: the employee contract of 2007. But his prescription is overly simplistic: Change the players. The city has had mayors with too much “outsider” posturing and too little knowledge of how to run the place.

Emanuel Pleitez has made a name for himself in this race but is a long way from being ready to lead a great city. Like James, he relies too much on the argument that his “outsider” status, by itself, would be a cure for City Hall’s ailments. Those who are disappointed in Villaraigosa should remember that he ran as an outsider and had been on the council for only two years when he ran for mayor, and his lack of familiarity with City Hall — his lack of finesse — is part of what doomed his administration.

Advertisement

Voters at first embraced Villaraigosa because they saw in him the power to inspire. Garcetti has that too, but in a different, quieter fashion, and he backs it up with experience in City Hall, a share of troublesome mistakes and 12 years of achievement.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously declared unconstitutional a 2002 law that required the State Department to record Israel as the birthplace of Jerusalem-born citizens despite a long-standing position in the executive branch of strict neutrality toward sovereignty of the disputed city.

At stake in the case was a question of governmental authority over foreign policy: Does the president have the sole right to decide on what terms foreign nations are recognized?

Though the United States has recognized the sovereignty of Israel since it declared independence in 1948, no president has ever taken a position on Jerusalem. Israel considers the city its political and spiritual capital, while Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the capital of a future country.

The case was brought by the family of Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky, now 10, born to American parents in Jerusalem. When his mother applied for a passport for him with the birthplace as “Jerusalem, Israel,” the U.S. Consulate listed only “Jerusalem.”

Zivotofsky was born weeks after Congress passed the passport provision in September 2002 as part of a foreign relations appropriations bill.

But when President George W. Bush signed the law, he issued an executive statement asserting that the policy on Jerusalem, if construed as mandatory rather than advisory, would “impermissibly interfere” with the president’s constitutional authority in matters of foreign affairs.

The secretary of State has never enforced the policy, arguing that it intrudes upon presidential powers.

The Court of Appeals agreed in its ruling, stating that the law was a political act that infringed upon the president’s exclusive recognition power in the Constitution.

The law “is not, as Zivotofsky asserts, legislation that simply — and neutrally — regulates the form and content of a passport,” Circuit Judge Karen Henderson wrote in her opinion. “Congress plainly intended to force the State Department to deviate from its decades-long position of neutrality” toward Jerusalem.

Several groups swiftly decried the decision.

The Anti-Defamation League, which combats anti-Semitism, wrote in a statement that it was “deeply disappointed” by the news.

“The court has effectively given a stamp of approval to the offensive State Department policy that singles out Israel for ‘special’ treatment,” it wrote.

In a statement, the Orthodox Union, an umbrella group of Orthodox Jewish congregations, called Jerusalem “the eternal and indivisible capital of the State of Israel” and said it would support an appeal of the ruling to the Supreme Court.

Congress has long demanded recognition of Israel’s sovereign control over Jerusalem. In 1995, it passed a law requiring that the United States move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, an act that has since been suspended on a semiannual basis by the president for national security reasons.

The Zivotofsky case has already visited the Supreme Court once, to determine whether it was a “nonjusticiable political question” rather than a legal one. In 2012, the high court held that the case could be tried.

Talk about a dynamic duo.

President Obama, the nation's first golfer, teed it up Sunday with Tiger Woods, their first golf outing together.

Tim Rosaforte of Golf Digest and Golf Channel called it a historic moment, watching Obama and Woods ride off in a golf cart, headed for perhaps 27 holes.

The duo were playing at The Floridan Golf Club in Palm City, Fla.

This comes a day after Obama spent some time getting tips from Woods' former swing coach, Butch Harmon, and his son Claude.

Here are a couple of tweets from Rosaforte:

""Not going to turn this into Tiger Tracker, but from pro shop at Floridian we received word TW holed out greenside bunker No. 1 for birdie.""

""The President is arriving at The Floridian range. Awaiting is Tiger Woods and club owner Jim Crane. Historic day in golf. Their first round.""

Rosaforte also said, in an interview on Golf Channel, Woods was putting on a show, even driving the green on a 378-yard par-4.

""We had a big day today,"" Crane, who owns the Houston Astros, told MLB.com.

""Well, when you get to play with the president and Tiger Woods in the same round, that's one that doesn't happen every day and it might not happen again,"" Crane said. ""It was a lot of fun. The President was very cordial, and Tiger had a lot of fun and hit some great shots. We had a lot of fun.""

About Obama's golf game, Crane said: ""He played well today. He made some good shots and had some pars, and I think he shot in the 80s. The weather was nice and we had fun. I think he really enjoyed his visit and we really enjoyed having him in the Floridian, and hopefully we'll have him back some day.""

Woods, who is 1-for-1 in PGA Tour events this season, returns to action at the World Golf Championships-Accenture Match Play Championship on Wednesday in Marana, Ariz."

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — President Obama awarded U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Ty Carter the Medal of Honor on Monday for his heroics in a 2009 battle where he and 53 American troops fought back against some 300 Taliban fighters in a valley of the Afghanistan mountains.

Carter became the second soldier to be awarded the highest military commendation for his courageous action in the battle.

Earlier this year, Obama awarded Clinton Romesha, a former Army staff sergeant, the Medal of Honor for leading the defense of the plywood-and-concrete outpost known as Combat Outpost Keating. Eight U.S. soldiers would die in the fight for the outpost.

In honoring Carter and Romesha, it is the first time that two living recipients have received Medals of Honor for their gallantry in the same battle since Vietnam. Carter also became the fifth living U.S. servicemember of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to receive the honor.

""The outpost was being slammed from every direction,"" Obama said in the afternoon ceremony at the White House. ""Machine gun fire, rocket-propelled grenades, mortar, sniper fire, it was chaos. The blizzard of bullets and steel into which Ty ran not once or twice, or even a few times, but perhaps 10 times. In doing so, he displayed the essence of true heroism.""

Carter ran low and fast across an American outpost while overwhelming numbers of Taliban fighters closed in. He sprinted over ground where he could see bullets piercing the dust in front of him, gambling on getting ahead of the shooters' ability to target him.

Carter ran a gauntlet of heavy machine gun and sniper fire — carrying ammo, recovering a field radio, cradling a wounded comrade in his arms — sometimes zigzagging to dodge exploding rocket-propelled grenades or mortar rounds.

When he wasn't moving through enemy fire in the battle in 2009, Carter and another soldier made their stand in an all-but-shredded armored vehicle — a last defensive bastion in a far corner of the fort. Surrounded by dead Americans and running low on ammunition, they shot and killed enemy fighters breaching the walls.

""When good men are dying all around you, you have to decide what your last moments are going to be like,"" Carter told USA TODAY. ""Are you going to die behind something, or are you going to die standing and firing? Are you going to die pushing forward or falling back?""

Obama also thanked Carter for speaking out about his battles with post-traumatic stress, and noted that Carter had urged him to remember another soldier, Ed Faulkner Jr., who fought alongside him that day. Faulker died in September 2010 after a fatal overdose of methadone and Xanax.

""Let me say it as clearly as I can to any of our troops and veterans who are struggling,"" Obama said. ""Look at this man, look at this soldier, look at this warrior. He is as tough as they come and if he can find the courage and strength to not only seek help, but also speak about it … than so can you.""

On the play, San Diego lined up with seven men on one side of the snapper. This should have been penalized as an illegal formation by the defense. Rule 9, Section 1, Article 3 (b) (1) of the NFL Rule Book (page 51) states that “No more than six Team B players may be on the line of scrimmage on either side of the snapper at the snap.” The penalty for illegal formation by the defense is a loss of five yards. This is not subject to instant replay review. Had the penalty been assessed, it would have resulted in a fourth-and-seven from the San Diego 18 with 0:04 remaining, enabling the Chiefs to attempt a 36-yard field goal.

—

The NFL will reportedly concede on Monday that its officials may have cost the Pittsburgh Steelers a playoff spot when they failed to penalize the San Diego Chargers for having more than six players on one side of the long snapper on Kansas City Chiefs kicker Ryan Succop’s game-winning field goal attempt with eight seconds remaining in regulation on Sunday in San Diego.

ProFootballTalk’s Mike Florio reported on NBC’s Sunday Night Football that the NFL will admit on Monday that the officials in the game should have given the Chargers a five-yard penalty on Succop’s missed 41-yard field goal attempt because San Diego had seven players (pictured) on one side of the line of scrimmage when NFL rules only allow six. The referees did not throw a flag, and Succop missed the field goal that could have sent the Steelers into the playoffs. He should have gotten a re-kick–a 36-yard field goal attempt. And had Succop made the attempt he should have been awarded, Pittsburgh would have miraculously made the playoffs.

Here is the NFL rule in question:

(a) When Team A presents a punt, field-goal attempt or a Try Kick formation, a Team B player, who is within 1 yard of the line of scrimmage, must have his entire body outside the snapper’s shoulder pads at the snap. (b) When Team A presents a field-goal or Try Kick formation: (1) No more than six Team B players may be on the line of scrimmage on either side of the snapper at the snap; Penalty: For illegal formation by the defense, loss of 5 yards from the previous spot. (2) Team B players cannot push teammates on the line of scrimmage into the offensive formation. Penalty: For unnecessary roughness, loss of 15 yards from the previous spot

Earlier in the year, New England Patriots rookie Chris Jones was penalized 15-yards for pushing his teammate during a New York Jets field-goal attempt that decided the game in favor of the Jets.

After starting the season 0-4 with injuries at numerous positions, all the Pittsburgh Steelers needed to do to sneak into the playoffs was to win on Sunday and then hope that the Miami Dolphins, the Baltimore Ravens, and the San Diego Chargers all lost.

Incredibly, that almost happened. The Steelers (8-8) almost got the sixth and final AFC playoff spot, but Succop missed that 41-yard field goal and San Diego beat the Chiefs 27-24 in a wild overtime in which the Chargers faked a punt inside their own territory on their first drive in overtime that was also controversial. Kansas City seemed to return what appeared to be a fumble on that play for a touchdown to win the game, but the officials ruled that San Diego’s Eric Weddle’s forward progress was stopped. Former NFL head of officiating Mike Pereira disagreed with that interpretation:

Replay did not stop the game because the ruling of forward progress is not reviewable. Should have been a strip and TD in my opinion. — Mike Pereira (@MikePereira) December 30, 2013

Earlier in the day, the Cincinnati Bengals defeated the Ravens, 34-17. The New York Jets defeated the Miami Dolphins, 20-7. The Steelers took care of business and defeated the Browns, 20-7.

That meant San Diego would make the playoffs with a win over the Chiefs or a tie while Pittsburgh would only make the playoffs with a Kansas City win over San Diego.

And Kansas City, which sat its starting quarterback, Alex Smith, running back, Jamaal Charles, and a host of other starters to rest for next week’s playoff game, was leading for most of the game before San Diego tied the game with less than five minutes left and eventually won the game, taking the sixth and final AFC playoff spot.

Pepper Schwartz thought we're at the point that if a man can't control his lust, it's illegal

Schwartz: Women are insulted, not hired if unattractive, fired if they are too pretty

Saving your marriage by firing an employee for her looks is a gender issue, she says

Just when you think we're becoming civilized and smarter about our knowledge of gender, you get a stupid decision such as the one from the Iowa Supreme Court and you wonder whether sanity will ever reign.

I thought we had decided the issue that men's ""uncontrollable lust"" was indeed controllable, and if they didn't control it, they were going to be charged and convicted of sexual harassment, rape, frottage -- well you get the idea.

So now the all-male Iowa Supreme Court has said , albeit in a new way, that men are so controlled by their gonads that they can fire an employee at will for being able to incite attraction, sex, love, whatever. No matter that she is just going about her job or being a stellar employee; if she's got a cute butt or a nicely turned nose, her job is history.

If you haven't heard, the court stood by an earlier ruling that a Fort Dodge dentist acted legally when he fired his dental assistant -- even while acknowledging she had been an excellent employee for 10 years -- because he and his wife were afraid he would try to start an affair with her and ruin their marriage. The employee had sued for sex discrimination. But the court said firing an employee for being too attractive, despite no inappropriate behavior on her part, is not sex discrimination because gender is not the issue. Feelings are.

Pepper Schwartz

Don't tell me this has nothing to do with gender.

I don't see women firing men because they can't control themselves. Is this because they don't have manly kind of urges? Or is it because they don't have access to the same excuses, such as uncontrollable attraction and desire? Either way, it's a gender issue. And if a woman is denied employment because of her gender, that is a protected legal status.

But the Iowa Supreme Court guys didn't see it that way. By the way, Iowa women: Is this enough to motivate you to get some women on your Supreme Court? The guys saw the issue, at least in part, as protecting the institution of marriage rather than an infringement on a woman's right to work.

Let's be real honest here: If the only way this man and woman could protect their marriage is to remove an attractive woman from their midst, then I'd say this marriage has a lot more problems than just an attractive dental assistant.

What is this dentist's wife going to do -- put blinders on her husband like a race horse? Do employees have to pass an ugliness test? Do they pick the couples in their extended friendship network according to whether the wife is curvaceous?

Women have been at risk because of their looks for a long time. There are online sites where women are evaluated like so many heifers on whether they are "" Hot or Not?"" Words such as ""dog"" ""sow"" ""and needing a ""paper bag over her head"" have been thrown at us as a part of male bravado.

Beautiful women get cat-calls, sometimes really rude and threatening gestures and unwanted commentary on their looks. Talk about women being between a rock and a hard place. Insulted and not hired if they aren't attractive, fired if they are too attractive.

Could someone tell us just exactly how we should look?

More important, could we have some continuing education for the courts around the nation so that they realize looks are a gender issue -- and therefore protecting women from being fired because of them is appropriate.

If another case like this goes through the judicial system, I hope a very different conclusion will be reached. Otherwise, all kinds of firings may arise that use this excuse to get rid of women employees.

Why, this could even spread to the courts -- male judges might ban some women lawyers from presenting cases because, gosh darn it, they are just too lovely."

At first, Miguel Hernandez thought it was a mistake, or worse, a joke.

The 19-year-old had been pulled over for failure to use his turn signal, but the fact that he is an undocumented immigrant landed him in a detention center in rural Georgia.

Hernandez was certain that deportation proceedings would follow soon, and was mulling over it when a guard brought some news: He was being released.

“I was walking and I was thinking, this is a joke. They probably got confused with another guy or something,” Hernandez said.

More likely, Hernandez was one of hundreds of undocumented immigrants released from detention because of looming budget cuts set to take effect Friday absent congressional action.

The package of forced budget cuts, known as sequestration, will mean $85 billion of government-wide cuts.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) decision to move detainees to less costly supervision options was met with backlash from Republicans who accuse the Obama administration of using scare tactics to win a political battle.

Jason Evans/CNN Miguel Hernandez was released from an immigration detention center in Georgia as federal budget cuts loomed.

“It’s abhorrent that President Obama is releasing criminals into our communities to promote his political agenda on sequestration,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, said. “By releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the administration is needlessly endangering American lives.”

But the White House had no input on the plan, spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday.

The decision was made by career ICE employees, an administration official told CNN. The move was made because the agency was preparing its year-end budget and had to take budget cuts into consideration, the official said.

An exact number of released detainees has not been released; ICE characterized it as “several hundred.” The population of immigration detainees is currently about 30,700.

Those who have been released are non-criminals or low-risk offenders without serious criminal histories, ICE spokeswoman Barbara Gonzalez said.

“Detainees with serious criminal histories are a detention priority and have not been released,” she said.

Another ICE official reiterated that all of those released remain in deportation proceedings, released on an order of supervision.

Some of those released will be on intensive supervision, such as ankle monitors, while others will just have weekly check-ins with an ICE officer, the official said.

Hernandez, the young man who was released in Georgia, can’t know for sure that he was released because of budget cuts. But he does fit the category of minor offenders, and was released at the same time as dozens of other detainees.

Those being released alongside Hernandez on Sunday were confused about what was happening. Some detainees who had bonds as high as $25,000 were being told they were bonded and released.

Hernandez said he believes some of those released with him are repeat offenders who have been previously deported.

Most were given a paper with a court date, but not Hernandez. He has been waiting for his court date to be mailed to him.

Another congressman, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, wrote a letter to ICE Director John Morton demanding accountability.

He wants to know exactly how many detainees were released, and where, and the reason for each person’s detention.

“This decision reflects the lack of resource prioritization within the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement and is indicative of the department’s weak stance on national security,” McCaul said.

Planning for the detainee release began last Thursday, a senior administration official told CNN.

Hernandez said he doesn’t understand what all the fuss is about.

“I don’t know why this affects them – I’m not a criminal,” he said.

Washington (CNN) - Senators won't give their official reading of former Sen. Chuck Hagel's performance at Thursday's nomination hearing until they vote on his nomination to be defense secretary.

But some think Hagel didn't do so well.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='danabashcnn']

Several senators told CNN that during a series of Senate floor votes during a break in the hearing that Hagel's lackluster performance, in the opinion of many senators, was all the buzz on the Senate floor.

One senator who is undecided but was not at the Armed Services Committee hearing says it is ""all the talk – I mean all the talk."" Fellow senators are ""shocked"" by how ill prepared Hagel seemed for basic questions about controversial comments he has made, this senator said.

A Democrat on the committee supporting Hagel shook his head in disbelief, saying he was surprised Hagel was not more forceful, especially since he has been on the other side of the dais and knows how this works. Hagel served in the Senate from 1997 through 2008.

Another undecided senator - this one who serves on the committee responsible for vetting Hagel's nomination - was also taken aback that Hagel didn't have better answers for Sen. John McCain's pointed questions, especially on the Iraq surge. The senator said Hagel could have simply said ""the Iraq war was wrong, but once we were there, the surge was the right way to go.""

Separately, an administration official involved in the confirmation process said ""a lot of what we've seen today is political theater. Chuck Hagel is someone very pragmatic and he wanted to have a conversation. He didn't take the bait. Some people will say he didn't get angry or mad, but that's not who he is. He decided to take the high road.""

But that said, a second official acknowledged ""we think he's on his way, but he didn't round the bases today. He could have. He didn't."" Had Hagel ""rounded the bases,"" he would have ensured no senator would step forward to filibuster him.

To be sure several Democrats on the committee defended Hagel, telling CNN they believe he was getting attacked with unfair gotcha questions on statements he made years ago.

Asked if he thought the questions were fair, Sen. Carl Levin, who chairs the committee, told reporters he thought ""some of the questions where (Hagel) was not allowed to answer was not appropriate.""

He added that he hopes the committee could vote on Hagel's nomination as early as next Thursday.

FBI probing whether political figures’ financial records were illicitly accessed

The FBI is investigating whether the financial records and other personal information of leading political figures, including Vice President Biden and first lady Michelle Obama, may have been illicitly accessed and published online, according to Justice Department officials.

A Web site posted what appear to be credit reports, banking information, Social Security numbers and addresses for several officials, as well as a number of celebrities. In addition to Biden and Obama, the site purported to have obtained records of Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III.

The Web site used the Internet suffix .su, which suggested that it was based in Russia or a post-Soviet republic.

It was unclear how the documents, if confirmed as authentic, could have been obtained. A Justice Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, said the FBI is trying to determine whether it might be a case of identity theft, hacking or perhaps both.

The White House declined to comment.

Much of the posted material was drawn from credit reports from organizations such as TransUnion and Equifax.

Tim Klein, a spokesman for the credit reporting agency Equifax, said the company was investigating “fraudulent and unauthorized access” to four consumer credit reports and is working closely with law enforcement officials.

“Nothing is more important to us than data security, and we have stringent measures in place for protecting the data entrusted to us,” Equifax said in a statement. “We enable consumers to access their credit reports through a variety of channels, including annualcreditreport.com, which is a free service. In order for a consumer to have access to their credit report through this channel, they must provide Personally Identifiable Information that should be known only to the individual.”

TransUnion did not respond to a request for comment.

To obtain free credit reports, consumers are typically required to answer about five to seven questions that detail information such as the applicant’s monthly mortgage payment, who holds their car loan or the last payment amount on a particular credit card. It is not known how that kind of information was obtained about those whose credit reports were posted.

The Web site that posted the purported records also disclosed what it claims were the records of celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Ashton Kutcher, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Beyonce and Jay-Z.

In what appears to be a separate incident, former secretary of state Colin L. Powell’s Facebook and personal e-mail accounts also were hacked this week.

An unidentified hacker asserted responsibility for the breach in an e-mail sent early Tuesday to dozens of Washington journalists. The e-mail contained 16 images showing screenshots of Powell’s digital correspondence. None of the e-mails between Powell and his acquaintances — dated from 2005 to 2012 — appeared to be particularly revealing.

The images bore the handwritten word “GUCCIFER,” the name used by the hacker who obtained e-mails from the accounts of at least six Bush family members last month.

Powell told The Washington Post that he was aware his account had been breached. “I can confirm that the hacker was able to get into my old e-mails, and I’m taking precautions,” Powell said.

The day before, Powell’s Facebook page was hacked, with an unidentified person posting incendiary messages.

Powell later posted a message on his Facebook wall apologizing for the incident. “I’m sorry you have to see all the stupid, obscene posts that are popping up. Please ignore as we are working with fb to take care of this problem. I appreciate your patience,” he wrote.

During his brief trip, he instantly became an expert about the deep-rooted societal implications of Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1968 assassination there and how they affected the Grizzlies’ inability to stop Tim Duncan and Tony Parker.

He spoke about this to Jalen Rose on his BS Report podcast:

“I didn’t realize the effect [the King assassination] had on that city. […] I think from people we talk to and stuff we’ve read, the shooting kind of sets the tone for how the city thinks about stuff. We were at Game 3. Great crowd, they fall behind and the whole crowd got tense. It as like, ‘Oh no, something bad is going to happen.’ And it starts from that shooting and it’s just that mind-set they have.”

On my pyramid of inane comments about sports and the lingering effects of civic catastrophes from pop culture writers-turned-sociologists, this could make a push for No. 1.

The Martin Luther King Jr. assassination was a national tragedy. Through a series of fateful events, Memphis became the stage for that tragedy. The civic effects have been studied by many people, most of whom probably spent more than five minutes in the city. But does this mean sports fans are walking around with dark clouds around their heads 45 years later, equating a missed Zach Randolph jumpshot with the worst moment in the city’s history?

If this is the case, shouldn’t the same thing be happening in Dallas? Nope. The Cowboys won the Super Bowl nine years after John F. Kennedy was assassinated in the city. But Simmons has an explanation for that, lest his grand theory on Memphis go any more off the rails. Dallas moved past JFK, in part, because of the Cowboys and the television show Dallas. On the other hand, Memphis has done nothing to establish its own identity in the past half-century. It’s still wallowing in the pain of the tragedy. That’s why Graceland is so understated and somber.

We’re already looking forward to the next podcast when Simmons breaks down how the Northridge earthquake and debut of Beverly Hills, 90210 set the stage for the NFL leaving Los Angeles."

Of course, Mrs. Clinton, if she remained secretary of state, could not participate in a political campaign. So the poll, and the former first lady’s popularity, only intensified speculation that Mr. Obama was considering moving Mrs. Clinton onto his ticket, replacing Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

The idea never gained traction, but all the chatter irritated Mr. Biden.

The next year, when a draft of the president’s speech for the annual White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner included a joke about dropping Mr. Biden from the ticket, Mr. Obama edited it out, fearing that the subject would upset Mr. Biden.

By all accounts, Mr. Biden and Mrs. Clinton have enjoyed a genuine friendship starting in the first days of her husband’s presidential administration, with shared Amtrak rides when they were in the Senate and, during Mr. Obama’s first term, early Saturday morning phone calls that Mr. Biden sometimes ended with “I love you, darling.”"

WASHINGTON, July 4 (Reuters) - At age 80, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, leader of the U.S. Supreme Court's liberal wing, says she is in excellent health, even lifting weights despite having cracked a pair of ribs again, and plans to stay several more years on the bench.

In a Reuters interview late on Tuesday, she vowed to resist any pressure to retire that might come from liberals who want to ensure that Democratic President Barack Obama can pick her successor before the November 2016 presidential election.

Ginsburg said she had fallen in the bathroom of her home in early May, sustaining the same injury she suffered last year near term's end.

""I knew immediately what it was this time,"" she said, adding that there was nothing to do but take pain killers and wait out the six weeks as her ribs healed. Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said on Wednesday that the day after the May 2 incident, Ginsburg was examined at the Office of the Attending Physician at the Capitol and then went about her regular schedule.

The justice, who survived two serious bouts with cancer, in 1999 and 2009, is keeping up a typically busy summer of travel, at home and abroad, beginning next week with a trip to Paris. Ginsburg said she was back to her usual weight-lifting routine and recently had good results from a bone density scan.

Supreme Court justices are appointed for life and can be a president's most enduring legacy. Disputes over many social dilemmas come down to 5-4 votes, as was seen in the recently completed term on gay marriage and voting rights. A retirement decision rests with an individual justice, but history is rife with tensions between aging justices and anxious presidents. Ginsburg, the eldest justice on an ideologically divided court, was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993.

Political pressure is an age-old backdrop to Supreme Court appointments, and for Ginsburg it is likely to accelerate before the November 2014 congressional elections that could alter the Democratic dominance of the Senate.

Such talk is always subtle because a presidential administration never wants to be perceived to engage in politics over the judiciary given the bedrock American principle that separates the branches of government.

2012 PRESSURE

Before Obama's 2012 reelection, Harvard University law professor Randall Kennedy stirred public debate with an April 2011 essay for the New Republic urging Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer, now 74 and also appointed by Clinton, to retire to ensure a possible Republican president not fill their seats.

On Wednesday, Kennedy repeated his sentiment, telling Reuters he still thinks that ""the responsible thing"" would be for Ginsburg to step down. ""It seems to me that a justice should take into account the politics surrounding confirmation and not allow (an) opportunity to fall to a Republican,"" said Kennedy, who was a law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall.

University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt, who has studied judicial nominations, said Wednesday he expected to see ""opinion leaders trying to shape attitudes"" among the public as well as ""efforts through back channels to increase the pressure for her to step down.""

In her interview, Ginsburg referred to past liberal commentary and predicted, ""That's going to start up again.""

Brushing off political calculations, she said, ""It really has to be, 'Am I equipped to do the job?' ... I was so pleased that this year I couldn't see that I was slipping in any respect."" She said she remains energized by her work as the senior liberal, a position she has held since 2010 when Justice John Paul Stevens retired, and calls being a justice ""the best job in the world for a lawyer.""

She has previously said she wanted her tenure to at least match the nearly 23 years of Justice Louis Brandeis, which would get her to April 2016, and said she had a new ""model"" in Justice Stevens, who retired at age 90 after nearly 35 years on the bench.

Reinforcing the message that she might not leave before her health requires it, she mused of another former colleague, ""I wonder if Sandra regrets stepping down when she did?""

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor retired in January 2006 at age 75 to take care of her husband, John, who had Alzheimer's disease. He died in 2009.

Ginsburg, who picked up the mantle of the liberals after Stevens' departure, took the unusual step of reading three dissenting statements from the bench in the final week of the term. Dissenting justices typically issue their statements only in writing. During one of them, on June 24, the media commented on the antics of Justice Samuel Alito, who had written the majority opinion in a job discrimination case Ginsburg was protesting, Vance v. Ball State University. As she spoke, he conspicuously rolled his eyes and screwed up his face.

Alito did not respond to a request for comment.

Ginsburg said she was oblivious, and only learned of his behavior from her law clerks. When she read another dissenting statement from the bench the next day, ""he did not make any faces.""

Was she insulted? Her answer appeared to allude to Alito's nationally televised grimace and mouthing of ""Not true"" in response to comments Obama made in his 2010 State of the Union speech about a court campaign-finance ruling.

""I'm in such good company,"" said Ginsburg. ""I'm in the company of the president.""

Where is the vice president? They aren’t here,” in an interview with Stephen K. Bannon on the Breitbart News live broadcast of Commemoration of Pickett’s charge on July 3.

During the three days of Gettysburg events, President Obama has been on a tour through Africa, traveling to Senegal, Tanzania, and South Africa.

Guelzo noted that it was mostly just ordinary people who showed up to the Gettysburg memorial, not just Americans but people from around the world who wanted to pay tribute to perhaps the most significant event and moment of sacrifice in our nation’s history. He also noted that the three-day commemoration of the event, July 1-3, was not covered by any of the major networks.

“Where is the Today Show? Where is Good Morning America?” said Guelzo.

Attendees have mostly shown great reverence to the honor and sacrifice of the men who fought on both sides of the battle, according to Guelzo. Most have honored Abraham Lincoln’s dictate in the famous Gettysburg Address: “never forget what they did here.” The “they” that Lincoln referred to were the soldiers in uniform on the battlefield 150 years ago who bled and died for the cause and the country that they believed in.

Visitors endured torrential rainfall to see the battlefield as tens of thousands came to pay tribute to this special moment in American and world history.

“One thing I tell people to do is just look around them here. This is a lot of people from all over the world. They are not here like they are at a theme park or a rock concert,” said Guelzo.

Presidents have frequently commemorated the great battles in American history with orations and memorials about the sacrifice of the men involved and the meaning of “American exceptionalism.” For instance, Ronald Reagan made a tribute to the “Boys of Pointe Du Hoc” on the 40th anniversary of D-Day and the beginning of the liberation of Europe.

Guelzo spoke about why he decided to write a book about Gettysburg, even though there have been so many written accounts of it in the past. He said that besides living in Gettysburg and being in close proximity, there were many stories about the battle that have been overlooked. “There were angles of this battle that I haven’t heard told before,” Guelzo explained.

One angle of the battle that Guelzo focused on was the role politics played in the Union Army. Though all were fighting for the Union, the soldiers and generals were divided on how to carry out the war. Peace Democrats, sometimes known as “Copperheads,” believed that the war was being fought for the wrong reasons–that Lincoln and the Republican Party were to blame for the war and secession. Guelzo said that Union General George McClellan, who ran against Lincoln in the 1864 presidential election, “often said he was divided on marching on Richmond or marching on Washington.”

Host Bannon called Guelzo’s book the “definitive” work on the subject, as it details both the minutia of the battle and the politics surrounding it, and it tells an interesting, gripping story about the individuals involved.

Bannon compared the narrative to those of the famous late Civil War historian, Shelby Foote, an incredible storyteller who wrote the three-part The Civil War: A Narrative and became famous to the general public after a performance on Ken Burn’s Civil War documentary.

Florida senator lights up Twitter after awkwardly taking sip of water during speech

Rubio explained what happened on several TV shows

GOP senator tweeted picture of empty water bottle

Sen. Marco Rubio is being a good sport about awkwardly taking a sip of water during his response to President Obama's State of the Union Address, using some Wednesday morning TV appearances to poke fun at himself.

""I needed water, what am I going to do?"" Rubio, R-Fla., said on ABC's Good Morning America. ""God has a funny way of reminding us we're human.""

Twitter exploded and Rubio's sip of water became a social media sensation.

For the millions of people watching Rubio's nationally televised remarks on Tuesday night, it wasn't so much that the senator was cotton-mouthed as he offered the GOP's vision on the economy. It was the way Rubio — a young, charismatic politician mentioned as a future presidential hopeful — quenched his thirst.

Rubio was standing in front of a TV camera in one of House Speaker John Boehner's conference rooms at the U.S. Capitol as he delivered his remarks. An 8-ounce bottle of Poland Spring water was out of view on a table, and he stepped out of the shot for a moment — without taking his eyes off the camera — to take a sip.

Rubio took a bottle of water to some of his morning show interviews, playing along with the joke as he took a swig while he was on Fox News. It was a step beyond what he did after his speech, when he posted a picture of an empty Poland Spring bottle on Twitter.

""When you give a speech on a podium and the water is right there. But when you don't, you start looking around thinking, 'Where am I going to get the water?'"" he said on Fox News.

Rubio explained on CBS that he had a long day. Before giving his speech live in English, he also taped his remarks in Spanish — marking the first time in history that the State of the Union response was delivered in two languages.

""I had already taped an 18-minute speech in Spanish,"" the senator said. ""So I'm just glad the water was nearby. I don't know what I would have done without it.""

In politics, the ability to poke fun at oneself is a critical survival tool. Texas Gov. Rick Perry appeared on late-night TV shows after he uttered ""oops"" during a GOP presidential debate in 2011 because he could not remember the name of a federal department he wanted to cut. Perry, whose presidential campaign was already struggling at that time, also walked into the media spin room immediately after the debate to tell reporters he ""stepped in it.""

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie got into it, too, during a recent appearance on David Letterman's Late Show. Letterman likes to make fat jokes about Christie, so the governor took a bite out of a doughnut as he was being interviewed.

David Marin, a former communications director for a House committee now with the Podesta Group public relations firm, said Rubio is handling the water break deftly.

""I think Sen. Rubio is going to turn lemons into lemonade here,"" Marin said. ""He's already doing the most important thing: Making light of a moment and owning it. And he's doing it in the right forum — via digital media, which shows real smarts since that's where the conversation was happening.""

Charlton McIlwain, a professor of media, culture and politics at New York University, said Rubio was wise to redefine the incident on his own terms by tweeting a picture of his empty water bottle.

By immediately ""making a joke of it,"" McIlwain said, Rubio was able to set the tone of the discussion without leaving pundits and others to define the sip of water as a mistake or a bungle.

As a result, the event will be memorable but ""probably not in a negative way"" for Rubio, McIlwain said.

Headed by veteran staff of Obama’s reelection, the organization’s mission is to use the resources that reelected Obama to promote his policy agenda. As a 501 c(4), it can accept unlimited donations. According to its 1st Quarter financials, however, it is struggling to attract the same big donors that fueled Obama’s reelection.

OFA raised $4.8 million in the first three months of 2013. This is a fraction of what the Obama campaign would raise each quarter, even though OFA can accept unlimited donations. OFA certainly tried to maximize this fundraising advantage. For a $500,000 contribution, donors would receive a seat on a “national advisory board” and attend quarterly meetings at the White House. The top donation to the group, however, was half this amount, $250,000 from activist Peter Munger.

Last month OFA held a founders’ summit in DC, which featured President Obama. The event was open to donors giving at least $50,000 to the group. In the 1st Quarter, however, only 16 donors gave this amount. In all, just over 1,400 donors gave more than $250.

The underwhelming haul can’t just be attributed to a post-election lull, either. In January alone, the RNC raised almost $7 million and the DNC raised over $4 million. In addition, President Obama has aggressively pushed several high-profile agenda items. Supporting these is OFA’s reason for existing and should have fueled significant contributions.

OFA’s larger challenge is that a campaign structure to support on individual candidate doesn’t necessarily translate to particular policies. Voters support a candidate for a variety of reasons, often irrespective of policies. Even when a voter completely agrees on an issue, it doesn’t always mean they will take action on that issue.

Deciding to take action in the climax of a national election is much different than taking action outside of the political frenzy, when daily life has returned.

Another challenge for OFA is that, inevitably, base activists will turn their attention to other campaigns. Second term Presidents inevitably shrink from the domestic policy debate, as party activists focus on midterm elections and the next nominee for the White House.

OFA’s struggles attracting big donors suggests this process has already started.

WASHINGTON — The newly revamped art-deco-style Capitol Hill Hotel near the Library of Congress recently converted its old management offices into a library.

It's not a fancy or particularly extensive library, but book lovers and history buffs alike may like the fact that they can pick up a copy of Pride and Prejudice or a vintage, leather-bound volume of United States Supreme Court Reports and sit on the tufted couch to flip the pages.

""The (new space) gives guests a chance to congregate instead of staying in their rooms,"" says Ian Harvey, the hotel's general manager. ""They can play cards, hold a meeting or read a good book.""

While a library may be especially appropriate for this hotel given its neighbor, it's only the latest property to embrace books, whether as a formal, big-budget library or as a modest library ""wall.""

Hotels in New York, Dallas, Chicago, London, Philadelphia and even a Caribbean resort are increasingly making books a vital part of their atmosphere.

The trend isn't limited to luxury hotels or sleekly designed boutique properties. It's coming to a Marriott near you.

""Even in the Philadelphia West Marriott, a 200-room hotel, we created a small wall of about 10 feet by 14 feet and put books on it,"" says Marc Hoffman, chief operating officer of Sunstone Investors, a real estate investment trust that owns 30 major hotels.

It's all about engaging guests so that they linger, which raises the odds that they'll eventually order something from a hotel bar or restaurant, he says.

""It's all part of this bigger picture of taking public spaces and making them into places where people will sit and generate revenue, instead of what the spaces were in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, places where people walked through,"" he says.

Sunstone is consistently adding libraries in hotels as it renovates its hotels' lobbies and turns them into more residential-style spaces, he says. A library is being installed now in the Hyatt Chicago Magnificent Mile, and one is slated for the Hilton San Diego Bayfront hotel when renovations begin later this year.

""We've taken great pride in building our libraries out,"" he says.

For the Renaissance Washington D.C., Hoffman notes, they bought more than 5,000 books. ""You will see all kinds of things about the D.C. area — art, history, sports teams, book on presidents, books on Washington, books on the great stills of the Virginia mountains,"" he says.

Designs differ

There is no single formula for creating hotel libraries. Some hotels are creating libraries that contain books hand-picked by famous personalities; quite a few are are teaming up with high-end cocktail book publishers.

Some, such as the stylish Joule in Dallas, are using them to drive retail sales, while others are using them to encourage people to order snacks and drinks. The Nomad hotel in New York, for instance, opened last year with its romantic Library Bar, a darkly lit space at night that features floor-to-ceiling bookshelves on two levels and an original spiral staircase imported from France.

Some hotels, such as the luxury Carlisle Bay resort on Antigua, have created libraries to look like ultra-stylish retreats with fiber-optic lighting that changes color, while others have created them to look like old English clubs with wood-paneled walls and leather wing back chairs.

Intriguing trend in digital age

Regardless of these libraries' design or book selections, the increasingly common hotel library represents an intriguing trend in an era of Kindles and tablets.

Hoteliers, after all, are constantly being dumbfounded by the Wi-Fi demands of their guests. It's not unusual for travelers today to check into hotels with two or three Wi-Fi-enabled devices, and families to check into a single room with eight devices.

Examples of libraries in hotels:

- In Dallas, The Joule, an upscale boutique hotel that belongs to the Starwood Luxury Collection, in February will open its $78 million expansion that includes a Charlie Palmer food hall as well as a stylish library. The library — which features books from Taschen — was designed to double as a bookstore to drive retail sales, says architect Jerry Flemons of ForrestPerkins, the firm in charge of the hotel's expansion.

- In Washington D.C., the 49-room Capella luxury hotel in Georgetown — weeks away from opening — will offer guests a library with books and DVDs in its guests-only living room, which also has a fireplace.

- In London last fall, the luxury One Aldwych, part of Leading Hotels of the World, opened a guests-only lounge that includes cozy sofas and armchairs, free Wi-Fi, and a selection of iPads, magazines, newspapers and books. To highlight its two high-profile neighbors in chic Covent Garden, the hotel asked designer Paul Smith to select 50 cocktail table books published by Rizzoli. Guests can order food and cocktails in the room throughout the day and evening.

- New York's Trump Soho recently installed new furniture in its second-floor library that overlooks the lobby. It's also has a new name — the Library at Koi SoHo — since the newly opened Koi restaurant began serving light fare and cocktails in the space. Expect a selection of books on topics such as fashion, art and architecture. Guests can work there during the day, hold meetings or just read.

- The hip Hudson Hotel in New York has a room called the Library that's decorated like an English club with wood-covered walls, a fireplace, a billiards table, wing chairs - and books about film, theater, fashion, politics and travel. Guests can order breakfast and coffee.

- In Santa Monica, Calif., the Viceroy has a contemporary library — with sunny yellow accents — that's off the lobby and adjacent to the pool deck. Expect to find 2,000 books on the arts and culture selected by Kelly Wearstler, the hotel's designer. It can be rented out for private events.

- The modern Radisson Blu Edwardian, which opened in Guildford, England, in the fall of 2011, has a library with sleek, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and windows, as well as theater-style lighting and a theatrical ""ladder to nowhere."" Designer Rabih Hage was in part inspired by local author, Lewis Carroll, famous for writing Alice in Wonderland as well as the concept of performance, says hotel spokeswoman Tina Morgan. The hotel hosts author events when the Guildford Book Festival takes place each fall.

Back at the Capitol Hill Hotel, where a room can be booked for as little as about $120 on slow weekend nights, general manager Harvey expects the new library will get quite a bit of traffic. When the hotel was filled with the freshman class of the 112th Congress, for instance, many members retreated to the area to hold meetings."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/20/jfk-assassination-gary-hart_n_4302598.html,2013-11-20 00:00:00,"['Managing Editor', 'The Worldpost', 'Former Washington Bureau Chief']",Senator Who Investigated JFK Assassination: 'American Journalism Never Followed Up On That Story',"WASHINGTON -- As the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's death nears, former presidential candidate Gary Hart, a member of the Senate committee that investigated JFK's assassination, said that the press had failed in its responsibility to investigate the truth behind his killing.

Hart served on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Agencies, known as the Church committee, after chairman Frank Church. He recalled that while the committee was investigating the connection between the assassination, the Mafia and plots against Cuban President Fidel Castro, two of the three main figures involved were also killed.

""It's amazing to me that American journalism never followed up on that story very much, because if you found out who killed those two guys, you might have some really interesting information on your hands,"" Hart, who served as a Democratic senator from Colorado for two terms, told HuffPost in a recent interview.

There were ""all kinds of leads"" -- had reporters followed them, he said. ""I went down to Miami when [Johnny] Roselli was killed and talked to this Dade County sheriff from the Miami Police Department, and they showed me pictures of him being fished out of the water in the barrel and how he'd been killed -- nightmarish stuff. And [Momo Salvatore] Giancana was killed in his own basement with six bullet holes in his throat with a Chicago police car and an FBI car outside his house,"" he recounted.

According to CIA documents released in 2007, the agency hired Johnny Roselli, a high-ranking mobster, to eliminate Fidel Castro, offering to pay him $150,000. Roselli reportedly declined the money and worked with former FBI agent Robert A. Maheu; Giancana, Al Capone's Chicago mob successor; and Santo Trafficante Jr., a mobster involved in Cuban operations, to unsuccessfully poison Castro with pills. Roselli disappeared soon after testifying before the Church committee, and his body was found inside an oil drum near North Miami Beach. Giancana was found dead at his Chicago home before he could testify to the Church committee.

While alive, Giancana and Roselli also reportedly communicated with Kennedy. In a 1988 interview with People Magazine, Judith Campbell Exner claimed she had an affair with the president, and that during that relationship she served as a courier between the president and Roselli and Giancana. The president's brother, Robert Kennedy -- then-attorney general -- called for an investigation on Giancana.

The deaths of Roselli and Giancana in 1975 and 1976 occurred amid the Church committee's ongoing investigations surrounding Kennedy's assassination. That coincidence, Hart said, was suspicious enough to warrant press attention, and he was surprised that the press didn't jump on the story.

""I was always amazed in that particular instance of the CIA-Mafia connection and the Cuban connection 12 years -- coming up 12 years -- after Kennedy was killed that somebody didn't go after that story,"" he said. ""New York Times, Washington Post; anybody. And they didn't. They reported the deaths and that was it, and the strange quirky coincidence, you know, but nothing more.""

For Hart, the uncanny series of events roughly 12 years after Kennedy's death was less of a coincidence than an indication that people -- including Giancana -- knew more than they were letting on.

""You don't have to be a genius to believe that they knew something about the coincidence of events -- Cuba, Mafia, CIA and Kennedy -- that somebody didn't want that out in the public 12 years later,"" Hart said.

At a time when his Church committee was uncovering plots against the Cuban president and the CIA's use of the Mafia in those plots, Hart was privy to other peculiarities as well.

According to Hart, the Warren Commission -- the presidential commission charged with investigating Kennedy's assassination that concluded Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone -- remained unaware of the connections between Cuba, the CIA, the Mafia and Kennedy. Only then-CIA director Allen Dulles, who was on the commission, knew, according to Hart, but Dulles said nothing to the other members.

Hart also heard from William Robert Plumlee -- a former CIA contract pilot who gave classified testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then chaired by John Kerry, in the '90s -- about how he believed Kennedy was really killed. Plumlee told Hart that he'd flown a plane to Texas days before the president's assassination and had later come to believe that several people on board were connected to the murder. A report by TV producer Robert Vernon claimed that Plumlee testified that the flight -- with Roselli on board -- was an attempt to thwart the Kennedy assassination.

Hart tried to uncover the truth about the Kennedy assassination and the ""big unanswered questions."" He said he worked with fellow Church committee member and former Sen. Richard Schweiker (R-Penn.), but ultimately ran out of resources and leads. During an ill-fated presidential bid in the 1980s, Hart vowed he'd reopen the Kennedy investigation if elected. In retrospect, he said it ""was probably a stupid thing to do,"" citing death threats he received.

Fifty years later, the danger of digging into cases such as Kennedy's assassination is not lost on Hart. In his chiding of the press and its failure to seize the opportunity to reveal the truth about Kennedy's death, he admits that revealing such a truth -- even as a journalist -- could have dire consequences.

I had young children and no idea how to care for them. Shortly after I decided to separate from my husband, I met a man who I fell deeply in love with and decided to be with him at all costs. He graduated from North Carolina State University and was working as a contracted Geologist at Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. Against the wishes of my family and friends, I moved to Maryland to live with him.

We had lived there for a short while when he applied for a civilian job for the Defense Department as a Geologist in Aberdeen, Maryland. He had to apply for a secret security clearance for this job. He was cleared for the security clearance and got the job. We then moved to Harford County, Maryland into his childhood home. We married shortly after that. Once I had planted my feet in Maryland, I became the wife he had always wanted -- picket fence and all. He refused to let me work and wanted me to pamper him the way he felt he deserved to be pampered, and I obliged. When my girls came to Maryland, he raised them as if he were their father. He was very involved in their schooling and extra-curricular activities. I was so thankful to be married to a man who cared so much for them. He became involved in county politics, community projects, etc. We took wonderful vacations to Hawaii several times, Alaska, cross country trips. At times, I would miss North Carolina and my childhood friends but that was behind me now. Although I did not realize it at the time, we were living his life. The life he wanted.

On April 15, 2010, 11 years into my marriage, I had just gotten home from taking my daughter to school (she had a month to go before graduating) when the phone rang at 7:30am. It was my husband telling me that he was being detained. I had no idea what he meant by this until I finally realized that he had been arrested. I thought for sure it had to be a road rage incident or some kind of mistake. He told me that he loved me and that he didn't blame me if I divorced him. He hung up before he told me what had happened. Within minutes of that phone call, my entire property was swarmed by police -- exactly like you would see on television. I ran outside to see what was going on, but the police would not tell me anything. They told me that I was to stay with an officer and wait for the detectives to get there. When the detectives arrived, I was told that my husband had been arrested for taking pictures outside of the window of a teenage girl's bathroom. I could not hear anything they told me. I could not breathe. I could not believe that this was true. For nine hours, my house was no longer mine. It belonged to the police. They took what they wanted out of it and did to it what they pleased. The aftermath was mine to deal with.

My husband was bailed out of jail by his family and re-arrested on May 3, 2010 by the feds. This is when I learned that he had thousands of pictures and videos on his government issued computer, mostly of my daughter but also of her friends and other young girls in our community. The story became big news in Maryland and D.C. News crews were showing up at my house, our mailbox was continually bashed in, I was ostracized by my own town as if they thought I had something to do with it. To add insult to injury, I came to find out that this man that I loved so dearly had been arrested in the early '90s in the state of Ohio for doing the same exact thing! All the security clearances for his jobs with the United States government did me nor all the girls he sexually violated any good.

In August 2010, he was charged with two counts of child pornography in the Maryland Federal Courts and was sentenced to serve 12 years at Fort Dix Federal Prison in New Jersey. He believes that that government is using him as an example and that what he did has been blown way out of proportion. I believe the only regret he has is that he got caught. I also believe that when he does get out, he will do this again.

On April 15, 2010, my life came to a crashing halt. One phone call and the life that I knew and thought I loved was over and done. There are no words to describe the agonizing pain that I went through. Getting out of bed was impossible. I ceased to function at all. My heart was broken and all I wanted was to make the pain stop. I had a neighbor who was like a surrogate mother to me force me out of the bed and to my doctor. My doctor sent me to a therapist. Slowly, ever so slowly, I was moving again. I began re-connecting with my long lost friends from childhood on Facebook and eventually moved back to Charlotte, North Carolina where I was born and raised and where I belonged.

There are a few things I have learned from this nightmare and they are this: When your family and friends strongly discourage you from doing something, listen. Whomever you may become involved with, background check them thoroughly. This may seem impersonal but it will save you from ever having to go through a needless hell like I did. And last but not least, cherish your friends. They will be everything you will ever need when you are going through your worst storms. Therapist are wonderful. We all need them from time to time but nothing, absolutely nothing, will heal you quicker than the love of precious friends."

His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",E.J. Dionne: Obama needs to ask himself why even his supporters are growing impatient,"President Obama got roughed up by the pundit class last week. The question is what lessons he draws from the going-over. Here’s one he should take: The nation’s political conversation has grown stale, and many Americans have lost the sense of what he is doing to improve their lives.

You can argue that this perception isn’t fair. The Affordable Care Act, if it’s implemented well, will improve a lot of lives. The economy is adding jobs, not shedding them. The deficit is coming down. Two front-burner initiatives, immigration reform and broader background checks for guns — yes, they’ll be voted on again — really do matter.

But the fact is that the talk in Washington has been dominated by the same stuff we obsessed over in 2010, 2011 and 2012: a monotonous, uninspiring, insider clash over budgets. Even in that context, we barely discuss what government can do that would be helpful (except to air travelers).

Obama’s defenders say that D.C. dysfunction should be laid at the feet of Republicans in Congress who are so invested in his failure that they even vote against things they are for. That’s what Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) says happened on background checks.

Rather than criticize the president, says former chief White House speechwriter Jon Favreau, those who want him to succeed need to hold Republicans in the House and Senate accountable. The president can’t do it by himself, Favreau said in the Daily Beast. He needs help from his supporters.

Well, sure. To pretend that the president can magically get an increasingly right-wing Republican House and Senate contingent to do his bidding is either naive or willfully misleading. The GOP really does hope that blocking whatever Obama wants will steadily weaken him.

But the president also needs to ask himself why even his supporters are growing impatient. His whole budget strategy, after all, is directed almost entirely toward gently coaxing Republicans his way, without any concern as to whether what he is doing is demobilizing the very people he needs on his side now.

When, in pursuit of tax reform, he explicitly offered a compromise to change the index that determines Social Security benefits as part of his budget, he did so against the advice of many of his most loyal backers in Congress. That includes Democrats who would be willing to vote for that cut to Social Security benefits as part of a serious budget deal. But they insist that such a major step toward the Republicans should be taken only in return for concrete concessions from them on the need for more revenue.

If Obama wants to underscore that his problem is Republican obstruction, he should tell those GOP senators he likes to dine with that they need to come up with revenue very soon or else he’ll withdraw that “chained CPI” offer he claims not to like much anyway. Put up or shut up is a cliche, but a useful one.

Similarly, it’s worth asking why so many of Obama’s initiatives have dropped out of public view. Obama has called for raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour. Many Democrats in Congress think, correctly, that it should be set at $10. Would it be so hard for Obama to come out fighting for the minimum-wage increase — and for other steps to bolster the incomes of those stuck at the bottom of the economy? Why not expose that none of this is happening because of GOP opposition?

Obama wants to provide universal pre-K education. That ought to be a bipartisan idea. Many Republican governors have embraced the concept in their states. Shouldn’t the president be pushing harder to get it on the media’s radar by way of forcing a debate in Congress?

The president believes we need to spend more on our infrastructure to boost job creation now and to make us competitive for the long run. He’s right. But he needs to make clear it is something that’s genuinely important to him.

It’s true that Obama spoke about both his investment agenda and preschool plans at last week’s much-maligned news conference. And the White House announced on Sunday that he would embark on a series of “middle class jobs and opportunity tours.” These should be shaped by a consistent, driving theme: that the stakes in this debate are larger than the day-to-day drone of partisan invective suggests.

Remember the Mark Twain line that Wagner’s music was better than it sounded? Obama’s program has more to do with growth and opportunity than he usually lets on. If he wants to rally us, he might want to change that.

Mike Lee', 'R-Ut']",House Leaders Must Shut Back Door To Comprehensive Immigration Bill,"The Gang of Eight immigration bill is a 1,200-page legislative monstrosity. Senators had roughly 72 hours to read the final version of this massive and complex bill before the votes began. Like with Obamacare, the Senate was supposed to pass the bill in order to find out what was in it.

But while lawmakers and the public were left in the dark, the White House strategists and special interest allies who crafted the bill knew exactly what it contained: immediate amnesty, weakened enforcement, and unending illegal immigration.

The House has said that it will not take up the Senate bill. Rather, it will consider immigration reform in a “step-by-step” process, one bill at a time. We share the belief that the way to address immigration policy changes is through step-by-step legislation, with individual reform measures first implemented and then verified in the proper sequence.

We are concerned, however, that the House will pass individual, incremental bills only to have them cobbled together in a backroom deal with Majority Leader Reid and the Gang of Eight. Through a series of procedural maneuvers, House leaders could agree to begin negotiations with the Senate, known as a conference, using one of these smaller, targeted bills, while the Senate could bring the Gang of Eight bill to the negotiations.

This scenario would open the back door for congressional leaders to create a new amnesty-first, enforcement-later “comprehensive” immigration bill. Once the conference approves the new bill and sends it back to each chamber, amendments are prohibited and only an up-or-down vote is allowed.

Another danger is that, after the House passes several smaller bills, congressional leaders could handpick negotiators to meet in secret and develop a “compromise” plan to “fix” the Senate bill and bring the new–even larger–comprehensive proposal to a vote in both chambers.

If House members allow any of their proposals to be combined into an omnibus immigration bill, they would, in effect, allow White House strategists and their special interest allies to determine the final outcome of immigration much the way they shaped the creation of the original Gang of Eight bill. They would be handing the reins over to the very people who have made it their mission to suspend the constitutional rule of law in matters of immigration enforcement.

House leaders, therefore, should make absolutely clear that any individual immigration bills must be considered separately by the Senate, not crammed together into a behemoth comprehensive proposal. It’s not step-by-step if the bills are merged with the Senate monstrosity at a later date–either through a formal conference or a closed-door negotiation. Any possibility of such an outcome must be ruled out. How can House leaders ask a single member of Congress to vote for step-by-step bills if they’re leaving the back door wide open to a comprehensive bill?

There must be no confusion. No word play. Step-by-step must mean just that: individual steps, not an all-in-one legislative colossus.

As we’ve seen with spending bills, an enormous amount of mischief can be accomplished by rushing through a package of different proposals in the form of one catch-all bill. It deprives lawmakers the opportunity to review and modify each element, and it deprives the public a chance to weigh in.

The devil, the saying goes, is in the details. And there are a lot of details in several thousand pages of legislation."

The NCAA%27s vice president of enforcement is leaving in the wake of an external review

Miami president Donna Shalala issues a strong statement on the NCAA%27s conduct

Still%2C the submission of a Notice of Allegations to Miami is imminent

The future of the NCAA's case against Miami isn't the only thing in question in the wake of an external review that revealed misconduct by investigators.

NCAA president Mark Emmert, who confirmed to USA TODAY Sports the departure by March 1 of Julie Roe Lach, vice president of enforcement, called the results of the review ""an embarrassment."" Although Emmert said ""tainted information"" had been removed from the investigative record and indicated the case would move forward, Miami president Donna Shalala pushed back.

In a strongly worded statement that appeared to be an attempt to grab the high ground, Shalala said the misconduct ""taints the entire process"" and called for the NCAA to wrap up the process with no penalties beyond those already self-imposed by the school.

""We have been wronged in this investigation,"" Shalala said.

For more than two years, the NCAA has been investigating allegations of rule violations made by former booster Nevin Shapiro, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for running a $930 million Ponzi scheme. Miami instituted a bowl ban in each of the last two football seasons and reduced scholarships.

And regardless of what happens next to Miami, surely others are asking if they have been wronged, too – Emmert said the misconduct ""failed our membership"" – and what the NCAA will to do make it right.

Is the problem systemic? Have other cases been similarly tainted? According to the review by attorney Ken Wainstein of the law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, enforcement staff members secured the services of attorney Maria Elena Perez to glean information from depositions in Shapiro's bankruptcy proceedings. The report found the actions did not violate NCAA bylaws or enforcement staff policies, but found former investigator Ameen Najjar disregarded advice of the NCAA legal counsel, which told them not to use Perez to depose witnesses.

Najjar and Roe Lach did not return phone calls Monday. In an interview Monday with USA TODAY Sports, Emmert characterized Najjar's actions as ""a novel approach,"" adding that enforcement staff members ""knew that something like this had never been done before.""

""We need to be careful not to generalize beyond the data,"" Emmert added. ""We've got a decision here where some very bad judgment and very bad decisions were made, but that doesn't taint the entire enforcement process or the individuals involved in it.""

Shalala would disagree.

Although Emmert repeatedly declined to discuss Roe Lach's departure – except to confirm it – the review found she exercised ""insufficient oversight"" of Najjar's actions. The review absolved other NCAA officials, including chief operating officer Jim Isch and Emmert, of blame. Isch approved paying Perez, but the review concluded ""he was addressing only the fiscal issue and not any legal/prudential concerns."" According to the report, Emmert didn't learn of the investigators' conduct until last fall.

As a result, only the head of enforcement rolled.

""The actions that we're taking today are clearly consistent with principles of holding people accountable for their behavior,"" Emmert said in a teleconference. ""I'm not going to comment on any personnel actions, but again if the (NCAA's) executive committee believes that some disciplinary action toward me needs to be taken, then I'm sure they will.""

The external review was limited to the Miami investigation. Emmert said part of the charge for attorney Jonathan Duncan, who has been appointed interim head of enforcement, will be to conduct a broad review of the enforcement process. But according to Emmert, there are no plans to review other pending or recently completed cases for possible malfeasance.

""As we go forward through all of this, we need to have very clear protocols to make sure evidence has been gathered appropriately and that we have confidence in that process,"" Emmert told USA TODAY Sports. ""Up until this moment, I think everyone would say that has been the case.""

The Miami case will apparently go forward. A person familiar with the NCAA enforcement staff's activities said the Notice of Allegations has been prepared and is ""ready"" for delivery. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.

According to the external review, information derived from the bankruptcy depositions – including information gleaned from 13 full interviews and portions of 12 more – was removed from the Miami investigative record. But in her statement, Shalala said Miami pledged full cooperation when the investigation began in September 2010 – ""than two and a half years ago"" – and added:

""The University of Miami has lived up to those promises, but sadly the NCAA has not lived up to their own core principles. The lengthy and already flawed investigation has demonstrated a disappointing pattern of unprofessional and unethical behavior.""

The question is if the pattern goes beyond Miami. And regardless of the answer, the current perception is not positive.

Last month during a session at the NCAA Convention, ""public and membership distrust of the NCAA's ability to police itself"" was cited as a reason for the existence of the temporary Enforcement Working Group. In the external review, Wainstein found the action by the enforcement staff members had the potential appearance of ""an inappropriate manipulation of the bankruptcy process."" But as telling, he said they did not sufficiently consider ""whether it was consistent with the NCAA membership's understanding about the limits"" of the investigators' power.

Several other recent high-profile cases have been controversial, as well. The NCAA drew criticism from school administrators and outsiders alike for its handling last summer of Penn State for the Jerry Sandusky scandal – punishment that was unprecedented in severity and process – but that didn't involve the enforcement staff. Former USC assistant coach Todd McNair has filed suit against the NCAA for its actions in the investigation of former rule violations involving star Reggie Bush. Last fall the NCAA fired investigator Abigail Grantstein after her boyfriend was overheard providing information related to the eligibility case of freshman UCLA basketball player Shabazz Muhammad.

Emmert said he was committed to do what he could to ""improve the level of confidence that people have in the way enforcement is conducted,"" and added:

""Perfection is not the goal here – but confidence certainly is."""

Updated 7/12, 8:01 a.m. ET

(CNN) - It's no secret that Jay-Z is close with President Barack Obama. The hip hop artist held big fundraisers for the president, and his megastar wife, Beyoncé, performed at Obama's second inauguration.

But Jay-Z said this week their friendship also plays out on the small screen–a very small screen. In an interview with New York radio station Hot97, the rapper confirmed that he and Obama exchange text messages.



""Yeah, I've spoken to him on the phone and had texts from Obama, of course,"" he said Wednesday.

Jay-Z stopped himself and quickly expressed regret for saying ""of course,"" acknowledging the term may sound arrogant.

""Yes, that's happened,"" he continued, referring to the text messages.

The song writer and designer said Obama is ""a regular guy"" who uses a lot of sports analogies.

""I don't know if this is like breaching national security, but he was like–when he was getting elected the second time–he was like 'Hey, you know, fourth quarter, just give me the ball.' I said 'word'.""

That conversation, Jay-Z added, happened in Cleveland when he performed at a rally for Obama shortly before Election Day.

He further admitted he gets a little star struck around the president, a big admission for one of the most successful musical artists in the country.

Jay-Z has previously hinted that he uses SMS with the president. In his 2009 song, ""On to the Next One,"" the rapper mentions that he chills with Oprah ""in the projects"" and has Obama ""on the text.""

Obama's relationship with the power couple also made headlines this year when Jay-Z rapped that the White House–rather than the Treasury Department–gave him and Beyoncé approval for their high-profile trip to Cuba.

In an unusual White House press briefing, Obama's chief spokesman, Jay Carney, was asked about the lyrics.

But Carney sharply denied that the White House gave the couple clearance for their travel.

""I guess nothing rhymes with Treasury,"" Carney said.

The bonds between the rapper and the president go back at least as far as the 2008 campaign, when candidate Obama said the way to handle political mudslinging was by brushing one's shoulders off – mimicking Jay-Z's trademark move. Jay-Z's hits shuffle on Obama's iPod, he said in July 2010 – alongside the likes of crooner Frank Sinatra and opera great Maria Callas. The couple also visited the White House earlier that year, and their VIP tour included a stop inside the Situation Room.

The Supreme Court decided that Montana District Judge G. Todd Baugh cannot move forward with a hearing that had been scheduled for Friday at 1:30 p.m. local time to void the 31-day prison sentence that he imposed last week on Stacey Rambold.

The court’s ruling came less than an hour before the hearing in Billings was to start.

Rambold, 54, was convicted of raping a then-14-year-old student who killed herself while the case was pending. Baugh sentenced Rambold to a 15-year sentence and suspended all but 31 days of the sentence, with a credit for a single day already served in jail.

“We conclude that the stated intent of the District Court to alter the initially imposed oral sentence in today’s scheduled hearing is unlawful,” said the state Supreme Court’s ruling, which requires Baugh to issue a written judgment that aligns with his previous 31-day sentence.

“We take no position on the legality of the imposed sentence and will address the parties’ arguments in that regard on appeal,” said the ruling, which was supported by four of the court’s six justices.

Chief Justice Mike McGrath and Justice Brian Morris dissented without comment.

Baugh’s Aug. 26 sentence was widely criticized as too lenient, sparking local and national outrage. The victim’s mother criticized Baugh, who in sentencing Rambold remarked that the teenage victim was “older than her chronological age.”

The backlash apparently prompted the veteran judge to backpedal. In a court order issued this week, Baugh, 71, reasoned that his prior sentence was “illegal” because it ignored the mandatory minimum sentence of two years. Friday’s hearing, wrote Baugh, would correct the legal error.

Both prosecutors and Rambold’s defense attorneys objected to Baugh’s attempt to undo his previous sentence.

The state’s attorney general filed an emergency petition this week to prohibit Baugh’s hearing, arguing that the “proper avenue to address the illegal sentence” is an appeal before the Supreme Court.

The attorney general’s emergency petition recognized Baugh’s “effort to correct the error” but said that the correct judicial process needs to be upheld with an appeal to the Supreme Court.

Rambold’s attorneys concurred with state prosecutors, maintaining that a new sentencing hearing was inappropriate and the previous sentence should remain in effect, according to court documents.

Prosecutors filed on Wednesday a notice of appeal, which is pending before the state Supreme Court.

Trial lasted 5 months

His father%2C contractor friend also convicted of some charges

Each defendant could receive up to 20 years in prison

DETROIT — Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick took off his suit coat, tie, belt and jewelry. He handed his belongings to his mother and crossed his hands behind his back so federal agents could handcuff him.

It was a humiliating ending to a case that prosecutors said was about ""breathtaking corruption.""

A federal jury convicted Kilpatrick, his longtime contractor friend Bobby Ferguson and his father Bernard Kilpatrick on a combined 34 charges. Among the most serious: extortion, bribery and racketeering, which the defense referred to as the government's ""nuclear bomb."" The jury deliberated for 14 days.

The verdict marked a landslide victory for the federal government, which turned its radar gun onto Kilpatrick about a decade ago after a homeless shelter operator donated money to the Kilpatrick Civic Fund in exchange for a political favor.

That donation, which was first disclosed by the Detroit Free Press, triggered an IRS investigation that transformed into a broader probe of widespread corruption throughout City Hall that has ensnared more than 30 convictions.

""Kwame Kilpatrick didn't lead the city, he looted the city,"" U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said at a news conference, flanked by the prosecutors who tried the case and the federal agents who investigated it.

Kwame Kilpatrick was found guilty of 24 of 30 counts. Ferguson, who also was led away in handcuffs, was convicted on nine of 11 counts. Bernard Kilpatrick was convicted on just one of four counts: filing false taxes. The jury acquitted him on two other counts and deadlocked on the most serious charge: racketeering.

The government built its case against the Kilpatricks and Ferguson through secret surveillance videos, wiretaps and cooperating witnesses — several of them Kilpatrick's closest friends and aides, who earlier pleaded guilty to various crimes and agreed to testify. Perhaps most compellingly, the government also used text messages from the defendants as evidence stitching together the crimes.

It worked.

After five months of testimony from 90 witnesses, the panel of eight women and four men concluded that Kwame Kilpatrick and Ferguson engaged in a pattern of racketeering that lasted for years. But the panel could not unanimously agree that Bernard Kilpatrick was part of this criminal enterprise, which originally included five defendants.

Ex-city water department director Victor Mercado pleaded guilty to conspiracy during trial. The fifth defendant, former Kwame Kilpatrick right-hand man Derrick Miller, cut a deal before trial and testified against the remaining three. Both await sentencing.

Bernard Kilpatrick, who faces up to three years in prison and remains free pending sentencing, was overcome with emotion after the verdicts were read. In the courtroom, he sobbed as he hugged his son, who smiled and kept saying, ""It's OK, Pops. It's OK.""

Kilpatrick and Ferguson each face up to 20 years in prison but could get more, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. This far outweighs the punishment he received for his unrelated crimes in the scandal involving sexually explicit text messages and an affair with an aide, triggering his eventual resignation in 2008 and imprisonment.

Kilpatrick shook his head at times as the verdicts were read Monday, at one point mouthing, ""Oh my gosh."" He appeared stunned as he left the courtroom and declined to comment.

Kilpatrick's wife, Carlita Kilpatrick, and his three sons were not in the courtroom. But his mother, former U.S. Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, sat alongside friends and other relatives who cried as they watched Kilpatrick and Ferguson leave the courtroom in handcuffs.

""Love you, baby. We love you,"" one woman shouted as Kilpatrick was led away.

""Stay strong,"" Kilpatrick responded, later turning his head and adding: ""No doubt. No fear.""

The woman shouted back: ""None.""



'An important day'

For McQuade, Monday's verdict was long overdue.

She echoed the theme that prosecutors hammered away repeatedly at trial: that the case was about greed.

""Kwame Kilpatrick stole money from the people of Detroit. And while Kwame Kilpatrick enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, he watched the quality of life erode for the people of Detroit,"" McQuade said. ""The mayor cheated the system.""

He did that, McQuade said, with the help of Ferguson, who secured $127 million worth of contracts while his friend was mayor of Michigan's largest city — the bulk of it illegally.

""Our community has spoken,"" McQuade said. ""Our community has said you can't cheat the city and get away with it.""

Detroit FBI chief Robert Foley said Monday was ""an important day for justice and an important day for the city of Detroit.""

Promise of appeal

The defendants were defiant up to the end.

Kilpatrick's lawyer James Thomas said they will appeal, and Kilpatrick maintains his innocence.

""He is definitely going to pursue that with every ounce of his being,"" he said. ""I would expect that the judge is going to sentence him to a very difficult time. If that is the case, would you expect him to not do anything?""

Ferguson also proclaimed his innocence Monday and remained upbeat.

Coming out of the courthouse after the verdicts were announced, he said: ""God is good.""

Minority contractor Craig Davis Sr., owner of Craig's Carpentry, said he was glad to see a guilty verdict.

""I am extremely glad that the people voiced their concerns about this and that the prosecutors came forth and found this is a legitimate case, and that the jurors after months and months of deliberation decided their fate, and their fate was guilty,"" he said.

When Bernard Kilpatrick was asked whether the jury got it wrong, he said: ""Absolutely.""

Michael Rataj, Ferguson's attorney, said he was surprised by the verdict and is considering an appeal.

""Anytime you put your heart and soul into something like we did with this, you're disappointed,"" he said. ""You never really prepare yourself for this. I'm definitely shocked by the verdict.""

Straight to jail

In most white-collar crime trials, defendants are allowed to remain free on bond until they are sentenced.

After the verdicts were announced, the prosecution argued Kwame Kilpatrick and Ferguson should be locked up immediately.

The government argued Kilpatrick has repeatedly ignored court orders, lied about and hidden assets in his state case and violated his parole conditions stemming from the text message scandal. Kilpatrick also has access to cash, the government argued, stressing he can't be trusted not to flee.

Attorneys for Kilpatrick and Ferguson argued they should remain free on bond pending their sentencing and said they weren't a flight risk.

U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds, who said it was the defendants' burden to prove they can be trusted to remain free on bond, concluded Kilpatrick hadn't proven that. She concluded the same for Ferguson, who has a 2005 felony conviction for pistol-whipping an employee and, the government says, was later found in possession of guns when he wasn't supposed to have them.

""I think this is a close call,"" Edmunds said after hearing arguments from both sides. Still, she ordered that both men be locked up pending their official sentencing dates, which have not yet been determined.

All about the evidence

The jury — a diverse panel of eight women and four men — agreed to meet with reporters to discuss their verdict, but kept their identities secret.

The jury included five African Americans, one Hispanic female and six whites.

Nearly all who spoke said it came down to the evidence.

""We looked at the evidence as a whole — no one piece sealed the deal,"" said juror No. 9, an African-American male who knew very little about Kilpatrick's legal troubles before the trial started.

The jurors said they came up with a tentative decision Friday, but told the judge they wanted to sleep on it over the weekend.

One juror, an African-American woman who voted twice for Kilpatrick, said she was disappointed by what she learned at trial.

""I saw a lot that really, really turned my stomach,"" the woman said. ""There was never any anger. Disappointment is all that I feel.""

'That's justice'

Witnesses during the trial told of Kwame Kilpatrick's lavish lifestyle — complete with luxury vacations, custom-made suits and golf outings — despite being at the helm of a city so broke it's now on the verge of a state-appointed emergency financial manager to right its finances.

In some cases, longtime friends testified they handed cash to Kilpatrick in envelopes.

Tonya Wells, 50, of Detroit went to the detention hearing

because she said she wanted to see for herself that Kilpatrick would be locked up.

""That's justice. He doesn't deserve to go home. He took money from the citizens of Detroit under false pretenses for his own profit,"" she said as she left the courthouse. ""I'm disgusted.""

""The system of the Catholic clergy, for which I have great respect and to which I have given many years of my life, selects, cultivates, protects, defends, and produces sexual abusers."" - Richard Sipe

Richard Sipe, a former Benedictine monk and mental health counselor, lived in the catholic system for 18 years where he counseled his fellow priests. Sipe did a 25 year study examining celibacy in the priesthood.

What he found was that at any one time, no more than 50% of priests practice celibacy.



""They know that celibacy is not practiced"" they being Vatican authorities, Sipe said, ""you may not be keeping your celibacy but as long as it's secret, it's okay.""



Reverend Lawrence Murphy

The narrative is framed by the first known case of a priest being publicly accused of molestation — Father Lawrence Murphy of Milwaukee's St. John's School for the Deaf. There, we learn through the signed testimonials of four former pupils — Terry Kouhut, Gary Smith, Pat Kuehn and Arthur Budzinski — the boyish and beloved priest systematically raped and abused more than 200 pupils during his unstoppable 24-year tenure.

Reverend Lawrence Murphy sexually abused over 200 deaf children at St. John's school in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Not only were these young men unable to speak out about the abuses Father Murphy perpetrated on them, but in many cases, their own families did not know how to sign which put Father Murphy as interpretor between mother/father and son, leaving them absolutely no opportunity to tell.

His own moral depravity wasn't enough, Reverent Murphy enlisted older boys in an organized system of abuse. These older boys, who had been molested by Murphy, used threats to force little 7 year old boys to perform oral sex on him. In the documentary it was said these older boys were prepping the younger boys for Father Murphy.

Murphy eventually left the school of the deaf, but served as parish priest in another church near his cabin where he lived. This new church was never told of the accusations of pedophilia. Father Murphy continued abusing little boys.



In 1974, the very first public outcry against the abuses within the church came from three young deaf men who had been abused by Father Murphy.

Although deaf and unable to speak, these young men found their voice by plastering this image of Father Murphy in their deseperate attempt to stop him from hurting other little kids.



One of the biggest crimes featured in the film is that of Father Lawrence Murphy, who abused over 200 deaf children in a Milwaukee school that he was in charge of. The victims, years later as adults, brought the first public protest against clerical abuse in the United States. It ended up becoming a lawsuit against the pontiff himself.

""This wasn't a conspiracy, this was worse than a conspiracy - the policy was to keep this absolutely secret"" - Fr. Tom Doyle, Canon Lawyer

Father Tom Doyle, a Canon lawyer, became aware of the Murphy case and was asked to evaluate some of the information. The Vatican knew there was prior reports about Murphy - but failed to act.

Initially, Father Doyle attempted to work within the system, but was told ""we don't turn our priests in, this is our problem, we take care of it.""



Father Thomas Doyle, a canon lawyer at the Vatican, co-authored a report to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in 1985 warning that if the Church did not act on the problem of sexual-predator priests it would end up costing over one billion dollars. For his efforts he was made a military chaplain and sent to an American Air Force base in Germany. The corporate culture of the Catholic Church is to protect itself from scandal at all cost. To the men who run the Church, this means hiding their dirty secrets at all cost. They hoped that by paying the money, everyone would just go away. That didn’t happen.

At one point during the documentary, Fr. Doyle is asked if he ever represented the church. He replied ""yes, I represent the church every time I step into the courtroom, because I represent the people and the people are the church.""

Money is the root of all evil

Patrick J. Wall, Former Benedictine Monk, found out during his ordination that there were treatment centers around the world for priests who sodomized and raped kids. There were 55 child molesters in his monastery - more than 70 in the archdiocese. He was shocked that this information wasn't known publicly and was even more shocked by the special assignment he was tasked with.

Patrick Wall became the ""fixer"" for the church. He would travel to sites where priests were accused of childhood sexual abuse, given a budget of $250,000 to settle with the victims, (if you could get a confidentiality signed) and was to clean up the mess - remove the offending priest, put in a new priest and get everything back to normal.



""I thought I was going there to uncover the crimes, heal the wounds, offer pastoral care. I thought I was going to care for the afflicted, you know, what we are ordained for. But the people sending me in obviously had ulterior motives.""



InHe was never told to report abuse to authorities.

Many of the priests were sent to treatment centers, like the First Servants of the Paracletes. However, when Fr. Wall found out it didn't stop, that offending priests were allowed to stay in ministry, he left the priesthood.

First Servants of the Paraclete Center was opened by Father Fitzgerald to treat pedophile priests. He believed sexual predators who abuse children should be removed from the priesthood and forced to live a life of prayer and penance.

From the 1950s to the 1990s, the Servants of the Paracletes spent more than $80 million dollars treating more than 2000 pedophile priests.



The order, the Servants of the Paraclete, closed the New Mexico facility where many Los Angeles priests were sent amid a flood of lawsuits in the mid-1990s. A lawyer for the order indicated in a 2011 civil court filing that all treatment records were destroyed.

In the recent release of files from the Los Angeles Arch Diocese, letters from the Servants of the Paraclete to then Cardinal Roger Mahony, stating:



""Once more, we ask you to PLEASE DESTROY THESE PAGES AND ANY OTHER MATERIAL YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM US,"" the acting director of the order's treatment program wrote to Mahony in 1988 in a letter detailing therapists' reports about a prolific molester. ""This is stated for your own and our legal protection.""

Cover-up at the Highest Level

Prior to his election to Pope, Cardinal Razinger served as the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) from November 1981 through April 2005.

In 2001, Ratzinger put out a teaching approved by then pope John Paull II stating every sex abuse case that involves a minor comes to Ratzinger's desk.



The year before the Globe story, then-German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was designated to oversee complaints against priests from all over the world. In that job, he ordered that every sex abuse case in the church be brought to his attention, which means that the man who is now the head of the Roman Catholic Church was once in a position to know more than any other single individual in the church about the extent of the issue of pedophilic priests.

The CDF has documents from 4th century councils in Spain, that talks about sex abuse and children.

When will we stop protecting the pedophiles and start protecting the innocent children?

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/05/opinion/krugman-republicans-against-reality.html,2013-08-05 00:00:00,['Paul Krugman'],Republicans Against Reality - The New York Times,"Last week House Republicans voted for the 40th time to repeal Obamacare. Like the previous 39 votes, this action will have no effect whatsoever. But it was a stand-in for what Republicans really want to do: repeal reality, and the laws of arithmetic in particular. The sad truth is that the modern G.O.P. is lost in fantasy, unable to participate in actual governing.

Just to be clear, I’m not talking about policy substance. I may believe that Republicans have their priorities all wrong, but that’s not the issue here. Instead, I’m talking about their apparent inability to accept very basic reality constraints, like the fact that you can’t cut overall spending without cutting spending on particular programs, or the fact that voting to repeal legislation doesn’t change the law when the other party controls the Senate and the White House.

Am I exaggerating? Consider what went down in Congress last week.

First, House leaders had to cancel planned voting on a transportation bill, because not enough representatives were willing to vote for the bill’s steep spending cuts. Now, just a few months ago House Republicans approved an extreme austerity budget, mandating severe overall cuts in federal spending — and each specific bill will have to involve large cuts in order to meet that target. But it turned out that a significant number of representatives, while willing to vote for huge spending cuts as long as there weren’t any specifics, balked at the details. Don’t cut you, don’t cut me, cut that fellow behind the tree.

Then House leaders announced plans to hold a vote on doubling the amount of cuts from the food stamp program — a demand that is likely to sink the already struggling effort to agree with the Senate on a farm bill."

""It's a sad day in the history of the Senate,"" Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said after the vote.

Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., moving quickly following days of speculation, used the so-called ""nuclear option"" to pass the change. Typically, major changes like this take 67 votes, but he did it with just a simple majority.

With Republicans fuming, the change weakens the power of the minority to stall nominations for top positions. Instead of needing 60 votes to break a filibuster, the change means Democrats will now need just 51.

President Obama, speaking Thursday from the White House briefing room, said the change was needed to deal with Republicans' ""unprecedented pattern of obstruction.""

He cited, among other stand-offs, the bid by Republicans to filibuster his nomination of Chuck Hagel, a former GOP senator, for Defense secretary. ""For the sake of future generations, we can't let it become normal,"" he said.

Republicans charged that Democrats were merely trying to shift focus away from ObamaCare with the move.

""Today we face a real crisis in the confirmation process, a crisis concocted by the Democrat majority to distract attention from the ObamaCare disaster and, in the process, consolidate more power than any majority has had in more than 200 years,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said in a statement immediately following the historic vote.

""It sounds to me like Harry Reid is trying to change the subject and if I were taking all the incoming fire that he's taking over Obamacare, I'd try to change the subject too,"" House Speaker John Boehner said.

Reid won approval for the change on a 52-48 vote.

Regardless of Reid's underlying motivations, the vote Thursday marks a major change in Senate rules. The filibuster, for better or worse, has been a defining feature of the Senate for decades. While this makes the Senate one of the slowest-moving legislative bodies in the world, it also prevents legislation and appointments from moving too fast.

The vote on Thursday vastly reduces the power of the minority to stall nominations and makes it easier for federal judges to get lifetime appointments.

Even Democrats have supported the right to filibuster in the past. The late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said in 2010 that changing the rules would ""destroy the uniqueness of this institution.""

""In the hands of a tyrannical majority and leadership, that kind of emasculation of the cloture rule would mean that minority rights would cease to exist in the U.S. Senate,"" he said.

The change applies to nominations for federal court and other top positions, though not for the Supreme Court.

Reid got the ball rolling on the rule change late Thursday morning. Frustrated by Republicans' stonewalling of numerous Obama nominees, he cast the shift as vital to the Senate's survival.

""The Senate is a living thing, and to survive it must change,"" he said on the Senate floor.

But the maneuver itself threatens to make the bitter atmosphere on the Hill even more toxic, imperiling the prospect for future agreement on everything from immigration to the budget.

McConnell charged that Reid's attempt proves the Democrats are willing to ""do and say just about anything"" to get their way.

The change is the most far-reaching to filibuster rules since 1975, when a two-thirds requirement for cutting off filibusters against legislation and all nominations was eased to the 60-vote level. It delivers a major blow the GOP's ability to thwart Obama in making appointments, though Republicans have promised the same fate would await Democrats whenever the GOP recaptures the White House and Senate control.

The clash occurred as Democrats have grown increasingly irritated by the GOP's derailing of Obama's selections for top jobs, including three picks for pivotal judgeships in recent days.

Republicans say they are weary of repeated Democratic threats to rewrite the rules. They say Democrats similarly obstructed some of President George W. Bush's nominees and argue that the D.C. Circuit's caseload is too low, which Democrats reject.

Nomination fights are not new in the Senate, but as the hostility has grown the two sides have been edging toward a collision for much of this year.

The latest battle is over Obama's choices to fill three vacancies at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Since Halloween, GOP filibusters have derailed the president's nominations of District Judge Robert L. Wilkins, law professor Cornelia Pillard and attorney Patricia Millett for those jobs, which are lifelong.

The D.C. Circuit Court is viewed as second only to the Supreme Court in power because it rules on disputes over White House and federal agency actions. The circuit's eight judges are divided evenly between Democratic and Republican presidential appointees.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/11/us-citing-security-to-censor-more-public-records-analysis-finds/,2013-03-11 00:00:00,[],"US citing security to censor more public records, analysis finds","The U.S. government, led by the Pentagon and CIA, censored in the name of national security files that the public requested last year under the Freedom of Information Act more often than at any time since President Barack Obama took office, according to a new analysis by The Associated Press.

Overall, the Obama administration last year answered its highest number of requests so far for copies of government documents, emails, photographs and more, and it slightly reduced its backlog of requests from previous years. But it more often cited legal provisions allowing the government to keep records or parts of its records secret, especially a rule intended to protect national security.

The AP's analysis showed the government released all or portions of the information that citizens, journalists, businesses and others sought at about the same rate as the previous three years. It turned over all or parts of the records in about 65 percent of requests. It fully rejected more than one-third of requests, a slight increase over 2011, including cases when it couldn't find records, a person refused to pay for copies or the request was determined to be improper.

The government's responsiveness under the FOIA is widely viewed as a barometer of the federal offices' transparency. Under the law, citizens and foreigners can compel the government to turn over copies of federal records for zero or little cost. Anyone who seeks information through the law is generally supposed to get it unless disclosure would hurt national security, violate personal privacy or expose business secrets or confidential decision-making in certain areas.

The AP's review comes at the start of the second term for Obama, who promised during his first week in office that the nation's signature open-records law would be ""administered with a clear presumption: In the face of doubt, openness prevails."" The review examined figures from the largest federal departments and agencies. Sunday was the start of Sunshine Week, when news organizations promote open government and freedom of information.

White House spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement that during the past year, the government ""processed more requests, decreased the backlog, improved average processing times and disclosed more information pro-actively."" Schultz said the improvements ""represent the efforts of agencies across the government to meet the president's commitment to openness. While there is more work to be done, this past year demonstrates that agencies are responding to the president's call for greater transparency.""

In a year of intense public interest over deadly U.S. drones, the raid that killed Usama bin Laden, terror threats and more, the government cited national security to withhold information at least 5,223 times — a jump over 4,243 such cases in 2011 and 3,805 cases in Obama's first year in office. The secretive CIA last year became even more secretive: Nearly 60 percent of 3,586 requests for files were withheld or censored for that reason last year, compared with 49 percent a year earlier.

Other federal agencies that invoked the national security exception included the Pentagon, Director of National Intelligence, NASA, Office of Management and Budget, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Communications Commission and the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Homeland Security, Justice, State, Transportation, Treasury and Veterans Affairs.

U.S. courts are loath to overrule the administration whenever it cites national security. A federal judge, Colleen McMahon of New York, in January ruled against The New York Times and the American Civil Liberties Union to see records about the government's legal justification for drone attacks and other methods it has used to kill terrorism suspects overseas, including American citizens. She cited an ""Alice in Wonderland"" predicament in which she was expected to determine what information should be revealed but unable to challenge the government's secrecy claim. Part of her ruling was sealed and made available only to the government's lawyers.

""I find myself stuck in a paradoxical situation in which I cannot solve a problem because of contradictory constraints and rules — a veritable Catch-22,"" the judge wrote. ""I can find no way around the thicket of laws and precedents that effectively allow the executive branch of our government to proclaim as perfectly lawful certain actions that seem on their face incompatible with our Constitution and laws, while keeping the reasons for their conclusion a secret.""

The AP could not determine whether the administration was abusing the national security exemption or whether the public was asking for more documents about sensitive subjects. Nearly half the Pentagon's 2,390 denials last year under that clause came from the National Security Agency, which monitors Internet traffic and phone calls worldwide.

""FOIA is an imperfect law, and I don't think that's changed over the last four years since Obama took office,"" said Alexander Abdo, an ACLU staff attorney for its national security project. ""We've seen a meteoric rise in the number of claims to protect secret law, the government's interpretations of laws or its understanding of its own authority. In some ways, the Obama administration is actually even more aggressive on secrecy than the Bush administration.""

The Obama administration also more frequently invoked the law's ""deliberative process"" exception to withhold records describing decision-making behind the scenes. Obama had directed agencies to use it less often, but the number of such cases had surged after his first year in office to more than 71,000. After back-to-back years when figures steadily declined, the government cited that reason 66,353 times last year to keep records or parts of records secret.

Even as the Obama administration continued increasing its efforts answering FOIA requests, people submitted more than 590,000 requests for information in fiscal 2012 — an increase of less than 1 percent over the previous year. Including leftover requests from previous years, the government responded to more requests than ever in 2012 — more than 603,000 — a 5 percent increase for the second consecutive year.

The Homeland Security Department, which includes offices that deal with immigration files, received more than twice as many requests for records — 190,589 new requests last year — as any other agency, and it answered significantly more requests than it did in 2011. Other agencies, including the State Department, National Transportation Safety Board and Nuclear Regulatory Commission performed worse last year. The State Department, for example, answered only 57 percent of its requests, down from 75 percent a year earlier.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services drove a dramatic increase in the number of times DHS censored immigration records under exceptions to police files containing personal information and law enforcement techniques. The agency invoked those exemptions more than 136,000 times in 2012, compared with more than 75,000 a year earlier. Even though USCIS is not a law-enforcement agency, officials used the exceptions specifically reserved for law enforcement.

The AP's analysis also found that the government generally took longer to answer requests. Some agencies, such as the Health and Human Services Department, took less time than the previous year to turn over files. But at the State Department, for example, even urgent requests submitted under a fast-track system covering breaking news or events when a person's life was at stake took an average two years to wait for files.

Journalists and others who need information quickly to report breaking news, for example, fared worse last year. The rate at which the government granted so-called expedited processing, which moves an urgent request to the front of the line for a speedy answer, fell from 24 percent in 2011 to 17 percent last year. The CIA denied every such request last year.

Under increased budget pressure across the government, agencies more often insisted that people pay search and copying fees. It waived costs in 59 percent of requests, generally when the amount was negligible or the release of the information is in the public interest, a decline from 64 percent of cases a year earlier. At the Treasury Department, which faced questions about its role in auto bailouts and stimulus programs during Obama's first term, only one in five requests were processed at no charge. A year earlier, it granted more than 75 percent of fee waivers. The CIA denied every request last year to waive fees.

The 33 agencies that AP examined were: Agency for International Development, CIA, Agriculture Department, Commerce Department, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Defense Department, Education Department, Energy Department, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Interior Department, Justice Department, Labor Department, State Department, Transportation Department, Treasury Department, Department of Veterans Affairs, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Communications Commission, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Election Commission, Federal Trade Commission, NASA, National Science Foundation, National Transportation Safety Board, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Management and Budget, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Securities and Exchange Commission, Small Business Administration, the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service.

Four agencies that were included in AP's previous analysis of FOIA performance did not publicly release their 2012 reports. They included the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Council on Environmental Quality and the Office of Personnel Management."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/01/22/CBS-News-Exec-Claims-Pulverize-was-Analysis,2013-01-22 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],"CBS News Exec Claims 'Pulverize GOP' Was Analysis, Not Opinion","Saturday morning, Big Journalism ran the story of John Dickerson, a CBS News political director, who took to the online pages of Slate to suggest it was time for Obama to “destroy” and “pulverize” the Republican Party.

Today, Dickerson took to the online pages of Slate again, this time to insist we all misunderstood him. His new headline and subtitle say it all:

They Hate Me, They Really Hate Me Conservatives despise my analysis of Obama’s second-term options. But it was analysis–not advice.

He then writes:

Some people thought I was giving the president my personal advice. No. My goal was to make a compelling argument based on the facts. I used words like “war” and “pulverize,” and some have responded with threats to me and my family. (“Go for his throat!” some have counseled, echoing the headline.) These words have also liberated some correspondents (USUALLY THE ONES THAT TYPE IN ALL CAPS!!!!) from reading the piece or reading it in the spirit in which it was written.

All the left-wing bases are pretty much covered there: Oh, poor me; I’m the misunderstood victim who’s hated and receiving death threats from the wingers.

I honestly believe that one of the Lefts’ primary tactics is to endlessly exhaust us with this kind of relentless tactical nonsense.

If Dickerson was indeed writing analysis, he did an awfully good job ofdisguising it as naked advocacy. Here are the opening paragraphs of Dickerson’s original piece. Please tell me at which point this Obama cheer-leading distinguishes itself as anything nearing objective analysis: [emphasis added]

Go for the Throat! Why if he wants to transform American politics, Obama must declare war on the Republican Party. On Monday, President Obama will preside over the grand reopening of his administration. It would be altogether fitting if he stepped to the microphone, looked down the mall, and let out a sigh: so many people expecting so much from a government that appears capable of so little. A second inaugural suggests new beginnings, but this one is being bookended by dead-end debates. Gridlock over the fiscal cliff preceded it and gridlock over the debt limit, sequester, and budget will follow. After the election, the same people are in power in all the branches of government and they don’t get along. There’s no indication that the president’s clashes with House Republicans will end soon. Inaugural speeches are supposed to be huge and stirring. Presidents haul our heroes onstage, from George Washington to Martin Luther King Jr. George W. Bush brought the Liberty Bell. They use history to make greatness and achievements seem like something you can just take down from the shelf. Americans are not stuck in the rut of the day. But this might be too much for Obama’s second inaugural address: After the last four years, how do you call the nation and its elected representatives to common action while standing on the steps of a building where collective action goes to die? That bipartisan bag of tricks has been tried and it didn’t work. People don’t believe it. Congress’ approval rating is 14 percent, the lowest in history. In a December Gallup poll, 77 percent of those asked said the way Washington works is doing “serious harm” to the country. The challenge for President Obama’s speech is the challenge of his second term: how to be great when the environment stinks. Enhancing the president’s legacy requires something more than simply the clever application of predictable stratagems. Washington’s partisan rancor, the size of the problems facing government, and the limited amount of time before Obama is a lame duck all point to a single conclusion: The president who came into office speaking in lofty terms about bipartisanship and cooperation can only cement his legacy if he destroys the GOP. If he wants to transform American politics, he must go for the throat.

As you can see, any claim that this is analysis, and not opinion, is complete nonsense.

As the portions I’ve highlighted make clear, Dickerson’s entire piece was predicated on his obvious belief that Republicans are the problem, not Obama. All four of those paragraphs are loaded with criticism of the GOP, while Obama is presented as a reasonable man who tried his best to make things work only to find his noble intentions thwarted at every turn.

The love for Obama starts in the next paragraph, as the GOP bashing continues:

President Obama could, of course, resign himself to tending to the achievements of his first term. He’d make sure health care reform is implemented, nurse the economy back to health, and put the military on a new footing after two wars. But he’s more ambitious than that. He ran for president as a one-term senator with no executive experience. In his first term, he pushed for the biggest overhaul of health care possible because, as he told his aides, he wanted to make history. He may already have made it. There’s no question that he is already a president of consequence. But there’s no sign he’s content to ride out the second half of the game in the Barcalounger. He is approaching gun control, climate change, and immigration with wide and excited eyes. He’s not going for caretaker. How should the president proceed then, if he wants to be bold? The Barack Obama of the first administration might have approached the task by finding some Republicans to deal with and then start agreeing to some of their demands in hope that he would win some of their votes. It’s the traditional approach. Perhaps he could add a good deal more schmoozing with lawmakers, too. That’s the old way. He has abandoned that. He doesn’t think it will work and he doesn’t have the time. As Obama explained in his last press conference, he thinks the Republicans are dead set on opposing him. They cannot be unchained by schmoozing. Even if Obama were wrong about Republican intransigence, other constraints will limit the chance for cooperation. Republican lawmakers worried about primary challenges in 2014 are not going to be willing partners. He probably has at most 18 months before people start dropping the lame-duck label in close proximity to his name.

“Even if Obama were wrong about Republican intransigence…”

Whatevs.

A look at Dickerson’s previous Slate columns only bolsters the case that he has no business presenting himself on CBS News, or anywhere, as an unbiased political analyst.

But even if Dickerson’s DESTROY THEM! column is analysis, it’s ridiculously biased analysis, and biased only in favor of every premise Obama’s manufactured in his ongoing media/political war with the GOP.

Maybe that’s the problem… Maybe what the corrupt media now considers “objective analysis” is so comfortable in the tank with Obama, that those of us who live in the real world can no longer distinguish between the rantings of the politically bloodthirsty Left and the mainstream media’s idea of analysis.

Because there is no difference.

Incredible amounts of corporate money have flooded into our political system since the Citizens United decision. Indeed, Bazelon's statement in 2007 seems very prescient after this week:



The reassurances to the left about Roberts' virtues look pretty empty this week. And just wait until Roberts becomes a court veteran. The longer he's there, the less relevant keeping or chucking past decisions will be, and the more he'll build, from case to case, on the opinions he has written himself. [Emphasis supplied.]

That is precisely what Roberts did in gutting the Voting Rights Act this week, where in his opinion in Shelby County v. Holder (PDF), the precedent Roberts relies upon almost exclusively is his own 2009 opinion in. When affirmative action comes before the court again, watch the citations to Fisher

Might this be the moment that finally provides a deeper understanding and awakening in the country to just how extremist and radical the Robert Court is? Certainly on the court that may be happening. Justice Ginsburg's dissent is quite biting:



Without even identifying a standard of review, the Court dismissively brushes off arguments based on “data from the record,” and declines to enter the “debat[e about] what [the] record shows.” Ante, at 20–21. One would expect more from an opinion striking at the heart of the Nation’s signal piece of civil-rights legislation.I note the most disturbing lapses. First, by what right,given its usual restraint, does the Court even address Shelby County’s facial challenge to the VRA? Second, the Court veers away from controlling precedent regarding the“equal sovereignty” doctrine without even acknowledging that it is doing so. Third, hardly showing the respect ordinarily paid when Congress acts to implement the Civil War Amendments, and as just stressed, the Court does not even deign to grapple with the legislative record. [...] the Court’s opinion in this case contains not a word explaining why Congress lacks the power to subject to preclearance the particular plaintiff that initiated this lawsuit—Shelby County, Alabama. The reason for the Court’s silence is apparent, for as applied to Shelby County, the VRA’s preclearance requirement is hardly contestable. [...] Beyond question, the VRA is no ordinary legislation. It is extraordinary because Congress embarked on a mission long delayed and of extraordinary importance: to realize the purpose and promise of the Fifteenth Amendment. For a half century, a concerted effort has been made to end racial discrimination in voting. Thanks to the Voting Rights Act, progress once the subject of a dream has been achieved and continues to be made. [...] Congress reauthorized the VRA, including the coverage provision, with overwhelming bipartisan support. It was the judgment of Congress that “40 years has not been a sufficient amount of time to eliminate the vestiges of discrimination following nearly 100 years of disregard for the dictates of the 15th amendment and to ensure that the right of all citizens to vote is protected as guaranteed by the Constitution.” 2006 Reauthorization §2(b)(7), 120 Stat. 577. That determination of the body empowered to enforce the Civil War Amendments “by appropriate legislation” merits this Court’s utmost respect. In my judgment, the Court errs egregiously by overriding Congress’ decision. [Emphasis supplied.]

The direct political impact of the Roberts Five's radical extreme overturning of one of the most admired and effective pieces of legislation in the history of the nation is patent. Already many of the covered jurisdictions are warming up their schemes to suppress minority voting, mostly through onerous voter ID laws.

The question is will the nation, especially minority voters, be ""activated"" as well. A big part of the question will be determined by how the Democratic Party explains what is at stake. Too often it has failed in this task.

And too often liberal pundits have failed to explain the extreme and radical nature of the project the Roberts Five are engaged in.

One of my sig lines back in the day was ""the SCOTUS is extraordinary."" Every year we find out again and again how extraordinary it is. Can the extreme and radical nature of the Roberts Five be properly conveyed by the Democratic Party and liberal and progressive commentators? Can the extreme and radical Roberts Five become a significant part of the political conversation? It needs to, not just for the politics but because the country needs to know what these five men are up to. And they must be stopped."

The state Department of Finance estimates that by the middle of this year, whites and Latinos will each represent about 39% of California population, with Latinos reaching a plurality soon after that.

Officials expect that by 2060, Latinos will make up 48% of the state’s population, compared with 30% for whites. Asians will make up 13% of the population, and blacks 4%.

As the white baby boomer population moves into retirement, Latinos and Asians will play an even bigger role in the state’s labor force, according to the state report.

In 2030, there will be 9.6 million Latinos in the prime working ages of 25 to 64; there will be 7.2 million whites and 3.1 million Asians, the report said. By 2060, there will be 12.1 million Latinos in that working group, compared to 7.4 million whites and 3.2 million Asians.

Experts said these shifts will bring fundamental changes to the demographics of the workplace, as many baby boomers — the majority of whom are white — retire.

“This should serve as a wake-up call and appreciate how the older generation needs the younger generation,” said USC demography and urban planning professor Dowell Myers.

The more educated and prosperous this younger generation is, the more they can contribute to California’s tax base as the baby boomers’ contributions decrease, Myers said.

“Without the babies born to those immigrant mothers, we would really be in deep trouble,” he added.

Myers and others said the projections underscore the importance of education in helping the future workforce be as productive as possible.

The report also predicted a significant age gap among different ethnic groups.

By 2030, there will be 7.2 million Latinos younger than 25 compared to 2.2 million who will be 65 or older. By comparison, 4.1 million of the white population will be 65 or older and 3.8 million will be younger than 25.

The rise of California’s Latino population has been apparent for decades. And news that Latinos will surpass whites in total population has been predicted for some time.

“The projections are a continuation that have been observed for the last 20 years,” said James Allen, professor emeritus at Cal State Northridge.

The report also included some new growth projections for the state.

California’s population will reach nearly 52.7 million by 2060, crossing the 50-million threshold by 2049, the study found.

The population in Los Angeles County will increase by 1.7 million by 2060, an 18% increase from 2010.

The county’s population of whites and blacks will decrease by 25% and 17%, respectively, from 2010 to 2060. The Asian population will increase by 27% and the Latino population will get a 43% boost.

In Orange County, the state projects a 10% population increase by 2060. Ventura County should see a 25% population increase during the same period, officials said.

Rural Imperial County could see its population double by 2060.

Browsing the library, you wonder if these two presidents are complete opposites after all, as you see how history was shaped by an arrogant, press-averse, father-fixated, history-obsessed, strangely introverted chief executive.

Robert Draper, the author of “Dead Certain: The Presidency of George W. Bush,” perused the library with me and observed: “So 43 grew up entitled but could display a commoner’s touch, while 44 grew up hardscrabble yet developed this imperial mien. The former is defined by incuriosity, the latter by self-absorption. One is a late-blooming artist, the other a precocious writer. They can each make you kind of miss the other.”

Obama’s compelling speech on Thursday was his way of saying he didn’t want the seductive but morally dicey drone program he inherited from W. to define his own presidency. The way it had been going, one of the killer robots, hanging from the ceiling, might have made a fitting centerpiece for an Obama library.

W.’s library highlights his role in launching the Global War on Terror, an Orwellian phrase designed to conflate the sins of Osama, who was responsible for 9/11, and the sins of Saddam, who was not. That was the fatal mistake and hallmark of the Bush era. W., Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld declared war on a tactic, stoked fear as a smokescreen and treated pre-emptive attacks as just.

Better late than never, Obama brought his lapidary logic and legal cautions to bear. “Neither I nor any president can promise the total defeat of terror,” he said. “We will never erase the evil that lies in the hearts of some human beings nor stamp out every danger to our open society.”"

NEW YORK — Ed Koch is being remembered as the quintessential New Yorker – an admired but tough, colorful former mayor who will be honored at his funeral by former President Bill Clinton.

At the service Monday morning at Manhattan's Temple Emanu-El, mourners will also hear about Koch's other fierce loyalty: Israel. The Israeli consul general is set to speak, along with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Clinton interrupted a trip to Japan to return to New York for the funeral, according to Koch spokesman George Arzt.

He said Koch was a friend of both Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, and was helpful during her successful campaign for the U.S. Senate from New York. Koch also backed Hillary Clinton in her presidential run.

Bill Clinton will serve as a representative for President Barack Obama at the funeral.

Koch died Friday of congestive heart failure at age 88.

Friends from his weekly Greenwich Village luncheon gathering got together on Saturday, two weeks after his last meal with them.

The funeral will be held at one of the nation's most prominent synagogues, a Reform Jewish congregation on Fifth Avenue. Bloomberg is a member, as are comedian Joan Rivers and former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer.

""I don't want to leave Manhattan, even when I'm gone,"" he told The Associated Press in 2008 after purchasing a burial plot in Trinity Church Cemetery, at the time the only graveyard in Manhattan that still had space. ""This is my home. The thought of having to go to New Jersey was so distressing to me.""

Koch led his city for 12 years, with a brash, humor-tinged style that came to personify the New York of the 1980s.

The Democratic mayor is credited with helping save New York from its economic crisis in the 1970s and leading it to financial rebirth. But during his three terms as mayor, he also faced racial tensions and corruption among political allies, as well as the AIDS epidemic, homelessness and urban crime.

In his weekly radio address, Bloomberg called Koch ""our most tireless, fearless, and guileless civic crusader.""

The mayor said his predecessor's ""tough, determined leadership and responsible fiscal stewardship ... helped lift the city out of its darkest days and set it on course for an incredible comeback.""

He added, ""When someone needed a good kick in the rear, he gave it to them.""

Koch lost the Democratic nomination for mayor in 1989 to David Dinkins, who succeeded him.

Koch said he was defeated ""because of longevity."" In his words, ""people get tired of you.""

But as the votes were coming in, he said he told himself, ""I'm free at last."""

In his deposition, Gray who has a history of abusing Alexander, admitted it, stated he intended to hurt her had she not fired the warning shot, and said she did the right thing. He also said Alexander did not aim he gun at him. Gray then changed his story once the case went to trial. He walked out a free man - Marissa Alexander, the battered wife, received 20 years. The Florida Stand Your Ground Law did not work for Alexander because she fired a warning shot. Had she shot and killed Rico Gray that day, she would have most likely served no time at all.

My source who was in the courtroom today, reported new evidence has been brought forth - a text message of Rico Gray asking Marissa to come over for sex while there was an order of protection. Rico Gray claims Marissa should not be let out on bond because he is afraid of Marissa; he fears/feared for his life. Does asking her for sex sound like someone who feared for his life?

“I was in a rage. I called her a whore and bitch and . . . I told her, you know, I used to always tell her that, if I can’t have you, nobody going to have you. It was not the first time of ever saying it to her.”~ Rico Gray in his deposition on November 22, 2010.

Marissa Alexander's case has been highly publicized from the start, and the Free Marissa Now campaign has grown throughout social media. The case was catapulted into even more national spotlight, following the George Zimmerman case. In July 2013, Zimmerman was set free after killing teenager, Trayvon Martin, even though Zimmerman was the aggressor. Ironically, the same state attorney that failed to successfully prosecute George Zimmerman, is the same attorney that sent Marissa Alexander to prison. State Attorney Angela Corey 'twisted the knife' by refusing to drop Alexander's case,even after it was overturned in September.

Unless something changes, it doesn't look as though Marissa Alexander and her three children will be having happy holidays, as she awaits a new bail hearing, and then a whole new trial in March 2014. Supposedly the next trial will be different. This time, Florida courts say the burden of proof will be placed upon them rather than Marissa Alexander. Isn't that how it's supposed to work, Florida?

New Republic: Have you ever fired a gun? President Obama: Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time. New Republic: The whole family? President Obama: Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there.

Journalists, politicians, and the general public alike reacted with understandable skepticism to this politically expedient claim by the President. No one could recall ever seeing a photograph of President Obama shooting skeet, nor had he ever claimed before that he had ever participated in the sport.

At the regular White House press briefing on Monday morning, a skeptical Jessica Yellin, CNN’s White House correspondent, pressed White House secretary Jay Carney on the issue. His response was less than convincing:

Yellin: On a different topic, how often does the President go skeet shooting? (Laughter.) And are there photographs of him doing so? Carney: I would refer you simply to his comments. I don’t know how often. He does go to Camp David with some regularity, but I’m not sure how often he’s done that. Yellin: Is there a photograph of him doing it? Carney: There may be, but I haven’t seen it. Yellin: Why haven’t we heard about it before? Carney: Because when he goes to Camp David, he goes to spend time with his family and friends and relax, not to produce photographs.

Congressman Blackburn was among those skeptical of the President’s claim who remained unconvinced by Carney’s explanation. Monday night on CNN she issued her skeet shooting challenge to the President:

My money is on Congressman Blackburn."

http://news.yahoo.com/senate-confirms-kerry-nomination-state-dept-214010433--politics.html,,[],Senate confirms Kerry nomination for State Dept.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate overwhelmingly confirmed President Barack Obama's choice of five-term Sen. John Kerry to be secretary of state, with Republicans and Democrats praising him as the ideal successor to Hillary Rodham Clinton.

The vote Tuesday was 94-3. One senator — Kerry — voted present and accepted congratulations from colleagues on the Senate floor. The roll call came just hours after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved the man who has led the panel for the past four years.

No date has been set for Kerry's swearing-in, but in a letter to Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, Kerry says his resignation is effective at 4 p.m. Friday. The State Departments plans a welcoming ceremony for Kerry on Monday.

Obama tapped Kerry, 69, the son of a diplomat, decorated Vietnam veteran and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, to succeed Clinton, who is stepping down after four years. The Massachusetts Democrat, who had pined for the job but was passed over in 2009, has served as Obama's unofficial envoy, smoothing fractious ties with Afghanistan and Pakistan.

""Sen. Kerry will need no introduction to the world's political and military leaders and will begin Day One fully conversant not only with the intricacies of U.S. foreign policy, but able to act on a multitude of international stages,"" said Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who will succeed Kerry as committee chairman.

Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the panel's top Republican, called Kerry ""a realist"" who will deal with unrest in Egypt, civil war in Syria, the threat of al-Qaida-linked groups in Africa and Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons.

Kerry, a forceful proponent of climate change legislation, also will have a say in whether the United States moves ahead on the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada, a divisive issue that has roiled environmentalists.

Obama had nominated Kerry after Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, removed her name from consideration following criticism from Republicans over her initial comments about the attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

Story continues

Voting against Kerry were three Republicans — Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma and John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas. Absent from the vote were Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and John Hoeven, R-N.D.

""Sen. Kerry has a long history of liberal positions that are not consistent with a majority of Texans,"" Cornyn said in a statement. The senator is up for re-election next year and could face a tea party challenge.

Kerry's smooth path to the nation's top diplomatic job stands in stark contrast to the harsher treatment for Obama's other national security nominees — Chuck Hagel to be defense secretary and John Brennan to be CIA director.

Hagel, the former two-term Republican senator from Nebraska, faces strong opposition from some of his onetime GOP colleagues who question his support for reductions in the nuclear arsenal and cuts in defense spending. Lawmakers also have questioned whether he is sufficiently supportive of Israel and strongly opposed to any outreach to Iran.

Democrats have rallied for Hagel, and he has the announced support of at least a dozen members in advance of his confirmation hearing on Thursday. Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi will support Hagel, a spokesman said Tuesday, making him the first Republican to signal he will vote for the nomination.

Six Republicans have said they would vote against him, with some opposing Obama's choice even before the president's announcement.

Brennan faces questions from the GOP about White House leaks of classified information and from Democrats about the administration's use of drones.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., threatened to block the nomination of both men until he gets more answers from the Obama administration about the assault on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

Graham, who earlier this month signaled he would delay Brennan's pick, said in an interview Monday night with Fox News' ""On the Record"" the he would ""absolutely"" block Hagel unless Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testifies about the attack in Benghazi, Libya.

Clinton testified for more than five hours last Wednesday before the House and Senate, but that wasn't sufficient for Graham.

""Hillary Clinton got away with murder, in my view,"" he said. ""She said they had a clear-eyed view of the threats. How could you have a clear-eyed of the threats in Benghazi when you didn't know about the ambassador's cable coming back from Libya?""

Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., told reporters Tuesday that a hearing with Panetta on Libya is planned though the date is uncertain. Graham welcomed that news and said he would not thwart a committee vote on the nomination.

""Happy as a clam. News to me,"" said Graham, who met with Hagel for 20 minutes on Tuesday.

Pentagon spokesman George Little said Panetta had not responded yet to the request but that the department has been forthcoming with information. He insisted that the Hagel confirmation process move as quickly as possible.

Two former chairmen of the committee — Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia and Republican John Warner of Virginia — plan to introduce Hagel, according to officials close to the confirmation process. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the committee has not formally made an announcement.

As a White House emissary, Kerry has tamped down diplomatic fires for Obama. He also has stepped ahead of the administration on a handful of crises. He joined Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., as an early proponent of a more aggressive policy toward Libya, pushing for using military forces to impose a ""no-fly zone"" over Libya as Moammar Gadhafi's forces killed rebels and other citizens. He was one of the early voices calling for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down as revolution roiled the nation two years ago.

During his tenure, Kerry has pushed for reducing the number of nuclear weapons, shepherding a U.S.-Russia treaty through the Senate in December 2010, and has cast climate change as a national security threat, joining forces with Republicans on legislation that faced too many obstacles to win congressional passage.

He has led delegations to Syria and met a few times with President Bashar Assad, now a pariah in U.S. eyes after months of civil war and bloodshed as the government looks to put down a people's rebellion. Figuring out an end-game for the Middle East country would demand all of Kerry's skills.

The selection of Kerry closes a political circle with Obama. In 2004, it was White House hopeful Kerry who asked a largely unknown Illinois state senator to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic convention in Boston, handing the national stage to Obama. Kerry lost that election to President George W. Bush. Four years later, Obama was the White House hopeful who succeeded where Kerry had failed.

At a Washington, D.C., memorial Monday night, members of Congress and loved ones gathered to remember Swartz, who committed suicide on Jan. 11 while facing years in prison for mass-downloading scholarly articles.

Swartz had already reshaped the Web experiences of millions by co-creating Reddit and the information-distribution service RSS. By turns, speakers at the Cannon House Office Building compared Swartz to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Apple founder Steve Jobs, and 20th century British programmer Alan Turing -- with Swartz as yet another cybergenius whose ambitions carried him to the law’s edge.

Swartz hanged himself in New York while under indictment for purportedly breaking the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Prosecutors had hinted he might face decades in federal prison for violating a law that congressional speakers at the memorial said they planned to change.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), leader of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has opened an inquiry into Swartz’s prosecution by the U.S. Attorney’s office in Massachussetts. Issa told the audience, “We suspect some of it had to do with ambition, big prosecutions, smart people being brought down.”

Issa related an anecdote about selling cookies as a child to fund summer-camp trips, in which he’d punched buzzers on an apartment building door until a stranger let him in.

“I broke the law,” Issa said, adding later, “If everyone who ever tried to guess a combination on a safe -- or a password, or looked at a diary, endlessly deciding whether to open it, or a drawer that was half-opened -- [if everyone] was brought up on charges on the maximum value of what could have been the damages, then our jails… would in fact be beyond overflowing.”

Democratic Colorado Rep. Jared Polis criticized Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz’s prosecution as “a perversity of justice.”

“What I hope comes out of this terrible travesty is a policy change -- an awakening, something that will prevent this type of travesty from occurring to anybody else in this country,” Polis said.

Two legislators attending, Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden and Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose), have cosponsored legislation called “Aaron’s Law” that is intended to remove terms-of-service breaches from punishment under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and wire fraud statutes.

Swartz had planned to republish the expensive scholarly articles online in a place where they’d be available for free. Swartz previously said the information belonged to the world.

Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) recalled Swartz’s work as an intern. “Aaron wanted to rock the boat, not just for the sake of boat-rocking, but for the sake of improving the lives of ordinary people,” he said.

Grayson compared Swartz to Alan Turing, a crack codebreaker who was prosecuted by the British government in 1952 for being gay, which was against the law. “I’m sure there were people at that point in those days who said, ‘The law is the law – if you disobey the law, you go to prison,’ ” Grayson said.

After Turing was forced to accept estrogen treatments in exchange for avoiding prison, he killed himself.

“What we engage in is human sacrifice,” Grayson said. “We sacrifice their lives in the misguided sense that we need to protect ourselves from them, when instead, it’s the exact opposite.”

Swartz’s father, Bob Swartz -- who previously spoke with the Los Angeles Times about his son’s death -- cited a long list of other computer innovators who had, at times, broken the law, or came close.

“Are we a country that wants to encourage our best and brightest, who see things differently?” he asked. “Or do we want to crush them?”

Frum: Why isn't homelessness getting worse? Because of the policies of George W. Bush

He says under Bush the simple solution of providing a home (""housing first"") worked

Frum: Abolition of homelessness has become a real possibility, thanks to Bush

Have you noticed that homelessness isn't worse? Here we are, living through the most protracted joblessness crisis since the Great Depression -- and surprisingly, fewer people are living on the street.

The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development reported that the number of the chronically homeless declined by 30% between 2005 and 2007. You might have expected the numbers to spike again when the financial crisis hit but no. Since 2007, the number of chronic homeless has dropped another 19%.

A broader measure of the number of homeless counts the number of people living out of doors on one randomly chosen night. That broader measure has also improved through the economic crisis. Between January 2011 and January 2012, homelessness among veterans dropped by 7%.

To what or whom do we owe this good news?

David Frum

In very large part, we owe it to the president whose library opened in Dallas last week: George W. Bush.

For three decades, we have debated what causes homelessness and how to deal with it. Is homelessness a mental health problem? A substance abuse problem? A problem caused by gentrification and urban redevelopment? Or something else again?

The Bush administration substituted a much simpler idea -- an idea that happened to work. Whatever the cause of homelessness, the solution is ... a home.

In 2002, Bush appointed a new national homeless policy czar, Philip Mangano . A former music agent imbued with the religious philosophy of St. Francis of Assisi, Mangano was seized by an idea pioneered by New York University psychiatrist Sam Tsemberis: ""housing first.""

The ""housing first"" concept urges authorities to concentrate resources on the hardest cases -- to move them into housing immediately -- and only to worry about the other problems of the homeless after they first have a roof over their heads. A 2004 profile in The Atlantic nicely summarized Tsemberis' ideas: ""Offer them (the homeless) the apartment first, he believes, and you don't need to spend years, and service dollars, winning their trust.""

Many old school homeless advocates resisted Mangano's approach. They were impelled by two main objections:

1. They believed that homelessness was just the most extreme form of a problem faced by low-income people generally -- a lack of affordable housing for low-income people. Focusing resources on the nation's hardest cases would (these advocates feared) distract the federal government from the bigger project of subsidizing better housing for millions of people who did not literally live in the streets.

2. By 2002, the nation had been worrying about homelessness for several decades. Countless programs from state and local agencies responded to some separate part of the problem; tens of thousands of people earned their livings in those state and local agencies, disposing of massive budgets. ""Housing first"" threatened to disrupt this vast industry. ""Housing first"" was comparatively cheap, for one thing: a homeless shelter might look squalid, but it cost a great deal to operate -- more, oftentimes, than a proper apartment with kitchen and bath. The transition to ""housing first"" threatened jobs and budgets across the country.

There was only one counterargument to these objections: ""Housing first"" worked. It worked from the start, and it worked fast. It worked so well that the Obama administration has now claimed the approach as its own, even keeping Mangano on the job for the first weeks of the new administration.

Bush remains one of the more controversial and less popular ex-presidents. But if in the next days you happen to walk down a city street, take a moment to notice how many men or women are sleeping there. Results will vary from place to place, but on average, there are probably fewer than half as many as a decade ago. The job is not completed yet. But for the first time since the 1970s, the abolition of homelessness has become a real and near possibility. Whatever else you think of the 43rd president, that achievement is part of Bush's legacy, too."

But many conservatives made clear they rejected that contention. They remain deeply skeptical of any plan that would create a way for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country to become citizens.

“The last time we talked about this in 2007, it sounded very seductive. When we saw the details, it was clear it wouldn’t work,” Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said. Sessions said he was concerned that the Obama administration was not committed to securing the borders to thwart illegal immigration.

On the Senate floor, Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) sounded implacable. “We have history as a guide, and history suggests that this brand of comprehensive reform … is a recipe for failure,” he said.

Twenty-two GOP senators who opposed the failed 2007 plan for immigration reform are still in the Senate, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. By contrast, just two of the 12 Republicans who backed it are still in Congress: Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

McCain, who worked on the new compromise, bluntly replied, “Elections,” when asked what improved the outlook in Congress to pass an overhaul. His own history illustrates his point: He was the main GOP advocate for reform in 2007, but he backed off when he ran for president in 2008.

“The Republican Party is losing the support of our Hispanic citizens,” McCain said at a news conference with four other senators. “We realize that there are many issues in which we think we are in agreement with our Hispanic citizens, but this is a preeminent issue with those citizens.”

Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who worked with McCain and others on the compromise, agreed that the political environment had shifted. “For the first time ever, there’s more political risk in opposing immigration reform than in supporting it,” he said.

The failure Republican candidates experienced with Latino voters in November has galvanized the attention of party strategists and many elected officials. Advocates for the reform plan hope that a strong bipartisan vote in the Senate, which Schumer predicted, will pressure the House to act.

The immigration blueprint unveiled Monday contains many similarities to the 2007 legislation, including a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. But the architects of the current plan made a number of adjustments to try to satisfy liberal and conservative critics.

The framework, for example, includes additional steps to enforce border security, a longtime demand by many Republican lawmakers. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who worked on the plan and at times spoke in Spanish during Monday’s news conference, later told a conservative radio host that he would “not support any law that does not ensure the enforcement things happen.”

The support from Rubio, a potential presidential hopeful, is seen as particularly key in bringing others in his party along. But another Latino newcomer, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), said in a statement that he had “deep concerns with the proposed path to citizenship.”

In the House, some Republicans who have been reluctant to pursue comprehensive reform welcomed the Senate outline, including House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who issued a carefully worded response. But Republican resistance promises to be intense. Many represent districts where any proposal that could be characterized as “amnesty” for illegal immigrants sparks angry opposition.

“It’s one thing for a senator who has a statewide electorate to be able to make the case on this issue. In the House, you have a different demographic base,” said Luke Frans of Resurgent Republic, a conservative research group that has been closely studying the Latino vote.

House conservatives made clear Monday that nothing in the new proposal changed their minds.

“When you legalize those who are in the country illegally, it costs taxpayers millions of dollars, costs American workers thousands of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration,” said Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas). “By granting amnesty, the Senate proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration.”

Smith was instrumental in stopping earlier attempts to overhaul the immigration system from his former perch as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. His successor, Rep. Robert W. Goodlatte (R-Va.), handled immigration cases as a private practice lawyer in Roanoke. His voting record on immigration is nearly identical to Smith’s, but Goodlatte did not dismiss the proposal.

“Our nation’s immigration system is in desperate need of repair, and it is not working as efficiently and fairly as it should be,” Goodlatte said, promising to look at the Senate plan.

Most of the Republicans on the committee, including Goodlatte, have consistently voted against bills that would expand the number of immigrants allowed into the country. But some see moves by the House leadership to put calmer voices in key positions as an indication the committee may be more open to engaging in the immigration debate.

“Do I see a change in tone on how they are talking about the issue? Absolutely,” said Alfonso Aguilar, a Republican strategist at the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, a Washington-based nonprofit group. “We have the environment where it can happen.”

A bipartisan group of House members also plans to introduce an immigration overhaul bill similar to the Senate proposal before President Obama’s State of the Union address on Feb. 12, a congressional aide said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney welcomed the Senate proposal as “movement and progress.”

On Tuesday, Obama will travel to Las Vegas to push the immigration proposal he outlined in May 2011. He plans to insist that any reform be comprehensive, such as the bipartisan Senate plan, which the president believes tracks with his approach, said aides who requested anonymity to discuss internal White House talks. The president also plans to urge Congress to move swiftly.

Schumer said lawmakers planned to write a bill by March, with a Senate vote by late spring or summer.

Advertisement

Though McCain welcomed the president’s public push for reform, Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) said he worried the president’s involvement could curb support from Republicans.

“If we can keep everybody on the same message and not try to move the ball too much, I think we can get something done in a bipartisan manner,” he said. “But if he tries to move it too far on the left — I just don’t want to lose the support that we have on our side.”

A range of outside groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Service Employees International Union, reacted positively to the Senate plan. But NumbersUSA, a Virginia-based advocacy group that lobbies to reduce immigration levels, dismissed the proposal as “all the same old tired ideas.”

And some immigrant rights groups applauded the proposal but worried that it would make a pathway to citizenship contingent on first securing the border.

“What measurable outcome are they looking for, with respect to being able to say the border is completely secure?” asked Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles. “Can the border ever be completely secure?”

USA TODAY

A Justice Department investigation of possible civil rights violations is underway

Trayvon Martin%27s family could sue in civil court%2C where the standard of proof is lower

A wrongful death lawsuit seeks money damages rather than punishment

George Zimmerman's business with the criminal court in Florida may be done, but a federal civil rights investigation remains open, and legal experts say he could face a civil suit.

A federal investigation into the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin is underway, and prosecutors from the Justice Department's civil rights division will review evidence from the FBI and the Florida criminal trial, the Justice Department said Sunday in a written statement.

Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in a gated townhouse community in Sanford, Fla., shot and killed Trayvon on Feb. 26, 2012, as he returned home from buying snacks at a convenience store. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, claimed he shot the unarmed African-American teenager in self-defense.

""Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate,"" the statement said.

NAACP President Ben Jealous said on CNN that the civil rights organization had spoken with Justice Department officials about lodging federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.

""There will be a federal civil rights phase,"" Jealous said.

Trayvon's family could sue Zimmerman in civil court for wrongful death, following the example of the families of O.J. Simpson's former wife, Nicole Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman, who sued the football star and won $33.5 million after he was acquitted on murder charges. A wrongful death lawsuit seeks money damages rather than punishment.

Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., issued a statement urging the family to sue Zimmerman.

""While I am profoundly disappointed with the ruling in this case, the criminal portion of the process has run its course,"" Wilson said. ""I encourage Trayvon's parents to pursue vindication of their rights under civil law.""

Barbara Arnwine, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, called the verdict a ""tragic miscarriage of justice.""

""No matter how you look at this situation, if it were not for the actions of Mr. Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin would still be alive with his family today,"" she said in a statement. ""Yet there is still the potential for justice to be served through a civil suit brought about by Trayvon Martin's surviving family members, and also through civil rights charges.""

Although Zimmerman has few assets, a book or movie deal could make him a lucrative target for a wrongful death suit, said Randy Reep, a criminal defense attorney in Jacksonville.

Apart from money, the family might sue ""if only for a victory in principle,"" he said.

Despite the acquittal in criminal court, Trayvon's parents could win in civil court, where a lower standard of proof prevails, he said. A jury in civil court need only be convinced that Zimmerman ""more likely than not"" is responsible for Trayvon's wrongful death, he said. In a criminal court, a jury can acquit if they have ""reasonable doubt.""

Zimmerman would be immune to such a lawsuit only if he asked for a hearing under Florida's ""stand-your-ground"" law and a judge found he justifiably used force in self-defense in the face of an ""unlawful threat,"" Reep said.

Zimmerman's lawyer, Mark O'Mara, commented Saturday night on the possibility of suits against his client.

""On the civil aspect, if someone believes that it's appropriate to sue George Zimmerman, then we will seek and we will get immunity in a civil hearing.

""We'll see just how many civil lawsuits are spawned from this fiasco.""

Someone get this pundit a calculator.

Rightwing columnist/professional “amnesty”-hater Ann Coulter continued to rail against the possibility of any immigration reform that would create a pathway to citizenship in a column published last week, using faulty math to press her case.

Arguing, as she has in the past, that Republicans should avoid trying to cultivate Hispanics because they lean Democratic, Coulter offered the following calculation:

Can I see the math on that? I can see why bringing in 30 million new Democratic voters would be good for the Democrats, but how does it help Republicans? Maybe conservatives shouldn't blindly trust the calculations of the guy who graduated fifth from the bottom of his class at the U.S. Naval Academy.

This “math” is based on a few incorrect assumptions. She presumes that every undocumented immigrant currently in the country or projected to come here over the next decade is Hispanic, will become a citizen and eligible to vote, and will proceed to vote exclusively for the Democratic Party.

Coulter doesn’t explain how she arrived at her figure, but it's unrealistically high. The total number of undocumented immigrants in the country right now stands at about 11.1 million, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the legislation would lead to a net increase of 9.6 million people in the United States over the next 10 years. That totals 20.7 million, not 30 million.

But not all undocumented immigrants are Hispanic. Some 81 percent of immigrants residing illegally in the United States come from Latin America, according to the Pew. The CBO doesn't specify where the 9.6 million new U.S. residents, both unauthorized and authorized, would come from, but working from the assumption that it's comparable to the figure for unauthorized immigrants, we can drop that figure still further to 16.8 million.

Not all of them would become citizens if the immigration reform became law, however. The proposed law specifies a 10-year-long process from legal residence to citizenship. Not everyone will go through it. Under current law, only 56 percent of legal residents become naturalized citizens with the power to vote, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. That would bring the figure down to 9.4 million, though there’s no sure way to know what naturalization rates will look like in the future.

Latinos also face a major problem with voter turnout. Only 48 percent of Hispanics voted in 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau -- a much smaller figure than the number of blacks (66.2 percent) and non-Hispanic whites (64.1 percent). Even more worrisome for Hispanic voters, that low turnout figure represents a drop from 2008, when 49.9 percent of Latino voters made it to the polls. Such low turnout would once again cut the potential Latino voter impact, to about 4.5 million.

Lastly, Latinos do not vote “80 percent against Republicans,” as Coulter claims in her column. They vote differently depending on the candidate in front of them.

GOP contender Mitt Romney fielded 27 percent of the Hispanic vote last year, the worst performance for a presidential candidate since Bob Dole’s run in 1996.

But George W. Bush -- who unlike Romney spoke some Spanish and supported immigration reform -- won 44 percent of the Latino vote in 2004."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/12/ethics-emails-epa,2013-01-12 00:00:00,"['George Landrith', 'Peter Roff']",EPA Email Scandal Fits Pattern of Its Secrecy,"As a candidate for president, Barack Obama promised to lead the most open, most transparent administration in history. He has not kept that promise. Time and again, members of his administration have failed to keep faith with the American people. Acting in secret, they have taken sometimes extraordinary steps to shield their actions from the public.

The latest example involved Lisa Jackson, who has led the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency since the beginning of the president’s first term. Jackson is resigning, but only after it was revealed she used a fake name (Richard Windsor) to create a fake e-mail address to conduct official EPA business.

What Jackson did contravenes federal law which, because as a nation we value open and transparent government, prohibits such behavior.

This is not the first time the EPA has been in the spotlight because its administrator acted against the interests of transparency. Carol Browner, who led the agency under Bill Clinton and then served for a time as President Obama’s “environmental czar” – ordered the hard drive on her government computer erased and reformatted and all backup tapes destroyed only hours after a federal judge had ordered the EPA to preserve all agency e-mail records.

This conduct, the use of phony e-mail addresses and the erasure of computers pose an interesting question: What is the EPA and its administrators doing that they are so unwilling to have their official communications become public? It doesn’t paint a pretty picture for the left’s agenda or its methods of implementation.

Jackson’s conduct came to light only after a a whistle-blower divulged she was using her fake e-mail account to conduct controversial business, evade congressional oversight, and get around the requirements of the federal Freedom of Information Act. Typically, government business is conducted in public. Correspondence and e-mail must be available to scrutiny, both by Congress and the American people. When a fake name is used, it allows an agency and its employees to evade accountability.

There is no way around it. This is government corruption at its highest form – and the polar opposite of the kind of transparent and open government political leaders on both sides of the aisle claim to want.

EPA’s record of following the law and being transparent couldn’t be much worse. Obama’s EPA has twice failed to provide as required by law a “Unified Agenda” which is a compendium of regulations planned in the foreseeable future. For the record, no other administration has ever even once failed to meet the requirements of this law. This, combined with the more than 12,000 secret e-mails, suggests a pattern of chicanery, obfuscation, and lawlessness at Obama’s EPA.

The problem does not end with Ms. Jackson or her staff. For the last four years, when asked to respond to lawful requests for information by Congress or by American citizens under FOIA, EPA attorneys did not provide e-mail sent and received by the administrator at her “Richard Windsor” e-mail address. Moreover, they affirmed that all responsive e-mails had been provided, when they clearly had not.

It is important whether these attorneys knew or had reason to know that their representations were false. And it is incumbent on the U.S. Congress and, perhaps, the U.S. Department of Justice to begin an inquiry into whether they did so.

To stop the culture of corruption at the EPA, it is not sufficient for Ms. Jackson to step down. There must be a comprehensive investigation concerning the actions of Ms. Jackson, her staff, and EPA attorneys who were involved. It must be determined who knew about or participated in the corruption. Ms. Jackson clearly did but did anyone else? Any government employee involved should be fired and prosecuted. If they are an attorney, they should also be disbarred.

No one has ever gone to jail for violating the Freedom of Information Act but, the federal mail and wire fraud law is broadly used to target corruption in government that falls well short of bribery or extortion. Ms. Jackson and all those who participated in the fraudulent and fake e-mail scheme should face prosecution.

Once the 12,000 or more secret e-mails become public, Attorneys General and United States Attorneys all over the United States will likely have jurisdiction to investigate and perhaps even prosecute Ms. Jackson or anyone else who were involved in there e-mail fraud scheme. Congress should also have a full investigation and also determine if other of agencies have engaged in similarly corrupt schemes designed to shield their activities from public scrutiny, particularly those that pertain to the official function of their position and the development of public policy.

The Obama administration has been one of the least transparent or open administrations in memory. The activities of Lisa Jackson at the EPA are just one example of that. If the president hopes to remove the taint from his administration, he must take a personal interest in rooting out this sort of corruption. He cannot simply accept Ms. Jackson’s resignation and call the matter closed.

""The Prince has arrived in this strange city, whose streets of ill-built houses connect to the most noble public buildings, and where one has to admire the city as a city always in the future tense,"" the London Times correspondent wrote of Washington. ""It will and must in history be one of the greatest capitals the world has seen, but as yet it seems to want a deal of building, alterations, and improvements, before it can be a worthy legislative center of this great empire.""

If anything, the reporter was too sanguine in his description. The city that awaited Lincoln that fall remained a far cry from the populous, gleaming capital that it would become after -- and largely because of -- the Civil War. It was, as author Margaret Leech wrote in her Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ""Reveille in Washington, 1860-1865,"" ""a mere ambitious beginner, a baby among capitals.""

""Built to order at the dawn of the century, it gave after sixty years the impression of having been just begun,"" she wrote. ""Washington was merely a place for the government. It was an idea set in a wilderness.""

That wilderness was a dirty and disagreeable swamp of a place, where pigs and cattle roamed freely, where alleys reeked with the stench of raw sewage, where dysentery and diarrhea inflicted their annual toll, where saloons and brothels and gambling parlors easily outnumbered restaurants and theaters. The unpaved streets stayed muddy in the winter and dusty in the summer, always marked with ruts from wagons and carriages and always littered with the manure of the horses that pulled them.

The Capitol dome was three years from completion, and herds of cattle grazed at the stump of the Washington Monument, which sat less than a third finished. The handful of grandiose structures, among them the White House, the Treasury Building and the Smithsonian Institution, sat amid vast open spaces largely unpopulated and uncultivated.

There were islands of social life, such as dinner parties in the dignified mansions of Georgetown and grand cotillions on Capitol Hill and by the Navy Yard. At Willard's Hotel at 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, society women and boisterous men mingled in the smoke-filled bar, and much of the business of government took place in hushed conversations. But mostly, Washington remained a backwater. Diplomats from Europe considered it a hardship post.

""It was a Southern town, without the picturesqueness, but with the indolence, the disorder and the want of sanitation,"" Leech wrote. ""Its lounging Negroes startled Northern visitors with the reminder that slaves were held in the capital. Hucksters abounded. Fish and oyster peddlers cried their wares and tooted their horns on the corners. Flocks of geese waddled on [Pennsylvania] Avenue, and hogs, of every size and color, roamed at large, making their muddy wallows on Capitol Hill and in Judiciary Square. People emptied slops and refuse in the gutters.""

The 1860 Census counted 75,080 souls in the District of Columbia, including 61,000 in the city proper, 8,700 in the separate village of Georgetown and the remainder in the rural areas of the district, which began just north of Florida Avenue. Nearly a quarter of Washington's residents came from Virginia or Maryland, and even the city's natives often had strong ties to families from the surrounding Southern countryside. Most of the city's 12,484 immigrants came from Ireland and Great Britain, although a few had ventured from as far as Australia, Russia and Turkey. The vast majority of residents were white, though more than 3,000 slaves and more than 11,000 ""free colored"" people called Washington home.

""Poverty, squalor, prejudice, and violence"" existed in abundance, author Constance McLaughlin Green wrote in her exhaustive history, ""Washington: Village and Capital, 1800-1878."" ""Class distinctions were clear-cut, but a family's place in the social structure of the city rested less upon money than upon accomplishments and manners . . . Whatever the community's vices, pretentiousness was not one.""

The fledgling city consisted of bakers and blacksmiths, fishermen and farmers, carpenters and government clerks. There were three veterinarians, six undertakers, 17 milkmen, 67 innkeepers, 148 doctors, 180 lawyers and 242 tailors. Smith's on Seventh Street sold the season's latest hats and caps. Charles Shafer worked in his watch shop, not far from the Washington Carriage Factory, which was on D Street between Ninth and 10th. Benter's Restaurant on C Street advertised its fish and oysters, as well as its wine, liquor and cigars. The studio in which Mathew Brady would photograph the most famous faces of the Civil War was already up and running in a building on Pennsylvania Avenue, halfway between the White House and the Capitol.

But despite the growing bustle, it remained ""a pretty sleepy place,"" said Ernest B. Furgurson, a former Baltimore Sun correspondent and author of 2004's ""Freedom Rising: Washington in the Civil War."" ""It really was not as cosmopolitan as a lot of other cities in the country. It was still very much a place under development."""

""It seems almost unreal that we can't get together on a budget or legislation,"" he said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""We weren't perfect, by a long shot, but at least we got our work done.""

Dole, who served in the Senate from 1969 to 1996, wasn't fully critical of the president, but said part of the problem is that he ""lacks communication with Congress"" and should have gotten together with members earlier in his presidency.

Dole joked at first when asked by host Chris Wallace to quickly give his thoughts on President Barack Obama. ""He's a great golfer, very articulate,"" Dole responded.

Still, he acknowledged it's not easy to work with the Senate, where he said ""no doubt about it,"" cloture is being abused. He didn't spare the Republican Party his criticism, saying they need to be ""closed for repairs"" and come up with more plans and a vision for the future before the end of the year. Wallace asked him whether he'd even fit in with the Republican Party today.

""I doubt it,"" Dole replied. ""Reagan wouldn't have made it, certainly Nixon wouldn't have made it, because he had ideas. We might have made it, but I doubt it.""

The decal shows a blonde woman in jeans curled up on the bed of a pickup truck, her hair obscuring her face and her hands and feet tied with rope. It's meant to be slapped on a truck's tailgate, creating an optical illusion of an actual woman lying in distress.

KWTX News 10 in Waco, Texas reported that Hornet Signs put the decal on the back of an employee's truck to show how realistic its signs are. A female employee volunteered to be tied up and photographed for the promotional material.

""I wasn't expecting the reactions that we got, nor was it really anything we certainly condone or anything else,"" Hornet Signs owner Brad Kolb told KWTX. ""But it was just something...we had to put out there to see who notices it.""

Kolb also claimed that since the controversy, he has seen a rise in decal orders.

KWTX said it asked viewers what they thought of Kolb's marketing stunt, and the responses the station received were pretty ""one-sided"" against it. Some viewers said they even called the police when they saw the decal, thinking a woman was truly in trouble.

Julie Gerstein at the Frisky adds, ""The sad thing is, this isn’t even an original idea. Similar truck decals featuring hogtied women, like this, and this, all contribute to a culture of violence against women. Plus, this can’t be making local police happy. How many false 911 calls have been made because of these things?"""

Jerry Brown and legislative leaders broke an impasse Monday over how to reduce prison crowding, agreeing to seek more time for that effort from federal judges but preparing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to relocate inmates if the jurists say no.

With only four days left in this year’s legislative session, the deal resolves a dispute over the best way to abide by an order to shed more than 9,600 inmates from California’s packed lockups by Dec. 31.

Under the compromise, the state would ask a panel of three federal judges for time to expand rehabilitation programs aimed at reducing the number of inmates who, after serving their time, commit new crimes and return to prison.

If the judges reject an extension, the state will implement Brown’s original plan to spend $315 million this year moving inmates to private prisons, county jails and other facilities. The money for the extra housing would come from the state’s $1.1-billion reserve.

The price tag is expected to increase to $415 million for each of the following two years.

Officials have already begun preparations to move prisoners, and the governor has pledged to comply with the court without releasing any inmates early.

Brown stood with Democratic and Republican leaders outside his office Monday morning — a rare display of bipartisan unity since he took office — saying he wants the judges to “recognize our commitment to longer-term solutions and to consider modifying their order.”

He did not specify how much extra time the state would seek.

The Legislature still must vote on the new plan, which incorporates key elements of a proposal from Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento). Steinberg initially had called Brown’s plan inadequate, insisting on more programs to address drug abuse and mental illness.

Steinberg had proposed asking inmates’ lawyers and the judges for a three-year reprieve of the Dec. 31 deadline. The senator had said his plan eventually would reduce the prison population by about 9,600 inmates.

The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office had found flaws in the original proposals from both Brown and Steinberg. The governor’s plan was only a short-term fix, the analyst said, and the senator’s program would take effect too slowly.

On Monday, Steinberg reiterated his view that California needed more time to “invest in a more durable and sustainable solution to our overcrowding problem.”

Lawyers for inmates, who sued the state over prison conditions in a series of cases that led to the current court order, were not included in the negotiations that resulted in Monday’s plan.

“The governor hasn’t built up a lot of trust here,” said attorney Michael Bien, who is handling a lawsuit over mental healthcare in the prisons.

Right now, he said, the lawyers are skeptical of allowing the state more time to meet the court order to shrink inmate numbers, issued originally in August 2009 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2011. The judges already moved back the deadline from June 30 to Dec. 31.

“We are supportive of the effort to reduce the total burden on prisons by changing California laws,” Bien said, “but we have not agreed to [a] length of time.”

The judges, for their part, have previously expressed little interest in backing down from their latest deadline. They have repeatedly accused state officials of abusing any leniency given them in the decades-long legal battle over the prisons.

“Defendants have consistently sought to frustrate every attempt by this court to achieve a resolution to the overcrowding problem,” they wrote in June.

Brown, however, asserted Monday that there was a “reasonable chance” the judges would go along with the state’s revised plan.

“We’re not acting … just with no foundation,” he told reporters. “There are little smoke signals emanating from the mountaintops.”

He did not elaborate.

Republicans also used the short-messaging blog back then to heckle the new president as he delivered a speech to Congress. (Even the mom of Missouri Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill criticized her daughter for tweeting during the event, although her posts were about seeing Supreme Court Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg there after her operation for cancer.)

Other politicians were still finding their way on Twitter, including former Michigan congressman Pete Hoekstra, who blared to the world he was on a secret mission to Iraq by tweeting about it in 2009, and in 2011, former New York congressman Anthony Weiner took to Twitter to share lewd photos of himself with a lady friend.

Times have changed with Internet speed. As President Obama heads into his second term, most politicians are up to snuff on social media, or have at least hired helpers who know how to make the most of 140 characters or less. Twitter gaffes are no longer the norm. These days, politicians use Twitter to connect with constituents, provide updates on legislation, comment on big news stories and even share photos of their daily goings-on.

What's more, Twitter announced that all 100 members of the U.S. Senate now tweet, compared to 44 percent in 2011; and 90 percent of the members of the House of Representatives send out 140-word bits and bites (or at least their staffers do; it’s often hard to know who is really behind the tweeting). Still, with nearly all of Congress tweeting, why can't bill-writing be done with such brevity? (The Affordable Care Act would have looked a lot different if it had said: ""Everybody. Gets. Covered. The End."")

NBC News asked Twitter to tell us who are the “most followed” senators and representatives. They don’t have numbers quite like the Bieb (33 million-plus followers) or even the president (26 million-plus). But Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, leads this list, with an impressive nearly 1.8 million followers. Here are the top 5 from each branch of Congress:

SENATE

Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona

Tweets: 4,469



Followers: 1,791,300

Joined Twitter: Feb. 22, 2010

He lost the presidential race in 2008, but still holds tremendous sway as one of the Republican Party’s senior senators.

Twitter tendencies: Because McCain, 76, does appeal to both sides of the aisle, his comments carry weight, although his tweets can be a bit dry (again, it’s not known how many of them he posts himself, or whether an overworked staffer is doing that). But they seem heartfelt and sincere. “Impressive briefing from Afghan Army Gen. Waziri in E. #Afghanistan- heroes who've fought for their country for 30 yrs” “Very positive meeting with President Karzai yesterday - US must maintain enduring partnership with #Afghanistan if we are to succeed here” and “Does Eric Schmidt really think that any ordinary North Koreans will hear his call for Internet freedom?”

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida

Tweets: 1,215

Followers: 232,387



Joined Twitter: Aug. 6, 2008

The first-term senator is one of the Republican Party’s much-needed stars, and a Cuban-American who also has received props from the Tea Party.

Twitter tendencies: It could have been Rubio running as Mitt Romney’s veep candidate, although it was Rep. Paul Ryan who was chosen last summer. Many think Rubio’s year will be 2016, and commend his work on immigration, sure to be a big issue, as indicated by the president in his inauguration speech. Rubio’s tweets seem to be his own, including these: “#Esquire report on having less hair than I once did is sadly true. But good news is I am still in upper 2% in Senate.” And: “Man pleads guilty to smuggling birds into US from #Cuba, HIDDEN IN HIS PANTS!!!”

Sen. Bernie Sanders, Independent, Vermont

Tweets: 5,543

Followers: 136,187



Joined Twitter: April 7, 2009

Sanders is the Senate’s only registered Independent, and was recently re-elected to a second term after previously serving several years in Congress.

Twitter tendencies: Sanders titled his 1997 autobiography, “Outsider in the House,” and enjoys his role as an independent, with a focus on the financial problems of the nation, as well as on global warming. “In our closed-door (Democratic) caucuses, he's not one of the senators who wants to speak on everything,"" Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont told the Burlington Free-Press in 2008. ""He picks his issues, and when he does speak, he has something valuable to say, and people listen."" That includes on Twitter, where Sanders often strikes out at large corporations and Wall Street. “Allowing Wall St CEOs to serve as @FederalReserve directors and hand-pick its members is a clear example of the fox guarding the henhouse,” he tweeted earlier this month.



Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota

Tweets: 1,177

Followers: 113,763



Joined Twitter: July 8, 2007

The former “Saturday Night Live” comedian tackles serious issues, including advocating for better mental health care in the wake of the Newtown school shootings, while also sponsoring lighter events like the recent Secret Santa gift exchange to break tensions among his colleagues.

Twitter tendencies: Franken isn’t a laugh-a-minute; he’s quite Minnesotan: Down-to-business and purposeful. Some of that may be his honesty-in-labeling: “Official TeamFranken Twitter feed” is what his Twitter page says, indicating the tweets may not be all his. But he is focused on big issues, including Internet freedom and privacy. “One hurdle cleared! #Senate Judiciary Cmte passes Al's #privacy bill to stop Smartphone Stalking,” he tweeted last month, as well as last June, a what-should-be-common sense approach to electronic records and health care: “All laptops containing private medical information should be encrypted to protect privacy.”



Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri

Tweets: 2,454

Followers: 86,703



Joined Twitter: Sept. 6, 2008

McCaskill won re-election in November after defeating U.S. Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri, whose comments about “legitimate rape” sent voters – and his proposed Senate election – over the edge.

Twitter tendencies: She is one of the few politicians who is personable and personal when she tweets, painting a picture for followers of real life in Washington, D.C. Among her tweets from the inauguration Monday: “Four years ago today I began tweeting. One of my first tweets was a comment on (Supreme Court Justice Antonin) Scalia's weird hat. Will he wear it again? Stay tuned.” That was followed up by a tweet — “Yup. There it is” — and sharing a photo she took.



HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio

Tweets: 9,854

Followers: 434,913



Joined Twitter: July 25, 2007

The Speaker of the House is the BMOCH (Big Man on Capitol Hill), as the voice of the Republican Party.

Twitter tendencies: He’s a little drier than a roll of paper towels wrapped in plastic, but that’s probably what Americans expect of him. Tweets like “House bills are now available for bulk download in XML via @USGPO,” and “This @aei chart shows ‘above normal’ government spending is driving force behind our debt” don’t win tweeting prizes. It’s also a big clue that the down-to-earth congressman probably doesn’t do his own tweets as a rule.



Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin

Tweets: 1,188

Followers: 327,076



Joined Twitter: Jan. 12, 2009

Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, was Romney’s vice-presidential candidate, and impressed conservative voters with his approach to handling the deficit.

Twitter tendencies: His post-election tweets have been few and far between; he likely had his biggest gains in followers during the campaign, taking the president to task for his fiscal policies. But some signs of Twitter life have been showing in recent days, including these tweets: ""We must pay bills today & ensure we can pay bills tomorrow. To do that, we must cut spending & budget responsibly” and “Senate Democrats have refused to pass a budget. Time to hold them accountable for this legal and moral failure.”



Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California

Tweets: 1,174

Followers: 293,092



Joined Twitter: Aug. 7, 2008

The minority House leader was the first woman to be speaker of the House, from 2007-2011, and during that time oversaw the House passage of the president’s landmark health reform law.

Twitter tendencies: The intense, all-business, to-the-point Pelosi uses Twitter to promote the president’s agenda, as well as hers: “The President has taken action to help protect families and children. Congress must now do its part to prevent gun violence,” she tweeted in recent days. But she is also personal when appropriate: “Saddened to hear of the passing of @PFLAG founder Jeanne Manford, who proved the power of a mother’s love can drive out hate,” Pelosi posted Jan. 10.



Twitter

Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida

Tweets: 2,984

Joined Twitter: Feb. 20, 2010

Wasserman Schultz is the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, and party officials credit her for her role in helping the president carry her home state in the November election, and gaining more seats in the Senate and House.

Twitter tendencies: Very politically correct, as one might expect a DNC chairwoman to be, but also very Florida in defending “my Gators” (we’re talking college football, not the critters). She's also a fan of the movie, “Lincoln”: “Just saw Lincoln, which was absolutely incredible. Raging debate over the 13th Amendment in 1865 makes fiscal cliff chasm seem so minute,” she tweeted Nov. 17.

Twitter tendencies: Tiger when it comes to tearing down the president’s policies: “At noon today, I introduced the first bill of the 113th Congress to repeal Obamacare in its entirety,” she tweeted Jan. 3. But she can also be a little homespun: “This morning I spoke to a great group of college students about my journey from student, wife and mother to politics,” she posted Jan. 15. And on Christmas Eve, she shared a link to a YouTube video with this Christmas Eve tweet: “One of my favorite scenes from Charlie Brown Christmas. Merry Christmas.”

Some also charge hypocrisy, since Democrats once opposed the very step they took last week.

In fact, seeing the world as it is rather than pining for a world that no longer exists is a condition for reducing polarization down the road. With their dramatic decision, Senate Democrats have frankly acknowledged that the power struggle over the judiciary has reached a crisis point and that the nature of conservative opposition to President Obama is genuinely without precedent.

What happened on Nuclear Thursday has more to do with the rise of an activist conservative judiciary than with the norms of the Senate. From the moment that five conservative justices issued their ruling in Bush v. Gore, liberals and Democrats realized they were up against forces willing to achieve their purposes by using power at every level of government. When the Bush v. Gore majority insisted that the principles invoked to decide the 2000 election in George W. Bush’s favor could not be used in any other case, they effectively admitted their opportunism. Dec. 12, 2000, led inexorably to Nov. 21, 2013.

Bush v. Gore set in motion what liberals see as a pernicious feedback loop. By giving the presidency to a conservative, the five right-of-center justices guaranteed that for at least four years (and what turned out to be eight), the judiciary would be tilted even further in a conservative direction.

Bush was highly disciplined in naming as many conservative judges as he could. His appointments of Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Samuel Alito bolstered the Supreme Court’s conservative majority. The court later rendered such decisions as Citizens United, which tore down barriers to big money in politics, and Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted a key part of the Voting Rights Act. Both, in turn, had the effect of strengthening the electoral hand of conservatives and Republicans.

With the conservatives’ offensive as the backdrop, Senate Democrats and liberals on the outside revolted in 2005 against the Republican threat to use the nuclear option when the GOP controlled the Senate. Progressives felt they had no choice but to throw sand into the gears of a juggernaut.

Liberals said things eight years ago that are being used by conservatives to accuse them of hypocrisy now. I didn’t have to look far for an example of what they’re talking about.

In a column in March 2005, I called the GOP’s effort to speed the confirmation of conservative judges “a blatant effort to twist the rules” that ignored “the traditions of the Senate.” I might take back the “traditions of the Senate” line, a rhetorical attempt to call conservatism’s bluff. But what animated my argument then is the same concern I have now: This era’s conservatives will use any means at their disposal to win control of the courts. Their goal is to do all they can to limit Congress’s ability to enact social reforms. At the same time, they are pushing for measures — notably restrictions on the right to vote — that alter the electoral terrain in their favor.

And it is simply undeniable that in the Obama years, conservatives have abused the filibuster in ways that liberals never dreamed of. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid cited the Congressional Research Service’s (CRS) finding that in our history, there have been 168 cloture motions filed on presidential nominations. Nearly half of them — 82 — happened under Obama. According to CRS, of the 67 cloture motions on judicial nominees since 1967, 31 occurred under Obama. Faced with this escalation, senators long opposed to going nuclear, among them Reid and California’s Dianne Feinstein, concluded it was the only alternative to surrender.

Republicans gave the game away when all but a few of them opposed Obama’s three most recent appointments to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit not on the merits but by accusing the president of trying to “pack the court.” In fact, Obama was simply making appointments he was constitutionally and legislatively authorized to make. His nominees were being filibustered because they might alter the circuit court’s philosophical balance. The GOP thus demonstrated beyond any doubt that it cares far more about maintaining conservative influence on the nation’s second most important judicial body than in observing the rules and customs of the Senate.

This is why the Senate Democrats’ action will, in the end, be constructive. The first step toward resolving a power struggle is to recognize it for what it is. The era of denial is finally over.

According to USA Today’s immigration beat writer Alan Gomez, NIF is planning to organize the fly in with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us, and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Partnership for a New American Economy.

“The fly-in is being organized not by conservative groups, but organizations that have focused on legalizing millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally and changing the legal immigration system to bring in more foreign workers,” Gomez wrote on Monday. He noted that the 300 activists for an immigration grand bargain were looking to make what he described as a “conservative pitch” for amnesty.

Gomez noted NIF’s Executive Director, Ali Noorani, who “has advocated for changes in immigration law to help legal and undocumented immigrants for three decades,” claimed “the broad collection coming to Washington represents ‘the conservative base of the Republican Party.'”

The event will take place on Oct. 28, coinciding with President Barack Obama’s and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s renewed push against House Speaker John Boehner for amnesty. Now that Obama, Reid, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are publicly pushing for amnesty after many mainstream media outlets declared it dead earlier this year, Soros’ groups are trying to make it appear as though conservatives support immigration legislation like the Senate-passed “Gang of Eight” bill. Ultimately, the left’s goal is to get the House to pass a series of piecemeal immigration bills and then combine them with the Senate bill in a conference committee.

Soros is heavily involved in funding the lobbying for amnesty. After Breitbart News exposed NIF for being Soros-funded while running a campaign to make it appear as though evangelicals support granting amnesty to illegal immigrants, Noorani admitted his group accepts funding from Soros. Noorani denies that the funding was being used for the Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT), a project that his group runs the operations of, but admits that millions of NIF’s dollars come from Soros and that about 10 percent of its budget this year comes from the leftwing billionaire.

Soros is also intimately connected to Facebook’s Zuckerberg’s FWD.us push for amnesty. Zuckerberg hired Soros’ former chief financial strategist Stanley Druckenmiller. Druckenmiller served as Soros’ chief strategist for more than a decade.

Mitt Romney’s top 2012 campaign donor, Wall Street hedge fund manager Paul Singer, also funds NIF, as Breitbart News has reported."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/12/justice-scalia-says-fits-right-in-in-texas/,2013-11-12 00:00:00,[],Justice Scalia says he 'fits right in' in Texas,"U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said Monday that if he weren't a Virginian he'd ""probably want to be a Texan.""

Swearing in new Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice Nathan Hecht before a packed state House chamber, Scalia said, ""I do fit right in here."" That came in response to Republican Gov. Rick Perry, who suggested in an address moments earlier that Texas and its fiercely conservative politics suited Scalia.

""We welcome you to Texas, sir,"" Perry told Scalia to applause. ""You would fit right in.""

Scalia was appointed to the nation's highest court in 1986, which makes him the longest-serving justice currently on the court. He now has come to Texas to administer the oath of office to the state's last three Supreme Court chief justices but joked that Hecht has been on the court since 1988 before assuming his new role.

""Judge Hecht has been on this court for 25 years and already he's chief justice,"" Scalia quipped. ""I've been on mine 27 with nothing to show for it.""

Scalia oversees the U.S. Fifth Circuit which includes Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. He also swore in new Justice Jeff Brown who fills Hecht's old slot and becomes the fourth one-time state Supreme Court law clerk to later serve on the court.

Hecht replaces Wallace Jefferson, who resigned last month to join a private law firm in Austin.

Perry, who has been in office since 2000, appointed Brown and named Hecht to his new post. The governor now has chosen six of the nine justices on the Texas Supreme Court, the state's highest civil court.

Addressing hundreds of judges, state officials and top attorneys in the House chamber Perry said: ""Today we can say, as we can every day in Texas, that God is good.""

Next year, Hecht is poised to surpass the late Joe Greenhill, who served on the court 25 years — 10 of those as chief justice — as the longest-serving justice on the state Supreme Court.

Hecht promised Monday to continue Jefferson's efforts to better ensure that all Texans have access to the court system regardless of economic background saying ""this is not a matter of politics, liberal or conservative, it is about good government.""

""I do not regard the position to which Governor Perry has appointed me as a career capstone,"" Hecht said, ""certainly not a headstone, but as a cornerstone for the work that lies ahead."""
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/15/Meese-Rove-off-the-mark-on-86-amnesty,2013-06-15 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],Meese: Rove 'Way Off the Mark' on 1986 Amnesty,"Last week, GOP pundit Karl Rove wrote in The Wall Street Journal in support of the current Senate immigration bill, arguing it was much tougher on illegal immigrants than the 1986 law that granted amnesty to the three million illegals. Rove wrote that the ’86 law “essentially told those here illegally that if they had arrived in the U.S. prior to 1982 and wanted to become citizens, simply raise your right hand.” Ed Meese responded Friday that Rove’s description of the law was “way off the mark.”

In a letter published by the WSJ, Meese recalled that he was present in 1986 when the legislation was under consideration. He had examined the bill carefully at the time. He was, after all, US Attorney General then.

“The 1986 act didn’t turn illegal immigrants into citizens on the spot. It granted temporary resident status only to those who could prove they had resided continuously in America for five years,” Meese writes. “Advancement to citizenship was not automatic. Immigrants had to satisfy various requirements along the way. They had to pay application fees, learn to speak English, understand American civics, pass a medical exam and register for military selective service. Those with convictions for a felony or three misdemeanors were ineligible.”





Meese goes on to note another similar, and troubling comparison between the current Senate bill and the 1986 Amnesty law. “The ’86 reform bill also had supposedly ‘rigorous’ border security and immigration law enforcement provisions. So how did that pan out?”

The 1986 law is a troubling parallel to today’s debate. That law was also intended to permanently “solve” the problem of illegal immigration. In granting three million illegals immigrants permanent legal status, the government also promised the public that it would secure the border and increase internal enforcement.

That, of course, didn’t happen. Instead, within two decades, the number of illegal immigrants in the country had more than tripled to 11 million. Without hard triggers for border security, is there any rational reason to think our experience will be any different today?

Meese writes, “Amnesty “bends” the rule of law. And bending the rule of law to reach a “comprehensive” deal winds up provoking wholesale breaking of the law. Ultimately, it encourages millions more to risk entering the country illegally in the hope that one day they, too, might receive amnesty.”

Rove is spearheading an effort to get the GOP behind the Senate immigration plan. Not really because of any particular provisions in the legislation, but rather a simple political ploy to allow the GOP to merely say they supported reform. It is a misguided pandering that will sow the seeds for another illegal immigration problem in the future."

“As we gather around this season, may the warmth and joy of the holidays fill your home,” the card reads, signed by President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, daughters Sasha and Malia, along with paw marks for Sunny and Bo.

The holiday card, a tradition that stretches to the early 20th century, began with the country’s notably hushed president: “Silent Cal” Coolidge.

Despite his steely demeanor, Coolidge was the first president to issue a warm Christmas greeting to the nation, issuing a letter for major newspapers across the country to publish in 1927. True to his nature, Coolidge’s message was terse, but it opened the door for presidents to come.

“Christmas is not a time or a season but a state of mind,” Coolidge wrote. “To cherish peace and good will, to be plenteous in mercy, is to have the real spirit of Christmas. If we think of these things, there will be born in us a Savior and over us will shine a star sending its gleam of hope to the world.”

For years afterward, presidential Christmas greetings were distributed among family, friends and White House staff, a trend that’s reflected by the more personal nature of earlier cards. Former first lady Lou Hoover accompanied cards with personal photos and poetry.

The cards eventually became one of the many yearly holiday events the White House takes part in, from the elaborate White House Christmas decorations to eventful holiday tours.

But it wasn’t until President Eisenhower sent his 1953 holiday card to members of Congress, heads of state, ambassadors and beyond that the White House holiday greeting reached a wider audience. By 1967, the White House holiday card was sent out to 2,600 recipients.

That number has since skyrocketed, with more than a million people receiving President George W. Bush’s annual cards.

Take a look through a wide array of White House cards above, stretching from Coolidge’s presidential seal-adorned letter, President Nixon’s minimalist White House silhouette to President Obama’s frequent use of first dog Bo as a holiday subject.

This so-called correspondent is a living breathing pipe-organ for the White House and its latest push to blame sequester — and by extension, the GOP — for Obama’s failed economic policies.

A little after 2pm ET today, Velshi appeared on CNN with Brooke Baldwin. She asked how the business community is reacting to sequester. His response was to use both hands to grab hold of Obama’s talking points from earlier today and spread that sequester gospel like one of the president’s apostles:

Generally speaking the word from the business community is pretty standard. We are at a time in our economy where it would be useful to be building and expanding. We got unemployment edging down, jobs being created, very low interest rates, and an energy boom. We could be really moving to the top of the global pile in terms of economic activity, and this sort of thing [sequester] is like the government sticking its foot out just as your gaining speed as you’re running.

Where to begin?

This isn’t a little partisan spin coming from Velshi, it is full-blown Orwellian propagandizing. You expect this kind of flackery from David Axelrod, not someone CNN poses as an objective correspondent.

1. Unemployment is not edging down. It is edging up. At best it’s stuck, and the CBO says it is going to stay stuck for at least another year.

2. Job creation is barely treading water with population growth.

3. An energy boom? Has Velshi filled his gas or home heating tank lately?

4. How exactly is our economy “gaining speed” when our economy plummeted around three-points last quarter to a growth level of one-tenth of one-percent?

5. “We could be really moving to the top of the global pile?” Did Velshi really say that? Good grief. Even Obama is more careful with the happy talk.

Then there are the lies of omission: The fact that we learned just today that the drop in income last month was the biggest in 20 years; and the fact that sequester represents about 2% of the federal budget, which translates to about a measly 1% of our GDP.

The picture Velshi is outrageously and dishonestly trying to paint is that our economy is humming (when the EXACT opposite is true) and that, if it falters (to a point where even the media can’t happy talk it), the fault falls on the government being too small, which Obama tried so desperately to stop.

But Velshi wasn’t done sucking up to Obama. Oh, no, someone’s looking for a “good dog” by blaming sequester in part on the right-leaning Chamber of Commerce:

But I have to tell you, the business community to some degree has fed this. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce really contributed to the partisanship and the election of people who are on both sides of this in Washington. And this is the result.

In Velshi’s defense… he has earned that “good dog.”

Come on CNN, can’t you do a little better than this? The economy just might become the biggest story in the country soon. If you want to earn back an audience, you’re going to need a business correspondent with some credibility, respect for context, and more respect for the viewer than his failed agenda.

USA TODAY

The president urged %27calm reflection%27

%27We are a nation of laws%2C and a jury has spoken%2C%27 Obama said

Obama renewed his call for gun safety legislation

President Obama called the death of Trayvon Martin a tragedy Sunday, but urged ""calm reflection"" in the wake of a jury's verdict finding his killer not guilty.

""We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,"" Obama said in a statement posted on the White House web site following a Florida jury's acquittal of George Zimmerman Saturday.

Obama also used the occasion to renew his call for gun safety legislation, saying, ""We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives.""

The president's statement:

""The death of Trayvon Martin was a tragedy. Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America. I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son. And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities. We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this. As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honor Trayvon Martin.""

(CNN) —

Congressional negotiators had no agreements to report Saturday, but they issued positive reports on their talks to end a partial government shutdown and avert a default on government debt.

“Cordial” was the word Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, used to describe his “preliminary” discussions with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

“Good” discussions were going on among Senate leaders, said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, “so I think all of us want to support those efforts, and hopefully they bear fruit over the weekend.”

Rallier tells Obama to ‘put the Quran down’

For all the positive talk, the only actions Saturday fell into the “no” category:

–Republican leaders said President Barack Obama rejected their proposal for a six-week debt limit extension.

–The Senate defeated a procedural measure to extend the debt limit with no strings attached.

–Reid said a proposal by a bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, is no longer on the table because it treated opening the government as a “concession.”

Reid continues to demand that any plan include a “clean” bill with no strings attached that raises the debt limit and reopens the government.

Countdown to default

The Treasury Department says it will be unable to pay the government’s bills unless the debt limit is increased by Thursday. The partial shutdown of government services has been in effect since October 1.

7 crazy side effects from the shutdown

Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said Saturday the consequences of a failure to raise the debt limit would be dire for economies around the world. She spoke to CNN’s Richard Quest at an Institute of International Finance conference in Washington.

“You know, I’ve just spent the last two days with representatives of about 188 countries around the world. I wouldn’t say they are confident. I would say they are concerned, and they are very anxious to see this crisis resolved, because they know it’s going to impact on their economy,” Lagarde said.

Senate Democrats meet with president

Senate Democrats met with Obama for 75 minutes Saturday afternoon. A Senate Democratic leadership aide said the party is unified.

“Democrats are willing to negotiate on anything Republicans want to discuss as soon as we reopen the government and pay our bills,” said the aide.

Another Democratic source said party leaders regard Republicans as lacking a coherent position. They hope McConnell can “cut through the clutter,” the source told CNN’s Dana Bash.

The sources, who are familiar with the talks, spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could speak candidly.

Despite the lack of agreement, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said progress was being made.

“I think our Republican colleagues are moving in our direction with the fact that Obamacare is not a major part of the discussion anymore among most all Senate and many House Republicans,” he said.

No votes on Sunday

Before the White House meeting, the Senate’s second highest-ranking Democrat, Richard Durbin of Illinois, told CNN’s Deirdre Walsh that Democrats hoped to reach agreement with Republican negotiators before stock markets open Monday.

Even if that optimistic timetable could be met, a deal could not be voted upon Sunday.

Will 2014 election solve anything?

The Senate is scheduled to come back into session at 1 p.m. ET Sunday, but no votes are planned and Senators have been told their presence is not required. The House is not scheduled to meet until Monday afternoon.

Even as he demanded a “clean” bill, Reid said he and McConnell are involved in “cordial” and “preliminary” discussions.

“I hope that our talking is some solace to the American people and the world,” Reid said. He said McConnell had approached him. “This hasn’t happened until now,” Reid said.

Obama-Boehner talks stall

Republican leadership told the Republican caucus during a Saturday morning meeting that the president will not accept their proposal to raise the debt limit for six weeks.

Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, told CNN Saturday that “the President rejected our deal.”

Paul Ryan steps into budget fight

The standstill came after a Friday afternoon phone call between Boehner and Obama in which they decided to keep talking.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Illinois, said the President is waiting for a better offer.

“It doesn’t seem like the White House is serious at all about entering negotiations with us until they see what comes out of the Senate. If they get something out of the Senate that’s weaker than our negotiated position, it obviously strengthens their position,” Kinzinger said.

While Democrats flat out rejected Boehner’s proposal, even some Republicans didn’t like it. That’s because it lacked a mechanism in the House proposal to immediately reopen the government, which has been partially shut down since October 1, prompting the furlough of hundreds of thousands of workers, the closing of national parks and an increase in public anger.

Previously', ""He Served As The Post'S Washington Nationals Beat Writer To""]",Nationals vs. Pirates: Ryan Zimmerman steal keys Washington’s 5-4 victory,"Ryan Zimmerman lingered a few feet off second base, his left leg throbbing, studying Pittsburgh Pirates reliever Tony Watson. He knew exactly how long it took Watson to deliver a pitch, and he knew it would allow him to do something he never had previously done.

Hours earlier, Manager Davey Johnson had gathered the Washington Nationals for a rare team meeting. He bounced between themes, but more than anything Johnson wanted his players to stop pressing and have fun. Now, with the score tied in the eighth inning, Zimmerman would try to steal third base.

Zimmerman spearheaded an unlikely double steal and lifted the Nationals to a 5-4 victory at PNC Park. After Zimmerman’s dash, Tyler Moore’s redemptive sacrifice fly ensured the Nationals wouldn’t hang a fifth loss on ace Stephen Strasburg, who allowed four runs in seven strong innings.

Afterward, loud, electronic music pulsed in the clubhouse. Zimmerman walked in from the trainer’s room, an ice pack strapped to his left shin testifying how he had reached base. Players hunched at a table and stared at monitors showing their at-bats. Johnson strolled toward the food room.

“Meeting of the year,” shortstop Ian Desmond said. “That’s how you win Manager of the Year.”

Before batting practice, Johnson summoned the Nationals for the first time this year. “It was probably more for me, so I feel like I’m doing something,” Johnson said. They had fallen to 15-15 on Friday night with a 14-strikeout performance, pressing against expectations. Johnson, 70, addressed the problems — a meager offense, trying too hard – with his deft touch.

“I wouldn’t call it a meeting,” Moore said. “He just kind of talked to us a little bit. He’s always got something good to say. Just to don’t press. We know we have a good team, but sometimes when you get in trouble, you press. Just go out there and go have fun and compete.”

The Nationals stranded 11 men in scoring position, but they scored more than three runs for the first time in a week and drew a season-high six walks. They trailed, 4-2, entering the sixth inning, but Wilson Ramos’s two-run, bases loaded single tied it.

Strasburg, despite a 3.13 ERA starting the day, took the mound under more scrutiny than usual. After his last start, when he allowed the Braves two runs and four walks over six innings, Johnson caused alarm by saying Strasburg felt “tightness” in his right forearm.

Saturday, he mixed excellence and inconsistency. He struck out eight, allowed five hits and walked one. The erratic delivery and command of his fastball seemed to persist. Strasburg dominated at times, flashing a change-up in the high-80s that could start over the edge of the plate and dart several inches out of the zone. But he lacked precision with his fastball, which hummed between 93 and 97 mph. He hit two batters with his fastball, and he also fired two heaters into the center of the strike zone, which Starling Marte and Clint Barmes turned into two-run home runs.

“I was happy,” Strasburg said. “In the past, if I gave up that many runs I feel like I would have had 100 pitches after the sixth.”

In the ninth, Zimmerman ended a seven-pitch at-bat by taking Watson’s 86-mph slider in the shin. He collapsed in a heap, then hobbled to first base and watched Adam LaRoche rip a line-drive single into right.

After LaRoche’s single, Pirates Manager Clint Hurdle visited Watson. During the timeout, Zimmerman and LaRoche conferenced with third base coach Trent Jewett. After Jewett asked Zimmerman if he was okay, he reminded Zimmerman he had the green light if he could get a good jump.

Zimmerman had stolen 30 bases in 1,006 career games before Saturday afternoon. He had not even tried to steal third since his rookie season. But Nationals advance scouts had timed Watson’s delivery to the plate at a glacial 1.8 seconds.

“We know what guys people like me actually have a chance to steal bases on,” Zimmerman said.

As Hurdle trundled back to the home dugout, Zimmerman rubbed his leg. “He was playing that up,” Johnson said, grinning.

“It was kind of a blessing in disguise that it looked like he was one in deep pain,” Jewett said. “Had it been [Denard] Span, there would have been a lot more attention paid to him. But we got a guy limping.”

As Watson took the sign on 1-1, he gave Zimmerman an obligatory peek. Infielders strayed from second base. Zimmerman took another step. Watson kicked his front leg. Zimmerman bolted, and LaRoche followed behind.

Martin popped out of his crouch, cocked his arm and held the ball. LaRoche scooted to second.

“I would have thought those were the last two guys who were going to steal,” Moore said.

Now, Moore had another chance to swing the game. In both the sixth and seventh innings, Moore had come to bat with the bases loaded and struck out. After one at-bat, Zimmerman found him in the dugout and told him, “He made a perfect pitch. It’s gonna happen.”

Facing a 1-2 count, Moore told himself to cut down on his swing. “But I was trying to do that in the other at-bats, too,” he said. He fought off a 94-mph sinker. Watson tried another, and Moore lofted it the other way, into the right field corner.

Travis Snider’s strong throw forced Zimmerman to slide, but he beat it with time to spare. As Zimmerman walked into the dugout, only Dan Haren and a few coaches greeted him. The rest of the team gravitated toward the guy who rebounded from two crucial strikeouts.

“T-Mo’s been great,” Zimmerman said. “Talk about a kid who anywhere else would probably get 400, 500, 600 at-bats. He comes here and does everything we ask and more, and he’s always ready to play.”"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/09/28/Media-no-longer-champions-of-civility-bipartisanship,2013-09-28 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],Shutdown Politics: Media No Longer Champions of Civility and Bipartisanship,"Up until just a few days ago, the American media were our country’s top cheerleaders for what they describe as “functional government.” The highest value in government, according to our media, was “getting things done.” And the way to get things done, we were told repeatedly, was through civility, compromise, and bipartisanship. But over the past couple of days, as the prospect of a government shutdown looms closer, the media have completely abandoned those principles.

In the name of civility, I’m old enough to remember (because it was just last week) when the media made politicians pay a heavy political price for harsh rhetoric and name-calling. Again and again, we have seen the media turn away from the issue at hand and make the “rhetoric” used to push the issue the issue.

For example, when running for president last year, Newt Gingrich wanted to talk about the explosion of food stamp recipients under President Obama. But the media just wanted to talk about whether he was racist for using the words “food stamps.”

Think about how many times some local Republican politician, or some conservative private citizen, at a town hall meeting, has made national headlines because of what the media described as “extremist political rhetoric.” Good heavens, how many times has some straggler’s Tea Party sign made NBC’s Chuck Todd tut-tut with disgust.

Think about how many times the media have used how a conservative made a political point as a way to gang up on and relentlessly pummel him or her — all while ignoring the issue.

Remember that whole fashion season of the media collectively wringing its hands over “eliminationist rhetoric?” Remember how the following fashion season was devoted to the scourge of “bullying.”

But that was then; this is now — and now the media have officially ended their opposition to over-the-top political rhetoric. We don’t know this because the media sent out a memo or made an official announcement; we know this because President Obama and Democrats have been accusing Republicans of being arsonists, anarchists, terrorists, extremists — and this is all Chuck Todd has to say about it…

—

“Hobby horse” “shenanigans” “extremists” and “burn the house down”. How POTUS described Congress today. GOP getting a taste of bully pulpit — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) September 27, 2013

—

And the rest of the media have been just as shoulder-shrugging and silent in the face of all this harsh, partisan, eliminationist rhetoric.

But that is not the only change in media policy that happened this past week. The media are also no longer concerned with making Washington work or the value of bipartisanship and working across the aisle. President Obama, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi have made it absolutely clear that they will not negotiate in budget battles that could result in a government shutdown, and the media are absolutely okay with this.

In the past, when Republicans dug in their heels or didn’t seem willing to compromise enough to satisfy Obama, the media were outraged over DC dysfunction and the lack of bipartisan compromise.

So it is finally over — the era of the media placing the highest value on bipartisan compromise and civility has finally ended. The media are now for harsh rhetoric, gridlock, and extremism. Or…

…maybe the media are just a bunch of hypocritical, lying, left-wing hacks who despise the GOP and are willing to sell their honor in order to help Obama to a political win?

Either way.

(CNN) – Fans of ""The West Wing"" remember well the fake President Josiah Bartlett's advice when boarding the presidential helicopter, Marine One: duck.

He might easily have offered this advice as well: salute.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Those who closely watch the president's every step and gesture noticed Friday he didn't salute the Marine standing guard at the foot of the chopper's stairs. After boarding and then shaking hands with the pilots, he quickly exited the chopper, and offered a handshake to the Marine at the steps, then returned for the short ride to Annapolis, Maryland for the United States Naval Academy commencement.

It's become tradition for presidents to salute the military officers he encounters when boarding the official helicopter, a tradition which is widely understood as begun by President Ronald Reagan in 1981.

But to not salute is not a break in protocol or a violation of any rule.

Nor was it likely a slight to the military. After all, Obama told the graduates in Annapolis later Friday morning, ""Today we salute all the Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in these wars, including 18 graduates of this Academy. We honor them all, now and forever.""

The tradition is believed to have been started by Reagan. The story goes that he consulted the Marine Corps commandant who ""told the president that as commander in chief he could salute anybody he wished,"" Smithsonian Magazine editor Carey Winfrey wrote in the New York Times.

It's not thought that President Dwight Eisenhower, who attained the rank of five-star general prior to his election and was the first commander-in-chief to ride a helicopter, saluted his pilot, and those before him would not have had the chance.

A hallmark of the U.S. military is that it is overseen by a civilian commander-in-chief. Some suggest the presidential salute to the troops is a sign of respect; others say it is not customary to offer a salute when out of uniform, and a sign of the over-militarization of the presidency.

And while the helicopter's rotor blades aren't spinning when a president approaches, there is still a reason for him to duck. It's to avoid hitting his head on the door opening which is a little low. (That noise you hear in the video is the auxiliary power unit on the helicopter running ahead of engaging the rotors.)

What do you think? Should the president salute the troops? Add your comments in the space below."

Almost one year ago, the blond stunner married the ""R.I.P.D."" actor in a secret ceremony. The style icon and former ""Gossip Girl"" star covers the September 2013 issue of Lucky magazine, and inside its pages she dishes about life as a new wife.

“I was recently asked how my style has changed since I got married, as if I was living under some sort of dictatorship,” Lively told Lucky. “I should hope I dress differently at 25 than I did when I graduated high school. I hope I never stop changing.”

Lively, 25, and Reynolds, 36, dated for almost a year before they tied the knot in Charleston, S.C., last September. Her fashion sense was as on-point as ever for her wedding day. She opted for a Marchesa ""cloudlike silk tulle"" gown featuring crystals and rose-gold embroidery.

Of course, her red carpet moments are no less fabulous now that she's a married woman, but some things are different. These days, you are more likely to see her in the aisles of Home Depot than in the front row at a fashion show. She is in the process of decorating the Bedford, N.Y., abode she shares with her hubby. Currently, she has her heart set on ""a handcrafted Rosemary Hallgarten rug and the perfect midcentury Danish side table from Etsy."" She credits Reynolds with having ""better taste"" (although we find that hard to believe), but says they influence each other in different ways.

“Work is important, but my greatest passion is my personal life,” she added.

Earlier this month, Reynolds told Details magazine that ""words are too clumsy"" to accurately express how he feels about his love. However, the notoriously private actor -- who has had very public romances and breakups with Alanis Morissette and Scarlett Johansson -- did reveal that he and Lively might be parents to a large brood someday.

""We'd love to have a big family,"" he said. ""We both come from big families -- my parents did four, Blake's did five. A lot of people say it's crazy, but we'll only know when we're there, you know? We'll walk through that fire pretty happily, I think.""

The financial impact of allowing potentially millions of immigrants onto state and local public assistance could overwhelm these programs’ budgets.

Senate Budget Committee ranking member Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) uncovered this loophole in the bill and many others, and he will circulate a memo detailing the gaps in the bill on Tuesday. Breitbart News exclusively obtained a copy of the memo before its public release.

“The Gang of Eight made a promise that illegal immigrants will not be able to access public benefits,” Sessions said in a statement to Breitbart News. “We already know that, once granted green cards and ultimately citizenship, illegal immigrants will be able to access all public benefit programs at a great cost to taxpayers. We have, however, identified a number of loopholes that would allow illegal immigrants to draw public benefits even sooner than advertised.”

If the bill were signed into law, America’s 11 million illegal immigrants would be legalized within six months, when Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano submits her border security plan to Congress. Illegal immigrants would immediately be eligible for Registered Provisional Immigrant (RPI) status, making them legal to live and work in the country.

As Sessions’ staff points out in the memo, “state laws frequently extend benefits to anyone ‘lawfully present’ in the U.S.” The Sessions team points to a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) brief that details how the only requirement many state and local governments have with regard to immigrant access to public benefits is that they are “lawfully present.” The term “lawfully present” is a legal definition.

According to page 91 of the bill, all illegal immigrants granted legalized RPI status would legally be considered “lawfully present.” That section reads as follows: ”(4) TREATMENT OF REGISTERED PROVISIONAL IMMIGRANTS.–A noncitizen granted registered provisional immigrant status under this section shall be considered lawfully present in the United States for all purposes while such noncitizen remains in such status, except that the noncitizen– ”(A) is not entitled to the premium assistance tax credit authorized under section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; ”(B) shall be subject to the rules applicable to individuals not lawfully present that are set forth in subsection (e) of such section; and ”(C) shall be subject to the rules applicable to individuals not lawfully present that are set forth in section 1402(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18071).”

In evaluating whether an illegal immigrant qualifies for RPI status, Sessions’ staff points out, the legislation “explicitly forbids” the Department of Homeland Security from using current law, which blocks entry to those who could become “public charges,” i.e. dependent on government welfare programs.

“Therefore, when those here illegally who are unable to support themselves are legalized, much of the immediate fiscal burden will fall on state and local governments,” Sessions’ staff wrote in the memo.

In addition to that loophole, Sessions and his staff found several more loopholes that allow current illegal immigrants access to public benefits even on the federal level before the promised wait time of 13 years from the bill’s passage.

In the memo, Sessions’ staff notes that current illegal immigrants who are “granted RPI status will immediately become eligible for federal benefits through citizen and permanent resident dependents, with no requirement that they support their household as a condition of receiving or maintaining legal status.” That means any current illegal immigrant who subsequently has dependent children, who are, by right of birth, U.S. citizens would qualify for federal welfare benefits through them."

McCain recalled how Day served as a frequent adviser and travel buddy on the campaign trail through the years.

""I'm going to miss him terribly. Even though Bud had reached advanced years, for some reason I could never imagine Bud yielding to anything — even, I thought, to the laws of nature,"" McCain said. ""Tough old bird that he was, I always thought that he would outlive us all.""

Open-air spaces like the World War II Memorial have been barricaded since the federal government shut down last week, but an organizer for the rally told the Washington Examiner that the National Park Service will allow the rally and march.

As Breitbart News reported, immigration activists have called for volunteers to get themselves arrested at the rally in acts of civil disobedience.

The event will be a culmination of rallies across the country over the weekend in which immigration activists demonstrated in 41 states demanding amnesty.

A variety of immigration activist organizations, along with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the AFL-CIO, are organizing the event, which they claim will attract 10,000 people.

Lawmakers in Congress like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (R-CA) and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) are expected to be at the event. Members of the House are trying to pass immigration reform bills that will allow them to go to conference with the Senate, which passed its comprehensive immigration bill in June that provided a pathway to citizenship for all of the country’s illegal immigrants.

The Congressional Budget Office determined that bill would reduce the wages of working class Americans while not solving the country’s illegal immigration problem.

House Republicans have been reportedly working under the radar on immigration reform, and Pelosi has said Democrats are willing to do “whatever it takes” to get to conference with the Senate. House Republican leaders have also expressed support in moving immigration reform legislation forward. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who is the chairwoman of the House Republican conference, told Univision’s Al Punto on Sunday that “there’s still time” for immigration reform and that it is a “priority” for Republicans.

“We must pass immigration reform,” McMorris Rodgers said.

A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) indicated that immigration reform will be next on the House’s agenda after the shutdown and the debt ceiling debates are resolved."

John McCain throws a damper on Dodgers’ pool party,"SAN DIEGO — Jon Stewart really needs to be the one writing this column. Ladies and gentlemen, and baseball fans of all ages, we present to you: The Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Sen. John McCain.

No spoof.

The issue that gripped America on Friday: Did the Dodgers commit a breach of etiquette by jumping in the Arizona Diamondbacks’ pool to celebrate the National League West championship?

Was this truly a matter of great importance in these United States? Must have been, because the senior senator from Arizona took to Twitter to let his position be known, in no uncertain terms.

“No-class act by a bunch of overpaid, immature, arrogant, spoiled brats!” The tweet included a link to an Arizona Republic column with this headline: “The Dodgers are idiots.”

It is common for elected officials to let a staff member mind their Twitter accounts. We immediately wondered whether an over-eager intern and frustrated Diamondbacks fan sent out the tweet in McCain’s name.

Advertisement

Nope.

“His tweets are all him,” McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said.

Advertisement

That this is even an issue is beyond ridiculous. In 2004, the St. Louis Cardinals clinched the NL Central in Milwaukee, then celebrated by taking turns going down Bernie Brewer’s slide. The Brewers did not throw a fit. Also, Twitter and MLB Network did not exist to dispense outrage at warp speed.

What the Dodgers did on Thursday was not akin to clinching in San Francisco, then defacing the statue of Willie Mays. The Dodgers did not deface, destroy or damage anything. They did not plant their flag on Arizona’s field.

Advertisement

They jumped into a pool, to which the Diamondbacks sell tickets for fans to enter every day. The Dodgers did not bring lounge chairs and beach balls with them. The Diamondbacks had nothing to clean up but a few drops of water on a pool deck, and a few wounded egos in their clubhouse.

Oh, and they had to retrieve a stray blue belt, the one Scott Van Slyke took off before he jumped in, then forgot to pick up on the way out.

Advertisement

The San Diego Padres do not have a pool beyond right field. They do have a beach beyond center field.

“If we won it here, would the Padres be mad if we jumped the fence and made sand castles?” Dodgers Manager Don Mattingly said.

Advertisement

On the day after the splash heard ‘round the world, the Dodgers insisted they did not act with malice or disrespect. Michael Young called the pool party “harmless,” Nick Punto called it “fun,” and J.P. Howell compared it to “egging someone’s house.”

So, at worst, a silly prank.

Advertisement

“You get caught up in the moment,” Andre Ethier said. “You do dumb things. We won the West, and that is getting overlooked.”

That is true, sadly, but that is not the most unfortunate outcome.

Advertisement

The most unfortunate outcome is that the Dodgers players appeared to keep a more level head than the senior senator from Arizona.

Not on Twitter, where Brian Wilson responded in kind.

Advertisement

“Senator McComplain knows a thing or two about coming in second and watching someone take a plunge in the pool (I mean poll),” Wilson tweeted.

However, in the Dodgers clubhouse Friday, there was more offense taken to what McCain said than to what any of the Arizona players said.

Advertisement

“I’m going to assume he was speaking as a fan and not as a public servant,” Young said.

Ethier said it was one thing to criticize the act of jumping in the pool — “Maybe some of his constituents were complaining to him, wondering if he could do something,” Ethier said — quite another to label the players as overpaid, immature, arrogant and spoiled.

Advertisement

“That’s over the line,” said Ethier, who lives in Arizona.

“It is absolutely absurd that he would even comment on that,” said Mark Ellis, who also lives in Arizona. “I would have thought he would know better than that. He doesn’t know any of us. The whole thing is absolutely ridiculous.

Advertisement

“To call us overpaid? Come on. Coming from a politician?”

Young said he would welcome the chance to meet with McCain, to explain how players are heavily involved in charities in the cities in which they play, and in their hometowns.

Advertisement

“I’d like to change his tune that we’re spoiled,” Young said. “I’ve never had the pleasure of meeting him. I’d love to.”

The rest of the Dodgers would just as soon return to taking on baseball teams, not senior senators.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/opinion/not-one-more.html,2013-10-28 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],‘Not One More’ - The New York Times,"President Obama urged Congress on Thursday to revive immigration reform, which is not dead but not moving, either. He was talking mostly to House Republicans, though he also urged business, labor and religious groups to “keep putting the pressure on all of us to get this done.”

It’s good that Mr. Obama said “us.” It acknowledges his own role in this continuing disaster.

Much of the responsibility to fix what Mr. Obama calls the “broken immigration system” lies within his own administration. He can’t rewrite immigration laws, but he can control how well — or disastrously — they are enforced. He can begin by undoing the damage done by his Homeland Security Department. Mr. Obama has just nominated Jeh Johnson, a former Defense Department general counsel, to replace homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano, who resigned in July. It’s the perfect opportunity for a fresh start. Here is what it might look like:

STOP NEEDLESS DEPORTATIONS The Obama administration has kept up a frantic pace of 400,000 deportations a year, and is closing in on two million. Those numbers are driven by politics, not public safety. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has wide discretion to determine whom it detains and deports. It can retool all its policies to make noncriminals and minor offenders — the people most likely to benefit from the reform now stalled in Congress — the lowest priority for deportation.

The deportation surge is fed by programs like Secure Communities, which does immigration checks on everyone arrested by local and state law enforcement, and Operation Streamline, in which border crossers in the Southwest are prosecuted en masse, with little access to legal representation. Mr. Obama turned the dragnet on, and can turn it off. In marches and vigils across the country, protesters have made one plea on deportations to Mr. Obama: “Not one more.” He should heed it.

ACKNOWLEDGE THE CRISIS As he makes the case for immigration reform, Mr. Obama often mentions the economic consequences of failure — jobs unfilled, crops unpicked, investments not made and taxes not collected. He would do well to highlight the human costs of enforcement without reform, in separating families, and violating the civil and labor rights of workers."

It avoids meaningful criticism of Israel and Saudi Arabia. It pretends, quite extraordinarily, that the Latin American sovereignty movement, which has liberated so many from United States-backed plutocracies and dictatorships over the last 30 years, never happened. Referring instead to the region’s “aging leaders,” the book can’t see Latin America for Cuba. And, of course, the book frets theatrically over Washington’s favorite boogeymen: North Korea and Iran.

Google, which started out as an expression of independent Californian graduate student culture — a decent, humane and playful culture — has, as it encountered the big, bad world, thrown its lot in with traditional Washington power elements, from the State Department to the National Security Agency.

Despite accounting for an infinitesimal fraction of violent deaths globally, terrorism is a favorite brand in United States policy circles. This is a fetish that must also be catered to, and so “The Future of Terrorism” gets a whole chapter. The future of terrorism, we learn, is cyberterrorism. A session of indulgent scaremongering follows, including a breathless disaster-movie scenario, wherein cyberterrorists take control of American air-traffic control systems and send planes crashing into buildings, shutting down power grids and launching nuclear weapons. The authors then tar activists who engage in digital sit-ins with the same brush.

I have a very different perspective. The advance of information technology epitomized by Google heralds the death of privacy for most people and shifts the world toward authoritarianism. This is the principal thesis in my book, “Cypherpunks.” But while Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Cohen tell us that the death of privacy will aid governments in “repressive autocracies” in “targeting their citizens,” they also say governments in “open” democracies will see it as “a gift” enabling them to “better respond to citizen and customer concerns.” In reality, the erosion of individual privacy in the West and the attendant centralization of power make abuses inevitable, moving the “good” societies closer to the “bad” ones.

The section on “repressive autocracies” describes, disapprovingly, various repressive surveillance measures: legislation to insert back doors into software to enable spying on citizens, monitoring of social networks and the collection of intelligence on entire populations. All of these are already in widespread use in the United States. In fact, some of those measures — like the push to require every social-network profile to be linked to a real name — were spearheaded by Google itself.

THE writing is on the wall, but the authors cannot see it. They borrow from William Dobson the idea that the media, in an autocracy, “allows for an opposition press as long as regime opponents understand where the unspoken limits are.” But these trends are beginning to emerge in the United States. No one doubts the chilling effects of the investigations into The Associated Press and Fox’s James Rosen. But there has been little analysis of Google’s role in complying with the Rosen subpoena. I have personal experience of these trends.

The Department of Justice admitted in March that it was in its third year of a continuing criminal investigation of WikiLeaks. Court testimony states that its targets include “the founders, owners, or managers of WikiLeaks.” One alleged source, Bradley Manning, faces a 12-week trial beginning tomorrow, with 24 prosecution witnesses expected to testify in secret.

This book is a balefully seminal work in which neither author has the language to see, much less to express, the titanic centralizing evil they are constructing. “What Lockheed Martin was to the 20th century,” they tell us, “technology and cybersecurity companies will be to the 21st.” Without even understanding how, they have updated and seamlessly implemented George Orwell’s prophecy. If you want a vision of the future, imagine Washington-backed Google Glasses strapped onto vacant human faces — forever. Zealots of the cult of consumer technology will find little to inspire them here, not that they ever seem to need it. But this is essential reading for anyone caught up in the struggle for the future, in view of one simple imperative: Know your enemy."

Nonetheless, the department hired Bravo as a deputy through a little-known program called “Friends of the Sheriff” — a screening process for applicants with connections to department officials.

Bravo’s link was his uncle: Sheriff Lee Baca.

Now, the jail deputy is the subject of a Sheriff’s Department criminal probe into whether he abused an inmate. The incident, sheriff’s officials say, was caught on tape. Sources say FBI agents investigating the jails are also inquiring about Bravo.

Advertisement

Confidential sheriff’s records indicate that Bravo was hired even though officials had documented his alleged involvement in a fight with San Diego police, theft and arrests on suspicion of drunk driving and burglary.

Following inquiries from The Times, the Sheriff’s Department’s civilian monitoring agency looked at Bravo’s background. The Office of Independent Review’s lead attorney, Michael Gennaco, said in an interview “there is no way he should have been hired.”

Baca and Bravo, 32, declined to be interviewed. Bravo has been relieved of duty with pay in connection with the criminal probe.

This isn’t the first time that the hiring of an applicant with ties to a top sheriff’s official has drawn scrutiny. Last year, The Times reported that the son of the undersheriff’s secretary was hired as a security guard despite a history of theft, dishonesty, liaisons with prostitutes and as many as 100 domestic violence incidents. When he applied for the job, he was still on probation for punching a man unconscious.

In 2011, The Times reported that a recruit with ties to Baca’s son was hired during a hiring freeze for rookie deputies.

Baca’s spokesman, Steve Whitmore, said the sheriff was unaware of his nephew’s past and played no role in the decision to hire him in 2007. After inquiries from The Times, Baca asked the department’s official watchdog and internal investigators to review Bravo’s history to determine whether sheriff’s employees gave him special treatment.

Personnel records reviewed by The Times show that for years Baca’s department has operated a special hiring track for friends and relatives of department employees. The program was called FOS, or “Friends of the Sheriff” but is now operated under a different name, sources said. In 2009, the sheriff’s watchdog reviewed the hiring practice, calling the name “unfortunate,” but concluded that there was no evidence that those hired through the special track “routinely received preferential treatment during the background investigation process.”

At the time, the Office of Independent Review also said that the sheriff “knows virtually none of the individuals on the list” — that the list “might more aptly be titled ‘Applicants Who Know Someone on the Sheriff’s Department.’ ”

In a recent interview, Gennaco argued that having a separate hiring track for people who know sheriff’s officials actually helps prevent special treatment. After an FOS applicant’s background is investigated, he said, a final hiring decision is made by a special panel of commanders who are not informed of the applicant’s identity.

An internal sheriff’s spreadsheet reviewed by The Times shows Bravo was an FOS candidate, listed as “Sheriff Baca’s nephew” and noted as having a “459 arrest” — penal code for burglary — along with “DUI arrest, fight w/San Diego PD and theft.”

“The sheriff didn’t know anything about this,” Whitmore said.

Though Whitmore declined to discuss those allegations of misconduct in detail, he said “most of it occurred, if not all, while he was in the Marine Corps.” Military disciplinary records are not public, and The Times could not find court records indicating Bravo was charged. Whitmore said that arrests alone, without convictions, would not necessarily disqualify a job candidate.

The sheriff’s hiring rules give officials wide discretion. Some experts have said they allow for too much leeway, especially when it comes to evaluating serious misconduct such as lying, stealing and violence.

Concerns about Bravo’s conduct began early in his career. Retired sheriff’s Cmdr. Robert Olmsted told The Times that in about 2009, a sergeant caught Bravo looking at inappropriate material on a jailhouse computer. When confronted, Bravo yelled at the sergeant to mind his own business, Olmsted said. About a month later, Olmsted said, Bravo went to an off-duty party, where he ripped another deputy’s shirt pocket and fought with him. As he was being escorted out of the party, Olmsted said, Bravo was caught on tape acting belligerently and banging on countertops.

Anthony Brown, an FBI inmate informant, has told The Times that Bravo once smuggled him a cellphone behind bars — a claim a spokesman said sheriff’s detectives investigated but could not substantiate. In 2011, Brown was smuggled a cellphone by a deputy who didn’t realize Brown was secretly helping with the ongoing federal probe of the jails. Brown said he used that phone to communicate with his FBI handler on the outside. The transaction led to a bribery conviction against that deputy.

In an interview with The Times, Brown said that before he got that phone, another cellphone was smuggled to him by a second deputy: Bravo. He said that before the handoff, Bravo stripped him naked to make sure he wasn’t wearing a wire. Brown’s work has helped secure the conviction of one deputy, however court files and interviews reveal that he has previously made false allegations.

FBI agents investigating jailhouse misconduct have recently asked potential witnesses what they knew about Bravo, according to sources.

An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment.

He Has Also Written For Food']",A food road warrior looks back on 2013,"Honestly, the real reason I went to Paris this year was that I’ve always wanted to type “April in Paris” in a dispatch from France (it’s true!), and until recently, I’d visited the City of Light only in summer, fall or winter. Never spring.

By luck, I snagged a reservation at one of the toughest tables in town, coincidentally called Spring, a divine restaurant from the American chef Daniel Rose. The evening was full of highs, and how cool that Karl Lagerfeld strolled in at one point and left behind a fashion doodle on a cocktail napkin. Yet I ended up not writing about Spring because it wasn’t new, because I wanted a break from having to recall every morsel of a meal for public consumption and, well, it’s no fun being the 410th food writer to wax poetic about a transporting dinner. (Noma, you’re no longer my reason for catching a flight to Copenhagen. Not that you need my help.)

Tips for eating on the road

My second reason for going to Paris was to take the temperature of the bistro scene, but here’s what a handful of fair-to-pleasant meals in some of the newer places taught me: San Francisco is a more significant place to eat, at least as far as this dedicated eater and trend watcher is concerned. Indeed, one of my most exciting meals away from Washington, better even than at some of the four-stars in New York, was at Coqueta in San Francisco. Lusty food in the company of loved ones in a waterfront setting was a reminder that while food is important, it isn’t everything.

You know how some travel experiences are so vivid you just know you’ll never, ever forget them and you decide not to take notes or even a photo because you’re trying to live in the moment? And the free-flowing pastis/mojito/pisco sour/soju is only encouraging you to relax and trust your memory?

Banish those thoughts. Put pen to paper, even if it’s the butcher paper on the table. Tap Instagram, at least for a shot or two. Believe me, I’d love to tell you more about the pig roast I went to on a little island with a sunset view of San Juan, the one where local hooch was passed around in little paper cups and everyone danced while a grizzled butcher lovingly carved a mahogany porker into at least 10 different courses. Trust me, I also knocked back some pretty good chow during a nighttime crawl of food stalls in Seoul, where one of the stops included an edible fire show served inside a tent (a learning experience despite a young guide who seemed more dedicated to teaching us drinking games than describing what was on our plates). In those and other situations, I didn’t record my impressions because I wasn’t on a deadline — or an expense account — and I didn’t want to interrupt the mood.

Still, there are plenty of meals I dutifully remembered, and described in some length here and elsewhere in the newspaper, via dining postcards sent from Atlanta, Charlottesville, Philadelphia, Richmond and Wilmington over the past 12 months.

As for those cities I grazed in but didn’t tell you about? Here are some of the highlights, retrieved from my iPhone, a kimchi-fragrant business card, the margins of a hotel map — and a frequent traveling companion with a much better memory than mine.

Coqueta

Hands down, the most joyous meal of my year was dinner in August at the youthful Coqueta in San Francisco. A waterfront address helps. So does a corner perch in a dining room where cowhide rugs pad the floor, the ceiling goes on forever and your first taste of the menu is a big board of skewered snacks, what the Basques know as pintxos, washed back with a gin and tonic that’s so beautiful, you want to take it home as a table decoration.

Michael Chiarello is the vision behind the fiesta, which might prompt head-scratching from followers of his Italian work, foremost Bottega in Napa Valley. The veteran Bay Area chef jokingly calls his switch to Spanish “my midlife crisis.”

There’s not a single dish at Coqueta, helmed by chef de cuisine Ryan McIlwraith, that I wouldn’t be eager to eat again.

Meatballs rich with duck and pork (anything with pig demands your attention here) get jolts of flavor from tart cherries and fried shallots. Shrimp gathered with shoestring potatoes and a gently cooked egg get a little wild when mixed with their chunky chorizo dressing. A sense of whimsy infuses other dishes, including the pickled mussels nestled with shaved fennel in a little tin. “Canned fresh daily,” reads the menu. And the reason the paella, cooked to splendor over a wood-fired grill, tastes as though you’re eating it on its home turf: “We spend a lot of time on the broth,” made with ham stock, lobster shells and sofrito, Chiarello says. Come dessert, there are more pintxos, and more surprises: tomato-basil jellies in summer and bite-size manchego cheesecake anytime.

Surveying the scene, I can’t help but feel at home; the faces of some of the overseers appear familiar. Chiarello lured so much talent from Washington uber-chef Jose Andres, the Italian says that the Spaniard told him that next time, “we demand first-round draft picks.”

Coqueta is “flirt” in Spanish. If this restaurant doesn’t make your heart beat a little faster, none will.

Pier 5 (on the Embarcadero, near Broadway), San Francisco; 415-704-8866. coquetasf.com. Dinner tapas $3 to $15; entrees $20 to $38.

Le 6 Paul Bert

The perfect start to a visit to Paris in April (or anytime, really): Le 6 Paul Bert. Awash in light by day, the trim storefront from the esteemed chef Bertrand Auboyneau opens with a picnic’s worth of jams, meats and cheeses and a fetching light fixture fashioned from old wine bottles. My companion and I are led past a cozy zinc bar and a communal table to a snug spot in the rear that initially feels like Siberia but turns out to be prime real estate. What food lover wouldn’t want to watch his meal being cooked in front of him? Indeed, the open kitchen is so close, we hear every high note sung by hot oil and smile with pride as we survey the kitchen’s reading material, including the “Momofuku” cookbook on a nearby shelf. The bread, delivered in a paper bag, is wonderful, and it comes in handy as a swab for the savory dishes that follow. Happy memories are soon made of crisp mackerel with a vivid green herb puree, tender chunks of pork scattered on a creamy puree of potatoes and sunchokes and an ethereal vanilla panna cotta made refreshing with grapefruit. And the price is right: $25 for a three-course lunch that’s as beautiful as it is luscious. Our server doesn’t know the food very well (the menu changes daily), but his lack of detail turns out to be a boon: We chat up the cooks instead.

Here’s the co-owner of Revel in Seattle explaining why she and her husband chose the name: “Revel means to have a lot of joy,” says Rachel Yang, who alternates cooking behind the restaurant’s long butcher-block counter with Seif Chirchi, the mate in question. “We want diners to have fun with our food, to be excited.”

Not a problem. She’s from Seoul, he’s from outside Chicago, they both worked at Alain Ducasse in New York. For Revel, in the hipster Seattle neighborhood of Fremont, the couple created a menu of Asian-accented small plates that’s so compelling, you really want to show up with a crowd so that you can try one of everything in their

industrial-but-gracious environment.

House-made kimchi and braised pork belly make for a dynamite pancake that relies on ground mung beans instead of flour. Caramelized beef short ribs fatten the supple dumplings, each bite of which reveals ginger and chili in the seasoning. A salad of peppery mizuna and corned lamb gets tossed with a dressing that ricochets from sweet to sour to spicy and back. Yang isn’t kidding when she says, “We both like big flavors.” And you know that you’re on the West Coast when the crab-

seaweed noodle salad stars sweet Dungeness crab.

403 N. 36th St., Seattle, 206-547-2040. revelseattle.com. Small plates, $9 to $16.

Cheogajip

Nearing the end of five days of eating in Seoul in November — at street stalls, in the shadow of Buddhist temples and at restaurants so tranquil they felt like museums — I was chagrined to hear a resident tipster tell me that I had been grazing in the wrong places. “The really good cooking is outside the city,” my informant said — just as I signed the check for an unremarkable dinner for four for $600.

Panic set in. There wasn’t time for me to venture outside the capital of South Korea, but I did have another opportunity to eat before heading to the airport. So I dashed off an e-mail to Joe McPherson, founder of the online food journal ZenKimchi: Where should I have lunch the next day, and could he join us? McPherson pitched a few ideas. I stopped him when he mentioned a source for North Korean food, prepared in the cook’s home. And so it was that my guide met us the next day at Yaksu Station, a subway stop, and we ventured into a nearby residential neighborhood in search of lunch.

The gate outside Cheogajip, our destination, was cracked open a few inches, and thank goodness for that, because there’s no way we would have found the place otherwise. Expecting us, the cook beckoned three appetites into a small courtyard, where a yapping dog and a clothesline signaled a private residence. Our hostess motioned to a small room with a sliding door, where we gathered around a low table and glanced at the brief menu posted on the wall.

“There are five choices,” McPherson translated from the Korean script. “Two of them are beer and soju,” Korea’s spirit of choice. The rest of the selections turned out to be among the highlights of my trip. First came floppy, crescent-shaped dumplings, their skins so thin you could see the filling of pork and onions. A big steamed chicken followed. Using chopsticks, we coaxed the ivory meat from the bones, then dipped the morsels in a racy paste of chilies and leeks. Bliss. Helping crowd the table: a big bowl of chilled,

spaghetti-thin buckwheat noodles. Garnished with neat batons of cucumber, the bolt of beige rose from a pond of clear broth with a delicate vinegar sting.

There were smiles all around as we unwound our legs, nodded our thanks to the cook and exited through the courtyard, where woven trays of daikon radishes basked in the early afternoon sun. For less than $10 a head, we got a feast and a story to take home.

Boeing (BA) has deep ties with the federal government as a top supplier of aircraft to the U.S. Air Force.

It has also worked aggressively to draw high-profile attention to its Dreamliner jets. Last year, President Obama visited a Boeing factory that makes the 787 Dreamliners in Everett, Wash.

The visit was used to drum up support for a federal agency called the Export-Import Bank, which provides loans and guarantees to foreign countries so they can buy U.S. products. U.S. taxpayer guarantees, via the Ex-Im bank, have helped finance sales of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners to airlines of countries such as India, Poland and Ethiopia.

In fact, 65% of the $15.3 billion worth of loan guarantees that the Ex-Im bank issued in 2007 and 2008 went to help foreign countries buy Boeing aircraft, according to a 2009 report issued by the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts. Last year, Congress reauthorized the Export-Import Bank by four years, and raised its loan limits to $140 billion.

Experts say Boeing's influence in Washington helped settle a high-profile labor fight with the National Labor Relations Board. After Boeing's union reached an agreement, the federal agency dropped a complaint against Boeing for building a new non-union plant in South Carolina that helped make Dreamliner jets.

Boeing's influence also extends to the FAA, which last week announced a probe into the design, manufacture and assembly of the Dreamliner after problems first began to surface. On Wednesday, the FAA grounded the Dreamliner in the United States, a move that resulted in taking all 50 planes worldwide out of service.

The Dreamliner, Boeing's newest airplane, is made of lightweight materials and uses 20% less fuel while being 60% less noisy than similar planes. It also flies the longest distance for a midsized plane that holds up to 250 passengers.

The plane is widely seen as playing a key role in Boeing's future. It started commercial flights in October 2011. Boeing has orders for 800 more Dreamliners, but so far the only U.S.-based carrier to put them in service is United (UAL).

The FAA has worked very closely with Boeing to get the Dreamliner certified safe for air travel at a faster-than-usual pace, according to consultant and former airline executive Robert W. Mann. He said that the FAA was under pressure to fast-track approval of different design parts of the 787 Dreamliner because of the excitement surrounding the aircraft.

""When you start to stack up very innovative solutions, either as designs or as processes, any one of these is OK,"" Mann said. ""But when you start to build an aircraft entirely out of very innovative approaches to problems, you start to think, do you really want to allow the oversight agency to hurry along the certification process?""

Boeing's influence in Washington partly stems from its position as one of the nation's largest manufacturers, with a workforce topping 150,000. As a larger defense contractor, its fortunes trickle down to myriad other companies and industries that supply parts.

Boeing spent $11.8 million on lobbying last year and $3 million during the latest election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Boeing competitor Lockheed Martin (LMT) came in second place, among big aerospace firms, spending $11.5 million on lobbying, according to the center.

Obama tapped Boeing CEO James McNerney to chair the President's Export Council in March 2010.

McNerney has sought to calm fears about the Dreamliner. On Wednesday, McNerney said in a statement that he is ""confident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity.""

Calls and e-mails made to Boeing seeking comment for this story were not returned. The FAA had no immediate comment on the story."

Bush Presidential Library and Museum opened May 1 on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas after much anticipation. The $250 million library brought together all living presidents for a dedication ceremony on April 25, where they showered praise on the 43rd president of the United States.

But according to the Democratic nonprofit group Bridge Project, which focuses on ""exposing the conservative movement's dishonest tactics,"" the library's version of the Bush legacy suffers from selective memory loss. Bridge Project thus created a library of its own Thursday, in the form of a website BushRewrite.org, which the group said will ""rectify the falsehoods and omissions of the Bush library.""

The timing coincides with the eighth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, a low point of Bush's two-term presidency. The Bush library has already been accused of glossing over Katrina, which killed 1,833 people and destroyed an estimated $81 billion in property. The library overlooks the Bush administration's delayed reaction and includes no pictures of the desperate crowds at the Louisiana Superdome or the New Orleans Morial Convention Center -- images that quickly spurred suggestions that race was a factor in the muted federal response.

The halls of the Bush library ignore other disturbing facts, the Bush Rewrite states on the website. The Huffington Post was offered an exclusive look at the website, which says that the Bush White House ""was plagued by a series of scandals and controversies"" and ""policy failures."" It contains pages with what Bridge Project calls a ""stark reminder"" of Bush's true legacy, ranging from the economy, which revisits events preceeding the 2008 financial collapse, to war and national security, which highlights the Bush administration's torture and rendition programs.

The Bush Rewrite also recalls Bush's record on education, environmental policy and Social Security. In some cases, the website displays pictures taken at the Bush Library to underscore the contrast between the museum's more favorable remembrance with media reports.

A section called ""The Missing Wing"" is dedicated to controversial moments under Bush's presidency that his library chose not to mention, such as the roles played by Vice President Dick Cheney and senior adviser-turned-deputy chief of staff Karl Rove, the Abu Ghraib prisoner torture scandal, and Bush's support for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.

Bridge Project also uses the website to argue that congressional Republicans continue pushing policies that are harmful today.

The Bush library contents are ""American fiction,"" Eddie Vale, vice president of Bridge Project, told HuffPost. ""The inaccuracies and omissions are a disservice to the annals of history, but ignoring the lessons of the Bush administration poses a threat to our nation’s future. The failure to recognize the consequences of Bush’s policy decisions is why today’s congressional Republicans are even more ambitious than Bush ever was in pursuing the policies that served as the catalyst for the crises from which we are still recovering."""

Rick Snyder deals democracy another blow,"Enemy of democracy Rick Snyder

In a stunning reminder of how anti-democratic Michigan government is, Gov. Rick Snyder said Friday he would appoint an emergency financial manager for Detroit

This is an affront to democracy on at least two levels. First, we're talking about replacing the elected government of the 18th-largest city in the United States with an unelected bureaucrat expressly to undo actions undertaken by the elected government. Detroit's population is larger than those of Vermont, North Dakota or Wyoming. But Michigan Republicans are fine with—eager to—take democratic local control away from that many people.

Second, the law Snyder is using to appoint an emergency financial manager is a replacement for the emergency financial manager law that Michigan voters repealed in November. Just over a month after that repeal vote, Republican legislators passed and Snyder signed an overwhelmingly similar version of the law during their notorious lame duck session.

It's fitting, I guess, that if you're going to deprive around 700,000 people of their elected local government, you do so with a law nearly identical to one that had previously been repealed by voters. If you're going to act against democracy, you might as well double down. But the whole thing is appalling."

Organizers are using Facebook to promote the gathering, which is expected to begin about 1 p.m.. They expect about 6,000 people to attend the rally at the site of the fiery car crash that took the life of Walker and his friend, Roger Rodas.

Officials from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department are preparing for a large crowd, moving items placed at an informal memorial at the scene of the accident.

Nearby North Park Community Church is urging its members to consider parking Sunday farther from the church than usual because of the expected crowd. The church has also made arrangements for free coffee and water for people attending the event.

Walker and Rodas were killed Nov. 30 when a 2005 Porsche Carrera GT driven by Rodas, 38, crashed into a pole and a tree on Hercules Street near Kelly Johnson Parkway. Walker, 40, was a passenger in the vehicle.

The two had decided to go for a ride in the 600-horsepower car after attending a charity event sponsored by Reach Out Worldwide, Walker’s nonprofit organization that provides assistance for disaster victims around the globe.

Walker died from a combination of injuries and burns suffered in the crash, according to coroner’s officials. Rodas’ death was the result of “multiple traumatic injuries.”

Sheriff’s officials said speed was a factor in the crash, but there was no evidence the pair were involved in a street race.

Investigators are still trying to determine exactly what caused the crash and whether there was a possible mechanical failure, causing Rodas to lose control.

The results of toxicology tests are not expected for six to eight weeks.

Cardozo Law School, decided to bestow this year’s International Advocate for Peace award on former President Jimmy Carter, they sought to honor his decades as a mediator and humanitarian. But in the process, they ignited a sizable conflict of their own.

That is because Cardozo is a part of Yeshiva University, an Orthodox Jewish institution where support for the state of Israel runs high. And among supporters of Israel, there are few figures more controversial than Mr. Carter, who has repeatedly criticized Israeli policy toward Palestinians and described their circumstances as apartheid.

A group called the Coalition of Concerned Cardozo Alumni constructed a Web site, shameoncardozo.com, and posted a letter declaring the group’s outrage to the law school’s board of overseers. “Jimmy Carter is anathema to the aspirations of the Jewish people and the survival of the State of Israel,” the letter read in part. “Yeshiva University and Cardozo should not give a platform to his slander.” That outrage quickly ricocheted around supporters and critics of Israel, and even made headlines in the Middle East.

Richard M. Joel, the president of Yeshiva University, issued a statement explaining that the journal is run by students, and that it was they, not the university’s administrators, who chose the recipient of the award. However the event plays out, it casts a light on Cardozo’s unusual position as a secular law school within a religious university — one whose mission is in part to “bring wisdom to life by combining the finest contemporary academic education with the timeless teachings of Torah.”"

Sept. 27: “SNL” cast member Jay Pharoah tells the Grio website that he thinks the show is “too white.”

Oct. 14: Longtime cast member Kenan Thompson tells a TV Guide interviewer that he doesn’t want make up the lack of diversity in the cast on “SNL” anymore by playing black female characters.

Thursday: Civil rights group ColorofChange pens a letter to “SNL” producer Lorne Michaels asking him to address the paucity of diversity in the cast. Michaels tells the Associated Press that finding black female performers for the show is “a priority.’

Saturday: “Scandal” star Kerry Washington is the first woman of color to host the show since early 2012 (Season 37.)

On the set: movies and TV

Washington and the show’s writers wasted no time in addressing the issue in the episode. In the cold open, Washington played a luminous Michelle to Pharoah’s Barack Obama (“I feel like it’s been years since I’ve seen you!” he said to her pointedly.) However, when the script called for Oprah Winfrey to enter the scene, it became clear that Washington would have to play her as well as any other black female characters who were part of the sketch. Washington directly mentioned Thompson’s refusal to don drag, and while she quick-changed off-camera into her Winfrey costume, the show scrolled an explanation for why the sketch was occurring.

One might have expected that Washington was going to have to hurriedly come out in an increasingly disheveled array of costumes and wigs, but ultimately she only portrayed the two women (although the possibility of a Beyoncé impression was raised.) Instead, the writers made the most of their white male surplus, sending out six “All right, all right, all right”-ing Matthew McConaugheys instead. The scene was capped by a very svelte Al Sharpton addressing the audience with a stately, “What have we learned from this sketch? As usual, nothing.”

Was the scene a step in the right direction of “SNL” tackling its diversity issues, or to use Sharpton’s words, did it contribute “nothing” to the discussion (or even make light of the situation?) Obviously it would be impossible for Michaels and the “SNL” team to modify its casting decisions immediately, but pretending the tense last few weeks didn’t occur would also not be wise. It will be interesting to hear how the scene came to be written and what, if any, input Washington had in it.

PHOTOS: Celebrities by The Times

Race was mentioned a few other times in the episode after the cold open, once in a talk show called “How’s He Doing?” featuring Thompson, Pharoah and Washington as “nonpartisan” black intellectual talking heads addressing the likelihood that President Obama would ever lose their support (answer: highly unlikely.) The poor, innocent television recapper was written into the sketch too, as the characters referenced how much white people love the television show “The Wire:” “I had a white friend who wrote episode recaps of the ‘The Wire’ on the Internet. Can you imagine? He would watch it, write about it, and then other people would read it!” Hey! What did TV recappers ever do to you, “SNL”? (Oh ...)

In miscellaneous but of-note news from the episode, Kanye West may not want to queue up the show on his DVR, as he was targeted twice. At the end of “How’s He Doing?” the next installment of the fake talk show promised to address, “Kim [Kardashian] and Kanye: Who do you think is the difficult one in the relationship?” Also, on Weekend Update, when discussing West’s claim that he’s reappropriating the confederate flag, Cecily Strong flashed a photo of West with Kardashian, quoting him as saying, “Whenever I see something that upsets people, I make it mine.”’

Additionally, the ghost of Miley Cyrus still cannot rest peacefully, as she was invoked in the monologue. When Vanessa Bayer came to Kerry Washington (using the skills as a fixer she picked up playing Olivia Pope), for help after punching a bouncer at “da club,” Washington advised her to leave town. “But who will play Miley?” asked Bayer. “Haven’t you played Miley enough lately?” Washington replied. The additional reminder of Cyrus’ existence was balanced out, however, by a short tribute to Lou Reed with a clip of him performing on the show.

Lady Gaga returns as host and musical guest Nov. 16. She will probably not wear anything interesting.

Mail would be delivered. Social Security and Medicare benefits would continue to flow.

But vacationers would be turned away from national parks and Smithsonian museums. Low-to-moderate income borrowers and first-time homebuyers seeking government-backed mortgages could face delays.

A look at how services would or would not be affected if Congress fails to reach an agreement averting a government shutdown at midnight Monday.

AIR TRAVEL

Federal air traffic controllers would remain on the job and airport screeners would keep funneling passengers through security checkpoints. Federal inspectors would continue enforcing safety rules.

INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL

The State Department would continue processing foreign applications for visas and U.S. applications for passports, since fees are collected to finance those services. Embassies and consulates overseas would continue to provide services to American citizens.

BENEFIT PAYMENTS

Social Security and Medicare benefits would keep coming, but there could be delays in processing new disability applications. Unemployment benefits would still go out.

FEDERAL COURTS

Federal courts would continue operating normally for about 10 business days after the start of a shutdown, roughly until the middle of October. If the shutdown continues, the judiciary would have to begin furloughs of employees whose work is not considered essential. But cases would continue to be heard.

MAIL

Deliveries would continue as usual because the U.S. Postal Service receives no tax dollars for day-to-day operations. It relies on income from stamps and other postal fees to keep running.

RECREATION

All national parks would be closed, as would the Smithsonian museums, including the National Zoo in Washington. Visitors using overnight campgrounds or other park facilities would be given 48 hours to make alternate arrangements and leave the park. Among the visitor centers that would be closed: the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Alcatraz Island near San Francisco and the Washington Monument.

HEALTH

New patients would not be accepted into clinical research at the National Institutes of Health, but current patients would continue to receive care. Medical research at the NIH would be disrupted and some studies would be delayed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be severely limited in spotting or investigating disease outbreaks, from flu to that mysterious MERS virus from the Middle East.

FOOD SAFETY

The Food and Drug Administration would handle high-risk recalls suspend most routine safety inspections. Federal meat inspections would be expected to proceed as usual.

HEAD START

A small number of Head Start programs, about 20 out of 1,600 nationally, would feel the impact right away. The federal Administration for Children and Families says grants expiring about Oct. 1 would not be renewed. Over time more programs would be affected. Several of the Head Start programs that would immediately feel the pinch are in Florida. It's unclear if they would continue serving children.

FOOD ASSISTANCE

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, could shut down. The program provides supplemental food, health care referrals and nutrition education for pregnant women, mothers and their children.

School lunches and breakfasts would continue to be served, and food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would continue to be distributed. But several smaller feeding programs would not have the money to operate.

TAXES

Americans would still have to pay their taxes and file federal tax returns, but the Internal Revenue Service says it would suspend all audits. Got questions? Sorry, the IRS says taxpayer services, including toll-free help lines, would be shut as well.

LOANS

Many low-to-moderate incomes borrowers and first-time homebuyers seeking government-backed mortgages could face delays during the shutdown. The Federal Housing Administration, which guarantees about 30 percent of home mortgages, wouldn't underwrite or approve any new loans during the shutdown. Action on government-backed loans to small businesses would be suspended.

SCIENCE

NASA will continue to keep workers at Mission Control in Houston and elsewhere to support the International Space station, where two Americans and four others are deployed. The National Weather Service would keep forecasting weather and issuing warnings and the National Hurricane Center would continue to track storms. The scientific work of the U.S. Geological Survey would be halted.

HOMELAND SECURITY

The majority of the Department of Homeland Security's employees are expected to stay on the job, including uniformed agents and officers at the country's borders and ports of entry, members of the Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration officers, Secret Service personnel and other law enforcement agents and officers. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services employees would continue to process green card applications.

MILITARY

The military's 1.4 million active duty personnel would stay on duty, but their paychecks would be delayed. About half of the Defense Department's civilian employees would be furloughed.

PRISONS

All 116 federal prisons would remain open, and criminal litigation would proceed.

VETERANS SERVICES

Most services offered through the Department of Veterans Affairs will continue because lawmakers approve money one year in advance for the VA's health programs. Veterans would still be able to visit hospitals for inpatient care, get mental health counseling at vet centers or get prescriptions filled at VA health clinics. Operators would still staff the crisis hotline and claims workers would still process payments to cover disability and pension benefits. But those veterans appealing the denial of disability benefits to the Board of Veterans Appeals will have to wait longer for a decision because the board would not issue any decisions during a shutdown.

WORK SAFETY

Federal occupational safety and health inspectors would stop workplace inspections except in cases of imminent danger."

It's his decision"" President Obama orders flags lowered to half-staff for the international icon Pickens County Sheriff Rick Clark says not in his department Clark says the honor should be reserved for American citizens

(CNN) —

A South Carolina sheriff is refusing to lower the American flag in tribute to Nelson Mandela, saying the honor should be reserved for American citizens.

President Barack Obama ordered flags lowered to half-staff for the international icon until sunset Monday.

But Pickens County Sheriff Rick Clark says not in his department.

“It’s just my simple opinion that the flag should only be lowered to half-staff for Americans who sacrificed for their country,” Clark told CNN affiliate WHNS.

It should be lowered at the U.S. Embassy in South Africa, he said, but not at home.

The flag in his department was lowered over the weekend to honor a fallen law enforcement officer and for Pearl Harbor Day. But it will stay up Sunday, he said.

“I have no problem lowering it in South Africa in their country but not for our country. It should be the people who have sacrificed for our country.”

A spokesman for the department said the sheriff cannot be disciplined.

“He’s not breaking a law. It’s his decision. And I support the decision of the sheriff,” Chief Deputy Creed Hashe said.

Mandela became the symbol of the fight against racial discrimination in South Africa and served 27 years behind bars for defying the apartheid government. He died Thursday at age 95.

Though rare, the lowering of flags for foreign citizens is nothing new.

George W. Bush did it for Pope John Paul II eight years ago. Bill Clinton did it when former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in the 1990s.

In fact, the practice goes as far back as 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson ordered flags lowered for former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

But not all world leaders get the honor.

This year, Obama issued a statement expressing his condolences for the death of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. But he did not order the flag lowered.

American presidents can issue the executive order at their discretion, the Flag Code states. In general, presidents reserve the honor for major national figures, including governors and foreign dignitaries.

The code says it’s only a guide and it does not offer penalties for noncompliance.

But in the city that gave rise to Joe DiMaggio and Yogi Berra, a once-unthinkable prospect now looms. A die-hard fan of the Boston Red Sox, the kind of enthusiast reviled across the five boroughs, could soon rule the city.

He was raised in Cambridge, Mass., becoming a devotee of the Red Sox at 6, and he is unabashed in his disdain for anything having to do with that team from the Bronx.

“I have my loyalty to the team of my youth,” he said in an interview, calling his tie to the Red Sox a “deep devotion.”"

(CNN) —

Montreal’s interim mayor, Michael Applebaum, was arrested and charged early Monday with 14 criminal counts including fraud, breach of trust and conspiracy.

Quebec police said the charges involve at least two Montreal real estate transactions from 2006 to 2011 and hundreds of thousands of dollars traded hands.

“These allegations rest essentially on obtaining permission and political support on two real estate projects,” said Capt. Andre Boulanger of the Surete du Quebec, the province’s police force. He would not confirm or deny if the charges involve bribes or ties to gangsters and organized crime.

Applebaum took over the mayor’s job in November after Gerald Tremblay resigned amid corruption allegations. At the time, Applebaum vowed to “end an era of sleaze” at Montreal City Hall.

From 2006 to 2011, Applebaum served as the borough mayor of a large suburb of Montreal. During this time he also served on the city council.

Commenting at a police news conference Monday, the head of Quebec’s anti-corruption squad, Cmdr. Robert LaFreniere, said, “We can no longer tolerate these reprehensible acts committed towards the management of our public institutions. The values of ethics and integrity must remain at the heart of the actions taken by our elected officials.”

Officers said the investigation began in March after they received what they described as “solid” evidence from members of the public. Quebec police say the investigation continues and they are not ruling out more arrests.

This is the most recent explosive allegation to rock the city of Montreal as the details of an insidious corruption scandal have been laid bare at a province-wide inquiry. Testimony at that inquiry has outlined widespread corruption allegations and close relationships between elected officials, city employees, contractors and even organized crime.

Applebaum denies all charges."

Circuit guts president's recess appointment power,"The Constitution’s overall appointments structure provides additional confirmation of the intersession interpretation. The Framers emphasized that the recess appointment power served only as a stopgap for times when the Senate was unable to provide advice and consent. Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 67 that advice and consent “declares the general mode of appointing officers of the United States,” while the Recess Appointments Clause serves as “nothing more than a supplement to the other for the purpose of establishing an auxiliary method of appointment, in cases to which the general method was inadequate.” The “general mode” of participation of the Senate through advice and consent served an important function: “It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity.” The Federalist No. 76. Nonetheless, the Framers recognized that they needed some temporary method for appointment when the Senate was in the recess. At the time of the Constitution, intersession recesses were regularly six to nine months, and senators did not have the luxury of catching the next flight to Washington. To avoid government paralysis in those long periods when senators were unable to provide advice and consent, the Framers established the “auxiliary” method of recess appointments. But they put strict limits on this method, requiring that the relevant vacancies happen during “the Recess.” It would have made little sense to extend this “auxiliary” method to any intrasession break, for the “auxiliary” ability to make recess appointments could easily swallow the “general” route of advice and consent. The President could simply wait until the Senate took an intrasession break to make appointments, and thus “advice and consent” would hardly restrain his appointment choices at all. To adopt the Board’s proffered intrasession interpretation of “the Recess” would wholly defeat the purpose of the Framers in the careful separation of powers structure reflected in the Appointments Clause.

A third alternative interpretation of “the Recess” is that it means any adjournment of more than three days pursuant to the Adjournments Clause. See U.S. Const. art. I, § 5, cl. 4 (“Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days . . . .”). This interpretation lacks any constitutional basis. The Framers did not use the word “adjournment” in the Recess Appointments Clause. Instead, they used “the Recess.” The Adjournments Clause and the Recess Appointments Clause exist in different contexts and contain no hint that they should be read together. Nothing in the text of either Clause, the Constitution’s structure, or its history suggests a link between the Clauses. Without any evidence indicating that the two Clauses are related, we cannot read one as governing the other. We will not do violence to the Constitution by ignoring the Framers’ choice of words.

The fourth and final possible interpretation of “the Recess,” advocated by the Office of Legal Counsel, is a variation of the functional interpretation in which the President has discretion to determine that the Senate is in recess. See 2012 OLC Memo, supra, at 23 (“[T]he President therefore has discretion to conclude that the Senate is unavailable to perform its advise-and-consent function and to exercise his power to make recess appointments.”). This will not do. Allowing the President to define the scope of his own appointments power would eviscerate the Constitution’s separation of powers. The checks and balances that the Constitution places on each branch of government serve as “self-executing safeguard[s] against the encroachment or aggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other.” An interpretation of “the Recess” that permits the President to decide when the Senate is in recess would demolish the checks and balances inherent in the advice-and-consent requirement, giving the President free rein to appoint his desired nominees at any time he pleases, whether that time be a weekend, lunch, or even when the Senate is in session and he is merely displeased with its inaction. This cannot be the law. The intersession interpretation of “the Recess” is the only one faithful to the Constitution’s text, structure, and history.

The dearth of intrasession appointments in the years and decades following the ratification of the Constitution speaks far more impressively than the history of recent presidential exercise of a supposed power to make such appointments. Recent Presidents are doing no more than interpreting the Constitution. While we recognize that all branches of government must of necessity exercise their understanding of the Constitution in order to perform their duties faithfully thereto, ultimately it is our role to discern the authoritative meaning of the supreme law. As Chief Justice Marshall made clear in Marbury v. Madison, “[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each.” In Marbury, the Supreme Court established that if the legislative branch has acted in contravention of the Constitution, it is the courts that make that determination. In Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, the Supreme Court made clear that the courts must make the same determination if the executive has acted contrary to the Constitution. That is the case here, and we must strike down the unconstitutional act.

It would have made little sense to make the primary method of appointment the cumbersome advice and consent procedure contemplated by that Clause if the secondary method would permit the President to fill up all vacancies regardless of when the vacancy arose. A President at odds with the Senate over nominations would never have to submit his nominees for confirmation. He could simply wait for a “recess” (however defined) and then fill up all vacancies.

Our sister circuits and the Board contend that the “arise” interpretation fosters inefficiencies and leaves open the possibility of just what is occurring here — that is, a Board that cannot act for want for a quorum. The Board also suggests more dire consequences, arguing that failure to accept the “exist” interpretation will leave the President unable to fulfill his chief constitutional obligation to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3, and even suggests that the interpretation we adopt today could pose national security risks. But if Congress wished to alleviate such problems, it could certainly create Board members whose service extended until the qualification of a successor, or provide for action by less than the current quorum, or deal with any inefficiencies in some other fashion. And our suggestion that Congress can address this issue is no mere hypothesis. The two branches have repeatedly, and thoroughly, addressed the problems of vacancies in the executive branch. Congress has provided for the temporary filling of a vacancy in a particular executive office by an “acting” officer authorized to perform all of the duties and exercise all of the powers of that office.... Admittedly, Congress has chosen not to provide for acting NLRB members. But that choice cannot support the Board’s interpretation of the Clause. We cannot accept an interpretation of the Constitution completely divorced from its original meaning in order to resolve exigencies created by — and equally remediable by — the executive and legislative branches. And as the Supreme Court expressly noted in New Process Steel, in the context of the Board, “[i]f Congress wishes to allow the Board to decide cases with only two members, it can easily do so.”

Part of the D.C. Circuit's problem with the NLRB's appointments, wrote Judge Sentelle, is that if the recess isn't only intrasession recesses, then there's no firm definition as to what it is. It's not just when Congress is closed while everyone's out eating lunch, and the Court was unwilling to declare an arbitrary length like 10 or 20 days to be a ""recess,"" nor would it count an adjournment as a recess:Importantly, they did not accept DOJ's argument that the recess is whenever the president says it is, with the political process able to police excess uses of the power:And, finally, the lack of presidential precedent weighs against this ""new"" power here:The panel further held that a vacancy does not ""happen"" during a recess unless it's created then, and not merely because it existed prior to the recess:Finally, the Court doesn't much care about an agency that can't act without a quorum: blame Congress and let them fix it, they write:This is a bad, bad day for the president, especially given the Senate's unwillingness to make major reform on getting such nominees confirmed.

As a general question of presidential power ... your mileage may vary. Do read that 2012 OLC Memo, and see how you feel about such powers being used when the parties are reversed."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/03/washington-state-considers-gender-neutral-language-bill/,2013-02-03 00:00:00,[],Washington state considers final gender-neutral language bill,"In Washington state, dairymen, freshmen and even penmanship could soon be things of the past.

Over the past six years, state officials have engaged in the onerous task of changing the language used in the state's copious laws, including thousands of words and phrases, many written more than a century ago when the idea of women working on police forces or on fishing boats wasn't a consideration.

That process is slated to draw to a close this year. So while the state has already welcomed ""firefighters,"" ""clergy"" and ""police officers"" into its lexicon, ""ombuds"" (in place of ombudsman) and ""security guards"" (previously ""watchmen,"") appear to be next, along with ""dairy farmers,"" ""first-year students"" and ""handwriting.""

""Some people would say `oh, it's not a big thing, do you really have to go through the process of changing the language,""' said Seattle Councilmember Sally Clark who was one of the catalysts for the change. ""But language matters. It's how we signal a level of respect for each other.""

About half of all U.S. states have moved toward such gender-neutral language at varying levels, from drafting bills to changing state constitutions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Florida and Minnesota have already completely revised their laws as Washington state is doing.

The final installment of Washington state's bill already has sailed through the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee with unanimous approval. The nearly 500-page bill has one more committee stop scheduled before full Senate debate.

Crispin Thurlow, a sociolinguist and associate professor of language and communication at the University of Washington-Bothell, said the project was admirable.

He said that as language evolves, such efforts are more than symbolic.

""Changing words can change what we think about the world around us,"" he said. ""These tiny moments accrue and become big movements.""

Clark and former councilmember Jan Drago -- the Seattle City Council has long eschewed the terms councilwoman or councilman -- brought the issue to Sen. Jeannie Kohl-Welles in 2006 after they came across references to firemen and policemen in the mayor's proposed budget, as well as in state law dealing with local-government pensions.

Clark and Drago's findings sparked the initial gender-neutral language law that was passed in 2007, immediately changing those terms and directing the state code reviser's office to do a full revision of the rest of the code. A 1983 Washington state law had already required all new statutes to be written in gender-neutral terms, so state officials were tasked with going through the rest of state statutes dating back to 1854 to revise the rest.

As in past bills on the issue that have tackled sections of the state code, some revisions were as simple as adding ""or her"" after ""his."" Others required a little more scrutiny. Phrases like ""man's past"" changes to ""humankind's past"" and a ""prudent man or woman"" is simply a ""prudent person.""

Kyle Thiessen, the state's code reviser who has been working on the project along with two attorneys since 2008, said that the work was not without obstacles.

Words like ""manhole"" and ""manlock"" aren't so easily replaced, he said. Substitutes have been suggested -- ""utility hole"" and ""air lock serving as a decompression chamber for workers."" But Thiessen said those references will be left alone to avoid confusion.

Republican state Rep. Shelly Short, of Addy, has voted against earlier gender-neutral language bills and said she plans to do the same this year.

""I don't see the need to do gender neutrality,"" she said, adding that her constituents want her to focus on jobs and the economy. ""We're women and we're men.""

Kohl-Welles, who has sponsored each of the gender-neutral language bills, said that while this project hasn't been her top legislation every year, ""overall, it has important significance.""

""I believe,"" she said, ""that the culture has changed."""

Nonetheless, the department hired Bravo as a deputy through a little-known program called “Friends of the Sheriff” — a screening process for applicants with connections to department officials.

Bravo’s link was his uncle: Sheriff Lee Baca.

Now, the jail deputy is the subject of a Sheriff’s Department criminal probe into whether he abused an inmate. The incident, sheriff’s officials say, was caught on tape. Sources say FBI agents investigating the jails are also inquiring about Bravo.

Confidential sheriff’s records indicate that Bravo was hired even though officials had documented his alleged involvement in a fight with San Diego police, theft and arrests on suspicion of drunk driving and burglary.

Following inquiries from The Times, the Sheriff’s Department’s civilian monitoring agency looked at Bravo’s background. The Office of Independent Review’s lead attorney, Michael Gennaco, said in an interview “there is no way he should have been hired.”

Baca and Bravo, 32, declined to be interviewed. Bravo has been relieved of duty with pay in connection with the criminal probe.

This isn’t the first time that the hiring of an applicant with ties to a top sheriff’s official has drawn scrutiny. Last year, The Times reported that the son of the undersheriff’s secretary was hired as a security guard despite a history of theft, dishonesty, liaisons with prostitutes and as many as 100 domestic violence incidents. When he applied for the job, he was still on probation for punching a man unconscious.

In 2011, The Times reported that a recruit with ties to Baca’s son was hired during a hiring freeze for rookie deputies.

Baca’s spokesman, Steve Whitmore, said the sheriff was unaware of his nephew’s past and played no role in the decision to hire him in 2007. After inquiries from The Times, Baca asked the department’s official watchdog and internal investigators to review Bravo’s history to determine whether sheriff’s employees gave him special treatment.

Personnel records reviewed by The Times show that for years Baca’s department has operated a special hiring track for friends and relatives of department employees. The program was called FOS, or “Friends of the Sheriff” but is now operated under a different name, sources said. In 2009, the sheriff’s watchdog reviewed the hiring practice, calling the name “unfortunate,” but concluded that there was no evidence that those hired through the special track “routinely received preferential treatment during the background investigation process.”

At the time, the Office of Independent Review also said that the sheriff “knows virtually none of the individuals on the list” — that the list “might more aptly be titled ‘Applicants Who Know Someone on the Sheriff’s Department.’ ”

In a recent interview, Gennaco argued that having a separate hiring track for people who know sheriff’s officials actually helps prevent special treatment. After an FOS applicant’s background is investigated, he said, a final hiring decision is made by a special panel of commanders who are not informed of the applicant’s identity.

An internal sheriff’s spreadsheet reviewed by The Times shows Bravo was an FOS candidate, listed as “Sheriff Baca’s nephew” and noted as having a “459 arrest” — penal code for burglary — along with “DUI arrest, fight w/San Diego PD and theft.”

“The sheriff didn’t know anything about this,” Whitmore said.

Though Whitmore declined to discuss those allegations of misconduct in detail, he said “most of it occurred, if not all, while he was in the Marine Corps.” Military disciplinary records are not public, and The Times could not find court records indicating Bravo was charged. Whitmore said that arrests alone, without convictions, would not necessarily disqualify a job candidate.

The sheriff’s hiring rules give officials wide discretion. Some experts have said they allow for too much leeway, especially when it comes to evaluating serious misconduct such as lying, stealing and violence.

Concerns about Bravo’s conduct began early in his career. Retired sheriff’s Cmdr. Robert Olmsted told The Times that in about 2009, a sergeant caught Bravo looking at inappropriate material on a jailhouse computer. When confronted, Bravo yelled at the sergeant to mind his own business, Olmsted said. About a month later, Olmsted said, Bravo went to an off-duty party, where he ripped another deputy’s shirt pocket and fought with him. As he was being escorted out of the party, Olmsted said, Bravo was caught on tape acting belligerently and banging on countertops.

Anthony Brown, an FBI inmate informant, has told The Times that Bravo once smuggled him a cellphone behind bars — a claim a spokesman said sheriff’s detectives investigated but could not substantiate. In 2011, Brown was smuggled a cellphone by a deputy who didn’t realize Brown was secretly helping with the ongoing federal probe of the jails. Brown said he used that phone to communicate with his FBI handler on the outside. The transaction led to a bribery conviction against that deputy.

In an interview with The Times, Brown said that before he got that phone, another cellphone was smuggled to him by a second deputy: Bravo. He said that before the handoff, Bravo stripped him naked to make sure he wasn’t wearing a wire. Brown’s work has helped secure the conviction of one deputy, however court files and interviews reveal that he has previously made false allegations.

FBI agents investigating jailhouse misconduct have recently asked potential witnesses what they knew about Bravo, according to sources.

An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment.

Washington (CNN) – Continuing his congressional outreach, President Barack Obama met with a dozen Democratic senators Wednesday night during the middle of week in which the issues of gun control and immigration reached crucial points on the legislative agenda.

Dining at the Jefferson Hotel, Obama and the group had a “productive discussion about a range of issues,” including gun violence, immigration reform and the economy, according to a White House official.



“The President and the Senators also discussed the explosions in Boston and the president reaffirmed that the full weight of the federal government is behind this investigation, which is being led by the FBI,” the official added.

The attendees were:

Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado

Senator Chris Coons of Delaware

Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois

Senator Dianne Feinstein of California

Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana

Senator Patty Murray of Washington

Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island

Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire

Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan

Senator Mark Warner of Virginia

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island

Senator Ron Wyden or Oregon

None of the Democrats who attended were among the four senators who voted against the party line Wednesday in a vote to expand the background check system to cover more firearm purchases. (Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also voted no at the last minute for procedural reasons, allowing him to bring the amendment back up at a later date.)

The meeting ran a little more than two hours and followed two high-profile dinners between Obama and Senate Republicans in recent weeks. He also met with both caucuses in both chambers last month in multiple trips to Congress.

The president’s new outreach came after criticism that the president was not socializing enough with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said last month that it was good Obama was reaching out to Republicans, but he also needed to build more relationships within his own party.

""I was very pleased to see him reach out to his colleagues on the other side, and I would hope he would reach out to us as well,"" he told CNN. Manchin was not among the guests Wednesday night.

Senators were tight lipped on their way out from the hotel Wednesday. When asked how the dinner went, Stabenow yelled ""great"" and added “very positive,” and Reed simply said ""good.” Warner said it went very well, while Whitehouse literally gave it two thumbs up.

“It was a good dinner,” Bennet said. “We talked about not talking about it.”

Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, meanwhile, released a statement after the meeting, saying the group talked about ways to tackle the deficit.

“It is clear to me that President Obama and Senate Democrats are united in our desire to end the constant lurching from crisis to crisis that is hurting middle class families and the economy,” she said. “We also share the hope that some Republicans will finally step out of their partisan corner and join us at the table willing to offer some compromises that will help move our country and our economy forward.”

On a warm night outside the hotel, a crowd of spectators gathered across the street throughout the evening. Joggers and bicyclists, some of whom first ignored the closed streets before being sternly turned back, were a constant presence on the crowded sidewalk across from the hotel.

While senators walked in the front door of the hotel, the president's motorcade did the short drive two blocks from the White House, past pedestrians, and entered on the side.

Hotel guests had their bags checked before being allowed to cross the street.

Before Joining The Post', 'She Was A Political Columnist', 'Food Writer At The Baltimore Sun', 'She Has Also Worked For The Associated Press', 'The Fort Worth Star-Telegram', 'The Hartford Courant.']",Mansion spending records indicate improper billing by Virginia governor and his family,"Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) and his wife, Maureen, have used taxpayer money for a range of small personal items they should have paid for themselves under state policy, according to spending records.

The McDonnells have billed the state for body wash, sunscreen, dog vitamins and a digestive system “detox cleanse,” the records show. They also have used state employees to run personal errands for their adult children. In the middle of a workday, for example, a staffer retrieved Rachel McDonnell’s newly hemmed pants at a tailoring shop nine miles from the governor’s mansion. Another time, a state worker was dispatched to a dry cleaner 20 miles away to pick up a storage box for Cailin McDonnell’s wedding dress.

About six months into the governor’s term, the official who oversees mansion spending told the McDonnells that they should not have charged taxpayers for a number of expenses, including deodorant, shoe repairs and dry-cleaning their children’s clothing. The official asked the McDonnells to pay the state back more than $300, which they did, and also gave them a refresher on what the state will and won’t provide for occupants of the governor’s mansion.

But since that time, state records show that the McDonnells have continued to let taxpayers pick up the tab for numerous personal items, including vitamins, nasal spray and sleep-inducing elixirs.

Under the Freedom of Information Act, The Washington Post sought records of personal expenses covered by the state over the couple’s 31 / 2 years in the mansion. The full cost of those items is unknown because the state released only 16 sales receipts, most of them from 2011. State records show that there were many more personal shopping trips — nine others in January 2011 alone, including two to Bed Bath & Beyond to pick up “college stuff” for the McDonnells’ children.

The McDonnells repaid the state for at least some personal items purchased on those occasions. But without receipts, it is impossible to know whether they fully reimbursed taxpayers. The few receipts that were released show only partial repayment.

McDonnell spokesman Tucker Martin declined to say why other receipts were not released.

Based on the disclosed records, the amount of personal expenses the McDonnells billed to the state is small — less than $600, including the $300 they repaid. But the disclosure comes at time when spending at Virginia’s Executive Mansion is already under scrutiny.

The FBI and a federal grand jury are investigating the $15,000 catering tab at Cailin McDonnell’s mansion wedding in June 2011 that was paid by a McDonnell campaign donor. That same donor, Star Scientific chief executive Jonnie R. Williams Sr., also lent the governor his Ferrari, lakeside vacation home and private jet. A Richmond prosecutor also is investigating whether the governor violated state gift disclosure laws.

Emerging as the former mansion chef faces charges of stealing food from the kitchen, the McDonnells’ expense records provide some insight into how the executive home has been managed. The chef has alleged that the McDonnells — already entitled to a free mansion, food, personal chef, maids and one of nation’s few state-funded butlers — have engaged in petty pilfering.

In court filings submitted as part of his defense, chef Todd Schneider has said that the McDonnells’ five children raided the mansion kitchen and liquor cabinet, taking large quantities of food and alcohol to their own homes or college dorm rooms. He also said that Maureen McDonnell had given away mansion pots and pans to her three daughters. McDonnell has declined to respond to those accusations, noting the ongoing criminal case against the chef.

Martin said the McDonnells have sought to properly distinguish personal expenses from state ones while living in the mansion, a 200-year-old Federal-style gem that is a public building and a private residence.

“Every Administration strives to balance private family life with the official state functions that are all occurring under the same roof, at the same time,” Martin said in an e-mail. “It is a balance and there is a constant effort to ensure that it is appropriately managed. The McDonnell Administration has adhered to precedent in reimbursing the state for items meant for personal use.”

In the McDonnell family’s first six months in the mansion, taxpayers paid for dry-cleaning the twin sons’ suits and shirts, repairing the first lady’s shoes and putting new shoulder pads into an item of her clothing. The McDonnells billed their energy drinks, body wash, deodorant and breath-freshening strips to the state as well.

Virginians paid for a $62 laminated banner to celebrate the twins’ high school graduation, with a state employee picking up the sign at the print shop and paying for it with the mansion credit card. When Ginger, the sheltie/terrier mix billed as “Virginia’s first dog,” needed vitamins, the McDonnells passed the $9.49 expense to taxpayers.

Eventually, an official who reviews mansion spending kicked those expenses back and asked the McDonnells to reimburse the commonwealth $317.27. The McDonnells paid the money back.

“These expenses are personal ones, that due to auditing and the direction of Dennis Johnson, Division Director of DSAS [Division of Selected Agency Support Services], cannot be covered by the State or Mansion funds,” mansion director Sarah Scarbrough said in a note to the McDonnells in the fall of 2010.

The state will cover the cost of dry-cleaning for the governor and first lady, basic hygiene items, “including toilet paper, mouthwash, bar soap,” cleaning and laundry supplies, and food for family meals, state functions and events, Johnson said in the memo.

But it does not cover the cost of clothing alterations, dry-cleaning for other family members, deodorant or body wash, pet food or treats, or food for non-family meals or non-state functions, Johnson wrote.

The McDonnells directly pushed back on one front, insisting that the state continue to pay for their energy drinks. The governor’s chief of staff, Martin Kent, overruled Johnson to allow the drinks at state expense.

“While other governors and spouses may have had bacon and eggs, or cereal, or etc for breakfast, Governor McDonnell drinks Boost every morning, and the First Lady has a 5-Hour energy and/or a Boost,” Martin wrote. “That is their breakfast. And that is why those items are covered, just like breakfast is covered for EVERY Governor and First Lady.”

Like all new governors and their families, the McDonnells were told the expense rules at the outset of the administration but needed some time for them to sink in, Johnson said in an interview. Energy drinks aside, Johnson said that ever since he gave the McDonnells their refresher on what the state will and won’t pay for, their spending has been in line with state policy.

“Typically when an administration comes in, we do discuss things,” he said. “There are growing pains, and early on in the administration, there will be some things we have to review and discuss.”

But sales receipts released by the state indicate that energy drinks are not the only extra the governor and first lady have continued to get at state expense. They went on to bill taxpayers for myriad medicine-cabinet products, vitamins and the body wash that Johnson said shouldn’t be billed, records show.

Records also show that the McDonnells used state employees to run personal errands for their children — and directed the employees to use the mansion credit card to pay for their children’s personal items.

In some cases, personal items for the McDonnell children are the only products listed on mansion credit card receipts. In those instances, the errands do not appear to have been performed in conjunction with any official state business.

In July 2011, for example, a state employee picked up Rachel McDonnell’s hemmed pants at Lucy’s Divine Creations, located 20 minutes west of the mansion. And that November, a worker was dispatched to Handcraft Cleaners, 30 minutes away, to get a box for Cailin McDonnell’s wedding dress. The $24 charge for the hemming and the $49.50 cost of the box went on the mansion credit card. The McDonnells later repaid the state for those personal expenses, but not for the use of employee time.

Martin said that Maureen McDonnell would have run those errands herself, but because she is the first lady, she must always travel with a security detail.

“First Ladies have Executive Police Protection,” Martin wrote. “They cannot just jump in their own car and run errands. Therefore the reimbursement process exists to allow First Families to reimburse for personal items that may have been picked up by staff.”"

""This is not a situation where we're back in the '80s where there was this push for welfare reform because people were perceived to be gaming the system,"" said Vilsack. ""That's not the case here.""

In an interview with The Huffington Post, Vilsack said House Republican leadership's failure to move a farm bill, which included nearly $80 billion per year in food stamp subsidies, could pose major harm to the agriculture community.

He also predicted that the GOP was harming itself politically, having spent the last election lambasting President Barack Obama as the ""Food Stamp President"" to no success.

""I think the reason why they haven't been particularly successful with this argument is that maybe the American people recognize these food assistance programs are helping people who are struggling through no fault of theirs,"" Vilsack said, ""or who have worked their entire lives but are now living on a very small and meager Social Security check, or dealing with a disability that makes it very difficult if not impossible for them to work. I think Americans have understanding and compassion for these people.""

Republicans in Congress disagree. Last month, GOP leadership brought to the floor a bill that would have cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by more than $20 billion and given states leeway to drug test recipients. To the surprise of leadership itself, the measure failed to pass, as conservative Republicans argued the cuts weren't deep enough and that the rest of the bill represented a giveaway to agribusiness. Democrats, for their part, said the food stamp cuts went too far and only a handful of them ended up supporting the legislation.

It's the second consecutive year the traditional alliance between urban and rural lawmakers has failed to get a farm bill through the House. With lawmakers now at an impasse, Republicans are entertaining the idea of splitting the bill in two, and attempting to pass agricultural subsidies and food stamp payments separately.

""I'd be very concerned if I were a farmer or rancher or producer if these bills were split,"" Vilsack said, adding that food stamps don't need congressional reauthorization to continue. ""On the other hand, some of these farm programs, they come up every five years and historically the way they get passed is for that coalition between urban suburban and rural legislators understanding that there's something in this bill that speaks to their constituents.""

Vilsack said that if Republicans wanted to reform nutrition assistance or crop subsidies, keeping them together in a farm bill is their best chance to do so. Agriculture and nutrition advocacy lobbyists generally agree that the nutrition and farm assistance should stay together.

The top Democrat in the House Committee on Agriculture, Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), argued a twin-bill package would fail to make it through the lower chamber. (He himself said he would vote against the food stamp portion of such a package, arguing the cuts would be too deep.) Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), meanwhile, urged House leadership to simply take up the Senate's version of the farm bill, pledging that he would not support a stopgap fix like the one-year extension that was passed last year.

Vilsack said that if current agriculture laws are allowed to expire at the end of September it would have damaging effects, both globally, by harming trade relations, and locally, by raising milk prices.

""We spend a lot less on our food as a percentage of our income than most people around the world do,"" Vilsack said. ""It gives us a lot of flexibility with our paychecks that sometimes we fail to recognize or appreciate farmers for what they get to us."""

In late 2011, they modified the Capitol Access Policy from a two page reservation form to a 25-page document that requires users to agree to all sorts of speech-chilling conditions. When singers ignored their demand to apply for a permit and sign the agreement, the Walker administration ordered its Capitol Police officers to issue hundreds of citations alleging violations of obscure sections of the Wisconsin administrative code. I received 4 of the citations last fall, including one for walking in a circle which they deemed to be disorderly conduct, and another for holding a cloth banner which they claimed was a hazardous material. Nearly all of those citations have been dismissed, and many more will be soon.

When that didn’t work, the Walker Administration declared an emergency, allowing them to temporarily modify the state administrative code and give themselves power to declare the Sing Along an “unlawful assembly.” When the singers continued to gather each day anyway, Walker ordered his palace guard to arrest singers, with handcuffs and everything, and issue them more citations. In the past few weeks they have arrested nearly 200 people, including working journalists covering the story, members of Veterans for Peace, numerous Raging Grannies wearing big hats and colorful aprons, at least two minors, school board members, firefighters, and other peaceful singers.

When news of the arrests spread, it attracted more citizens, swelling the ranks of the singers from a couple dozen to hundreds over the last couple weeks.

Finally, on Monday of this week, Walker’s stressed-out palace guards lost their composure and attacked two young African-American men in the rotunda, one who peacefully sat down when he was told he was being arrested, and that man’s brother, who was observing and taking photographs nearby. The photographer has languished in jail for three days while the Capitol Police have tried to get their paperwork together. I guess it’s tough to fabricate a plausible charge of battery to a police officer when multiple videos show that the defendant did nothing but try to walk away while waving his hands to indicate he was not a participant of the Sing Along:

.

Mr. Terrell is finally scheduled for his arraignment this afternoon.

According to one local source who prefers to go unnamed, the beleaguered Capitol Police chief recently contacted the Dane County Sheriff for advice on what to do. The Sheriff, who trains his staff in non-confrontational community policing techniques and has been moderately critical of the Walker administration, is said to have advised the chief to prepare for multiple federal lawsuits for violating people’s civil rights.

Obviously, nothing is working for the Walker administration in their attempts to kill off the peaceful and legal dissent, so now we see their latest brilliant scheme. They know the singers politely move outside when another event has been scheduled inside the building, so they have convinced their nutty allies to take out permits, denying the space to the Sing Along (and to any other group that might want to use the space.) In an attempt to “trap” the singers for public relations purposes, they don’t announce the event on their website until the day before, or sometimes not at all, hoping to cause confusion and a confrontation when people arrive for the Sing Along. Nice, huh?

Today, the Republican Women of Jefferson County will allegedly play music inside from noon to one. On Labor Day, the “Liberty Singers” are scheduled to perform from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Wow, that's a long time. I guess they'll be doing all their hits.

No problem. We singers will sing outside and have a grand time. If we can do it January in Wisconsin (which we have many times), August and September will be a piece of cake. Isn’t this just pathetic, though? I mean really.

UPDATE: Hey, they actually showed up. (Sometimes these ghost permit-holders don't appear.) Judge for yourself the quality of their singing, but don't be too harsh. Considering the propaganda they've been fed about the Solidarity Sing Along, they were probably nervous that they'd be entering a lion's den. It takes some guts to raise your voice in the people's house, no matter your message. They were pretty stiff, but they had one or two quality voices. My advice? Relax. It takes a few hundred rehearsals in the rotunda to adjust to the acoustics.



UPDATE 2: Mr. Terrell is now out of jail on a signature bond, but apparently has not yet been charged with a crime. The Dane County District Attorney, who has been very skeptical lately about arrests made by the Capitol Police, said he did not have enough time to review the paperwork submitted by Capitol Police. Mr. Terrell will have to appear in court again on September 12th, presumably to find out what it is he's being accused of. It's quite possible the D.A. will just drop the whole thing before then."

4) No American arms in the hands of Islamists or other bad guys

and

5) Assad at least talking seriously about giving up his chemical weapons.

Did Obama get 'lucky'? Well, I dunno. Luck is fickle. But there's a Yiddish saying:

The apparent deal with the National Treasury Employees Union is scheduled for Wednesday and was made public by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.

Grassley's office said the information came from a ""person with knowledge of IRS budgetary procedures.""

The IRS is already facing widespread criticism, which started last month when IRS officials acknowledged that agents had improperly targeted Tea Party groups and conservative organizations for additional scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status during the 2010 and 2012 elections. Then the agency's inspector general issued a report a few weeks later that documented lavish employee conferences during the same time period.

Grassley says the bonuses should be canceled under an April directive from the White House budget office.

More On This...

The directive was written by Danny Werfel, a former budget official who has since been appointed acting IRS commissioner.

The IRS said it is negotiating with the union over the matter but did not dispute Grassley's claim that the bonuses are imminent.

Office of Management and Budget ""guidance directs that agencies should not pay discretionary monetary awards at this time, unless legally required,"" IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge said in a statement. ""IRS is under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement, which specifies the terms by which awards are paid to bargaining-unit employees.""

Eldridge, however, would not say whether the IRS believes it is contractually obligated to pay the bonuses.

""In accordance with OMB guidance, the IRS is actively engaged with NTEU on these matters in recognition of our current budgetary constraints,"" Eldridge said.

The National Treasury Employees Union did not respond to requests for comment.

Three congressional committees and the Justice Department are investigating the targeting of conservative groups. And key Republicans in Congress are promising more scrutiny of the agency's budget, especially as it ramps up to play a major role in implementing the new health care law.

Much of the agency's top leadership has been replaced since the scandals broke. President Barack Obama forced the acting commissioner to resign and replaced him with Werfel, who used to work in the White House budget office.

In a letter to Werfel on Tuesday, Grassley said the IRS notified the employee union March 25 that it intended to reclaim about $75 million that had been set aside for discretionary employee bonuses. However, Grassley said, his office has learned that the IRS never followed up on the notice. Instead, Grassley said, the IRS negotiated a new agreement with the bargaining unit to pay about $70 million in employee bonuses.

""While the IRS may claim that these bonuses are legally required under the original bargaining unit agreement, that claim would allegedly be inaccurate,"" Grassley wrote. ""In fact, the original agreement allows for the re-appropriation of such award funding in the event of budgetary shortfall.""

Werfel wrote the directive on discretionary employee bonuses while he was still working in the White House budget office. The directive was part of the Obama administration's efforts to impose across-the-board spending cuts enacted by Congress.

“It’s like robbing Peter to pay Paul,"" said Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. ""On the one hand the IRS claims it’s short on resources, but on the other hand it appears they’re ready to dole out $70 million in bonuses that looks like a payoff to union workers at a time when we’re drowning in a sea of red ink. Given the government guidelines on sequestration, this is certainly an issue that demands further scrutiny.”

The sequestration cuts are resulting in at least five unpaid furlough days this year for the IRS' 90,000 employees. On these days, the agency is closed and taxpayers cannot access many of the agency's assistance programs.

Werfel's April 4 memorandum ""directs that discretionary monetary awards should not be issued while sequestration is in place, unless issuance of such awards is legally required. Discretionary monetary awards include annual performance awards, group awards, and special act cash awards, which comprise a sizable majority of awards and incentives provided by the federal government to employees.""

""Until further notice, agencies should not issue such monetary awards from sequestered accounts unless agency counsel determines the awards are legally required. Legal requirements include compliance with provisions in collective bargaining agreements governing awards.""

Father is not bitter about CIA analyst%27s decision to leak information

The news has turned family upside-down%2C but dad says he is not angry

Says he does not know whether his daughter is still in Hawaii

The father of the girlfriend to the security analyst whose revelations of secret surveillance programs rocked the globe says he doesn't feel bitter about his family's life being turned upside-down, and he sends his love to the couple.

Jonathan Mills spoke briefly to a handful of reporters from the driveway of his modest Laurel, Md., duplex, saying he didn't know if his 28-year-old daughter Lindsay Mills is still in Hawaii. He said they have communicated by text message but that he doesn't know her whereabouts, or those of Edward Snowden, the former CIA technical analyst working in Hawaii when he leaked details of U.S. government surveillance efforts.

""I know more from your reports than from anywhere else,"" Jonathan Mills told reporters.

Asked how she's doing in the face of the revelations, the gray-haired, pony-tailed Mills said, ""She's holding on.""

Jonathan Mills said he last saw her when she visited about two months ago. Lindsay Mills grew up in the duplex in a modest suburban Baltimore neighborhood. He said Snowden, 29, and his daughter had been dating for four or five years and described him as ""very nice – shy, reserved.""

Asked if Snowden's leak was a surprise, he said, ""He's always had strong convictions right along and it kind of made sense, but it's still a shock.""

Jonathan Mills had originally refused to talk to reporters as he arrived at his home Tuesday afternoon. About a half dozen local police officers were soon dispatched to the home, where they stood in the driveway for nearly an hour. Finally, a Laurel police spokesman persuaded the elder Mills to come outside and speak briefly with the media. The entire interview lasted less than two minutes, and Mills, who spoke in a hushed voice, said it was ""all right"" that Snowden's leaks have turned his family's life upside-down. ""I understand.""

Jonathan Mills added, ""I just wish him good luck and he's got my love.""

Lindsay Mills, 28, said recently on her blog that ""my world has opened and closed all at once, leaving me lost at sea without a compass.""

Mills' latest blog post, on Monday, says she won't be blogging again for ""a while.""

In the post, Mills talks of typing on a ""tear-streaked keyboard"" and reflects ""on all the faces that have graced my path. The ones I laughed with. The ones I've held. The one I've grown to love the most. And the ones I never got to bid adieu. But sometimes life doesn't afford proper goodbyes.""

Snowden had been hiding in a Hong Kong hotel before checking out on Monday. He told The Guardian that he left behind his family and a six-figure job in Hawaii to disclose the details of NSA phone and Internet data collection.

Lindsay Mills worked with the Waikiki Acrobatic Troupe in Hawaii, colleague Terryl Leong said. In a post Sunday, Mills said she was feeling ""sick, exhausted and carrying the weight of the world.""

A post June 3 reports, ""I feel alone, lost, overwhelmed, and desperate for a reprieve from the bipolar nature of my current situation.""

In a post May 13, she says that ""E's"" family would be visiting them in Hawaii.

Andrea Torres, director of the Samadhi aerial dance studio in Honolulu, told The Telegraph that Mills had trained there all of last year.

Torres told The Telegraph: ""She took a beginner's class in silks, and enjoyed pole dancing and inquired about burlesque. She came by herself and she was very fit.""

http://money.cnn.com/2013/02/01/news/economy/taxes-middle-class/index.html,2013-02-01 00:00:00,['Joseph J. Thorndike'],When taxes first hit the middle class,"It was 1940, and war was enveloping Europe. In Washington, defense costs were beginning their steep spiral into the stratosphere.

In the first six months of the year, as German armies swept across northern Europe, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent Congress a series of military spending requests, each bigger than the last. On May 16, the president asked for $1.2 billion; on May 30, he asked for another $1.3 billion.

Joe Thorndike is a contributing editor at Tax Analysts and a columnist for Tax Notes magazine.

Congress began debating a variety of ways to pay for the country's military buildup, and the individual income tax quickly emerged as the most likely source of new money. Support for exempting less income, and thus imposing higher taxes, cut across the political spectrum; even many liberals, led by FDR, embraced the idea.

The enormous funding needs of World War II would soon transform the income tax from a ""class tax"" to a ""mass tax."" Throughout the New Deal, tax burdens had been very light or even non-existent on lower- and middle-income Americans, and Roosevelt emphasized income taxes on the very rich. Now he would push to raise taxes on a much broader swath of workers.

Revenue was one reason. But as the war became a reality for Americans, the notion of shared sacrifice emerged as another main justification for higher taxes.

""A part of the sacrifice means the payment of more money in taxes,"" Roosevelt warned in 1941.

The income tax, enacted 100 years ago, was the nation's most famous tax, and one deeply rooted in notions of social justice. Its annual filing requirement made a connection between the taxpayer and his government -- a connection absent from most sales and consumption taxes.

Related: The millionaire 'super tax'

Notions of fairness and sacrifice were also tied up with tax visibility. Tax experts had long contended that people should be aware of the taxes they paid. Such awareness encouraged scrutiny of public affairs and left taxpayers more attuned to the costs of democratic governance.

As America's involvement in World War II deepened, all taxpayers faced a heavier burden.

The average effective rate for the top 1% of taxpayers climbed from roughly 20% in 1940 to almost 60% in 1944. On the other end of the scale, the marginal tax rate in the bottom bracket in 1940 was 4.4% and it began after an $800 exemption for individuals. In 1944, the exemption was $500 and the rate was 23%.

Related: Presidents and their tax rates

The war years also brought the Victory Tax, a short-lived income tax that bolstered the regular income levy by taxing Americans near the bottom of the income scale.

The Victory Tax was most notable, however, for an innovation it brought to the federal tax system: withholding. The tax was deducted directly from both salaries and wages. That ensured that taxpayers would remain current with their obligations and gave the Treasury Department quick access to new revenue.

Until it became a ""mass tax,"" the income tax was administered without withholding.

Treasury officials used a massive public relations campaign to advise new taxpayers of their fiscal responsibilities. Posters, radio announcements, popular songs and even a Donald Duck cartoon drove home the new tax filing requirements. Officials stressed that millions of previously exempt Americans now had to file returns.

Related: Taxing the rich - What's fair?

Withholding changed the income tax forever. It made the levy more responsive and flexible, both reflecting and facilitating its conversion into a powerful economic tool. Moreover, as one legal historian has pointed out, it helped create a taxpaying culture, getting Americans comfortable with regular deductions from their paychecks. No small feat in an era when such deductions were all but unknown.

In the end, the exemption cuts of World War II totaled just $500 for individuals, but they transformed the nature of the American state and society. Similarly, the rate changes, while often simply a matter of adjusting numbers in a table, were enormously important to the taxpayers who suddenly found themselves with marginal tax rates over 90%.

In many vital respects, the wartime tax regime broke with the history of New Deal revenue reform. Almost overnight, the income tax had ""changed its morning coat for overalls."" Millions of middle-class Americans unaccustomed to paying direct taxes to Washington joined the tax rolls for the first time.

Sunday marks the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the Constitution's 16th Amendment, which ushered in the modern federal income tax. This commentary by historian Joseph J. Thorndike is adapted from his new book, Their Fair Share: Taxing the Rich in the Age of FDR (Urban Institute Press)."

Syria 'expert' Elizabeth O'Bagy

During last week’s Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on possible military strikes against Syria, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) read from an “important op-ed by Dr. Elizabeth O’Bagy,” whom he described as a “Syria analyst at the Institute for the Study of War.” That group fired O'Bagy Wednesday after learning she had falsely claimed she holds a Ph.D.

One of the people advocating war in Syria, occasionally quoted by certain pro-Syria War kossacks, is Elizabeth O'Bagy. O'Bagy is your run-of-the-mill PNAF type. She writes op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. She's even been cited as a source by John McCain and John Kerry. She's a CNN and Fox News analyst. She's a junior member of the Washington neoconservative foreign policy establishment. If you've ever lived or done business in Washington, you've probably encountered people like her. If you could stand it.

She's the person who has been going around saying stuff like this:



O’Bagy wrote that “contrary to many media accounts, the war in Syria is not being waged entirely, or even predominantly, by dangerous Islamists and al Qaeda die-hards.” For McCain and Kerry, each advocating intervention, the op-ed served as a way to speak to concerns over the make-up of the forces fighting Syrian President Bashar Assad, and whether they're hostile to U.S. interests.

It's a patent falsehood. Even our own intelligence agencies say that the biggest and most effective ""rebels"" are various Saudi-financed jihadists and Al Qaeda. And that even the so-called ""moderates"" are anything but. Of course, she never disclosed that she was also political director for ... you guessed it, The Syrian Emergency Task Force which was the group that organized ... you guessed it ... John McCain's trip to Syria. The same trip that caused him to start beating the war drums for military intervention. The SETF is a bunch of Syrian-American yuppies looking to go take over the country ... as long as they don't have to do any of the fighting themselves.

And guess who finances the operation. Well, I'm still finding that out. But I suspect that when I explore the fact that the SETF's founder and executive director was a featured speaker at last year's Republican National Convention, I'm pretty sure what we have here is an Ahmed Chalabi-style get rich quick scheme being pushed by a bunch of Syrian-American elites and their neocon allies. After we've done all the dirty work in blood and treasure, they'll gladly come in as agents of ""democracy.""

How many times do we have to watch this movie, folks?

O'Bagy got fired for lying on her resume, claiming she had a PhD when she didn't. No doubt she's lying about, in John Kerry's words, her ""enormous experience in Syria"" as well. But that's just a small part of the story.

The bigger story here, for an enterprising reporter, is just who is behind the push to get America involved in the Syrian civil war. Who are the people operating behind the scenes, coddling and convincing important senators like McCain? Getting themselves and their allies speaking gigs in the media? Getting themselves quoted as foreign policy analysts? Getting meetings with important officials whom they've happened to have gone to Harvard with?

It is important to know because if we are going to be, yet again, duped into a stupid war by a bunch of well-connected elitists with their own secret agenda, then I'd like to know NOW rather than 10 years, 7,000 lives, 35,000 wounds, and $2 trillion later."

""I know you're going to think that I'm crazy for doing this, for leaving the U.S., for coming to Mexico but, to be honest, I think it is crazier that I had to wait 15 years to see my family,"" Lizbeth Mateo, one of the activists, said in a video posted on the Alliance's Facebook page.

Mateo traveled to Oaxaca a week ago, while the two other activists — one who has applied for a government program that lets young immigrants live in the U.S. on renewable two-year stays — went to Mexico on Wednesday, said Domenic Powell, one of the Alliance's founders.

Powell declined to provide details on the three, or on how or where they will attempt to re-enter the country, other than to say it will occur Monday. He said the organization doesn't want to divulge information because it wants to see how agents from Customs and Border Protection react when they encounter the three.

""We want them to act in a way as they normally would, as they always do,"" he said.

The activists plan to meet with others who were deported to Mexico or left on their own and will try to return to the U.S. with them, Powell said.

Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Deportations have exploded in recent years, topping 400,000 in 2012, more than double the number seven years earlier. U.S. lawmakers are debating an overhaul to the country's immigration system that could include a fix for immigrants who were brought in illegally as children. Many have grown up in America and have no recollection of life in another country, but they have no legal status in the U.S.

""Whether immigration reform happens or not, they should be here in the U.S. because they live here and this is their home,"" said Powell, whose group in the past has organized sit-ins in politicians' offices over the administration's immigration policies."

This was slightly more than the 28 percent who said President George W. Bush was to blame. An additional 44 percent thought it over but just weren’t sure.

This is a preposterous notion. Everybody knows Barack Obama couldn’t have been responsible for the Katrina response because he was in Indonesia in 2005, learning about his Muslim faith in a madrassa. He had moved to Indonesia directly from his home country of Kenya, stopping in the United States just long enough to fake the moon landing.

When I read a report about the poll on the Talking Points Memo Web site, the first thing that came to mind was the famous campaign-trail quotation from the man who actually was president in 2005: “Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning.”

Evidently, they is not, at least not in Louisiana. Yet ignorance alone does not account for this bizarre finding.

The Katrina result, from the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling, is somewhat suspect because it is from an automated, push-button polling method. Yet the finding, if unscientific, is revealing: It shows that a substantial number of Republican voters will agree to something they know to be false if it puts Obama in a bad light.

The Katrina question is consistent with the many surveys finding an appalling amount of misinformation embraced by the electorate. Seven in 10 Americans believed that Saddam Hussein was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. One in five thought that Obama was Muslim. In another famous poll, Americans were three times more likely to be able to name two of the seven dwarfs than two Supreme Court justices.

Earlier this year, Public Policy Polling found disturbingly high levels of belief in UFOs and aliens, and the believers were bipartisan: Twenty-two percent of Mitt Romney voters said Obama was the Antichrist, and 13 percent of Obama voters said the government allowed the 9/11 attacks to occur.

But Obama’s presidency has provoked a particularly steep rise in the proportion of Republican conspiracy theorists. A Pew poll last year found that 30 percent of Republicans and 34 percent of conservative Republicans thought Obama was Muslim — roughly double than thought so four years earlier. Gallup polling in April 2011 found that 43 percent of Republicans thought Obama was born in another country.

Obama conspiracy theories have flourished in the Deep South, where wealth and educational levels are both low. This makes sense: Where voters are least informed, they are most susceptible to misinformation peddled by talk-radio hosts and the like.

For this reason, voters in reliably Republican states, which tend to be poorer, with lower test scores, are more vulnerable to misinformation. To use one measure, the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress test of eighth-grade reading, all but one of the top 10 states were in Obama’s column in 2012. Of the 19 doing worse than average, 14 were red states.

This is what makes the Katrina question so interesting. Certainly, Louisianans are on the low end of the education rankings, fifth from the bottom in math and third-to-last in reading. But this question got around the ignorance question by asking Louisiana Republicans about a topic they know intimately.

All but the most clueless had to know that Obama, a first-term senator in 2005, was not responsible for the botched storm response that Louisianans experienced up close and personally. It’s a notion so demonstrably false that they wouldn’t have heard anybody arguing for it on Fox News or talk radio. Yet 29 percent of Republican primary voters (the sample size was 274) reflexively endorsed the falsehood.

Why?

“Obama derangement syndrome is running pretty high right now among a certain segment of the Republican base,” Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, told me. “There’s a certain segment of people who say, ‘If you’re going to give me the opportunity to stick it to Obama, I’m going to take it.’ ”

In other words, a large number of that 29 percent who said Obama was responsible for the Katrina response knew that he wasn’t but saw it as a chance to register their displeasure with the president. Obama has driven a large number of Republican voters — Jensen puts it at 15 to 20 percent of the overall electorate — right off their rockers. And to that, there is only one thing to say.

Heckuva job, Barry.

President Barack Obama may have messed with the wrong stage mom.

Kim Kardashian’s momager Kris Jenner used her new talk show platform to slam the President over comments he made about Kim and her boyfriend Kanye West.

Back in July, Obama said in an interview that he feels Kardashian and West have negatively impacted children’s views of the world.

""I do think what's shifted is a notion that the wealthier you are, the more conspicuous consumption you engage in. The more successful you are, the more society should stay out of your way as you pursue the bigger house or the fancier jet or the bigger yacht,"" Obama said.

""Were there things that all of us might have liked to have? Sure. But partly, I think, there also has been a shift in culture. We weren't exposed to things we didn't have in the same way kids these days are. There was not that window into the lifestyles of the rich and famous,"" the president said. ""Kids weren't monitoring every day what Kim Kardashian was wearing, or where Kanye West was going on vacation, and thinking that somehow that was the mark of success.""

Jenner was not too pleased with the President’s analysis… to say the least.

""I bet the president has some friends with 10,000-square-foot houses and you probably wouldn't mind going over there, Mr. President while you were asking them to have a party for you when you were campaigning for dollars to run for president,"" Jenner fired back.

Plus, she noted, the President’s house is pretty nice too.



""I started thinking about her 10,000-square-foot house,"" Jenner said. ""I thought, wow, her job affords her to live in a 10,000-square-foot house. And I think, if I'm not mistaken, that Mr. President's job affords him to live in a 55,000-square-foot house. So basically my house would fit in his entry.""

She added that she did not see how Kardashian and West were ruining kids’ views of success.



""It's really great that people aspire to get a great job... but I wasn't aware that you could only set the bar so high and that we could only dream so big,"" Jenner said after reading the president's quotes. ""I was taught: Dream big, work hard and you could have whatever you wanted.""

26 students from Sandy Hook will sing before kickoff

NFL to fly families to New Orleans later this week



League%2C players have shown extensive support to victims in wake of shooting

NEW ORLEANS — A little more than a month after the tragic mass shooting of 26 students and faculty at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., a group of 26 students from the school will perform America the Beautiful during the Super Bowl XLVII pregame show, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed to USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday.

The league is flying the students and their families down to New Orleans later this week in advance of the performance, which will be broadcast live on CBS shortly before Alicia Keys performs the National Anthem.

The gesture will cap a season in which the league lent its support to the Newtown community via ""S.H.E.S."" stickers on helmets, personal messages on cleats and gloves, moments of silence before games and charitable donations for relief causes, as well other means of emotional support.

The New York Giants welcomed students and families onto the field during their pregame introductions before their Week 17 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. That came a little less than two weeks after Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz paid an emotional visit to the family of 6-year-old Jack Pinto, a Cruz fan who was buried in a No. 80 Giants jersey.

""It was a time where I just wanted to be a positive voice, a positive light in a time where it can be very negative. It was a good time,"" Cruz said of his visit with the Pinto family. ""They're a great family and they are really united right now at this time. It was good to see.""

Tennessee Titans running back Chris Johnson auctioned off his game-worn cleats on which he wrote all of the victims' names and gave the proceeds to the United Way's Sandy Hook School Support Fund.

The Houston Texans were one of the teams that raised money for the victims. Defensive end J.J. Watt tweeted a picture of him and a handful of students on the field the Friday before Houston's Week 16 game against the Indianapolis Colts.

""I just kind of wanted to give them as normal a day as possible, just running around, having fun, going out on the field,"" Watt told USA TODAY Sports. ""We were kicking field goals. They were trying to put it through the uprights. Just be kids. And to see them in a normal setting, having fun and big smiles on their faces was awesome.""

A group of Sandy Hook students recently recorded a version of Over the Rainbow with pop singer Ingrid Michaelson at the home of Connecticut residents Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, with the proceeds going to Newtown Youth Academy and the United Way of Western Connecticut.

http://news.yahoo.com/dream-act-aid-illegal-immigrants-153934615.html,,[],Dream Act would provide aid to illegal immigrants,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Legislation to provide financial aid and other assistance to college-bound illegal immigrants is gaining political support in New York a year after the idea withered in Albany and Washington.

The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act is being pushed by powerful Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. Now, fellow Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Republicans who share control of the state Senate are interested in discussing the bill.

Known as the Dream Act, the bill would provide a way to help poor immigrant families afford college through the state Tuition Assistance Plan and academic assistance programs. It would also create a commission to raise money for scholarships.

""Our immigrant families, like many struggling in these trying economic times, need financial help to achieve their educational goals,"" said Silver. ""Investing in these inspiring students represents an investment in our future.""

Immigrant community leaders and Latino legislators say national and state political trends are helping their cause. In New York, the Latino vote has been courted by Republicans and Democrats.

""We can no longer exclude New York's Dream youth from the promise of higher education afforded their classmates,"" said Chung-Wha Hong, executive director of The New York Immigration Coalition.

New York would join Texas, New Mexico and California in offering financial aid to immigrant children, including illegal immigrants. In New York, lower in-state resident tuition at public colleges has been offered since 2002 to illegal immigrants. A federal Dream Act proposal that would provide federal financial aid to college-bound immigrants and a pathway to citizenship for younger adults has been stalled by Republican opposition in Congress.

New York's proposal is expected to be debated by the Legislature in its budget negotiations and could surface as early as Cuomo's budget presentation on Tuesday if he endorses the idea. The roughly $132 billion budget is forecast to have a deficit of more than $1 billion.

Story continues

Senate Republican spokesman Scott Reif said the GOP conference, which balked last year because of cost, will consider several proposals, including Silver's.

This year, the Senate majority is controlled by an alliance between Republicans and breakaway Democrats that is expected to send more progressive proposals like the Dream Act to floor votes.

Jeffrey Klein, a Bronx-Westchester Democrat who is among the chamber's leaders, is making a top priority of the Dream Act. His proposal would provide $19.5 million a year for the state financial aid from a licensing fee on the proposed expansion of casino gambling. He estimates the fee could generate $28 million to fund the academic assistance programs in the act and create the commission to raise money for scholarships.

""We have a tremendous opportunity to help educate thousands of smart young people from around the world who have moved here to pursue the American dream,"" he said.

Cuomo proposed three upstate casinos in his State of the State address earlier this month, but he wants to devote all the money to schools and the counties and municipalities where casinos are built.

The labor-backed, progressive Fiscal Policy Institute estimates the cost of the Dream Act to be $17 million a year, while the Senate Republicans a year ago estimated the cost at as much as $30 million.

Advocates have estimated the cost at $20 million."

Is Not ‘Surprising’ Enough to Cover,"Many Times readers have been writing to me for several days about a story The Guardian broke last week, describing how the United States routinely shares with Israel intelligence information that the National Security Agency gathers on American citizens.

The story was published five days ago, and by late last week I was already hearing from dozens of readers. One of them was Phyllida Paterson, of Silver Spring, Md., who wrote:

48 hours and there is still nothing in The Times about how the N.S.A. shares U.S. citizens’ raw communications data with Israel. This explosive story ought to be front-page news. Word is spreading and The Times is losing credibility by the hour. Friends of mine who never before believed that newspapers suppressed news are shocked by the evidence before them. Do you really want to push more readers into the arms of The Guardian?

After a weekend in which no mention was made in The Times of the article, I asked the managing editor, Dean Baquet, about it on Monday morning.

He told me that The Times had chosen not to follow the story because its level of significance did not demand it.

“I didn’t think it was a significant or surprising story,” he said. “I think the more energy we put into chasing the small ones, the less time we have to break our own. Not to mention cover the turmoil in Syria.”

So, I asked him, by e-mail, was this essentially a question of reporting resources? After all, The Times could have published an article written by a wire service, like Reuters or The Associated Press.

“I’d say resources and news judgment,” he responded.

In a world with many news outlets, he said: “We can spend all our time matching stories, and not actually covering the news. This one was modest and didn’t feel worth taking someone off greater enterprise.”

The Times has been working on “enterprise” – that is, journalism that it produces itself, usually through investigative digging or other deep reporting – with The Guardian and ProPublica based on leaked information from the N.S.A. Many of the articles in recent months have been broken by The Guardian and The Washington Post, after the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden’s leaking of the information.

The Times published the first of the articles in that collaboration this month, and there is more to come. I’ve written about this several times, most recently saying that it was good to see The Times getting more fully involved in developing these extraordinary revelations and resisting government requests to withhold the story.

I disagree, however, with Mr. Baquet’s conclusion on this one. I find it to be a significant development and something that Times readers should not have to chase around the Web to find out about. They should be able to read it in The Times."

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s move to schedule votes on the first five amendments was rejected by Republicans who opposed the Nevada Democrat’s plan to require 60 votes for passage.

“There is no reason, particularly in this first week, at the beginning of the process, to be blocking our amendments with a 60-vote margin,” said Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who is leading the debate for Republicans. “It really looks like the fix is in, and the bill is rigged to pass basically as it is.”

Senators from both parties have suggested changes that could boost the chance of adding GOP votes needed to pass the legislation, or could erode the fragile bipartisan balance that now exists on the bill.

Many of the Republican amendments take aim at the cornerstone of the compromise: a 13-year pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people living in the United States who entered illegally or have stayed on expired visas.

The GOP proposals would stop immigrants from making the transition to legal status until various border security and immigration enforcement goals are reached. Under the bill as written, a plan to halt 90% of all illegal crossings must be in operation before legal status is set in motion, but a security plan does not have to achieve that target.

Republican senators said the changes were needed to encourage action in the GOP-led House, where the conservative majority is less inclined to provide a route to citizenship.

Democrats argued that these proposals could prevent immigrants from ever gaining legal status. And they said the costs of security measures beyond the $6.5 billion already in the bill could prove unpopular.

“Its cost goes through the roof,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a chief architect of the bill, who was joined on the Senate floor by another coauthor, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), in an unusual display of bipartisanship. “It’s not going to strengthen the bill, but could indeed kill it.”

Democrats, though, also have amendments that could cost votes, including one from Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) that would give gay Americans the same right to obtain visas for their foreign-born spouses as straight couples have.

When the bill was in committee, Leahy shelved the amendment rather than risk losing Republican votes. But his effort got a boost Wednesday from one of the eight senators in the bipartisan group that drafted the bill, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.).

“I think that amendment should get a vote,” Bennet, who is also the chairman of his party’s campaign arm, said at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.

As the senators sparred, advocacy groups fanned out across the capital and online for what is expected to be a lengthy process of moving the bill through Congress.

Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, a Republican, headlined an event hosted by a coalition of religious, law enforcement and small-business leaders — “Bibles, Badges and Business” — that supports the effort to rewrite immigration laws.

Advertisement

The Senate Conservatives Fund, an advocacy organization that opposes the bill, urged voters to call “amnesty Republicans” who voted Tuesday to allow the debate to begin. “If this bill passes, they will be largely responsible,” the fund’s executive director wrote to supporters.

Senate leaders and those involved in the immigration overhaul effort are somewhat divided over how much to alter the bill to gain GOP support.

Advertisement

Some believe they should aim for the biggest vote possible to put pressure on reluctant House Republicans. But others counter that there is no need to give more ground than what is absolutely needed to get the 60 votes required to pass. They say Republicans already have an incentive to support the effort because they need more support from Latino and minority voters.

But even starting the debate has proved daunting, despite an overwhelming vote Tuesday to do so. And exchanges between Republicans and Democrats on the Senate floor Wednesday grew testy.

Leahy, who is leading the floor debate for Democrats, gently reminded senators that any delays could keep them in Washington through the Fourth of July holiday.

“I’d like to start voting on something,” he said.

The actor admitted that he jumped into marriage too young -- at age 27 -- and for the wrong reasons.

""Success when you’re young is really overwhelming. The world felt out of control. And I wanted to stop it from spinning so fast. I thought marriage would decrease my variables or something. I was absolutely wrong,"" he said. ""There was this discovery that the male brain isn’t done until 28. I definitely think my frontal lobe was not finished. I had no business taking vows that would last more than two weeks.""

And although he has previously said that his divorce was ""difficult in ways I couldn't even see at the time,"" he told Elle that the experience taught him a lot and prepared him for the rest of his life.

""Through the failure of my first marriage I learned a lot about myself. Until you know yourself, you don’t know how to share your life with another person,"" he said. ""And this may sound too self help-y, but when I was a young man, I had all these ideas about who I wanted to be. But they weren’t totally rooted in the truth.""

Amusement parks are outdated entertainment. Most of the rides look dangerous because they are dangerous.

I work at an amusement park. We check every harness, every time. We have a great team that walks every roller coaster inch by inch every day.

I feel sorry for the lady who got killed. If she didn't feel safe, why didn't she just get off the ride?

— Karen Hunt

What would it have taken for the attendant to recheck and secure the latch? Ten seconds? This park should be sued. All personnel should be retrained and made to realize that they hold people's lives in their hands.

— Claudia Thibodeau Gibson

The reality is weight likely played a role in this tragedy. Roller coasters can only be made for a certain range of sizes in order to protect riders from the 10-year-old skinny girl up to an adult. Many park workers are high school or college students, and they alone should not be judging safety and fit when a bigger person wants to ride.

— Michelle Welch Yangwel

The woman's death is sad, but it was an accident. You have a greater chance of dying while crossing a street than on a roller coaster. If people stop doing things because of possible dangers, why live at all?

I work at an amusement park, and I'm glad our employees check harnesses even on the ones you won't fly out of. Safety is key.

Bush Presidential Center, a museum and library that contains the historic bric-a-brac of President George W. Bush's White House, is being dedicated today. In keeping with arcane traditions, all of the living presidents of these United States are in attendance to fete the occasion. Speeches have been made, songs sung, pleasantries exchanged, and now all you need to do is Google ""What time does the George W. Bush Presidential Center open on Saturday?"" to proceed with the next step in your lives.

I've not been paying very close attention to the celebration, other than to passively absorb the cable teevee coverage, which all seems to be coming straight from the lips of Dr. Pangloss to my captive ears. (A summary: Gatherings of presidents are neat-o! Look at them! They all seem to be great pals! Everyone is being so nice to President Bush. Nice things are nice!)

But scrolling around the web, I now see that I should have paid more attention, because according to The New York Times' Peter Baker, President Barack Obama faced a very ""delicate task"" at this ceremony. Which surprises me, because as near as I can tell, the George W. Bush Presidential Center is not, say, testing nuclear weapons or promising war with South Korea or threatening to destabilize an entire region. (Though I guess the day is young.)

Per Baker, here's why this library opening is actually a perilous moment for the Obama White House:

It has become an awkward ritual of the modern presidency that the current occupant of the Oval Office is called upon to deliver a generous historical judgment of the previous one. With the opening of each new presidential library, the members of the world’s most exclusive fraternity put aside partisan differences to honor the shared experience of running the nation in difficult times. The task in such moments is especially acute when, as with Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush, the current and previous presidents come from opposing parties and such different sensibilities. The incumbent must hit grace notes without appearing inconsistent with past criticism or, worse, hypocritical. Sometimes a president goes through the motions, dutifully reading what aides put before him. Other times, library dedications have become bonding moments when presidents genuinely grow closer.

See, the problem facing Obama is that in key moments of his life as a politician, he has publicly assessed the Bush legacy as, you know, less than ideal. And now he has to stand in front of Bush at a big celebration and not issue a series of policy indictments. Awkward, right?

At least one person Baker has talked to thinks that the policies on which Bush and Obama agree are the thornier ones:

“He’s never going to say this,” [former Bush speechwriter Marc] Thiessen said, “but if he’s being totally honest, he would say that except for interrogations, he adopted almost the entire Bush counterterrorism policy, some of it voluntarily, some of it involuntarily, but most of it voluntarily.”

Ha, well, Thiessen is absolutely right that Obama has pretty much continued the bulk of Bush's counterterrorism policies and ""unitary executive"" outlook -- and even expanded upon them. I'm bewildered, though, as to why anyone should expect this to come up at a museum dedication. ""Yo, where my fans of targeted extrajudicial killings at? Can I get a what-what?"" doesn't seem like a sentiment Obama is likely to offer, though I suppose it would ""make news.""

And that's really the point, actually. If Baker was willing to be dead honest with his readers about the ""delicate task,"" he wouldn't couch his piece in all this gauze and mummery. He'd simply say, ""The media is going to scrutinize every detail of Obama's brief speech looking for gaffes and 'tells,' which we will then stretch into one-day stories.""

That's really what this is about. Baker's piece is basically a warning that it's up to Obama to keep this non-event from becoming a pseudo-event. Obama has to navigate this little bit of oratory without seeming insincere in his remarks, or saying anything that a pundit-necromancer can spin into a dig, or doing anything funny with his gestures. Because what Baker means to say is that reporters are lying in wait to analyze his body language and pore over his word choice to divine dire meanings in preparation for articles titled, ""Obama did not use the word 'freedom'"" or ""Obama's hip-hop library dedication did not create jobs.""

And what if Obama fails? This is the extraordinary thing, actually. Unlike every other ""delicate task"" that Obama could fail at this day or this week or this year, should Obama's Bush library speech be deemed less-than-satisfactory, the result will be a hot sack of nothing at all. No one's lives will be affected by anything that happens at this library today. There aren't merely low stakes, there are no stakes.

I don't know why it's so hard to just admit this. Anyone who really thinks that this library opening is some sort of perilous moment for any of the attendees or speakers needs to get out more.

She Has Written Two Books', 'Demon Fish', 'Travels Through The Hidden World Of Sharks', 'Fight Club Politics']",White House delayed enacting rules ahead of 2012 election to avoid controversy,"The White House systematically delayed enacting a series of rules on the environment, worker safety and health care to prevent them from becoming points of contention before the 2012 election, according to documents and interviews with current and former administration officials.

Some agency officials were instructed to hold off submitting proposals to the White House for up to a year to ensure that they would not be issued before voters went to the polls, the current and former officials said.

The delays meant that rules were postponed or never issued. The stalled regulations included crucial elements of the Affordable Care Act, what bodies of water deserved federal protection, pollution controls for industrial boilers and limits on dangerous silica exposure in the workplace.

The Obama administration has repeatedly said that any delays until after the election were coincidental and that such decisions were made without regard to politics. But seven current and former administration officials told The Washington Post that the motives behind many of the delays were clearly political, as Obama’s top aides focused on avoiding controversy before his reelection.

The number and scope of delays under Obama went well beyond those of his predecessors, who helped shape rules but did not have the same formalized controls, said current and former officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic.

View Graphic Proposed federal rules face longer review wait times, lower chance of being enacted

Those findings are bolstered by a new report from the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS), an independent agency that advises the federal government on regulatory issues. The report is based on anonymous interviews with more than a dozen senior agency officials who worked with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), which oversees the implementation of federal rules.

The report said internal reviews of proposed regulatory changes “took longer in 2011 and 2012 because of concerns about the agencies issuing costly or controversial rules prior to the November 2012 election.”

Emily Cain, spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, said in a statement that the administration’s “approach to regulatory review is consistent with long-standing precedent across previous administrations and fully adheres” to federal rules.

Administration officials noted that they issued a number of controversial rules during Obama’s first term, including limits on mercury emissions for power plants and Medicaid eligibility criteria under the Affordable Care Act.

“OMB works as expeditiously as possible to review rules, but when it comes to complex rules with significant potential impact, we take the time needed to get them right,” Cain said.

But Ronald White, who directs regulatory policy at the advocacy group Center for Effective Government, said the “overt manipulation of the regulatory review process by a small White House office” raises questions about how the government writes regulations. He said the amount of time it took the White House to review proposed rules was “particularly egregious over the past two years.”

Previous White House operations have weighed in on major rules before they were officially submitted for review. But Jeffrey Holmstead, who headed the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation in the George W. Bush administration, said the effort was not as extensive as the Obama administration’s approach.

“There was no formalized process by which you had to get permission to send them over,” Holmstead said, referring to rules being submitted to the White House.

The recent decision to bring on Democratic strategist John Podesta as a senior White House adviser is likely to accelerate the number of new rules and executive orders, given Podesta’s long-standing support for using executive action to achieve the president’s goals despite congressional opposition.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who chairs the Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, Federal Rights and Agency Action, said he’s concerned about the real-world impact of the postponements in the first term.

“Legal protection delayed is protection denied,” Blumenthal said. “I’ve spoken to officials at the top rungs of the White House power structure and at OIRA and we’re going to hold their feet to the fire, and we’re going to make sure they’re held accountable in a series of hearings.”

The officials interviewed for the ACUS report, whose names were withheld from publication by the study authors, said that starting in 2012 they had to meet with an OIRA desk officer before submitting each significant rule for formal review. They called the sessions “Mother-may-I” meetings, according to the study.

The accounts were echoed by four Obama administration political appointees and three career officials interviewed by The Post.

At the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, a former official said that only two managers had the authority to request a major rule in 2012: then-administrator Lisa P. Jackson and deputy administrator Bob Perciasepe. Perciasepe and OIRA’s director at the time, Cass Sunstein, would have “weekly and sometimes semi-weekly discussions” to discuss rules that affected the economy, one said, because they had political consequences, the person said.

“As we entered the run-up to the election, the word went out the White House was not anxious to review new rules,” the former official said.

Sunstein, who has returned to his post as a Harvard Law School professor, declined to comment.

Several significant EPA proposals were withheld as a result of those meetings, officials said, including a proposal requiring cleaner gasoline and lower-pollution vehicles that had won the support of automakers but angered the oil industry.

That regulation, which would reduce the amount of sulfur in U.S. gasoline by two-thirds and impose fleetwide pollution limits on new vehicles by 2017, was ready in December 2011, said three officials familiar with the proposal. But agency officials were told to wait a year to submit it for review because critics could use it to suggest that the administration was raising gas prices, they said. The EPA issued the proposed rule in March.

Other EPA regulations that were delayed beyond the 2012 election included rules on coal ash disposal, water pollution rules for streams and wetlands, air emissions from industrial boilers and cement kilns, and carbon dioxide limits for existing power plants.

Ross Eisenberg, who serves as vice president of energy and resources policy at the National Association for Manufacturers and has criticized several EPA regulations, noted that in the past year the administration moved ahead with proposals such as the rules on greenhouse gas emissions and boilers.

“The agenda certainly did slow down, but it doesn’t change,” he said.

The administration also was slow to handle rules pertaining to its health-care law. Several key regulations did not come out until after the 2012 election, including one defining what constitutes “essential health benefits” under a health plan and which Americans could qualify for federal subsidies if they opted to enroll in a state or a federal marketplace plan.

The latter focused on what constitutes “affordable.” Treasury proposed a regulation in August 2011 saying an employer plan was affordable as long as the premium for an individual was no more than 9.5 percent of the taxpayer’s household income. Several groups — including labor unions — argued that the proposal did not take into account that the premium for a family plan might be much higher than that standard.

Unions represent a vital part of the Democratic coalition, in part because they help mobilize voters during elections.

The Treasury Department held the proposal back while finalizing all the other tax-credit rules on May 23, 2012. Treasury officials later told those working on the regulation that it could not be published before the election, according to a government official familiar with the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of its sensitive nature. The department made the rule on Feb. 1.

OMB has reduced the length of time that rules are pending this year. The agency has cut the number of rules that were under review for more than 200 days by more than half.

But while the administration is pressing ahead, activists say the delays took a toll. Peg Seminario, director of safety and health for the AFL-CIO, points to an update of the nation’s silica standards proposed Sept. 12 after a long delay. The rule, which would prevent an estimated 688 deaths and 1,585 silica-related illnesses each year, won’t be finalized until 2016.

Jon Devine, a senior lawyer in the Natural Resources Defense Council’s water program, said small streams and wetlands remain vulnerable because of the administration’s foot-dragging. The EPA recently withdrew a proposal to outline what kind of water bodies deserve federal protection that had been pending since February 2012 and announced it would issue a legally binding rule instead.

“What’s disappointing is it leaves waters subject to the existing, weak state of affairs until they get the rule over the final hurdle,” Devine said."

Miriam Carey, who had been diagnosed with postpartum depression and psychosis, told officers who responded to her Stamford apartment on Dec. 10 that President Barack Obama communicated with her and had set up cameras to record her life for national news outlets, police said.

""She stated that President Obama put Stamford in lock down after speaking to her because she is the Prophet of Stamford,"" a police report said.

Carey, a 34-year-old dental hygienist, tried to ram her car through a White House barrier on Oct. 3 before leading police on a chase that ended with her being killed. Her 1-year-old daughter was in the car but escaped serious injury.

Carey's relatives have challenged law enforcement accounts that she was delusional and raised questions over whether police used an appropriate level of force. A lawyer for Carey's sister didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.

Stamford police said in incident reports released Thursday under a public records request that officers had dealt several times with Carey and issues including her belief that she was the subject of a reality television show for the government.

The police visit on Dec. 10 followed a call from Carey's boyfriend, Eric Francis, who said he was afraid for their daughter's safety because Carey wasn't speaking rationally and had taken the girl outside in the cold and rain wearing only pajamas.

""Miriam, she's outside now with the baby without any coat. She's just like physically ... I mean they definitely need to take her somewhere to get some help,"" Francis said in a 911 call. ""She locked herself in the bathroom, and the baby's crying. It's been going on for a week now.""

Police said Carey struggled with officers and was escorted away in handcuffs.

Later that month, Francis called police twice in one night to report that Carey was acting irrationally and having delusions. The officers who responded said they found milk spattered around the apartment and said Carey was acting violently, saying she refused to go to the hospital. They said Carey tried to kick one of them and was taken to an emergency room for an evaluation.

The report said officers were aware of Carey's condition and ""the boyfriend Eric was attempting to care for her and the child the best he can.""

Francis didn't respond to messages left Thursday at a phone number listed for him."

Meet the new coyotes: immigration attorneys and government rule-writers.

According to the clear guidelines published on the Internet and updated by the Obama administration in mid-June, there’s an easier way to cross to gain entrance to the United States: simply step right up to a border crossing and tell the officials that you have a “crediblee fear” of persecution or torture. Use that exact phrasing and you may be able to enter the USA while you await a hearing before an immigration judge…a process that could take years.

As Breitbart News reported yesterday in a story that swept through the Internet, that’s exactly what’s been happening recently with a flood of new asylum requests that seem designed to overwhelm the system.

The Obama Department of Homeland Security led by Janet Napolitano updated the information on their article Questions & Answers: Credible Fear Screening on June 18th, 2013. The article explains that if you claim ‘credible fear of persecution or torture’ that you can seek asylum, and that the process is subject to review.

Individuals Seeking Asylum If you are in expedited removal proceedings and found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture, you may seek asylum before an Immigration Judge (IJ). (See definition for Credible Fear in the “Glossary” link to the right) If the asylum officer does not find that you have a credible fear of persecution or torture, you may request that an IJ review that determination. If you do not request review by the IJ or the IJ agrees with the determination, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) may remove you from the United States.

It defines with a “credible fear” is:

Q. What Is a Credible Fear of Torture? A. A “significant possibility” that you can establish in a hearing before an Immigration Judge that you would be subject to torture if returned to your country (see definition of Torture in the “Glossary” link to the right).

Elsewhere on the DHS site, the government draws a distinction between a “credible” fear and a “reasonable”fear. The credible fear standard appears to be a lower bar, which is likely why it became the key word used by about 200 people a week ago at the Otay crossing near San Diego.

Q. What is a reasonable fear of persecution? A. You credibly establish that there is a “reasonable possibility” you would be persecuted in the future on account of your race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The legal standard is the same standard used to establish a well-founded fear of persecution in an asylum case. You cannot establish a reasonable fear of persecution based only on past persecution without establishing a “reasonable possibility” of future persecution. After a reasonable fear of persecution or torture is found, the Immigration Judge will decide if you are eligible for withholding of removal or deferral of removal. Withholding of removal only provides protection against future persecution and may not be granted without a likelihood of future persecution. However, if you establish past persecution, there is a presumption that your fear of future persecution is reasonable.

The webpage spells out the Catch-22 of the asylum claim: if the asylum officer finds you have a “credible fear,” the next step is a hearing by an immigration judge. However, if the asylum officer does not find you have a “credible fear,” you can then request a appeal hearing by an immigration judge. Either way, you will have a hearing in front of a judge.

This is where the fun begins, because you will wait for your hearing in the United States under some sort of bond. Effectively, you are free to roam about the country for years. This “credible fear” tactic was used by Lizbeth Mateo, Lulu Martinez and the others in the Dream 9 group of illegal alien activists to gain reentry into the Unites States last week.

As the Los Angeles Times reported:

The protest took root in July when Marco Saavedra of New York, Lizbeth Mateo of Los Angeles and Lulu Martinez of Chicago — all young adults brought into the U.S. illegally as children — voluntarily crossed the border into Mexico as a protest of the administration’s deportation policies. They tried to reenter the U.S. on July 22 with six other dreamers who also had been brought to this country illegally as children but had returned to Mexico more than a year ago for various reasons.

The Times points out the claim that the Dream 9 are making that pushes the legal envelope:

A person seeking asylum must establish a well-founded fear of persecution based on “that he or she belongs to a race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” according to Citizenship and Immigration Services guidelines. Some of the Dream 9 are petitioning for asylum, saying that they have family members who have been killed and face death threats themselves. However, many in the Dream 9 claim they should be granted asylum because they belong to a particular group of people — that they are singled out and persecuted in Mexico because they have lived most of their lives in the U.S. They could become targets for criminal organizations that see them as easy prey for extortion and violence, they claim.

It bears repeating: some in the Dream 9 are claiming that they fear persecution in Mexico because they spent time in the United States as illegal aliens. They are prepared to argue that illegal aliens are are a particular social group that is due asylum consideration for having been illegal aliens.

It’s such an outlandish argument that it’s one only a lawyer could love, but it will be years until an immigration judge hears it. In the meantime, Dream 9 activist Lizbeth Matter remains in the United States and begins her first day of law school at Santa Clara University today."

""If you confirm me, I would take office as secretary proud that the Senate is in my blood, but equally proud that so, too, is the Foreign Service,"" the Massachusetts Democrat told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Washington, where all the members greeted him warmly.

By David Alexander

WASHINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Two years of budget cuts and fiscal uncertainty have forced the U.S. Army to greatly curtail spending on training, leaving it with only two combat brigades fully prepared to go to war, the Army's top officer said on Monday.

""Right now, we have in the Army two brigades that are trained. That's it. Two,"" General Ray Odierno told a news conference at the annual conference of the Association of the U.S. Army.

Odierno's comments came as he and Army Secretary John McHugh discussed the impact of the recent U.S. government shutdown as well as across-the-board budget cuts that forced the military to slash spending in March, nearly halfway through its fiscal year.

McHugh and Odierno both appealed to Congress to find a way to give the military more financial predictability so it can plan effectively. McHugh said that with the way the military is currently funded, budgets that are approved today are based on planning that occurred three years earlier.

""You can't run the most important military on the face of the Earth locked into three-year-old budgets,"" McHugh said.

The Army was hit particularly hard by the cuts in March, known as sequestration, because of higher-than-projected Afghanistan war costs and the need to make up those funds from its operations accounts, which include money for training.

""We had to stop training, basically, in the last six months of the year,"" Odierno said.

The ongoing uncertainty with the defense budget could make the situation worse in the fiscal year that began in October. The U.S. government began the year with a shutdown that lasted nearly three weeks and put many federal workers on unpaid leave.

The government resumed operations last week under a deal to fund operations at last year's spending levels and priorities.

The Army chief said he hoped to be able to devote enough money to training this fiscal year to ensure that seven combat brigades are fully ready by June to respond to a conflict. He said the current lack of training was his biggest concern.

A combat brigade team has about 3,500 to 5,000 soldiers.

""The worst-case scenario is you ask me to deploy thousands of soldiers somewhere and we have not properly trained them to go because we simply don't have the dollars and money because of the way sequestration is laid out,"" Odierno said.

Odierno said that while troops going to Afghanistan had been trained, they were ""trained now to do training and advising only. They're not trained to do combat operations ... because that's not their mission in Afghanistan any more.""

The Army grew to about 570,000 uniformed personnel over the past decade. But with the war in Iraq over and the one in Afghanistan winding down, officials plan to reduce the size of the force to 490,000. The number of brigade combat teams is due to fall from a total of 45 currently down to 33.

With the Pentagon increasingly likely to face cuts of nearly $1 trillion over the next decade, the Army could be forced to cut further. A management review this summer conducted by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel indicated the Army might have to shrink by up to 70,000 more soldiers, to 420,000.

McHugh said that if the across-the-board cuts continue in force, essentially all of the Army's programs will be affected.

Odierno also said the Army needs a replacement for its armored fighting vehicles, its workhorse Humvee vehicles and its helicopters. ""The bottom line is we can't afford all of that. And so we're going to have make some tough decisions,"" he said. (Reporting by David Alexander; Editing by Will Dunham)"
http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/ex-san-diego-mayor-who-gambled-away-1-billion-remorseful.html,,[],Ex-San Diego mayor who gambled away $1 billion remorseful,"Maureen O'Connor was the first female mayor of San Diego. But when she left public life, she spent countless hours seated in front of video-poker machines, authorities said.

Over a nine-year period, she wagered an estimated $1 billion, including millions from a charity set up by her late husband, who founded Jack in the Box.

That was the portrait that emerged in court Thursday as the frail former mayor tearfully acknowledged she skimmed more than $2 million from a charity founded by her late husband, Robert O. Peterson.

O'Connor, 66, admitted in a plea deal that she had a gambling addiction and is nearly destitute. Her lawyer, prominent defense attorney Eugene Iredale, suggested that a brain tumor may have impaired her reasoning; he gave reporters copies of her brain scan from a 2011 surgery.

O'Connor's rapidly declining medical condition ""renders it highly improbable — if not impossible — that she could be brought to trial,"" according to court documents filed by federal prosecutors.

""This is a sad day for the city of San Diego,"" said Assistant U.S. Atty. Phillip Halpern. ""Maureen O'Connor was born and raised in this town. She rose from humble origins.... She dedicated much of her life, personal and professional, to improving this city.""

The $1-billion gambling binge stretched from 2000 to 2009, according to court documents. In 2008 and 2009, when the fortune she had inherited was not enough, she began taking from the R.P. Foundation to cover her losses.

Despite being ahead more than $1 billion at one point, O'Connor ""suffered even larger gambling losses,"" according to prosecutors. Her net loss, Iredale said, was about $13 million.

She was considered such a high roller that Las Vegas casinos would send a private jet to pick her up in San Diego. Records show that O'Connor won $100,000 at the Barona casino in San Diego County, while at roughly the same time she needed to cash a $100,000 check at the Bellagio in Las Vegas.

Those who knew the former political doyenne said she had become a recluse, inscrutable even to those she counted as friends.

""I considered myself one of her closest friends, but I would call her and she wouldn't return my call,"" said lawyer Louis Wolfsheimer. ""I didn't want anything from her, just to know how she was. But it looked like she was becoming reclusive.""

In a bargain with prosecutors, O'Connor agreed to repay $2,088,000 to the R.P. Foundation started by Peterson, which supported charities such as City of Hope, San Diego Hospice, and the Alzheimer's Assn., and was driven into insolvency in 2009 by O'Connor's misappropriation of funds, prosecutors said.

""I never meant to hurt the city,"" an emotional O'Connor told reporters gathered at a restaurant close to the federal courthouse. She promised to repay the foundation but declined to answer questions.

Prosecutors agreed to defer prosecution for two years. If O'Connor violates no further laws and makes restitution, the charge of making illegal financial transactions may be dismissed. Under the agreement, O'Connor acknowledged her guilt but was allowed to plead not guilty.

If convicted, O'Connor could have faced a maximum 10-year prison sentence and a fine of up to $250,000.

As part of her plea agreement, O'Connor agreed to settle ""all tax liability resulting from her receipt"" of money from the foundation. She also agreed to seek treatment for her gambling addiction.

Although she is currently without income or a bank account, O'Connor's economic status could reverse if she wins a civil lawsuit filed against a German bank involved in the 2005 purchase of a resort in Mendocino County that O'Connor had purchased in 1998.

O'Connor sold the Heritage House for $19.5 million but has alleged that she was the victim of fraud in the sale. A settlement or victory at trial could provide the millions needed to pay restitution to the foundation and also the tax liabilities involved with the misallocation of its funds.

""No figure, regardless of how much good they've done or how much they've given to charity, can escape criminal liability with impunity,"" said U.S. Atty. Laura Duffy.

One of O'Connor's major worries, defense attorney Iredale said, ""is fear of losing her reputation.""

(CNN) —

In 1980, Nelson Mandela was sitting in a South African prison cell, serving a life sentence.

On the other side of the world, a young college student named Barack Obama was riveted by the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa and the brewing crusade to free the renowned activist.

Little did they know that nearly three decades later, the two would have something in common: They would be the first elected black presidents in their respective countries.

U.S. President Barack Obama has made it no secret that he considers Nelson Mandela one of the greatest influences – if not the greatest – in his life and in the lives of countless others. Throughout his first five years in office, he has repeatedly referenced Mandela, either invoking quotes from the anti-apartheid icon or spreading his messages of freedom and equality.

“We have lost one of the most influential, courageous, and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this earth,” the President said Thursday while marking Mandela’s death. “He no longer belongs to us – he belongs to the ages.”

Left and right use Mandela’s death as opportunity to bash their favorite bogeymen

Answering a ‘call’

At Occidental College in Los Angeles around 1980, Obama first forayed into political activism — a protest against apartheid. It was the beginning of what would become years of studying Mandela’s speeches and writings.

“In the most modest of ways, I was one of those people who tried to answer his call,” he wrote in the forward to Mandela’s 2010 memoir “Conversations with Myself.”

Obama has acknowledged that none of the obstacles he faced growing up compared to those of the victims in South Africa, but Mandela’s “example helped awaken (Obama) to the wider world,” he wrote in the forward.

“Through his choices, Mandela made it clear that we did not have to accept the world as it is – that we could do our part to seek the world as it should be,” he added.

In his own book, “Dreams of my Father,” Obama recalls giving his first public speech, in which he made a plea for the trustees at Occidental to divest from South Africa.

“I really wanted to stay up there, to hear my voice bouncing off the crowd and returning back to me in applause.”

Following his involvement with the demonstrations, Obama began pursuing his interests in public policy, transferring to Columbia University where he dug deep into books and courses about race and social justice. After graduation, he became a community organizer in Chicago.

Making history

When Mandela was released from prison in 1990, Obama was well into law school at Harvard and getting ready to start the next phase of his career.

Mandela’s funeral, farewell plans: a day by day breakdown

That same month, Obama made history of his own — though on a much smaller scale. He became the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review, a story big enough to elicit a headline in the New York Times.

In his interview with the Times, Obama said, ”I personally am interested in pushing a strong minority perspective. I’m fairly opinionated about this,” he said. “But as president of the law review, I have a limited role as only first among equals.”

Four years after graduating law school, and not long after Mandela won a Nobel Peace Prize and was elected president, Obama published “Dreams of my Father” in 1995. In the memoir, he lumped Mandela in with a group of men whose attributes Obama aspired to emulate.

“It was into my father’s image, a black man, son of Africa, that I’d packed all the attributes I sought in myself, the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, DuBois and Mandela,” he wrote.

A year later, Obama was elected to the Illinois state Senate, a path that would set him on a fast-moving track that landed him a spot on the presidential ballot just 12 years later.

’A personal hero’

As Obama made his way up the political ladder, Mandela was continuing to spread his influence, campaigning for justice and human rights around the world. He didn’t seek reelection in 1999 – keeping his promise to serve only one term – and he became intimately involved with AIDS awareness, a disease that killed his son at the age of 55 in 2005.

Obama met Mandela for the first time in 2005. Obama, a senator at the time, was riding to a Washington event when his office called; Mandela was in town and asked to see him. The two men met at the Four Seasons Hotel.

Obama: Mandela was influential, courageous

After that, Obama and Mandela had occasional interactions and conversations, including a phone call from Mandela after Obama was elected president in 2008. Obama called Mandela in 2010 after his great-granddaughter was killed in a car crash.

While Obama considered Mandela a champion, he frequently noted he was not alone in his views about the icon.

“He’s a personal hero, but I don’t think I’m unique in that regard,” he said in Senegal. “I think he’s a hero for the world.”

During his first year in the Oval Office, Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize – a decision that sparked controversy, considering that his career on the world stage was only at its infancy at that point.

Obama was keenly aware of where he stood in line.

“Compared to some of the giants of the history who’ve received this prize, Schweitzer and King, Marshall and Mandela, my accomplishments are slight,” he said in his acceptance speech, also paying tribute to those who were suffering in their respective fights for freedom and justice around the world. “I cannot argue with those who find these men and women – some known, some obscure to all but those they help – to be far more deserving of this honor than I.”

’That’s what brings me back here’

On a trip to Africa this summer, Obama and his family visited Mandela’s cell on Robben Island, a spot Obama visited as a senator in 2006. But this time, he got to bring his two daughters, Sasha and Malia.

Life under apartheid: demeaning, often brutal

“For me to be able to bring my daughters there and teach them the history of that place and this country … that’s a great privilege and a great honor,” Obama told students at the University of Cape Town in June.

With Mandela gravely ill, Obama did not get to visit him during his trip; he met with Mandela’s family instead. While in South Africa, Obama noted the “outpouring of love” for Mandela, saying it spoke to “the yearning for justice and dignity that transcends boundaries of race and class and faith and country.”

“That’s what Nelson Mandela represents,” he said at a town hall-style meeting with young people in Soweto. “That’s what South Africa, at its best, can represent to the world, and that’s what brings me back here.”

Wendy Davis Republican Gov. Rick Perry is expected to sign the bill Critics of the measure say it would shut down most abortion clinics in Texas

Watch Candy Crowley’s exclusive interview with Gov. Rick Perry Sunday 9 a.m. ET on State of the Union

(CNN) —

A bill that places new restrictions on abortion passed the Texas Senate on Friday after days of debate that galvanized activists nationwide.

It was the second attempt by the measure’s supporters to pass the bill in the Senate – it originally failed to gain approval because of a filibuster by Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis.

The Senate voted 19 to 11 to approve the restrictions.

Republican Gov. Rick Perry, who supports the new abortion laws, called the state Legislature back into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill, which passed the Texas House on Wednesday.

The measure bans abortions past 20 weeks of gestation, mandates abortion clinics become ambulatory surgical centers, tightens usage guidelines for the drug RU486 and requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they’re providing such services.

Opinion: It’s the real Texans who count

Critics of the measure say it would shut down most abortion clinics in Texas – denying access to many in rural communities – and force women to seek dangerous back-alley abortions.

The Republican legislators who support it say the bill isn’t about banning abortions, but rather about protecting women’s health.

The special session was marked by loud protests and high-profile voices from both sides of the abortion debate.

Taking a swipe at former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum, who came to Austin to support the bill, Democratic Sen. Kirk Watson made a final appeal to the Republicans to vote no, asking them to: “Take this chance to stop, take this chance to think, take this chance to stop listening to the partisans and failed presidential candidates.”

Cowboy Rick Perry will ride again - in 2016

However, for supporters of the bill such as Sen. Jane Nelson, the bill’s measures are long overdue.

“There is a clear choice in this vote tonight,” she said. “Do we keep the lax standards, do we forgo safeguards, do we ignore the evidence that at 20 weeks we have a child who can feel? Or do we choose life?”

The roars of the crowd in the rotunda were audible throughout the Senate debate and at one point, abortion rights protesters disrupted the proceedings in the Senate gallery. One protester, singing quietly to the chamber, chained herself to a railing in the gallery and brought the session to a brief halt.

The bill makes its way to Perry, who will sign it into law.

“Today the Texas Legislature took its final step in our historic effort to protect life,” Perry said after the bill’s passage. “This legislation builds on the strong and unwavering commitment we have made to defend life and protect women’s health. I am proud of our lawmakers and citizens who tirelessly defended our smallest and most vulnerable Texans and future Texans.”

Planned Parenthood, a leading reproductive health provider, decried the passage and called on voters to throw out the politicians who voted for it.

“If you are angry about what happened in Texas tonight – and what’s happening in other states all around the country – there is something you can do about it,” spokeswoman Dawn Laguens said. “Register to vote, and vote for candidates who will protect women’s access to health care.”

WASHINGTON, April 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama poked fun at the media, his critics and himself on Saturday at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner, a star-filled event where journalists and celebrities mixed with the Washington elite.

Joined at the dinner by his wife, first lady Michelle Obama, the president gently knocked Republicans for not working with him on policy priorities and made a rare reference to his race when urging the opposition party to be cooperative.

""I know Republicans are still sorting out what happened in 2012, but one thing they all agree on is they need to do a better job reaching out to minorities,"" Obama said.

""And look, call me self-centered, but I can think of one minority they could start with. Hello? Think of me as a trial run, you know?"" he said.

Obama, a Democrat and the first black U.S. president, won re-election in November with overwhelming support from minority voters including blacks and Hispanics.

He took a swipe at people who have doubted his religion and accused him of being a radical leftist, while he made light of his graying hair.

""These days, I look in the mirror and I have to admit, I'm not the strapping young Muslim socialist that I used to be,"" Obama said. ""Time passes. You get a little gray.""

The president is a Christian who was born in Hawaii, but he included some material for so-called ""birthers"" who falsely assert he was born abroad.

""I'm also hard at work on plans for the Obama Library, and some have suggested that we put it in my birthplace, but I'd rather keep it in the United States,"" he said.

Obama made light of his own rapid rise to power by comparing himself to Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a Hispanic from Florida who is touted as a potential presidential candidate in 2016.

""One senator who has reached across the aisle recently is Marco Rubio, but I don't know about 2016. I mean, the guy has not even finished a single term in the Senate and he thinks he's ready to be president,"" Obama joked. ""Kids these days.""

Obama began running for president during his first term as a U.S. senator from Illinois.

In a room filled with journalists, the president saved some of his most biting jokes for the press.

""I know CNN has taken some knocks lately, but the fact is I admire their commitment to cover all sides of a story, just in case one of them happens to be accurate,"" he said, drawing applause.

""Some of my former advisors have switched over to the dark side. For example, David Axelrod now works for MSNBC, which is a nice change of pace since MSNBC used to work for David Axelrod.""

Axelrod was the chief strategist for Obama's re-election campaign and a former White House adviser. MSNBC is considered to be a liberal-leaning television network.

Obama also made light of his wife's new bangs, drawing laughter from her when he showed mock pictures of himself with the same hairdo. (Additional reporting by Elwina Nawaguna and Peter Cooney; Editing by Paul Simao)"

Boeing’s warning came in response to comments by the local president for the group, Tom Wroblewski, who tore up a copy of the proposed deal at the end of a union meeting Thursday night.

According to The Seattle Times, Mr. Wroblewski told union members that he would seek to have the proposal withdrawn. Workers had criticized parts of the eight-year contract extension during the meeting, including plans to limit pay raises to 1 percent every other year."

http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0163cjt,,[],"BBC Africa Debate, Can Africa set the science agenda?","This edition of the BBC Africa Debate comes from Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, where the BBC is hosting a science festival. We bring together scientists from across Africa and around the world to consider the state of science on the continent. With the majority of funding coming from outside the continent, are African scientists in control of their own research agendas? Is African science meeting Africa’s needs – and can it be used to drive growth on the continent? One Ghanaian doctor cites the fact that many children who were admitted with cancer come from a particular area of the country, but there doesn’t appear to be any effort to research the reasons why.

Funding bodies themselves insist that it is local partners who design their projects. Sir John Savill, Chief Executive of the Medical Research Council in the UK, insists that his organisation has a ""grass roots up"" approach, which results in researchers based in Africa setting the local MRC agenda. Some African countries have tried to move away from the old reliance on outside funding – although not always to great effect. Uganda's government chose not to renew a low-interest science loan from the World Bank in 2010, for example, pledging to provide the money itself. But the money was not allocated in that year’s budget. The Ugandan government has also so far failed to establish a promised science ministry.

Ghanaian-born Nasa scientist Dr Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu, believes that scientists in Africa need to be pragmatic. If it wasn't for foreign funding, there would be no research happening on the continent at all. At least students are trained, labs are built and infrastructure is put in place. Some will argue that, when much of the continent's population is still living without basic necessities, is it right for vast amounts of money to be spent on experiments that may never yield tangible results for years, or even decades?

We Respond.,"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker made himself a household name when in 2011 he worked with his legislative allies to strip collective bargaining rights from public workers. At the time he said this would help the state create jobs, but later told his donors it was part of a “divide and conquer” strategy to destroy his opposition.

Over the next two and a half years, Gov. Walker worked around the clock to make life harder for Wisconsin workers: killing the state earned income tax credit, using relief for foreclosure fraud victims to plug holes in his budget, cutting the state’s BadgerCare health insurance program, shifting funds from public to private education, banning cities and towns from making their own sick days ordinances, and attempting to end same-day voter registration and enact strict voter ID laws.

He is now making a name for himself by passing the back for his state’s job crisis, arresting people for singing, and for wanting really badly to be president.

So when Gov. Scott Walker, who has worked around the clock to destroy the labor movement in Wisconsin, tweeted “Happy Labor Day!” yesterday, the responses came fast and uniformly furious.

At Working America, we hypothesized that maybe Gov. Walker was confused about what Labor Day was. Labor Day celebrates all that has been accomplished by workers who have banded together for a better life; accomplishments like fair wages, sick days, health care, voting rights, and corporate accountability. Accomplishments that Gov. Walker has made a career of rolling back.

We decided to respond to Gov. Walker’s Labor Day tweet by borrowing a phrase from The Princess Bride’s Inigo Montoya. Retweet if you agree.

http://news.yahoo.com/ex-navy-seal-remembered-servant-others-232814773.html,,[],Ex-Navy SEAL remembered as servant to others,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — As military service members carried the flag-draped coffin out of Cowboys Stadium, the sounds of bagpipes echoed and people saluted Chris Kyle, an ex-Navy SEAL sniper who dedicated his post-military career to helping other veterans.

Widow Taya Kyle spoke through tears earlier, surrounded by her husband's military friends, her voice trembling as she described to a crowd of thousands what ""my slow-talking Texas man"" had meant to his family, friends and country.

""Chris, there isn't enough time to tell you everything you mean to me and everything you taught me,"" the widow said Monday during a two-hour memorial service for Kyle, a decorated sniper and best-selling author who was slain earlier this month at a gun range.

She described herself as broken but said the family will ""put one foot in front of the other"" to get through their grief. She told her two children that they will remember Kyle's silly side, Texas twang and prayers they prayed together.

Nearly 7,000 people, including former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and her husband, attended the service. Dozens of military personnel and others were seated in front of the podium near the Dallas Cowboys' star at midfield, where Kyle's coffin was placed at the beginning.

His friends and fellow service members told mourners that Kyle was more than an excellent sniper feared by U.S. enemies — he was a dedicated family man known for his sense of humor, compassion, selflessness and generosity. Kyle completed four tours of duty in Iraq and wrote the best-selling book ""American Sniper.""

Some who served with him said that Kyle was a man, myth and legend because he would do anything for his fellow SEALs.

Childhood friends recalled his mischievous side, and one said he and Kyle played with BB guns as kids — and Kyle ""wasn't a good shot back then.""

Bo French, an executive at Craft International, the security training company Kyle started after he left the Navy, told those gathered that Kyle had a passion for helping others. Kyle also founded a nonprofit, FITCO Cares, that provides at-home fitness equipment for emotionally and physically wounded veterans.

Story continues

Pictures of Kyle with his family and SEALs were shown on a large screen in the stadium. The back page of the memorial service program included copies of handwritten notes from Kyle's young kids: ""I will miss your heart. I will love you even if you died"" from his daughter, and ""I miss you a lot. One of the best things that has happened to me is you"" from his son. The children signed them ""Baby Girl"" and ""Bubba.""

After Taya Kyle's eulogy, country singer Randy Travis sang ""Whisper My Name,"" which he said Taya Kyle had told him was a meaningful song for the couple, and ""Amazing Grace.""

Kyle's funeral service is scheduled for Tuesday. He will be buried at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin after a 200-mile funeral procession.

Iraq War veteran Eddie Ray Routh, 25, has been charged in the Feb. 2 killings of Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield at a North Texas gun range. Routh is being held in Erath County on $3 million bond.

Taya Kyle spoke kindly of Littlefield during the service Monday, saying he was the ""effortless, no expectations"" friend that her husband needed.

Many said before Monday's service that they didn't know the 38-year-old Chris Kyle. Air Force Master Sgt. Kevin Phillips said he came from his Fort Worth home to honor ""a brother in arms.""

Esperanza Meza, who is in the Texas State Guard, said: ""I'm here to pay my respects to him, and also for all of those who have fallen while serving this country.""

Travis Cox, director of FITCO Cares, has said the men apparently had been helping Routh work through post-traumatic stress disorder.

Kyle, Littlefield and Routh arrived together at the Rough Creek Lodge shooting range, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth, authorities say. Routh later fled in Kyle's truck and went to his sister's home.

According to a search warrant, Routh told his sister and brother-in-law that the men ""were out shooting target practice and he couldn't trust them so he killed them before they could kill him."" Routh's sister called the police, describing her brother as ""psychotic."" Routh was arrested after a short police chase.

Routh's brother-in-law told authorities that Routh had recently been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

One of Routh's attorneys, J. Warren St. John, said his client had been released from the Dallas Veterans Affairs hospital against his family's wishes just two days before the shootings.

Littlefield's funeral was held Friday in Midlothian. Afterward, Littlefield's relatives said the outing with Routh was intended to be therapeutic."

Obamas and Clintons visit Kennedy grave site at Arlington National Cemetery

WASHINGTON — President Obama paid tribute Wednesday to Democratic predecessor Bill Clinton, and both of them honored a presidential icon, John F. Kennedy.

As a bugler played taps, Obama, Clinton and spouses Michelle Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton stood with hands over hearts before the eternal flame that illuminates Kennedy's grave at Arlington National Cemetery.

The solemn ceremony and other events began a series of memorials across the nation leading into Friday, the 50th anniversary of the assassination that transformed American politics and culture.

Before the Arlington visit, Obama awarded Clinton and 15 other Americans the Presidential Medal of Freedom, created 50 years ago by President Kennedy. Other recipients included television legend Oprah Winfrey, country music artist Loretta Lynn, women's rights leader Gloria Steinem,

baseball great Ernie Banks and the late pioneering astronaut Sally Ride.

""These are the men and women who in their extraordinary lives remind us all of the beauty of the human spirit, the values that define us as Americans, the potential that lives inside of all of us,"" Obama said during a ceremony at the White House, echoing Kennedy's reasons for establishing the award.

""John F. Kennedy stands for posterity as he did in life — young and bold and daring,"" Obama said later in the day at a dinner honoring current and former Medal of Freedom recipients. ""He stays with us in our imagination not because he left us too soon, but because he embodied the character of the people that he led.""

The delegation to the Kennedy grave site in Arlington included members of the Kennedy family, as well as a former official who may soon seek the presidency herself: former first lady and secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

At the site, Obama and Bill Clinton escorted Ethel Kennedy, widow of slain JFK brother Robert F. Kennedy. Each president held one of her hands and helped her climb some stairs.

During a wordless ceremony on a sunny but chilly day, the Obamas and the Clintons placed a wreath before the twin graves of President Kennedy and wife Jacqueline.

Jack Schlossberg, a grandson of President Kennedy, greeted dignitaries as they arrived at the grave site.

The presidential couples later greeted members of the family. ""Good to see you,"" Obama told one group amid smiles and hugs. The president and first lady also read some of the inscriptions etched into a memorial at the grave site.

The Obamas and the Clintons rode to the cemetery in the same limousine; they left separately.

Months before his death, Kennedy had visited Arlington House at the cemetery, a spot just above his future grave. He reputedly said, ""I could stay here forever.""

Jacqueline Kennedy made the decision to put the eternal flame at her husband's resting place.

Like their presidential predecessors, Obama and Clinton have often paid homage to the memory of the charismatic Kennedy.

The Kennedy family gave Obama crucial support during his 2008 presidential campaign. The endorsement of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., the late president's brother, helped Obama win that year's Democratic primary race over Hillary Clinton. Edward Kennedy is also buried at the Arlington grave site.

This year, Obama made Caroline Kennedy, JFK's daughter, the ambassador to Japan.

During a June 19 speech in Berlin — site of of Kennedy's ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" speech of 1963, just months before his death — Obama said his predecessor's words ""are timeless because they call upon us to care more about things than just our own self-comfort, about our own city, about our own country.""

Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign featured pictures of him as a 16-year-old member of Boys Nation shaking hands with President Kennedy in 1963, casting it as a symbolic passing of the torch.

Even Republican presidents have hailed the Kennedy mystique. President Reagan, for example, cited JFK's support for tax cuts.

Obama's Republican predecessor, George W. Bush, cultivated Edward Kennedy's support on education and other issues. Bush invited Edward Kennedy and members of his family to the screening of a film about JFK's handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

During the Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony in the East Room, Obama praised Clinton for a journey that took him from a small town in Arkansas to the White House and cited his predecessor's post-presidential humanitarian work, saying, ""He doesn't stop.""

The current president also thanked Clinton for his ""advice and counsel ... on and off the golf course.""

Referencing Hillary Clinton, Obama joked to the former president: ""Of course, I am most grateful for his patience during the endless travels of my secretary of State.""

Other Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients hailed from the worlds of politics, entertainment, science, civil rights, and the arts.

Winfrey, whose talk show transformed television interviews, reached ""the pinnacle of the entertainment universe,"" Obama said of his fellow Chicagoan and longtime political supporter.

""In more than 4,500 episodes of her show, her message was always, 'you can,'"" Obama said.

In addition to Clinton, Obama honored other political leaders. He hailed the ""visionary work"" of former senator Richard Lugar, R-Ind., to reduce global stockpiles of nuclear weapons, describing it as the ""destruction of Cold War arsenals.""

The late Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, lost an arm and earned a Medal of Honor in World War II, and went on to become the second-longest-serving senator in U.S. history.

Civil and human rights played a large role in the Medal of Freedom ceremony.

Steinem, the feminist who began professional life as a journalist, ""awakened a vast and often skeptical public to problems like domestic violence, the lack of affordable child care, (and) unfair hiring practices,"" Obama said.

The Rev. C.T. Vivian, a close adviser to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., was ""among the first to be in on the action"" during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, from lunch counters to freedom rides to Selma, Obama said.

Another civil rights activist, the late Bayard Rustin, organized the 1963 March on Washington. Obama pointed out that history has sometimes denied Rustin due credit because he was an openly gay man.

Judge Patricia Wald was the first woman to sit on the U.S.Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.

Lynn, often called the queen of country music, ""gave voice to a generation, singing what no one wanted to talk about and saying what no one wanted to think about,"" Obama said. She is, literally, a Coal Miner's Daughter, the title of a 1980 biographical film about her life.

Jazz legend Arturo Sandoval learned to play the trumpet in communist Cuba, where listening to music on the Voice of America could be dangerous, Obama said.

Obama noted that baseball Hall of Famer Ernie Banks — ""Mr. Cub"" — came up through the old Negro League, joined the Chicago Cubs as their first African-American player, and became famous for his infectious enthusiasm as well as his 512 home runs.

Former University of North Carolina basketball coach Dean Smith — a hoops innovator, winner of 879 games — helped integrate a restaurant and neighborhood in Chapel Hill and recruited the school's first African-American athlete during the 1960s, the president said.

Science was also honored at the Medal of Freedom ceremony.

Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman ""basically invented the study of human decision making,"" Obama said.

Environmental scientist Mario Molina, another Nobel Prize winner, has defined the dangers of carbon emissions, the president said.

Another honoree had a direct connection to John Kennedy: Ben Bradlee was a neighbor of JFK's and covered his presidency for Newsweek magazine. Bradlee later was editor of The Washington Post, making it a national political force through coverage of the Pentagon Papers and Watergate."

A letter was mailed to Mississippi Republican Sen. Roger Wicker's office containing the toxic substance ricin, forcing the temporary closure of a Senate post office and prompting a federal investigation.

The letter was intercepted at an off-site location on Tuesday morning and was later tested positive for ricin, a highly poisonous chemical that can be fatal to humans if inhaled. While the letter did not reach Wicker's office, the discovery prompted the off-site center to be shut down. There is no evidence of contamination in the on-site post office.

Wicker's office released a statement on Tuesday evening from the senator in which he did not specifically mention the letter or its contents. He said the matter was ""part of an ongoing investigation"" by the U.S. Capitol police and the FBI.

""I want to thank our law enforcement officials for their hard work and diligence in keeping those of us who work in the Capitol complex safe. Gayle [my wife] and I appreciate everyone’s thoughts and prayers,"" Wicker said.

Also Tuesday evening, the Senate sergeant-at-arms, Terrance Gainer, sent an email to senior Senate staff saying the letter had been postmarked from Memphis, Tenn., but had no unusual identifying marks. He urged staffers to be ""vigilant in their mail handling processes for ALL mailings.""

Senators first learned of the letter at a private security briefing about the Boston Marathon bombings, but there is no indication, senators said, that the poisonous letter was connected to Monday's attacks.

""We don't know enough about Boston to even speculate,"" said Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin after the briefing.

Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill said the sender was a person who mailed frequent letters to Capitol Hill. Lawmakers' state offices around the country are currently being notified about the incident.

All mail to the Capitol building is processed and tested in a facility off-site before reaching the destination as a precaution against incidents like this. Several senators interviewed said they were not concerned about a broader attempt to target them.

Story continues

""It was caught in a way that did no damage, so I'm not excessively concerned about it,"" said Michigan Democratic Sen. Carl Levin. ""They've taken strong steps to avoid any problem.""

Letters containing the lethal substance anthrax were sent to Vermont Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy and then-Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle exactly one week after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. Several news organizations were sent anthrax-laced mail as well. Five people were killed and 17 were injured after inhaling the substance.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-issues-pardons-17-minor-offenses-223346342--politics.html,,[],Obama issues pardons to 17 for minor offenses,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama on Friday issued pardons for 17 people, largely for minor offenses.

Those receiving pardons came from 13 states and had been sentenced for crimes that included falsely altering a money order, unauthorized acquisition of food stamps, drug violations, and possession of an unregistered firearm.

No one well-known was on the list released by the White House. Some of the crimes drew light penalties in the first place — such as a North Carolina woman sentenced to two years' probation and 100 hours of community service for distributing satellite cable decryption devices.

A dozen of the 17 had been placed on probation. The other five had been sentenced to prison terms ranging from 54 days to five years. For those placed on probation, the length ranged from one year to five years.

The White House offered no details on why these particular people were selected by Obama, who has issued relatively few pardons since taking office.

He granted his first pardons in December 2010, to nine people convicted of such offenses as drug possession, counterfeiting and mutilating coins. He also issued two separate batches of pardons in 2011, including eight people in May for relatively minor offenses and five people that November.

Those pardoned Friday by Obama:

— Robert Leroy Bebee of Rockville, Md., sentenced to two years' probation for concealing a felony or concealing information about a felony.

— James Anthony Bordinaro of Gloucester, Mass., sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment, three years supervised release and a $55,000 fine for conspiracy to restrain, suppress and eliminate competition in violation of the Sherman Act and conspiracy to submit false statements.

— Kelli Elisabeth Collins of Harrison, Ark., sentenced to five years' probation for aiding and abetting a wire fraud.

—Edwin Hardy Futch Jr., of Pembroke, Ga., sentenced to five years' probation and $2,399.72 restitution for theft from an interstate shipment.

By Jennifer Ablan

NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - George Soros, the 83-year-old billionaire investor, philanthropist and active supporter of liberal political causes, married health care and education consultant Tamiko Bolton on Saturday afternoon.

Soros and Bolton, 42, exchanged vows in a small ceremony at his Bedford, New York, estate, which Soros bought in 2003 from ""Jurassic Park"" author Michael Crichton. Federal judge Kimba Wood officiated at the non-denominational wedding, which was attended by members of the couple's families, including the groom's five children, a source familiar with the wedding told Reuters on Saturday.

For Soros, whose net worth is $20 billion according to Forbes, this will be his third marriage. It is Bolton's second.

Soros put a Graff wedding band on Bolton's finger during the half-hour ceremony, according to the source.

The exchange of vows will be followed by a reception, which begins at 4:30 p.m, with more than 500 guests at the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts, the Westchester County complex known for its Italian Renaissance-inspired buildings and lush gardens.

Among the guests at the various events are World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and some foreign leaders, including Hendrik Toomas Ilves, president of Estonia; Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, president of Liberia; and Edi Rama, prime minister of Albania.

Also expected to attend are fellow titans of the hedge fund world, Paul Tudor Jones and Julian Robertson. From the U.S. political realm those invited include Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi of California and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, both Democrats.

On Friday night, the couple held a reception for 300 guests at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan for a preview of the new exhibition of works by Belgian painter Rene Magritte - ""Magritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926-1938.""

The honeymoon plans were not immediately disclosed.

Soros, who established one of the first hedge funds in 1969 and is probably best known for famously betting against the British pound in 1992, met Bolton at a dinner party in 2008. Their engagement was announced in August 2012.

Bolton, who was raised in California, is the daughter of a nurse and a retired naval officer. She graduated from the University of Utah and holds an MBA from the University of Miami.

Bolton has been a consultant and entrepreneur working in the fields of health and education. She started an Internet-based dietary supplement and vitamin sales company, and her most recent project was advising on development of a web-based yoga education platform.

The bride's dress was designed by U.S.-based, Lebanon-born Reem Acra, whose gowns have been worn on the red carpet by many stars, including Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Lopez.

The reception on Saturday night will feature Hungarian composer and conductor Iván Fischer, a family friend, who created a new arrangement for the occasion. It will be presented with the Budapest Festival Orchestra. Also, Cape Verdean Mayra Andrade will sing with the Harris Lane Orchestra. Andrade and Roma ensemble Via Romen will perform at a Sunday brunch.

In lieu of gifts, the couple has asked that donations be made to charities including Global Witness, Harlem Children's Zone, National Dance Institute, Planned Parenthood and the Roma Education Fund."

After taxes, the $650,000 winnings will add to a $125,000 annuity they've been receiving since their first lottery win back in 1995. But Diana says they're not done yet.

But the Carmichaels aren't alone in celebrating their second lottery win recently. A South Carolina man doubled down on his second jackpot in four months earlier this year. A few days later, another lucky twosome won the lottery twice in one day.

WASHINGTON — An off-white jacket. A casual long-sleeve shirt. A turquoise- and-orange wool blanket. A wallet that contains a Social Security card and family snapshots.

While these relics from the early '60s sound like everyday items, they are priceless pieces of history tied to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Beginning April 12, visitors to the Newseum in the nation's capital will have the rare chance to view these never-before-displayed artifacts belonging to Lee Harvey Oswald, the presumed gunman, as part of an exhibit marking the 50th anniversary of JFK's death. Oswald, who wore the shirt and carried the wallet when he was arrested on Nov. 22, 1963, in Dallas, was himself shot and killed two days later by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby, a crime that was caught live on TV.

The jacket was found at a gas station near the Texas Theater, where Oswald was captured. Oswald's rifle, which was kept wrapped in the blanket in a friend's garage, was found at the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas shortly after JFK was shot.

""This is a pretty incredible opportunity to work with the National Archives and be able to display these pieces,"" says Carrie Christoffersen, Newseum curator and director of collections.

Christoffersen says the purpose of ""Three Shots Were Fired,"" an exhibit of more than 100 artifacts, including the first UPI report about the attack on the presidential motorcade, ""is to tell the story of how news media responded and how it fulfilled its responsibility to the public. It was a unique time in American and journalism history. The shooting led to unprecedented TV coverage over four days on the networks commercial-free. This was at a time when nightly newscasts had only just expanded from 15 minutes to a half-hour.""

A collection of photos, ""Creating Camelot: The Kennedy Photography of Jacques Lowe,"" as well as a Newseum-produced film, A Thousand Days, will bring to life the youthful glamour that the first family brought to the White House, as well as newsworthy moments of JFK's short presidency.

The exhibit, which runs through Jan. 5, 2014, will include an interactive feature that allows visitors of all ages to share the defining ""JFK moment'' in their life, whether it was the bombing at Pearl Harbor or memories of 9/11."

The fugitive, believed to be holed up in the transit zone of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, was supported by 55 percent of those surveyed by researchers at Quinnipiac University, Connecticut.

About one-third (34 percent) of those polled said they believed Snowden had betrayed his country.

Of those who backed his decision to leak the contents of classified documents in order to expose the extent of government-sanctioned surveillance, there was equal representation from almost every gender, social group and political persuasion.

The remaining 11 percent did not have an opinion.

Peter Brown, assistant director of the school’s Polling Institute said the result illustrated public shock at the scope of intelligence-gathering by government agencies seeking to prevent future terror attacks.

""The fact that there is little difference now along party lines about the overall anti- terrorism effort and civil liberties and about Snowden is in itself unusual in a country sharply divided along political lines about almost everything,” he said.

“Moreover, the verdict that Snowden is not a traitor goes against almost the unified view of the nation's political establishment.""

Researchers asked 2,014 American voters: ""Do you regard Edward Snowden, the national security consultant who released information to the media about the phone scanning program, as more of a traitor, or more of a whistle-blower?""

Brown added: ""Americans' views on anti-terrorism efforts are complicated. They see the threat from terrorism as real and worth defending against, but they have a sense that their privacy is being invaded and they are not happy about it at all.""

Venezuela is the ""most likely"" asylum choice for former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, the journalist who published the contents of the self-professed leaker's classified documents said Tuesday.

But his travel problems could take time to resolve as his U.S. passport has been canceled and U.S. allies may deny airspace to any flight on which he is believed to be traveling.

LOUISVILLE, Kentucky, Nov 20 (Reuters) - After a string of setbacks and losses, the insurgent Tea Party movement is at a crossroads, between learning to live within the Republican Party or pursuing its fight against those it sees as not conservative enough.

The choice is an easy one for Tea Party activists, who vow to keep up their campaign to vote out of office those Republican politicians they say have betrayed the tenets of the conservative cause - smaller government and less federal spending and taxes.

Voters nationally blame October's partial government shutdown on Republicans, and particularly the Tea Party, which lost elections earlier this month in Virginia and Alabama.

With important mid-term congressional elections coming in November 2014, the Tea Party is under pressure from within the Republican Party to call off their insurgency and focus on the end game of defeating Democrats, rather than bruising primaries to clobber Republicans, some of whom could be in close contests to keep their seats.

Republican strategist Ford O'Connell said the Tea Party movement needs to decide its long-term strategy.

""Are they interested in toppling Republicans or winning elections? If they don't win some elections they're probably going to die on the vine,"" O'Connell said.

A series of interviews with Tea Party activists preparing for 2014, mainly in southern states, produced a clear consensus of the path forward, with possibly unsettling implications for Republican incumbents.

While mainstream Republicans nationally see the crisis of President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul as their ticket to success next November, Tea Party activists see Republican leaders' decision to end the shutdown in October as a betrayal of the fight over healthcare reform, best met with primary challenges next spring.

""The Tea Party won the 2010 election for the Republicans,"" said Debbie Dooley of the Atlanta Tea Party. ""We took a back seat in 2012 and the Republicans lost. We're not going to make the same mistake in 2014.""

The national criticism of the movement is failing to change many minds in the movement, either.

""If we have to get hurt in the polls in order to save the country from financial ruin, so be it,"" said Ben Cunningham, a long-time conservative activist in Tennessee involved in efforts to find a challenger for Senator Lamar Alexander.

Tea Party-backed primary challengers are running in South Carolina against Senator Lindsey Graham, a frequent target of Tea Party ire for his ability to compromise, and Alexander in Tennessee. There are also right-wing challenges to Senator Pat Roberts in Kansas and Thad Cochran in Mississippi. The Senate seat in Georgia left open by the impending retirement of Saxby Chambliss has a field of candidates vying for the mantle of most conservative.

For many grassroots conservatives the main target is Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. McConnell is well known for vowing to make Obama a one-term president, but his record of brokering deals with Obama has incensed the Tea Party.

""There are many important races in 2014 that deserve attention,"" said David Adams, president of Kentucky Citizens Judicial, a group suing Kentucky's Democratic Governor Steve Beshear over the implementation of Obama's health care law. ""But in terms of taking off the head of the snake, Kentucky is it.""

In Kentucky and elsewhere, some of the Tea Party's challenges are perennial: they lack name recognition, the benefits of incumbency, and their rivals raise millions of dollars to their thousands.

What Tea Party activists have on their side is cheap get-out-the-vote technology, motivated volunteers, and enough past success to provide a roadmap for would-be candidates. In Kentucky, for instance, many Tea Partiers united early around a candidate, and started campaigning early, following the lead of Ted Cruz of Texas, who came from behind to win a U.S. Senate seat.

BACKING ONE HORSE

A national Quinnipiac University poll published Nov. 13 found 47 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view of the Tea Party, the highest percentage yet. Other national polls have also shown a drop in popularity for the movement.

But unlike the Republican Party's national structure, the Tea Party has become an increasingly regional phenomenon, at its strongest in Republican dominated states like Georgia or in a few battleground states like Ohio.

Of 80 Republican House members who wrote to John Boehner in August arguing the House Speaker should threaten a shutdown over the healthcare law known as Obamacare, 13 represent districts in Kentucky, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.

""There are parts of the country geographically and sociologically that continue to feed the Tea Party phenomenon,"" said James Henson, a politics professor at the University of Texas in Austin. ""I'd be surprised if recruitment wasn't up.""

While some senior Republicans in the U.S. Senate say House Republicans and senators Cruz and Mike Lee of Utah fought a useless, self-punishing fight over the government shutdown, conservatives say were close to victory undermining Obamacare when moderate Republicans undermined them.

The Tea Party also pins the narrow Nov. 5 defeat of conservative Ken Cuccinelli in Virginia's gubernatorial race on the refusal of the Republican establishment to back him.

The challenge is daunting in Kentucky, Tennessee and South Carolina where McConnell, Alexander and Graham all have a big advantage in raising money. McConnell, for instance, had $10 million cash on hand at the end of September. His opponent, moderately wealthy businessman Matt Bevin, had raised less than $900,000, more than two thirds of which was his own money.

McConnell had a 33 point lead over Bevin in one poll. The Senator has focused his campaign on Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes, with whom he was tied, according to polling.

Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia Center for Politics said it is hard to see the challengers in Kentucky, Tennessee or South Carolina being able to win, but that Cruz's long slog ahead of the Texas primary showed a challenge could develop late.

""The best you could say at the moment is the jury is out,"" he said.

INDIANA PLAYBOOK

Tea Party activists in Kentucky and Tennessee have carefully studied the playbook adopted by activists in Indiana in their successful bid to oust former Republican Senator Richard ""Dick"" Lugar in 2012. The key to primary victory involved getting behind a single challenger in state treasurer Richard Mourdock and going door to door for months ahead of the election -- well ahead of traditional campaigns.

Many Tea Party activists have rallied behind Bevin in Kentucky. Speaking at his home in Louisville in October, Bevin said he would have favored the government shutdown. McConnell's team says voters will favor politicians who get things done.

Bevin said his race against McConnell would be won ""from the bottom up"" by grassroots activists and compared his opponent to the emperor with no clothes, lacking real Republican values.

""If this naked emperor can be exposed, any one of them can be exposed. If we can do this at the ballot box, none of them are safe and we can send them home one at a time,"" he said, invoking other Tea Party challenges gearing up.

Activists are already going door to door for the primary election in May, using get-out-the-vote software provided free of charge by Kansas-based group the Madison Project, and Tea Partiers in Tennessee are using similar technology.

""The only energy in the Republican Party at the moment lies in the Tea Party,"" said Randy Keller of the Bowling Green Southern Kentucky Tea Party, a conclusion some political analysts reach as well.

""The lack of a ground game is a particular point of vulnerability for Republicans like Mitch McConnell,"" said Steven Schier, a politics professor at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. ""The question is can they compete at the ground level?""

BOON FOR DEMOCRATS?

With bruising primary contests likely in key states, one question is will the winner be able to win the general election.

In Indiana's primary last year, Mourdock beat Lugar but lost in the general election in a reliably Republican state.

In Kentucky's 2011 gubernatorial election, the candidate backed by Tea Party activists lost in a hard-fought primary, and many frustrated conservatives stayed home on election day, contributing to the re-election of Democrat Beshear.

The Bowling Green Southern Kentucky Tea Party's Keller is no fan of McConnell's but he worries that widespread dislike for McConnell among conservatives could favor the Democratic candidate on election day in 2014.

""I would really rather not see that happen because even a flawed Republican would be better than a Democrat,"" he said. (Editing by David Lindsey, Peter Henderson and Grant McCool)"

The segment on Friday at noon that referred to two of the pilots as “Captain Sum Ting Wong,” and “Wi Tu Lo,” has gone viral and drawn heavy criticism on the Internet.

“Apologies to all upset by a story on Noon News. A serious mistake was made @KTVU,” anchorwoman Tori Campbell wrote on Twitter. “My thoughts are w/ victims of Flt 214 & families.”

In a statement read on KTVU-TV on Friday night, anchor Frank Somerville said the station made several mistakes.

Somerville did not say how exactly the station got the names.

But “we never read the names out loud, phonetically sounding them out” before going on the air, he said.

Late Friday, the National Transportation Safety Board acknowledged that a summer intern confirmed the names to KTVU when a reporter from the station called about them.

“Earlier today, in response to an inquiry from a media outlet, a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft,” the NTSB said in a statement. “Appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such a serious error is not repeated.”

Somerville said the station didn’t properly verify who at the NTSB was confirming the names.

The hoax prompted outrage from some Asian American activists and a journalism organization.

“Words cannot adequately express the outrage we … feel over KTVU’s on-air blunder that made a mockery of the Asiana Airlines tragedy,” wrote Asian American Journalists Assn. President Paul Cheung and MediaWatch Chair Bobby Caina Calvan. “We are embarrassed for the anchor, who was as much a victim as KTVU’s viewers and KTVU’s hard-working staff.”

The two said KTVU should explain where the names originated.

In a letter to Tom Raponi, KTVU/KICU vice president and general manager, retired KTVU reporter Lloyd LaCuesta, an Asian American Journalists Assn. member, said he was saddened by the airing of the prank names.

“Common sense indicates that simply sounding out the names would have raised red flags,” LaCuesta wrote in the letter.

Two teenage girls from China and another passenger were killed and more than 180 people injured when the Boeing 777 clipped a sea wall and slammed into a runway July 6 at San Francisco International Airport.

Asiana Airlines has identified the pilot and copilot as Lee Kang-kook and Lee Jung-min.

The KTVU newscast was captured in a video posted to YouTube in which the station displayed four incorrect pilot names on the screen and an anchor read them aloud.

“The NTSB has confirmed these are the names of the pilots aboard Flight 214 when it crashed,” the anchor said. “We are working to determine exactly what roles each of them played during the landing on Saturday.”

Another YouTube video showed an apology read by the same anchor.

“These names were not accurate despite an NTSB official in Washington confirming them late this morning,” the anchor said. “We apologize for this error.”

The station issued a statement Friday afternoon acknowledging it had “misidentified the pilots involved.”

“Prior to air, the names were confirmed by an NTSB official in the agency’s Washington, D.C., office,” the statement posted on the station’s website said. “Despite that confirmation, KTVU realized the names that aired were not accurate and issued an apology later in the newscast.”

“We sincerely regret the error and took immediate action to apologize, both in the newscast where the mistake occurred, as well as on our website and social media sites,” Raponi said in the statement. “Nothing is more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and integrity, and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of error does not happen again.”

Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas, speaks at a news conference in the Capitol Visitor Center held by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus entitled 'One Nation: Principles on Immigration Reform and Our Commitment to the American Dream.' (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)

WASHINGTON -- Several House Democrats walked out of a committee vote in protest on Wednesday, accusing their Republican counterparts of refusing to negotiate in a bipartisan manner over a job training bill.

While it's common for members of Congress to simply not show up for committee meetings, it's rare for them to actually boycott one.

""We didn’t come to this decision lightly,"" said Reps. John Tierney (D-Mass.), Rubén Hinojosa (D-Texas) and George Miller (D-Calif.), members of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, in a statement. ""Unfortunately, we viewed boycotting this proceeding as our only alternative after many months of repeatedly requesting bipartisan negotiations and being rebuffed by committee Republicans.""

""It would have been a dereliction of duty to continue to participate,"" they added.

Republicans were quick to criticize the walkout (seen in this video, near minute 51:00).

""Rather than present their ideas, Democrats offered a rote defense of the status quo and political theatrics,"" Committee Chairman Rep. John Kline (R-Minn.) said in a statement. ""Both are a disservice [to] workers, employers, and job seekers.""

The legislation at issue is a bill to reauthorize and reform the Workforce Investment Act, the largest source of federal funding for job training. Republicans want to consolidate more than 30 workforce development programs into a single fund, which they say would eliminate redundant programs and cut out red tape. Democrats say the plan would make it harder for vulnerable groups like the elderly and disabled to get access to the job training they need.

Committee Democrats argued that funding for job training had been a generally bipartisan issue until recently. After making little headway in negotiations, they sent committee Republicans a letter on Monday asking them to cancel the markup of the bill scheduled for Wednesday, saying that the GOP plan ""eliminates programs for the sake of eliminating programs, without any independent evaluation of whether they are in fact duplicative of one another.""

Nonetheless, Republicans went ahead with their markup and approved the legislation on Wednesday. Ahead of the vote, Kline said the reforms would save taxpayer dollars that are ""wasted on failed programs"" and leave workers ""stranded in unemployment.""

After discussion of the bill, Hinojosa said he would leave the committee meeting on principle, and he called on his Democratic colleagues to join him.

""I have concluded that I cannot be part of a political process that continues to be highly partisan and broken,"" Hinojosa said. ""At this time, I urge my colleagues to join me in exiting this committee room.""

Mental illness has been the common denominator in one act of mass violence after another.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health%2C about 1 in 4 adults suffer from a mental disorder.

Blunt is co-sponsoring three Senate bills to offer solutions and draw attention to outdated policies.

Nearly six months after the tragic deaths of 26 students and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School, President Obama held a widely-publicized ""conference"" last week to finally discuss one of the most pressing challenges: fixing our broken mental health system.

While I'm pleased the president has finally turned his attention to mental health, I'm also disappointed it has taken so long. Instead of joining bipartisan efforts to address mental health reform immediately after the Sandy Hook tragedy, President Obama spent a great deal of time and political capital trying to pressure Congress into passing an unrelated gun bill -- legislation that failed to address the root cause of the deadly violence that we witnessed in Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., and Tucson.

People with mental health problems are almost never dangerous. In fact, they are more likely to be the victims than the perpetrators. At the same time, mental illness has been the common denominator in one act of mass violence after another.

In Newtown, Adam Lanza's mother identified and expressed deep concerns surrounding her son's mental health before he brutally murdered her and 26 other innocent people. Yet as Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen rightly noted last month, ""even if miraculously enacted, the (president's gun control) bill would not have stopped 20-year-old Adam Lanza from his murderous rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School.""

Prior to James Holmes' theater rampage in Aurora, his University of Colorado psychiatrist was so alarmed by his behavior that she notified the campus-wide threat-assessment team. Unfortunately, the team did not move the matter forward because Holmes was leaving the university. In addition, his psychiatrist reportedly rejected a law enforcement offer to confine him for 72 hours after he told her six weeks before the shooting that he fantasized about killing ""a lot of people.""



In Tucson, Rep. Gabby Giffords' attempted assassin, Jared Loughner, reportedly exhibited signs of bizarre behavior and had five run-ins with Pima Community College police before he was ultimately suspended from the school. College officials ultimately informed Loughner that he would need to obtain assurances from a mental health official indicating ""his presence at the College does not present a danger to himself or others"" if he intended to return to school.

Mental illness is a widespread, but treatable, disease. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately ""one in four adults suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder"" every year nationwide. Unfortunately, as we saw in Newtown, Aurora and Tucson, the loved ones and community leaders closest to these individuals often lack the tools or knowledge to intervene before someone does something that tragically impacts their lives and the lives of others.

Before January of this year, the Senate committee that deals with mental health issues had not held a hearing devoted to this topic since 2007. The moment to talk about what we can do is now. That's why I've been working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for many months to offer solutions and draw attention to our nation's outdated mental health policies.

In February, I joined Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. to introduce the Excellence in Mental Health Act. This bill addresses our nation's fragmented mental health system by offering current Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) a chance to obtain the Federally Qualified Community Behavioral Health Center designation.

I also co-sponsored the Mental Health First Aid Act of 2013 to help people identify, understand and respond to the signs of mental illnesses and addiction disorders through a pilot program for mental health first aid training. And I co-sponsored the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Act to improve access to mental health services for people in the criminal justice system. This bill would give law enforcement officers the tools they need to identify and respond to mental health issues, while continuing to support mental health courts and crisis intervention teams.

These bills -- all of which have garnered bipartisan support -- are steps in the right direction. I will continue to encourage Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to allow stand-alone votes on mental health legislation, and I hope President Obama will work with members from both parties to improve our nation's policies before another mental health crisis results in senseless loss.

However, the 82-15 vote to start the intense congressional battle, which is expected to continue through the month in the Senate, does not necessarily predict the final outcome in that chamber. At the same time, momentum from the Senate could motivate reluctant House Republicans to act -- or they could remain on the sidelines.

Border security remains a sticking point for Republicans, as it was during the last attempt at immigration overhaul six years ago, an effort that failed.

Republicans in both chambers want to tighten control of the border with Mexico before an estimated 11 million people in the country illegally can finish a proposed 10-year route to legal status.

The Senate’s No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, said he wants to require secure borders before green cards are issued for those who entered the country illegally or overstayed visas; Democrats argue that idea is a “poison pill” that will keep immigrants in limbo beyond what is already a decade-long wait.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

“You got to give people a sense of certainty that they go through all these sacrifices, do all this, that there’s at the end of the horizon, the opportunity -- not the guarantee, but the opportunity -- to be part of this American family,” Obama said. “And by the way, a majority of Americans support this idea.”

Deciding how to secure the border and determining when it can be considered guarded has long been a subjective pursuit that has vexed lawmakers and law enforcement.

The legislation provides $4.5 billion for more drones, manpower and double-layer fencing on the U.S.-Mexico border during its first five years in effect, and some sectors of the border are already close to achieving the bill’s goal of turning back 90% of illegal crossings. Other regions, though, are less secure, and an additional $2 billion would be available in subsequent years, if needed.

Under the bill, immigrants would be allowed to transition to provisional status within six months of the bill becoming law if a new plan for border security and fencing is in place. After 10 years, if the border plan is “operational,” most immigrants in good standing would be able to transition to green cards. After 13 years, they could become citizens.

“If we don’t guarantee results on border security, if we don’t guarantee to the American people that we actually are going to get serious about stopping the flow of people illegally crossing our Northwestern or Southwestern border, that is the real poison pill,” Cornyn said Tuesday.

Trying to bridge the divide in the GOP is Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, perhaps the most crucial member of a group of four Democratic and four Republican senators crafting the overhaul. He has been working on his own border security measure.

“I understand many in the Democratic Party and the advocate community for immigrants are asking for certainty in the green-card process, but I also think we need to have certainty on the border process,” Rubio said Tuesday. “And so we need to do both.”

The bill is the most ambitious attempt by Congress to overhaul the immigration laws in a generation, and has gained momentum in a political environment where Republicans and Democrats both want to court the growing Latino vote.

The legislation is expected to be the subject of a robust debate in the weeks ahead, with a final vote seen by the end of the month. New television ads in support of the bill were launched Tuesday by a powerful labor union, the SEIU, while the conservative Heritage Foundation urged senators to vote against it, warning immigrants who gain legal status would be a drain on the government.

Advertisement

Along with increased border security and the path to citizenship, the bill attempts to stem the future flow of illegal crossings by creating guest-worker programs for low- and high-skilled labor, and requiring all businesses to verify the legal status of new employees.

Under the measure, once immigrants who are already here undergo background checks and pay fines and fees, they can gain provisional status that allows them work permits.

“This is no cake walk,” Obama said Tuesday from the East Room, surrounded by law enforcement personnel -- including former Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton -- business leaders and union officials who back the effort.

Even if the border security provisions can be resolved, other possible amendments remain, including those to require immigrants to pay back taxes on under-the-table jobs and to bar green-card holders from receiving certain tax credits, such as those available to low-income Americans under the new healthcare law.

Sarah Palin went to the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. on Sunday–along with Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ted Cruz (R-TX)–to support thousands of veterans demanding that President Barack Obama re-open the memorials that have been barricaded due to the government shutdown.

At the World War II Memorial, Palin said that Obama is showing a “shameful lack of respect” and a “lack of valor” by barricading the memorials to veterans from across the country that marched in Washington to demand that Congress pass a law making it illegal for the federal government to close the memorials in future government shutdowns. They reportedly chanted, “tear down these walls.”

“We were proud to stand with thousands of America’s vets and other patriotic Americans today in Washington, D.C. This morning, Todd and I met with Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, and they joined us and other Americans at the World War II Memorial and then at the Lincoln Memorial, where we were met by a SWAT team in full riot gear!” Palin wrote in a Facebook post. “Watching those who have fought to protect freedom prevented by barricades from visiting these memorials to freedom was truly heart wrenching.”

Palin has said Messrs. Lee and Cruz are leading a party of “good guys” in the Senate against both party establishments that make up Washington’s permanent political class. After the Republican establishment attacked Lee and Cruz during the defunding Obamacare fight, Palin fiercely defended them for representing everyday Americans. Palin has also called for Obama administration employees to engage in acts of civil disobedience regarding the “Barrycades” at the memorials. At the march, veterans removed barricades from the memorial and took them to the White House.

Though the Obama administration officials put up barricades at the open-air memorials, they allowed thousands of amnesty supporters to rally on the National Mall, which was also supposed to be closed due to the government shutdown, last week in support of comprehensive immigration reform. On Saturday, Palin called out the Obama administration for revealing what their true priorities are during what she called a government “slim-down.”

Lee urged the crowd to “stand strong for liberty” and emphasized the memorial “belongs to the people.”

Cruz echoed Lee’s remarks.

After emphasizing that “our veterans should be above politics,” Cruz said he met with World War II veterans on “Honor Flights” last week and said they told him, “We stormed the beaches of Normandy, do they really think these little barricades [will keep us from seeing the World War II memorial]?”

Palin emphasized that Americans will now “take up the fight for freedom” and “won’t let you down”:

We’re here to show that the size of America’s heart for our veterans is immeasurable! But look around – barricades to shut down our memorials? Is this how a Commander in Chief expresses his gratitude? This “shutdown” priority proves a shameful lack of respect. It reflects a person’s lack of valor. But, Vets, We the People have learned from you! We know America will only remain the “Home of the Free” so long as we are the “Home of the Brave!” So, as we honor you, U.S. Military, know that our gratitude will not sleep! We will be brave! You were not timid, so we shall not be timid in calling out ANY who heart-wrenchingly would use you as pawns in a political game. America’s finest paid the price for our freedom today. Vets, you protected us from tyranny then. Rest now, it is OUR turn to protect against tyranny again. Ronald Reagan said, “Some people live an entire lifetime wondering if they ever made a difference in the world.” YOU, vets, need never ask that of yourselves. You made ALL the difference! Our war memorials remind us of the cost to keep us free. YOU paid the price! Rest now! We will pick up the mantle. We won’t let you down. We now take up the fight for freedom!

But for the 500 or so students and teachers from Sandy Hook Elementary School, there was nothing typical about Thursday.

After three weeks of unspeakable tragedy, funerals and muted holiday celebrations, Thursday was an effort to deliver a sense of normalcy for those who survived the shooting massacre that left 20 first-graders and six adults dead, residents of Newtown, Conn., in shock and a nation in grief.

Now the school is in a new town — Monroe, just seven miles away — but with its old name and a lot of support.

“A lot of them were happy to see their friends they hadn’t seen in a while,” Monroe Police Lt. Keith White told reporters. He described class attendance as “very good.”

Sandy Hook Elementary officials declined to talk with reporters, who were kept several miles away to not be a distraction.

The new building — until recently Monroe’s shuttered Chalk Hill School — was refurbished to help in the transition. Students arrived to find their old desks, classroom decorations and Sandy Hook’s furniture.

Julian Ford, a clinical psychologist at the University of Connecticut who helped counsel families in the days after the massacre, emphasized that familiarity was important for the children, who live more in the present than adults.

“When they see the classroom, it is not going to take them right back to the terrible incidents that happened,” he said, “but to all the experiences in the prior part of the school year — most of which will be very reassuring and positive for them.”

Despite the efforts to make the new school comfortable, signs of the tragedy were unavoidable. Students spent time with so-called comfort dogs and counselors were on hand. Inside a lecture hall, concerned parents asked questions about security and “how school was going to go,” White said.

At the state Capitol in Hartford, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy announced the formation of a Sandy Hook Advisory Commission to make policy recommendations on public safety, prevention of gun violence and mental health.

It was no surprise that a large police presence greeted students and teachers outside the school. But White said it would be reevaluated “week to week.”

“We don’t want them to think this is a police state,” he said. “We want them to know that this is a school and a school first. And that it is a place they are to come to learn, enjoy their friends and grow up.”

Ford said parents had a crucial role to play as their children recovered from what they would probably remember as a “very strange period,” filled with too many people, too much going on. “When parents are able to express what they are feeling in a way that communicates that it’s going to be all right, kids really pick up” those cues.

One mother, Denise Correia, told CNN: “There is no real playbook for this. We are kind of just sensing our child and trying to meet the needs that we can, and just support them.”

The Caller analysis of White House visitor logs showed former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman visited the White House at least 157 times under the Obama administration.

Even Attorney General Eric Holder, one of Obama's closest allies, visited only 62 times according to the records.

The records may not reflect every single visit, as some officials do not have to sign in every time they come to the White House.

But they could lend weight to concerns voiced by lawmakers at a hearing last week about the frequency of Shulman's White House contact. During the time period when the IRS was singling out Tea Party and other groups for extra vetting -- as they applied for tax-exempt status -- Shulman visited the White House 118 times.

Asked to explain the visits, Shulman gave lawmakers a list of possible reasons.

""The Easter Egg roll with my kids ... questions about the administratibility of tax policy ... our budget, us helping the Department of Education streamline application processes for financial aid,"" he said.

According to the Caller analysis, no other top official logged more than 100 visits.

The official with the next-highest number of visits -- close to 90 -- was Rebecca Blank, former deputy secretary and now acting secretary of the Commerce Department. Next in line was Thomas Perez, a top Justice Department official who has since been nominated to lead the Labor Department.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner each logged fewer than 50 visits.

Former IRS officials have testified that the scrutiny of conservative groups, while inappropriate, was not politically motivated."

His slogan ""Make America Great Again,"" became the central theme of his campaign.

Barack Obama (2009-2017) became the first African-American to hold the office of President. He took the oath of office amid the Great Recession, the biggest economic challenge since the Great Depression. Under the Affordable Healthcare Act, millions of uninsured Americans have gotten health insurance.

George W. Bush (2001-2009) is the son of former President George H.W. Bush. His presidency was largely defined by his response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In 2003, he ordered the invasion of Iraq on suspicion that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.

Bill Clinton (1993-2001) ran on the slogan, ""It's the economy, stupid."" Plagued by various scandals -- including accusations of sexual impropriety -- he was the second president to be impeached. He was acquitted in 1999.

George H.W. Bush (1989-1993) was a former CIA director and served two terms as vice president under Ronald Reagan. His approval rating at home soared after he led an international coalition to oust Iraq from Kuwait, and communism in Eastern Europe fell on his watch. But he lost his bid for re-election amid a sluggish economy and after reneging on a promise not to raise taxes.

Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) was the only actor ever elected President, and his talent as a speaker earned him the moniker ""the great communicator."" An affable Republican who wooed many Roosevelt Democrats, the staunchly anti-communist Reagan is seen as having played a large part in the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) brokered the 1978 Camp David Accords, the agreement that led to a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. At home, Carter's presidency was plagued by inflation and unemployment, and he lost his bid for a second term amid the hostage crisis in Iran.

Gerald Ford (1974-1977) had been appointed vice president by Nixon after Spiro Agnew was forced to resign. He then became President when Nixon himself resigned. Remembered mainly for his pardon of Nixon and his physical clumsiness, Ford was not elected to a second term.

Richard Nixon (1969-1974) became the first President to resign from office as he faced impeachment for his involvement in the Watergate scandal. Nixon made strides in domestic policy, proposing legislation that resulted in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. Abroad, he established relations with China and a détente in Soviet relations.

Lyndon B. Johnson (1963-1969) was vice president under John F. Kennedy and took the oath of office on a plane after Kennedy was assassinated. In 1964, Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, the landmark legislation that banned segregation and discrimination based on race and gender. The law was a cornerstone of Johnson's vision of a ""Great Society"" that also included a ""war on poverty.""

John F. Kennedy (1961-1963) was the first Roman Catholic President. He was assassinated in his first term, which was marked by the signing of the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, the creation of the Peace Corps, the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, and the beginning of military involvement in Vietnam.

Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953-1961) had been supreme commander of the European Allied forces during World War II, and he ordered the Normandy invasion on D-Day. His popular presidential campaign slogan was ""I like Ike!""

Harry S. Truman (1945-1953) served as vice president for 82 days before the unexpected death of Roosevelt. He authorized the use of two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-1945) was the only President elected to the office four times. During his 12 years as President, he championed numerous social programs and measures, including the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Civilian Conservation Corps and Social Security. Roosevelt contracted polio at age 39 and never recovered the use of his legs.

Herbert Hoover (1929-1933) was inaugurated on the year of the stock market crash that sent the country into the Great Depression. Although Hoover pushed for money to be appropriated for large-scale projects, he opposed federal relief payments directly to individuals. The national economy never recovered during his term, and the shantytowns that developed were nicknamed ""Hoovervilles.""

Calvin Coolidge (1923-1929) served as vice president until the death of Warren G. Harding. His 1924 campaign slogan was ""Keep Cool with Coolidge,"" and his nickname was ""Silent Cal"" because of his reputation as a man of few words.

Warren G. Harding's term (1921-1923) was cut short by his sudden death from a cerebral hemorrage. Harding captured 60% of the popular vote in 1920, marking the largest presidential landslide to date.

Woodrow Wilson (1913-1921) was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize for proposing and creating the League of Nations. But he was never able to convince the United States to join. Although he was first opposed to a federal amendment allowing women to vote, Wilson shifted his position during his second term and the 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920.

William Howard Taft (1909-1913) also served as the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court in his post-presidency years. During his re-election bid, he managed to win only eight of 531 electoral votes -- the poorest performance of an incumbent president seeking re-election.

At 42, Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909) was the youngest man to take the oath of office. A progressive reformer and environmental advocate, Roosevelt brought lawsuits against corporate trusts, taking on business giants to level the playing field for the working class.

William McKinley (1897-1901) led the country through the Spanish-American War, a three-month conflict that began with the sinking of the USS Maine and ended with Cuban independence. During the beginning of McKinley's second term, he was fatally shot by an anarchist.

Benjamin Harrison (1889-1893) signed into law the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which authorized the government to fine large corporations for price fixing and other corrupt business practices.

Grover Cleveland (1885-1889; 1893-1897) was the first and only commander-in-chief to serve two non-consecutive terms. He was also the first bachelor President to be married at the White House.

Just four months into his term, James Garfield (1881) was shot by a disgruntled lawyer who'd aspired to join the administration as a diplomat. The President was taken to the Jersey Shore, where doctors hoped the ocean air would help him recover. He died two weeks later.

Rutherford B. Hayes (1877-1881) promoted women's rights, signing legislation that allowed female lawyers to argue Supreme Court cases. He introduced the White House Easter Egg Roll as a spring tradition and established the first presidential library.

Tasked with unifying the country after the Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant (1869-1877) established the Department of Justice to protect the rights of freed slaves. He also authorized the military to fight the Ku Klux Klan and successfully lobbied for the 15th Amendment, granting voting rights to black men.

Andrew Johnson's (1865-1869) trial by impeachment in the U.S. Senate resulted in his acquittal by a single vote. History gives him a terrible performance review: His plan for post-war Reconstruction failed, and he had little support from Congress or the public.

Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865), purveyor of tall top hats and log cabins, preserved the Union during the Civil War and freed the slaves through the Emancipation Proclamation. He was assassinated by actor John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer.

James Buchanan (1857-1861) was the only President who never married. He failed to prevent seven pro-slavery states from seceding during his term.

Franklin Pierce (1853-1857) was the first President to not get his party's nomination for re-election. He signed the controversial Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed the people there to decide whether to allow slavery. This worsened the tension between the North and South.

Millard Fillmore (1850-1853) was the last President who was neither a Democrat or a Republican. He helped pass the Compromise of 1850, legislation that included the Fugitive Slave Act and California's admission to the Union as a free state.

Zachary Taylor (1849-1850), aka ""Old Rough and Ready,"" was a hero in the Mexican-American War. Mystery surrounds his actual cause of death from a stomach ailment. Did he just eat too many cherries, or was it murder? The 1991 exhumation of his body proved it wasn't arsenic poisoning at least.

James K. Polk (1845-1849) oversaw the greatest expansion of territory of any President in history. The expansion included what would become the future states of Texas and California. Polk also negotiated with Britain to establish the boundaries of the Oregon Country.

John Tyler's term (1841-1845) saw several presidential firsts. He was the first vice president to succeed office after the President died, he was the first to lose his wife while in office, and he was the first to marry while in office.

William Henry Harrison (1841) probably had only just finished unpacking his things at the White House when he died of pneumonia one month into his term. Harrison was the first U.S. President to die while in office, and he had the shortest tenure ever of any commander-in-chief.

Martin Van Buren (1837-1841) was the first President to be born a U.S. citizen. Previous Presidents were born before the United States was a country, making them colonists and, consequently, citizens of Great Britain.

Andrew Jackson (1829-1837) was the only President to serve in both the American Revolution and the War of 1812. He is also the only President to have been a former prisoner of war: Jackson was 13 when became a courier during the Revolutionary War, and he was later captured by the British.

John Quincy Adams (1825-1829) was the son of second President John Adams. He was the only President to serve in the House of Representatives after serving as President.

James Monroe (1817-1825) was the last of the Founding Fathers to be elected President. During his seventh State of the Union address, he outlined a foreign policy that warned European powers against further colonization of or meddling in the Western Hemisphere. This was later known as the Monroe Doctrine.

James Madison, the fourth President (1809-1817), was nicknamed the ""Father of the Constitution."" During his presidency, the first formal declaration of war was enacted -- the War of 1812 with Great Britain.

Thomas Jefferson, the third President (1801-1809), was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence. While President, Jefferson doubled the size of the United States by purchasing the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803.

The second U.S. President, John Adams, served from 1797 to 1801. He was also the first vice president of the United States, and he was the first President to reside in the White House, moving in on November 1, 1800, while the White House was still under construction.

George Washington was the first President of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797. He also served as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, and he has the distinction of being the only President unanimously elected by the Electoral College.

Story highlights George W. Bush goes on ""The Tonight Show""; Bill Clinton gets Medal of Freedom Julian Zelizer: The two are taking opposite approaches to managing presidential legacies Clinton takes initiative in pushing his view of how Democratic Party should act, Zelizer says Zelizer: Bush takes more passive role, letting his controversial record speak for itself

Editor’s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of “Jimmy Carter” and “Governing America.”

(CNN) —

Former President George W. Bush briefly jumped back into the national conversation Tuesday night with his interview on “The Tonight Show.” Bush told host Jay Leno that “I don’t miss the spotlight” and that he was thoroughly enjoying his post-presidential life. On Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton is in the news as he receives a Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama.

The two former presidents have taken a very different approach to their time after the White House. In an era when former presidents are often younger and healthier than in the past, the post-presidency offers a huge opportunity for them to help shape their legacies.

Larry Levanti Julian Zelizer

Former President Jimmy Carter raised the bar after he lost to Ronald Reagan in 1980. Rather than going into political hiding, the Georgian launched the Carter Center, which has been a hub of international diplomacy. Carter remained an important voice in discussions about foreign policy and has even played a role in resolving some tense diplomatic situations.

Clinton’s approach to life after the White House has reflected his general style of politics. Clinton has never been passive. As governor of Arkansas and as president of the United States, Clinton has believed it is essential to maintain an aggressive and proactive stance.

In an era when many Democrats felt defensive about their ideas, Clinton never let his opponents define him. He responded to every attack throughout his presidency by going on the attack and tried to influence the national conversation about how he was doing.

When Republicans shut down the government in 1995 claiming to be fiscally responsible, Clinton turned the tables on them by depicting them as politically reckless. When House Republicans moved to impeach him for perjury in 1997 and 1998, Clinton painted his opponents as partisan zealots who were using the constitutional process for crass political ends.

Since 2000, Clinton has continued to inject himself into the political arena. Understanding that presidential legacies evolve in real time, Clinton has remained a forceful presence in the Democratic Party. He has worked hard to strengthen his image as an effective partisan fighter who knows, and knew, how to make things work in a dysfunctional political period.

During the 2008 campaign, while supporting his wife’s candidacy he promoted a vision of Democratic politics that he said would be most effective in getting things done in Washington.

After Obama won office, Clinton made his peace with the President and in 2012 was one of the most effective advocates for the White House by articulating a powerful critique of Republican economic policies.

In recent weeks, Clinton spoke out on the health care program, urging Obama to honor his commitment for people to keep their insurance plans and aiming to shore up Democrats as they have struggled through the problematic rollout of the Affordable Care Act.

Not only does Clinton want to demonstrate his political skills, but he remains devoted to a Democratic Party that is strong and effective – which in his mind would be the best proof that his term in office helped to revitalize a party that had been politically devastated in the Age of Reagan. Clinton also would like his wife to be elected president so as to create a political dynasty of sorts.

Bush has taken a different approach, letting his record stand on its own. Bush left the White House hugely unpopular and controversial. Bush had little appetite for the toxic environment of Washington and has been remarkably quiet since leaving. Although Americans saw some of him following the release of his book and in relationship to the opening of his presidential library, that’s about it.

The strategy follows the kind of politician he was. Bush liked to call himself “The Decider” and in many ways he was. Bush preferred to make decisions and let them stick, regardless of how controversial or problematic they were.

We have seen the same strategy in his post-presidential career. Rather than being part of the political conversation and trying to shape his party in the years that followed, Bush has let the record speak for itself. By many accounts, he has watched as the GOP moved rightward despite his own inclinations about what would be best for the future of the party.

Each strategy carries its rewards and risks. For Clinton, his stance allows him to be part of the conversation and to try to make sure that his party remains in a strong position. He can paint himself in a good light as people examine what he was doing as president. The danger is that his actions make him a target of controversy and that by making himself so doggedly political he undermines the aura of a statesman that has been so beneficial to rebuilding the damaged image Americans often have of their leaders.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, criticism from the African-American community about his statements regarding Obama weakened some of the strong support that the community held toward his presidency.

For Bush, the benefit of his relative silence is that he avoids all of the pitfalls that face Clinton. As feelings about him start to soften simply because we are further removed from his presidency, he has created the space for more careful and rigorous analysis of what he did during the White House. By showing how difficult the political environment is regardless of whether he is in office, Bush can allow for more sympathy to develop of challenges he faced.

The dangers for Bush are twofold. By being so removed, he can convey a level of dispassion for politics that plays into criticism that it was never a job he was driven to do in the first place. He has also failed to play a forceful role as his party plunges in its approval ratings.

Presidential legacies are a tough thing to predict. Like the weather in New England, they change by the minute.

As the nation commemorates the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, we can see how presidential reputations fluctuate dramatically (historians often remember his failures as president, while many others recall his presidency in heroic terms). But in this day and age, former presidents have significant opportunities to shape how the nation remembers them and to influence the political world in which they will be judged during their lifetime.

As Obama reaches the final period of his presidency, he would do well to look at what his predecessors have done and start thinking through what his strategy will be in the years ahead.

Josh Gad and the cast of ""1600 Penn"" met President Obama at a special screening of the comedy in the White House.

Gad found himself unable to speak when the President introduced himself.

The President introduced the comedy in the White House theater and then had to excuse himself.

President Obama is so powerful that he even has the power to silence the very talkative Book of Mormon star Josh Gad.

Gad was at the White House this week for a special presidential screening of his new NBC comedy 1600 Penn and found himself unable to speak when Obama introduced himself.

""I was thinking this is going to be amazing, I have so much I want to say. And he walks in and I literally freeze,"" says Gad. ""He shakes my hand and says, 'So great to meet you. How you feeling? How you doing?' All I could say was, 'Um, um, I'm better now.'""

""Oh my God. I don't think I've been at a loss for words. I'm unfortunately very verbose too often,"" says Gad. ""I don't know what his impression was but you are meeting the leader of the free world on his home turf. It's not something you can prepare for.""

Gad plays a slacker son of a fictional president (Bill Pullman) in the sitcom written by former Obama speechwriter Jon Lovett. The president introduced the sitcom to members of his staff and the show's in the White House theater.

""It was incredible. It's like the President of the United States is giving a 10-minute speech introducing the show,"" says Gad.

But Obama couldn't stick around and excused himself by saying, ""something came up."" Lovett looked over at Gad and said that the last time Obama said 'something came up' was when Lovett was helping on his White House Correspondents dinner speech and the President walked away.

""And the next morning they found out he was killing Osama Bin Laden,"" says Gad. ""(Lovett) said, 'I have come to take it on his word when he says he has to go do something, it's really something.' ""

Nonetheless, Gad and Obama's crew saw the show, then enjoyed a special champagne reception in the East Wing to end the ""really remarkable"" day.

""It was incredible, one of the highlights of my life,"" says Gad."

Opponents Plan Attack on Immigration Bill,"WASHINGTON — Republican opponents of legislation to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws are readying an offensive intended to hijack the newly released bill as the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday begins a review that will offer the clearest sign yet of how difficult a path the legislation faces.

With the committee expected to spend at least three weeks on the legislation, Republican critics could offer hundreds of amendments to try to reshape the overhaul. They include proposals that could lengthen the timeline for a pathway to citizenship and that could tamper with an already fragile deal negotiated between business and labor groups for a guest worker program. Anticipating an onslaught, Democrats are preparing a robust defense in an effort to keep the legislation largely intact.

For the bipartisan group of eight senators who drafted the legislation and now hope to shepherd it through committee and onto the floor, each amendment is a potential hurdle.

“They’ll be looking to throw obstacles in the way of the process and propose poison pills in order to frame the debate for the far right,” said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, a pro-immigration group, referring to some of the potential Republican amendments. “What they’re really doing is playing towards conservatives, trying to make Marco Rubio and other Republicans uncomfortable, and mobilizing grass-roots opposition.”"

Some prisoners claim this strike is about living conditions in the Security Housing Units, commonly called SHUs, which house some of the most dangerous inmates in California. Don’t be fooled. Many of those participating in the hunger strike are under extreme pressure to do so from violent prison gangs, which called the strike in an attempt to restore their ability to terrorize fellow prisoners, prison staff and communities throughout California.

I am concerned about the toll this hunger strike is taking on my staff, the inmates and their families. I am uneasy about what some inmates are telling my staff. Many say they want to resume eating but are afraid of the retaliation they will suffer at the hands of other inmates acting on orders from their gang leaders. In one prison, an inmate was assaulted because he refused to share his food with striking inmates. He suffered facial fractures and had to be hospitalized for several days.

For decades, California has had the most violent and sophisticated prison gangs in the nation. When gang violence exploded during the 1970s and 1980s, and crime rates around the state rose to record highs, state prisons felt the impact. Between 1970 and 1973, 11 employees of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation were slain by inmates, and many others were brutally assaulted.

After this turbulent and violent time, and in response to the growing threat of gangs, the corrections department created SHUs to safely house gang members and their associates while minimizing their influence on other prisoners. Restricting the gangs’ communication has limited their ability to engage in organized criminal activity and has saved lives both inside and outside prison walls.

There are SHUs at four prisons in California. At three of them — in Tehachapi, Corcoran and Folsom — there are outdoor-facing windows in the cells that allow for direct sunlight. At Pelican Bay, all SHU cells have skylights. In all of the facilities, inmates in the SHU have radios and color TVs with access to channels such as ESPN. They have weekly access to a law library and daily exercise time. Many have cellmates; they can earn degrees; they can send and receive letters; and their family and friends can visit them every weekend. SHU inmates receive the same meals and portions as general population inmates. This is not “solitary confinement,” in that prisoners can have visitors and, in many cases, interaction with other inmates.

Even so, we remain committed to improving our facilities and policies. The department has brought in outside experts to evaluate our gang-management strategies. Based on their recommendations, we implemented a new comprehensive gang-management strategy last fall.

The new strategy places an emphasis on documented gang-related behavior, something hunger strike leaders asked for in 2011. It also features enhanced due process, along with a step-down program aimed at inmates who want out of the SHU but don’t want out of their gangs. We no longer commit people to indeterminate placements in SHUs, in which the terms have no end dates. And we are committed to providing less-restrictive housing and more privileges for inmates who demonstrate their willingness to refrain from gang behavior.

Also, as part of the reforms implemented last year, we are conducting case-by-case reviews of inmates who had been previously given indeterminate terms in SHUs. To date, we have completed 399 reviews, and about 62% of those whose cases have been reviewed have been transferred, or are about to be transferred back into the general prison population. An additional 30% were placed in various phases of the step-down program, receiving more privileges and rehabilitative services.

The corrections department has done everything it committed to do following the hunger strike in 2011. Several months after that strike, California’s Office of the Inspector General, which is responsible for independent oversight of the department, issued a report confirming the department’s good-faith efforts.

So what is this really about? Some of the men who participated in the last hunger strike have since dropped out of the gangs for religious or personal reasons, and they said it best in recently filed court declarations. “Honestly, we did not care about human rights,” one inmate said about the 2011 hunger strike. “The objective was to get into the general population, or mainline, and start running our street regiments again.” Another described the hunger strike this way: “We knew we could tap big time support through this tactic, but we weren’t trying to improve the conditions in the SHU; we were trying to get out of the SHU to further our gang agenda on the mainline.”

It’s no different this time. The inmates calling the shots are leaders in four of the most violent and influential prison gangs in California: the Aryan Brotherhood, the Mexican Mafia, Nuestra Familia and the Black Guerrilla Family. We’re talking about convicted murderers who are putting lives at risk to advance their own agenda of violence.

The leaders of these four gangs are directly responsible for at least five ruthless murders, 35 violent assaults, including stabbings, and they have racked up more than two dozen violations for possession of weapons and other contraband.

Brutal killers should not be glorified. This hunger strike is dangerous, disruptive and needs to end.

Mail would be delivered. Social Security and Medicare benefits would continue to flow.

But vacationers would be turned away from national parks and Smithsonian museums. Low-to-moderate income borrowers and first-time homebuyers seeking government-backed mortgages could face delays.

A look at how services would or would not be affected if Congress fails to reach an agreement averting a government shutdown at midnight Monday.

AIR TRAVEL

Federal air traffic controllers would remain on the job and airport screeners would keep funneling passengers through security checkpoints. Federal inspectors would continue enforcing safety rules.

INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL

The State Department would continue processing foreign applications for visas and U.S. applications for passports, since fees are collected to finance those services. Embassies and consulates overseas would continue to provide services to American citizens.

BENEFIT PAYMENTS

Social Security and Medicare benefits would keep coming, but there could be delays in processing new disability applications. Unemployment benefits would still go out.

FEDERAL COURTS

Federal courts would continue operating normally for about 10 business days after the start of a shutdown, roughly until the middle of October. If the shutdown continues, the judiciary would have to begin furloughs of employees whose work is not considered essential. But cases would continue to be heard.

MAIL

Deliveries would continue as usual because the U.S. Postal Service receives no tax dollars for day-to-day operations. It relies on income from stamps and other postal fees to keep running.

RECREATION

All national parks would be closed, as would the Smithsonian museums, including the National Zoo in Washington. Visitors using overnight campgrounds or other park facilities would be given 48 hours to make alternate arrangements and leave the park. Among the visitor centers that would be closed: the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Alcatraz Island near San Francisco and the Washington Monument.

HEALTH

New patients would not be accepted into clinical research at the National Institutes of Health, but current patients would continue to receive care. Medical research at the NIH would be disrupted and some studies would be delayed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be severely limited in spotting or investigating disease outbreaks, from flu to that mysterious MERS virus from the Middle East.

FOOD SAFETY

The Food and Drug Administration would handle high-risk recalls suspend most routine safety inspections. Federal meat inspections would be expected to proceed as usual.

HEAD START

A small number of Head Start programs, about 20 out of 1,600 nationally, would feel the impact right away. The federal Administration for Children and Families says grants expiring about Oct. 1 would not be renewed. Over time more programs would be affected. Several of the Head Start programs that would immediately feel the pinch are in Florida. It's unclear if they would continue serving children.

FOOD ASSISTANCE

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, could shut down. The program provides supplemental food, health care referrals and nutrition education for pregnant women, mothers and their children.

School lunches and breakfasts would continue to be served, and food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would continue to be distributed. But several smaller feeding programs would not have the money to operate.

TAXES

Americans would still have to pay their taxes and file federal tax returns, but the Internal Revenue Service says it would suspend all audits. Got questions? Sorry, the IRS says taxpayer services, including toll-free help lines, would be shut as well.

LOANS

Many low-to-moderate incomes borrowers and first-time homebuyers seeking government-backed mortgages could face delays during the shutdown. The Federal Housing Administration, which guarantees about 30 percent of home mortgages, wouldn't underwrite or approve any new loans during the shutdown. Action on government-backed loans to small businesses would be suspended.

SCIENCE

NASA will continue to keep workers at Mission Control in Houston and elsewhere to support the International Space station, where two Americans and four others are deployed. The National Weather Service would keep forecasting weather and issuing warnings and the National Hurricane Center would continue to track storms. The scientific work of the U.S. Geological Survey would be halted.

HOMELAND SECURITY

The majority of the Department of Homeland Security's employees are expected to stay on the job, including uniformed agents and officers at the country's borders and ports of entry, members of the Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration officers, Secret Service personnel and other law enforcement agents and officers. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services employees would continue to process green card applications.

MILITARY

The military's 1.4 million active duty personnel would stay on duty, but their paychecks would be delayed. About half of the Defense Department's civilian employees would be furloughed.

PRISONS

All 116 federal prisons would remain open, and criminal litigation would proceed.

VETERANS SERVICES

Most services offered through the Department of Veterans Affairs will continue because lawmakers approve money one year in advance for the VA's health programs. Veterans would still be able to visit hospitals for inpatient care, get mental health counseling at vet centers or get prescriptions filled at VA health clinics. Operators would still staff the crisis hotline and claims workers would still process payments to cover disability and pension benefits. But those veterans appealing the denial of disability benefits to the Board of Veterans Appeals will have to wait longer for a decision because the board would not issue any decisions during a shutdown.

WORK SAFETY

Federal occupational safety and health inspectors would stop workplace inspections except in cases of imminent danger."

An inebriated passenger on a January flight from Iceland to New York tries to grope and choke fellow travelers until crew members and other passengers bind him with duct tape.

Such incidents are no longer flukes but rather a trend that has prompted airlines to call for new laws to deal with unruly passengers and other onboard mayhem on international flights.

The number of incidents of unruly passengers jumped from less than 500 in 2007 to more than 6,000 in 2011, according to the International Air Transport Assn., the trade group for world airlines, which has been keeping track of the incidents.

In 1963, representatives from 185 countries met in Tokyo to adopt a set of laws that focused on onboard crimes related to hijacking. But the laws are outdated and do not address the kind of mayhem that some passengers cause, delaying flights and fraying nerves, said Perry Flint, an IATA spokesman.

“Lots of changes have taken place over the past 50 years,” he said. “The old rules no longer do a good job of addressing this problem.”

For example, under the 1963 laws, the country where a plane is registered has legal jurisdiction over offenses on the plane. But today about 40% of commercial planes are leased, meaning the country where the plane is registered is not always the country where the airline is based, according to IATA.

A meeting has been scheduled for March by the International Civil Aviation Organization, a branch of the United Nations, to discuss new rules on how to deal with unruly passengers. A location for the meeting has not been set.

Mr. Kerry, who is a Vietnam veteran, a former presidential nominee and the son of a diplomat, will be inheriting a difficult agenda. The conflict in Syria has killed more than 60,000 people. The international envoy on the Syrian crisis, Lakhdar Brahimi, who reported to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, has made no headway. Egypt is in turmoil. By Mr. Kerry’s own account, relations with Russia have deteriorated.

As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee during Mr. Obama’s first term, Mr. Kerry was a loyal ally of the White House and served as an interlocutor with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, among others.

During a nearly four-hour confirmation hearing last week, Mr. Kerry demonstrated familiarity with a broad range of issues, but he did not present any new ideas on how to address them.

Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose last day as secretary of state is Friday, said at a global forum at the Newseum on Tuesday that she expected Mr. Kerry to undertake a new effort to narrow differences between Israel and the Palestinians."

Robert Menendez (D-NJ), the so-called Gang of Eight’s immigration reform bill does not have enough votes at this point to pass the Senate.

Even though the bill has exited the Senate Judiciary Committee with a 13-5 vote, Menendez says that it will not receive 60 votes thanks to Republican opposition. “We don’t currently have 60 votes identified in the Senate,” Menendez told Univision. “We need to add more votes on the floor. That means that the community in your state, in every state, should be contacting your state’s two US Senators saying that they want comprehensive immigration reform, that they are going to judge their political future based on this vote.”

Several Republican senators have expressed support for debating the bill, but do not support the bill itself yet, including Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). Menendez does believe that by the time of the Senate vote, which he said will take place just after July 4, the votes will be there. “I believe that in those three weeks we can get the necessary votes and we will have the community. We are expecting that and working for that.”

The goal, said Menendez, would be to pressure the House of Representatives to pass a version of the bill by creating widespread Senate support. “We want to push this bill forward with the most positive votes we can find, more than sixty, the sixty we need to be able to pass it here in the Senate, so we can put pressure on the House,” he explained. “Speaker Boehner, will have to decide how he will proceed.”

Menendez’s statements on Univision are no coincidence – the Democrats’ plan for 2014 is largely built on the notion that by creating bipartisan support for immigration reform in the Senate, then forcing the House to stop a soft-on-border-security bill, they will be able to generate public support for taking the House back for President Obama.

Several of the court’s more liberal justices sounded doubtful about a state law that imposes requirements beyond those called for by a federal law.

“Many people don’t have the documents that Arizona requires,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.

The Arizona law, enacted in 2004 by a ballot initiative, requires prospective voters to prove that they are citizens by submitting copies of or information concerning various documents, including birth certificates, passports, naturalization papers or Arizona driver’s licenses, which are available only to people who are in the state lawfully.

The question for the justices was whether that state law conflicted with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which allows voters to register using a federal form that asks, “Are you a citizen of the United States?” Prospective voters must check a box yes or no, and they must sign the form, swearing that they are citizens under penalty of perjury."

Pollak'],Obama Tells Morehouse Graduates of 'Special Obligation' of Black Men,"In a commencement address in Atlanta on Sunday to graduating seniors at Morehouse College, President Barack Obama told graduates to fulfill the “special obligation I felt, as a black man like you.” The all-male, historically black liberal arts college was also the alma mater of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., among other famous graduates.

The president told the graduating students that their background meant they had a duty “to create greater justice both in your own community, but also across our country. To make sure everyone has a voice; everyone gets a seat at the table; to make sure that everyone – no matter what they look like or where they come from, or who they love – gets a chance to walk through those doors of opportunity if they want it bad enough.”

Obama cited his own life as an example several times during his speech, touting his success as a father while also acknowledging some “bad choices” he made in his youth–a veiled reference to his admitted past drug use, which Obama has often acknowledged in books, speeches and debates.

He also admonished Morehouse graduates who aimed to join the professions that they ought to serve the poor:

So yes, go get that law degree. But ask yourself if the only option is to defend the rich and powerful, or if you can also find time to defend the powerless. Yes, go get your MBA, or start that business. But ask yourself what broader purpose your business might serve, in putting people to work, or transforming a neighborhood….Some of you may be headed to medical school to become doctors. But make sure you heal folks in underserved communities who really need it, too.

(Here, the president did not mention his own rather unique career path as an attorney, which included defending landlords in large urban housing developments who had evicted tenants in winter or failed to provide necessary services.)

In one portion of his speech, the president touted Obamacare–and encouraged the graduates to sign up for the new health insurance exchanges created by his signature legislation.

Obama seems to have been carrying out the advice of Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, brother of Obama’s former chief of staff, who argued recently in the Wall Street Journal that young Americans would have to be targeted by a propaganda campaign if the system were not to be dangerously underfunded: “Every commencement address by an administration official should encourage young graduates to get health insurance,” Dr. Emanuel wrote.

Obama advised the graduating class that racism could no longer be leaned upon as a reason for failure: “We’ve got no time for excuses,” he said. He also acknowledged that the U.S. had become tolerant enough to elect a black president. And yet Obama described a nation in which discrimination is still rampant:

See, as Morehouse Men, many of you know what it’s like to be an outsider; to be marginalized; to feel the sting of discrimination. That’s an experience that so many other Americans share. Hispanic Americans know that feeling when someone asks where they come from or tells them to go back. Gay and lesbian Americans feel it when a stranger passes judgment on their parenting skills or the love they share. Muslim Americans feel it when they’re stared at with suspicion because of their faith. Any woman who knows the injustice of earning less pay for doing the same work – she sure feels it.

The premise of Obama’s claim is at odds with recent global survey data, which indicates that the U.S. is among the least racist countries in the world. It is also at odds with the record of his own political career. In the recent past, President Obama has been guilty of many of the sins described above–touting deportations of illegal immigrants; opposing gay marriage until a year ago; moving Muslims out of campaign photographs for fear of arousing prejudice; and, most notoriously, paying women less than men in both his Senate and White House offices.

Overall, President Obama’s remarks repeated a pattern of recent graduation speeches in which he minimized individual achievement in favor of collective obligation.

Curiously, he barely mentioned government, which he has been at great pains to defend in some recent addresses–speeches that have drawn wider criticism in the wake of recent scandals involving abuses of government power.

The word “government” appeared five times in his recent Ohio State commencement speech but not once in the Morehouse address, where the only mentions of government careers were his own presidency and the Atlanta mayoralty of Maynard Jackson.

Obama’s emphasis at Morehouse was on voluntary service to the community–a theme closer to the American philosophical tradition, albeit reformulated to suit the policies and prerogatives of the administration and the Democratic Party."

Detroit Free Press

Guide includes answers to 100 questions about Americans

MSU editor in residence involved journalism students in the project

Students gathered questions about Americans from their international counterparts

Page 4 explains why Americans often smile at strangers. Page 8 contains a handy tipping guide. And Page 35 offers some advice on asking someone out on a date.

Those questions — and 97 others — are gathered in a new guide aimed at helping international students understand the U.S. and its people. The guide was developed last semester by Michigan State University journalism students and delivered on the last day of class.

Called ""100 Questions & Answers about Americans,"" it's available for purchase online at Amazon and Barnes & Noble.

The guide has its genesis in the class of Joe Grimm, the visiting editor in residence at MSU's school of journalism. During his stint as ombudsman of the Detroit Free Press, Grimm said he heard from Arab and Jewish readers about issues, which led to a guide of questions and answers about Arabs.

Flash-forward more than a decade. MSU's Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives encouraged Grimm to work on the new guide. Michigan State has more than 6,700 students from 131 nations, with the most foreign students coming from China.

Grimm got the 16 students in his class involved.

""It forces students to talk to people across cultures and to learn how to ask awkward questions,"" he said.

The journalism students fanned out to find international students and gather the questions they had about America and Americans.

""It was really good training on how to talk to people and then how to find answers,"" said student Michelle Armstead, who worked on a team looking at race and social behaviors. ""We knew that there were a ton of people who didn't know much about America, other than what they had seen on TV.""

The journalism students compiled the questions and edited them down to a list of 100.

""The questions were framed by where the people were from,"" Grimm said. ""We had someone from Saudi ask why Americans work so hard. We had someone from China who asked why Americans didn't work hard.""

The students then set out to answer the questions. Some led them to census data. Other answers came from the journalism students' personal experiences.

The guide then went out to various MSU experts to vet the answers.

During the process, students learned about marketing, including what people were searching for online and how to make sure the guide popped up in result lists.

As for the answers to those earlier questions: Page 4 says Americans smile at strangers to be friendly; Page 8 says you don't have to tip the grocery bagger and Page 35 says you should spend time getting to know someone before asking for a date."

But Touré said that within MSNBC's modern era, there have only been five hosts to fit into three valuable slots -- and the current lineup of Chris Hayes, Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O'Donnell is ""brilliant"" and ""extraordinary.""

""If you were able to say to me that there is a person who is not brilliant ... then you can say something, but we have three extraordinary people,"" he said. Asked by Hill whether or not there was an endemic hostility to hosts of color in primetime at MSNBC, Touré said there wasn't.

Heinz Kerry, 74, is undergoing tests and evaluation at Massachusetts General Hospital. She had ""seizure-like symptoms"" on Sunday while at the couple's vacation home in Nantucket.

With his wife's condition improving, the secretary of State decided he could briefly return to Washington for the start of the annual U.S.-China Economic Dialogue. The summit began five years ago as a way for the world's two largest economies to manage their relationship.

Kerry did not elaborate on his wife's health, but said ""she's coming along.""

""I know when she's able to, she'll thank everybody herself,"" he said.

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court seems unlikely to uphold frequent-flier’s suit,"WASHINGTON — Rabbi S. Binyomin Ginsberg of Minneapolis admits being both a frequent flier and a frequent complainer. He flew on Northwest Airlines about 75 times a year, domestically and internationally, earning enough miles to qualify for “Platinum Elite” status.

But he also complained a lot — about two dozen times in seven months, the airline says — demanding compensation for delays, lost bags and losing seats on overbooked flights that Northwest said the rabbi had reserved “with the purpose of being bumped.”

After Northwest terminated Ginsberg’s platinum status for “abusing” its frequent-flier program, the rabbi sued. “I had hundreds of thousands of miles, and I wanted them back,” he said, standing on the steps of the Supreme Court on Tuesday, where his case was heard.

But based on justices’ questions and comments, the court appeared reluctant to grant U.S. travelers any expanded rights to sue airlines, pointing to a 1978 deregulation law that airlines use to shield themselves against lawsuits from customers over routes, rates and services.

The “whole point” of the deregulation act was to protect airlines from state lawsuits, said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. “We’re dealing with airlines that go to a lot of different states,” he said.

Ginsberg’s attorney contended that Northwest, which merged with Delta Airlines in 2010, broke its contractual promise with the rabbi. But justices noted that the fine print of the frequent-flier program said a decision to cancel a member’s account was left to the airline’s “sole judgment.”

At the heart of Northwest Inc. vs. Ginsberg is how to balance consumer protections for travelers with the Airline Deregulation Act, which Congress passed to insulate airlines from burdensome state lawsuits in an effort to increase competition and lower fares. That law has often frustrated airline customers, who find few legal options to challenge carriers in court over lost luggage or canceled flights.

The Supreme Court relied on that law to throw out a 1995 claim against American Airlines for making it harder for frequent fliers to earn free tickets. Frequent-flier awards are “related to” tickets prices, the justices ruled. But their opinion left the door slightly open for future claims from fliers if they could show that the airline had broken a promise in its contracts.

Ginsberg had sued in California, and a San Diego federal judge dismissed his claim prior to a trial, citing the deregulation act. But last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals revived it and said the rabbi could sue the airline for violating the general duty to act in “good faith” and engage in “fair dealing.”

An attorney for the consumer watchdog group Public Citizen, which agreed to represent the rabbi, argued that Ginsberg was a loyal flier and that the airline should be required to honor the deal it made with him. Courts should be able to “give effect to the bargain that the parties entered into based on their reasonable expectations,” said Adina Rosenbaum, a Washington lawyer.

Tuesday’s argument offered only a few glimmers of hope for Ginsberg.

Justice Elena Kagan said she understood the frequent-flier program as offering a deal. “I always thought the way these agreements worked … was that if I flew a certain number of miles on your plan, I was going to get a free ticket,” she said. “It wasn’t a gift.... It was because I did something. I flew a certain number of miles. So there was an exchange with value on both sides.”

“Well, I suppose you could conceive of it that way,” said former U.S. Solicitor Gen. Paul D. Clement, representing Northwest. But he argued that the frequent-flier program was “basically a premium that’s offered by the company to reward your loyalty.”

Clement argued that the court should close the door to lawsuits like Ginsberg’s because they would allow judges and juries to decide whether the airlines acted fairly. “You can’t run a national — let alone international — airline if every one of your judgments about taking an unruly passenger off or taking out an abusive customer is going to be second-guessed by a jury applying reasonable standards of ordinary decency and morality.”

What about travelers who feel cheated? Clement said they could file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Transportation. He also said the free market would work to keep the airlines in check. “Airlines do not have an interest in getting rid of their most lucrative and loyal customers,” he said.

A decision is not expected for several months.

As Republican and Democratic leaders battled over procedure, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees negotiated behind the scenes on a compromise bill.

The measure is the first change to law governing sexual assault in the military in years, stemming from the furor that has erupted over the rising numbers of sexual assaults in the military; there were 3,553 sexual assault complaints reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year, a nearly 50 percent increase over the same period a year earlier.

The problem has drawn particular scrutiny in this Congress by the seven women on the Senate Armed Services Committee, who were divided on the best approach to contain the problem. “This agreement represents a huge win for justice in America’s armed forces,” said a joint statement from Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, and Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican from New Hampshire, who have both offered measures to combat sexual assault.

Ms. Gillibrand intends to move forward with her legislation to remove commanders as a stand-alone bill; Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, has assured her a vote.

House and Senate negotiators turned back Mr. Obama’s renewed push to close the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, extending a prohibition on the transfer of prisoners to the United States and forbidding the construction of facilities to house them. But they did loosen restrictions on the transfer of Guantánamo prisoners to other countries.

Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the change should ensure that about half the detainees still at the military prison will be transferred. Half will remain.

There was no guarantee that the remaining few days of this session will be smooth for the Pentagon bill, pending nominations or other matters that must be dealt with. Without a military policy bill, the Pentagon will no longer be able to offer combat pay to troops, re-enlistment bonuses or impact aid to local schools and governments near military bases, a cudgel that Armed Services leaders intended to use to force consideration of their measure."

(CNN) —

The political culture in Arizona, my home state, is often coarse, racialized and divisive. President Barack Obama’s visit there Tuesday gave the world another opportunity to see it. At times it seems as though the most bigoted individuals in America’s 48th state save their most raucous and prejudiced behavior for the 44th president.

The Arizona Republic reported that hundreds of dissenters chose to model their insulting and extremist behavior before some of Phoenix’s youngest residents. Assembled outside Desert Vista High School, they mocked Obama’s race, singing “Bye Bye Black Sheep” in spirited synchronization. One “patriot” went so far as to deprecate our commander in chief by pronouncing him “47 percent Negro,” while another, Deanne Bartram, held a sign that read, “Impeach the Half-White Muslim!”

Obama chose Desert Vista, home to some of Phoenix’s best and brightest students, to present his ideas for repairing America’s ailing mortgage finance apparatus. Some activists assembled to plead with the president to take more aggressive steps to combat climate change, such as renouncing the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Nevertheless, the overwhelming disposition of the angry horde was openly reminiscent of the Jim Crow South.

One of the most disturbing aspects of the anti-Obama protest was the inclination of some participants to fault the president for increased racial tensions. “We have gone back so many years,” Judy Burris told the Republic, insisting that Obama’s presence and policies have engendered a racist backlash. “He’s divided all the races. I hate him for that.”

This mind-bending perspective has become one of the leitmotifs of the racialized anti-Obama movement, which laments regressive race relations, but which attributes increased racial tensions in Obama’s “disruptive” and “exotic” presence, rather than their own racial stereotypes, hateful rhetoric and divisive behavior. Despite myriad efforts to foster civil dialogue in Arizona, the state has proven to be fertile ground for the kind of chauvinistic crusading that greeted Obama this week.

The idea that Obama has divided the races is farcical. As I wrote in a Republic essay in March, Time magazine announced the selection of Obama as its Person of the 2012 Year (for a second time) because, as Richard Stengel argued in his editorial preface, “We are in the midst of historic cultural and demographic changes, and Obama is both the symbol and in some ways the architect of this new America.” Obama deserved credit, he wrote, “for finding and forging a new majority, for turning weakness into opportunity and for seeking, amid great adversity, to create a more perfect union.”

However, nearly five years into Obama’s presidency, the politics of hope, optimism and racial equality that his campaign and election inspired have bumped into a new political reality marked by economic challenges, political acrimony and disillusionment. The resulting political backlash has triggered rancorous and racially charged clashes.

The rowdy gathering outside Desert Vista underscored the nature of race relations in the Obama age – evolving but oddly static in some ways – and the particularly bigoted shades of anti-Obama emotion in Arizona. If the age of Obama prophesied a more progressive, multifaceted and refined dialogue about American race relations, the vision has not been realized. Rather, many Americans, particularly xenophobic cliques such as the ones on display in my state, have recoiled back to a pre-civil rights-era temperament and increasingly overt racist outbursts.

As brazen as those in the Desert Vista crowd were, they are merely the most belligerent and public face of a legion of racist anti-Obama persons. These more discreet individuals are smart enough to cloak their racialized opposition in obstructionist maneuvering and public policy that does more damage to the lives of people of color than prejudiced banter. Still, the Desert Vista protest should give everyone pause and put us on high alert. The racist rhetoric heard there reflects inner beliefs and fears that have tremendous potential to do great harm.

Arizona leaders would be remiss in dismissing it as “fringe.” As civil rights activist Pauli Murray once cautioned, “Racism is like a deadly snake coiled and ready to strike, and one only avoids its dangers by never-ending watchfulness.”

http://news.yahoo.com/rubio-warns-obama-could-act-legalize-immigrants-195638391.html,,[],Rubio warns Obama could act to legalize immigrants,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio warned Tuesday that if Congress doesn't pass immigration overhaul legislation, President Barack Obama may act on his own to legalize the 11 million immigrants already in the U.S. illegally.

Rubio, a potential presidential candidate and an author of the sweeping immigration bill that passed the Senate in June but stalled in the House, noted that the Obama administration took action a year ago to give legal status to many immigrants brought here illegally as children. He said without congressional action, the president might well be tempted to do the same for everyone else here illegally, too.

""I believe that this president will be tempted, if nothing happens in Congress, he will be tempted to issue an executive order like he did for the DREAM Act kids a year ago where he basically legalizes 11 million people by the sign of a pen,"" Rubio said on ""The Morning Show with Preston Scott"" on Tallahassee radio station WFLA.

Rubio said the possibility highlighted the need for congressional action because the alternative would be legalization without benefits like border security and an E-Verify system to require employers to check their workers' legal status.

""We can't leave it, in my mind, the way it is because I think a year from now we could find ourselves with all 11 million people here legally under an executive order from the president, but no E-Verify, no more border security, no more border agents — none of the other reforms that we desperately need,"" Rubio said.

The White House disputed Rubio's comments.

Asked whether Obama would be ""tempted"" to issue executive orders as Rubio suggested, White House spokesman Bobby Whithorne said, ""No. The only solution to this problem is for Congress to fix the broken immigration system by passing comprehensive reform.""

Rubio's comments came with lawmakers back home in their districts for Congress' five-week summer recess, which activists on both sides of the immigration issue are trying to use to make their case for or against action in the GOP-controlled House.

Story continues

Under pressure from advocates for reform, several House Republicans have already indicated qualified support for a path to citizenship for the immigrants already here illegally, something that's part of the Senate bill but opposed by many conservatives. Meanwhile those opposed to reform struggled to draw a crowd to a ""Stop Amnesty Tour"" event in Richmond, Va., Monday night.

But it remains unclear whether one side will clearly prevail come time for lawmakers to return to Washington in September, or what will happen then. GOP House leaders have said they plan to proceed with the immigration issue with single-issue bills, beginning with border security, so it remains to be seen whether they'll get to the point of entering negotiations with the Senate on a package that could reach Obama's desk.

Rubio's comments Tuesday tracked with speculation sometimes heard from immigration activists on the left about how to move forward if Congress never sends Obama a bill. The possibility of pressuring Obama to take additional executive actions has been discussed, though most advocates with ties to the White House say it's premature to focus on that idea.

(CNN) —

A row of 12 coffins, each draped with a flag, symbolizes the human cost of an explosion that destroyed much of a small Texas town and left the residents of that town searching for answers.

Hundreds of firefighters from across the nation and other first-responders joined grieving families and President Barack Obama and the first lady at the Ferrell Center in Waco, site of a memorial service Thursday for some of the people killed in a fertilizer plant explosion last week in the nearby town of West.

The president told the crowd that no words adequately describe the courage displayed by those who died.

“What I can do is offer the love and support and prayers of the nation,” Obama said.

Obama told the families and friends of the those killed that they were not forgotten, saying “our hearts have been here in your time of tribulation.”

He promised them the nation will help them rebuild and reclaim their small community of about 3,000 people.

Before the president and first lady Michelle Obama joined the residents of West at the service at Baylor University, the president’s helicopter flew over West and circled several times over the flattened structures and scarred earth.

The Obamas met privately with the families after the service.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry promised the families of the first-responders who died that their loved ones would not be forgotten.

“First-responders know better than anyone that there’s no such thing as a routine emergency,” Perry told the crowd, “but it didn’t slow them down as they raced toward that burning factory.”

Perry urged the families to remember that “the spirit that drove those men we love – they live on” and asked the crowd to “let their deeds serve as an inspiration” to service of others.

The families of the victims recorded emotional video tributes that were played during the service. Some were somber, some were mixed with light-hearted memories. All drew tears.

“Cyrus always hated the word ‘hero,’” said Bryce Reed, whose brother was attending a EMT class when the fire that preceded the explosion began. “He and I shared the belief that heroes are persons (whose names) are etched in marble. And that a hero is a sacred and solemn term reserved for only those who paid the ultimate price when others would falter or run.

“My brother would disagree, but I firmly believe that all privy to this incident can attest that my brother and all those who lay with him are heroes now and forever.”

Earlier, as the service began, everyone in the arena stood in complete silence as family and friends of the victims filed in. Some of the family members wept as they passed the flag-draped coffins – 10 with American flags and two with Texas flags – and photos in front of each one.

Family members hugged one another when they arrived at their seats.

The service – which honored the 10 first-responders killed April 17 and two friends of first-responders who also answered the call – included roll call as the name of each victim was read, followed by one toll from a bell. An officer at the foot of each coffin saluted.

Then the bell rang five times, paused, rang five more times, paused again, and rang a final five times to signal the fallen had answered their final call.

Each family was given a flag and a helmet in remembrance. A bagpiper played “Amazing Grace.”

In all, 14 people were killed by the blast, including two other people who died in their apartment nearby.

Before Thursday’s service, emotions were raw in Waco, the central Texas city about 20 miles south of the scene of the blast.

Many onlookers cried as they lined the street outside as a procession of fire trucks slowly passed. One man held a large Texas flag, bowed his head and rested a cowboy hat over his heart.

Hundreds of bikers from the Patriot Guard stood at attention as the rescue vehicles passed by.

Before leaving Washington, Obama signed a proclamation ordering all flags in the state to be flown at half-staff for the day.

City workers from Waco replaced West workers Thursday so they could attend funerals and take a break from trying to repair the city’s water system and cleaning up the town.

On Wednesday, an American flag was raised and a bugler played taps at a memorial service at the blast site. A few miles away, one of the victims, Kenneth “Luckey” Harris Jr., was laid to rest. Harris, a 52-year-old Dallas firefighter who lived in West, was one of the first-responders who died. One of the coffins at Thursday’s service represented Harris.

Hundreds of firefighters from Dallas and other areas surrounding West came for the funeral, the first to be held for the responders killed in the blast. Firefighters lined the sidewalk as Harris’ flag-draped coffin was carried out and loaded into the back of a Dallas fire truck to be carried to the cemetery. Bagpipes played as the coffin went through the crowd.

Before and after: Texas plant explosion

The investigation continues

“Shovel by shovel,” investigators are combing through the charred remains of the leveled fertilizer distributor after the April 17 explosion in West.

Much of the landscape surrounding the West Fertilizer Co. in West, Texas, is unrecognizable. What was once a corn silo appears to have crumpled in the force of the blast. A blue tarp covers the shell of a rail car.

Left is a crater nearly 100 feet wide and 10 feet deep that was once the site of a building. The crater is now filled with mangled metal and crumbs of mortar. Concrete chunks – some the size of shopping carts – are strewn hundreds of yards away from the blast site.

Losses from the explosion will probably top $100 million, said Mark Hanna, a spokesman for the Insurance Council of Texas.

But amid the devastation, forensic mappers are hoping to find clues.

Hundreds of small pink flags indicate anything on the ground that crews want forensic investigators to take a closer look at.

Officials face a difficult task in reconstructing the fire that preceded the deadly explosion. Still unknown: what types of chemicals and in what quantities were stored at the facility.

Putting the pieces together

One official likened the investigation to a jigsaw puzzle.

“Right now, think of that coffee table where all 100 pieces are gathered around,” Brian Hoback, an official with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told the San-Antonio Express News. “Now, we’re going to pull them together.”

ATF Special Agent in Charge Robert Champion said determining what started the initial fire is “the key.”

“We feel the explosion was caused by the fire so we’ve got to determine what the cause and the origin of the fire was, and that’s why we’re … attempting to re-enact that fire scene,” Champion said. “A fire scene is complicated in itself. But you compound that with an explosion and it really complicates the issue.”

So far, investigators have ruled out the possibility that natural causes ignited the fire.

That would be the case if they attempt to pass a slimmed-down bill without any path to citizenship. Republicans have been claiming they can do that, but I still think it’s unlikely. Such a bill would probably get very few Democratic votes — perhaps none at all. Meanwhile, if the bill were generous at all toward immigrants it would almost certainly lose those Republican members who oppose immigration reform of any kind; if it was harsh toward immigrants it would presumably lose moderates and those conservatives who believe that support for immigration is the proper conservative position. Either way, it’s hard to see them getting to 218 with only Republicans."

Jeremiah Wright — the controversial former pastor to President Barack Obama — was indicted today in an expanding federal probe of a state grant tied to a former suburban police chief.



Jeri Wright of Hazel Crest is accused of helping former Country Club Hills Police Chief Regina Evans convert fake paychecks from Evans’ nonprofit to Evans’ personal use, allegedly hiding money that was supposed to be used to train minority and female workers in the building trades.



Federal prosecutors in the Illinois’ central district say Jeri Wright received about $28,000 in grant-tied paychecks in 2009, but $20,000 of that was deposited back into accounts controlled by Evans. Prosecutors also say Wright then lied to officers and a grand jury.



The charges emerge about a year after Evans was charged with fraud in relation to a $1.25 million job training grant awarded to her nonprofit, We Are Our Brothers Keeper.

Evans and her husband are accused of siphoning money from the grant to pay friends and relatives and cover the mortgage on their landmark New Regal Theater on Chicago’s South Side — a venue they said they were trying to restore to its former glory as a cultural hub for the struggling area.



Evans, also a former Chicago police lieutenant, resigned as Country Club Hills police chief in 2011. Evans, through an attorney, has said she didn’t do anything wrong.



Jeri Wright, 47, faces two counts of money laundering, two counts of making false statements to officers and seven counts of giving false grand jury testimony. She couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.



An attorney for Evans confirmed Jeri Wright is the daughter of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, the pastor emeritus of the south side Trinity United Church of Christ, which Obama attended.

Bradley Manning's defense wanted all charges dismissed

If convicted of aiding the enemy, he could face life behind bars

WikiLeaks case involves thousands of war logs leaked

FORT MEADE, Md. (AP) — An Army private suspected of sending reams of classified documents to the secret-sharing WikiLeaks website was illegally punished at a Marine Corps brig and should get 112 days cut from any prison sentence he receives if convicted, a military judge ruled Tuesday.

Army Col. Denise Lind ruled during a pretrial hearing that authorities went too far in their strict confinement of Pfc. Bradley Manning for nine months in a Marine Corps brig in Quantico, Va., in 2010 and 2011. Manning was confined to a windowless cell 23 hours a day, sometimes with no clothing. Brig officials said it was to keep him from hurting himself or others.

Lind said Manning's confinement was ""more rigorous than necessary."" She added that the conditions ""became excessive in relation to legitimate government interests.""

Manning faces 22 charges, including aiding the enemy, which carries a maximum sentence of life behind bars. His trial begins March 6.

The 25-year-old intelligence analyst had sought to have the charges thrown out, arguing the conditions were egregious. Military prosecutors had recommended a seven-day sentence reduction, conceding Manning was improperly kept for that length of time on highly restrictive suicide watch, contrary to a psychiatrist's recommendation.

Lind rejected a defense contention that brig commanders were influenced by higher-ranking Marine Corps officials at Quantico or the Pentagon.

Manning showed no reaction as Lind read her decision. He fidgeted when the judge took the bench to announce her ruling, sometimes tapping his chin or mouth with a pen and frequently glancing at his attorney's notepad, but those movements tapered off during the hour and 45 minutes it took the judge to read the lengthy opinion.

Mike McKee, one of about a dozen Manning supporters in the courtroom, said he was disappointed. He called the ruling ""very conservative,"" although he said he didn't expect the charges to be thrown out.

""I don't find it a victory,"" McKee said. ""Credit like that becomes much less valuable if the sentence turns out to be 80 years.""

Jeff Paterson of the Bradley Manning Support Network, which is funding Manning's defense, said the sentencing credit ""doesn't come close to compensating Bradley"" for his harsh treatment.

""The ruling is not strong enough to give the military pause before mistreating the next American soldier awaiting trial,"" Paterson wrote in an email.

Lind ruled on the first day of a scheduled four-day hearing at Fort Meade, near Baltimore.

The hearing is partly to determine whether Manning's motivation matters. Prosecutors want the judge to bar the defense from producing evidence at trial regarding his motive for allegedly leaking hundreds of thousands of secret war logs and diplomatic cables. They say motive is irrelevant to whether he leaked intelligence, knowing it would be seen by al-Qaida

Manning allegedly told an online confidant-turned-informant that he leaked the material because ""I want people to see the truth"" and ""information should be free.""

Defense attorney David Coombs said Tuesday that barring such evidence would cripple the defense's ability to argue that Manning leaked only information that he believed couldn't hurt the United States or help a foreign nation.

Manning has offered to take responsibility for the leaks in a pending plea offer but he still could face trial on charges such as aiding the enemy.

The Crescent, Okla., native is accused of leaking classified Iraq and Afghanistan war logs and more than 250,000 diplomatic cables while working as an intelligence analyst in Baghdad in 2009 and 2010. He is also charged with leaking 2007 video of a U.S. helicopter crew gunning down 11 men, including a Reuters news photographer and his driver. The Pentagon concluded the troops acted appropriately, having mistaken the camera equipment for weapons.

Manning supporters consider him a whistleblower whose actions exposed war crimes and helped trigger the pro-democracy Arab Spring uprisings in late 2010."

Story highlights Some progressives dismayed with compromises and slow pace of change in Obama years Despite the evident frustration, there were no hints of outright anger about President Obama ""Sometimes the administration is standing in the way ... ,"" one Netroots participant says

(CNN) —

Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and Democratic firebrand, stood behind a podium at the San Jose Convention Center and neatly summed up the current zeitgeist of the left.

“Is the president perfect?” Dean asked a buzzing audience of left-leaning bloggers, political activists and organizers on Thursday evening. “No. But it sure is better than having Bain Capital, I mean Mitt Romney, in there.”

Dean’s growling joke crystallized the prevailing liberal sentiment about President Barack Obama as the curtain rose on Netroots Nation, the annual progressive conference started in 2006 by the creators of the Daily Kos, a popular left-leaning blog and founding member of an online grass-roots movement that eventually helped lift Obama into the White House.

From the left, Dean open to presidential run

Obama the senator made a pilgrimage to the 2007 conference, then called Yearly Kos, and charmed the assembled bloggers as he mounted what seemed an impossible primary campaign against Hillary Clinton.

In 2013, Obama the president sent a YouTube video. He wasn’t exactly missed.

On a host of issues from National Security Agency surveillance to Wall Street reform to foreclosure assistance to the Keystone XL pipeline debate, the more than 2,000 activists in San Jose for the eighth Netroots Nation expressed dismay about the compromises and slow pace of progress that have so far marked Obama’s tenure in the White House.

“If George Bush was in there, I’d more frustrated,” said Tony Alexander, political director for a local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. “But we have Barack Obama, so it’s a little less frustrating.”

But frustrating nonetheless.

To many here, the hard-won battles of the 2012 campaign have not yielded much at all.

“We are in the middle of foreclosure crisis, and we haven’t seen any real action on principal reduction, and we haven’t seen any of the banks get prosecuted for some of things that were supposedly under investigation,” said Liz Butler, a fellow at the Movement Strategy Center, a social justice organization. “A lot of us have concerns within the progressive, social justice and environmental movement about the lack of action on a whole set of issues.”

Scott Paul, a self-described “labor Democrat” and president of the nonpartisan Alliance for American Manufacturing, pointed to Obama’s promise at the Democratic National Convention to create 1 million new manufacturing jobs by the end of his second term.

’The American people want to believe in something’

“The first five months are in, and there is virtually no job creation, so they are already way behind on manufacturing,” said Paul, who was enticing conference-goers to his display in the Netroots Nation exhibition hall with classic arcade games such as Galaga and Pac-Man. “How much of it was rhetorical? A lot of it was, clearly.”

Across the hall from Paul’s display, staffers from the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a 1 million-member advocacy group founded by two former MoveOn.org organizers, was doing a brisk business handing out blue-and-white bumper stickers declaring, “I’m from the Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party.”

Warren, the senator from Massachusetts who endeared herself to the left by pushing for student loan reform and greater Wall Street regulation, long ago surpassed Obama as a darling of the left, said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.

The president’s attempt to pass sweeping gun control legislation after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School offered a glimmer of hope for liberals, Green said, but that soon faded.

“The American people want to believe in something, someone, and there are moments like the gun debate when the president did what progressives wanted all along, which is propose the boldest possible bill and barnstorm the country fighting for it,” he said.

“But on things like foreclosures, and even jobs, there is the absence of a policy. On some things he is just wrong, and on other things he is just absent. Why isn’t he giving a speech on jobs every single week? Why isn’t he owning that issue? He is almost treating his presidency like he is treading water. There are people who want to rally behind his leadership if he is willing to lead, but he is not.”

Obama recorded a video message for the conference that ran during the opening night of speeches on Thursday. It was sandwiched between the address by Dean and another by Sandra Fluke, the attorney and women’s rights activist who became a Democratic celebrity during the 2012 presidential race when radio talker Rush Limbaugh called her a “slut” for advocating for greater access to contraceptives.

“We won’t always agree on everything, and I know you’ll tell me when we don’t, but if we work together, I am confident we will keep moving this country forward,” Obama said in the video, which was met by tepid applause though it highlighted accomplishments such as increasing home sales and passing an extension of the Violence Against Women Act.

The president’s complicated relationship with his party’s activist wing is, in a certain sense, as institutional as it is ideological. Every president, liberal or conservative, has been forced to make compromises that rankled even his most loyal supporters.

Left has long record of restlessness

But Obama’s other challenge is that the political left has long had a knack for restlessness, even with one of its own occupying the Oval Office.

Until the second term of President George W. Bush exposed his party’s fault lines, Republicans for decades had a prized tradition of marching in lockstep with party leadership, especially when the GOP held the White House.

The Democratic Party, meanwhile, is routinely disparaged – even by its own professional class in Washington – as less a party than a feuding and loosely affiliated federation of special interests and demographic groups: organized labor, abortion rights supporters, environmentalists, racial minorities, students and others.

“Every president has to operate within the framework of a lot of competing interests and organizations that are supporting or against him, especially Democrats,” said Jann Dorothy, a Netroots attendee from Sacramento, California, who is supportive of the president. “He has to always balance the various constituencies that are out there. It’s a bit like herding cats.”

Dorothy said that “a lot of people here are frustrated, very upset” about the NSA surveillance and data collection programs that former contractor Edward Snowden revealed this month.

Obama’s approval rating has slipped in the wake of revelations about his administration’s sweeping surveillance programs, but Democrats continue to give him high marks. A CNN/ORC International poll from this week shows Obama’s approval rating among Democrats at 83%, down six percentage points from last month. Among liberals the rating fell three points to 75%

CNN Poll: Obama numbers fall into generation gap

But the lanyard-wearing Netroots crowd bristled at party labels. They were more likely to identify themselves with a particular cause – opposing the Keystone pipeline, for instance, or halting forced deportations of illegal immigrants. Breakout sessions at the conference largely focused on tactical matters such as media strategy and grass-roots organizing, not passing Obama’s political agenda.

“I don’t think there is a terribly strong allegiance to the Democratic Party here,” Dean said in an interview with CNN.

It is a demanding bunch. Everyone who came to Netroots arrived with a pet issue or two, but it was difficult on the conference’s first day to find anyone who said the president had done enough to satisfy his or her demands.

The exceptions to that rule were supporters of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, who applauded the president for backing same-sex marriage and said the administration has accomplished most of what they wanted.

Still, many questions about the president from a reporter were met with shrugs and the occasional eye roll.

The tension revealed itself in a roundtable session Thursday morning with leaders from Organizing for Action, a grass-roots advocacy group that sprang from Obama’s last campaign.

Does group exist only to push Obama’s agenda?

The group seeks to pressure members of Congress to back the White House’s agenda, largely through local media events and partnerships with sympathetic interest groups such as Planned Parenthood.

But several activists who attended the roundtable pointedly questioned the group’s executive director, Jon Carson, about its mission: Is its goal just to help Obama get his agenda passed? Or does it care about other progressive issues that don’t quite jell with Obama’s objectives?

The topic of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport crude oil reserves from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, was repeatedly broached. Several attendees doubted Organizing for Action’s sincerity on climate change given the president’s punting on a decision on construction of the 1,700-mile pipeline.

“Sometimes the administration is standing in the way of the agenda we all voted for,” one participant said.

Carson gamely tried to manage the situation.

“I think what I would say is, we do partnerships primarily on specific actions,” he said. “That’s what we are offering. We wouldn’t ask anyone, ‘Let’s make sure 100% of our agenda lines up before we go yell at (Sen.) Kelly Ayotte before her vote on background checks.’ But when we do line up our agendas on what we care about, we will find at least 80% matching.”

Sara El-Amine, the group’s national organizing director, said, “We can’t be all things to everyone.”

Despite the evident frustration, there were no hints of outright anger about Obama among the convention participants. He is still their president, and as Dean pointed out, it could be much worse.

Former Obama campaign staffers wandered the hallways sharing hugs with friends in the blogger community, and Obama T-shirts are a frequent sight on the backs of conference-goers. Booze-soaked parties are as much a part of the agenda as networking and political organizing. The 2016 presidential race and discussions about putative front-runner Hillary Clinton are only conversation topics when brought up by reporters.

Stop Hillary effort launches

The anxiety here is hard to define, but it might have something to do with the fact that liberals find themselves in the unusual position of being two-time winners on a grand scale.

For a progressive movement that started as an underdog insurgency fighting back against the powerful Bush administration, it’s kind of weird to be on top for five years running. These activists crashed the gate a long time ago. Their ambitions are a bit less sweeping, more prosaic and narrowly focused.

“It’s exciting to be coming together after we all performed really well as a party,” said Jess McIntosh, a spokeswoman for Emily’s List, a group that supports female Democratic candidates. “We ran really good candidates; we had really good issues and we won. So I think now we all get to stand around and talk about what do we do with a win, which might not be the most natural position for everybody here."

Washington (CNN) - The tea party is more unpopular than ever, according to a new national poll that also suggests that even many Republicans now view the grass-roots conservative movement in a negative light.

A Pew Research Center survey released Wednesday also indicates that Sen. Ted Cruz, one of the ringleaders of the conservative push to tie dismantling the national health care law to the funding of the federal government, has seen his popularity jump among tea party Republicans and drop among non-tea party GOPers.



According to the poll, which was conducted October 9 through Sunday, 49% of Americans said they have a negative view of the tea party, a slight rise of four percentage points from June. Three in 10 questioned said they see the tea party in a positive light, down seven points from June.

The tea party movement was born in early 2009 to protest the Wall Street bailouts initiated under President George W. Bush a few months earlier. It also opposed the stimulus and other economic and health care policies of President Barack Obama, who succeeded Bush in the White House.

The poll indicates the drop in favorable views of the tea party is not coming just from Democrats and independents.

""The Tea Party’s favorability rating has fallen across most groups since June, but the decline has been particularly dramatic among moderate and liberal Republicans. In the current survey, just 27% of moderate and liberal Republicans have a favorable impression of the Tea Party, down from 46% in June,"" a release from the Pew Research Center said.

Cruz has become much more visible during the shutdown and the showdown leading up the shutdown. And the poll indicates Cruz's popularity among tea party Republicans has soared, from 47% in July to 74% now. But among those who say they are non-tea party Republicans, the freshman senator from Texas and possible 2016 GOP White House contender's unfavorable rating jumped from 16% to 31%.

The Pew Research Center poll was conducted October 9 to 13, with 1,504 adults nationwide - including 655 Republicans and independents who lean toward the GOP - questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.

Carnival Cruise Lines says it will take up to five hours for everyone to disembark

One passenger says conditions not so bad, others disagree

Most say crew members have done great job after the ship was disabled by an engine fire

Finally, after days of listing on a disabled Carnival cruise ship without electricity and working toilets, thousands of passengers finished disembarking early Friday morning at the Port of Mobile.

The frustration that many felt was typified by Janie Esparza, one of the first passengers to get back on land.

""It was horrible. Horrible,"" Esparza told a scrum of reporters. ""The bathroom facilities were horrible and we could not flush toilets. No electricity and our rooms were in total darkness. Honestly, think that this ship should have ever sailed out.""

The Carnival Triumph, became a major media story, when it caught fire off the coast of Mexico. The blaze left the vessel listing to the side, drifting in Gulf of Mexico currents and the more than 4,200 passengers and crew on board in limbo. It took five days for the ship to dock at the Alabama Cruise Terminal, three days after it was due.

Family members cheered as the ship pulled in and in the crowd also was Carnival CEO Gerry Cahill. The CEO had his own message for the weary passengers: Sorry.

""We pride ourselves in providing our guests with a great vacation experience, and clearly we failed in this particular case,"" he said.

The beleaguered CEO went on the ship as passengers departed and delivered another apology.

But for some, like passenger Norma Reyes, it was too little too late.

""The hallways were toxic,"" said Reyes, who said she would never go on a Carnival cruise again. ""Full of urine. It was horrible. If that ship caught on fire and they had not contained it where would we be? Floating in the ocean or dead.""

Others were more forgiving.

""They did a good job of managing expectations,"" said Brett Klausman. ""The information that trickled out was probably well thought out to kind of keep people safe and calm.""

Despite the ordeal, many passengers had nothing but praise for the crew, saying they had worked long shifts to make sure their guests were as comfortable as possible.

""No power, no toilets, nothing. Nothing. I mean, it was was disgusting, but the staff, they did such an amazing job,"" said Joseph Alvarez. ""And I give them so much props because they were amazing through it all. I mean, they worked their tails off to accommodate everybody's needs.""

U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, Coast Guard members and a Carnival team boarded the ship before it arrived in port to help speed efforts to get passengers off as quickly as possible, he said.

Some families gathered at the Alabama Cruise Terminal, far from where the ship was originally supposed to dock in Galveston, Texas. Marissa Jenks said her family reported they had a hot meal Thursday morning and crew members were trying to clean up the ship as it neared port.

Boredom and stress

At some point during the ordeal urine and feces streamed in the halls and down walls after toilet facilities failed, soaking the mattress of a friend of his who was sleeping in a hallway, said Larry Poret.

Emergency power failures caused section doors to slam shut, panicking some passengers who had no idea what was happening.

""We definitely (were) not adequately informed,"" Poret said.

Poret said toilets on the ship worked on and off, but were too inconsistent to trust.

He said waste tipped out of some commodes and sloshed across floors as the ship listed to the side.

""It runs down the walls from one floor to the next. It's running out of somebody's bathroom out into the hallway all the way across,"" he said.

Long lines for food and frequent delays were constantly aggravating, he said.

""Here we are looking for hope that, hey it's 6 o'clock, it's going to get better,"" he said. ""And 6 o'clock comes and goes and all of a sudden an announcement at 8, 'Hey, we're running behind schedule.' Well, no joke.""

The incident aboard the ship scared Poret's daughter and a friend taking the cruise with her, Poret said.

""As soon as you get them calmed down, the electric goes out and doors start slamming shut,"" he said.

During less stressful times, passengers passed the hours playing cards, walking the deck and going to see what was happening on other areas of the ship, Poret said.

Passengers set up charging stations to help their fellow passengers juice up cell phones and other devices, he said.

The final trip home

Carnival promised an army of about 200 employees would take care of its passengers once they cleared customs.

Passengers boarded buses to Galveston, where the cruise originated, or Houston, or went to spend the night in a hotel in New Orleans.

Carnival said it had reserved about 100 motor coaches, more than 1,500 New Orleans hotel rooms, multiple charter flights from New Orleans to Houston on Friday and transportation from Houston to the Port of Galveston so that guests may retrieve their cars if they drove to the port.

Carnival officials had initially planned to tow the ship to a Mexican port, but after Gulf currents pushed it farther north before tugboats could take control, and considering that 900 of the passengers do not have passports, the company decided to take the Carnival Triumph to Mobile instead, where it can be repaired.

Compensation for travelers

The cruise line said it would give each passenger $500, a free flight home, a full refund for their trip and for most expenses on board, as well as a credit for another cruise.

The Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation into the cause of the engine room fire. Because the Carnival Triumph is a Bahamian-flagged vessel, the Bahamas Maritime Authority is the primary investigative agency.

Travelers have few options for compensation in these cases, other than what the cruise line is already offering, according to travel expert Jason Clampet of Skift.com , a travel website.

""The passengers on the ship aren't going to have a great deal of recourse when they get home,"" he said. Travel ""insurance really doesn't cover this sort of thing. Their trip wasn't interrupted and they aren't incurring extra expenses ... so they can't be compensated that way.""

Still, there's no denying that the fire and resulting bad PR will hurt Carnival.

""It's a terrible sight, thinking of people trapped on a ship with limited food and filthy conditions, so I think people will think twice about taking a cruise,"" Clampet said.

Bad luck before

The fire is at least the second problem for the ship since late January, when it had an issue with its propulsion system, according to a notice posted on the website of Carnival senior cruise director John Heald.

It's also not the first fire to disable one of the cruise line's ships.

In 2010, the Carnival cruise ship Splendor lost power after an engine room fire, leaving it drifting off the Pacific coast of Mexico. The USS Ronald Reagan ferried 60,000 pounds of supplies for the ship's passengers and crew as the ship was towed to San Diego.

After this ill-fated cruise, the Carnival Triumph won't host vacationing passengers until at least mid-April. Carnival has canceled a dozen voyages scheduled between February 21 and April 13. That makes a total of 14 scratched trips. The cruise line already had eliminated voyages slated for February 11 and February 16."

What Communists?,"On Wednesday, Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) joined nearly two thousand trade unionists, open communists, socialists, anarchists and illegal aliens at Chicago’s May Day march and rally.

Two large rally demonstrations that began at Union Park and Chicago’s Haymarket Riot monument converged into a giant march that shut down traffic for miles, and ended at Federal Plaza where they were joined by Senator Durbin.

Durbin made remarks to the red, yellow and black flag waving crowd about “immigration reform.” Opening with “My fellow immigrants,” Durbin told the crowd “this is a once in a lifetime chance” to get “immigration reform.”

Following his speech, I spoke to the senator about his participation:

(May Day is apparently also Law Day in America, but after covering the last three May Day marches in Chicago, I have never heard about Law Day, at any of the marches or elsewhere.)

Durbin then mounted a rather bizarre defense of his participation in the rally–on free speech grounds:

Rebelpundit: There is a large contingent of Communist Party USA, anarchists, international socialist groups here today that you just spoke to… Durbin: How do you know that? Rebelpundit: Because I’ve filmed them all day, and you just spoke to them, so I’d like to ask about your participation, why you decided to come out today? Durbin: Well let me just say something, because [pause] I believe in the Constitution. Do you believe in it? Rebelpundit: Because you believe in the Constitution you decided to come out to a rally full of communists and socialists? Durbin: And you know why? Rebelpundit: Why? Durbin: Because we have freedom of speech in America, and that’s why you can record this and not be arrested. RebelPundit: You think I should be arrested? Durbin: No, not at all, you have a right to your constitutional rights, and I do, too.

Of course, Durbin could go to a Nazi or KKK rally, too–but does that mean, as a United States Senator, he should?

USA TODAY Sports

Gildan New Mexico Bowl in Albuquerque

Colorado State (7-6)vs. Washington State (6-6)

Time/TV: 2 p.m. ET/ESPN.

Surface: Artificial.

Glantz-Culver line: WSU by 4½. Sagarin difference: WSU by 14.38.

Bowl records: WSU 6-4, CSU 5-7. Series: First meeting.

Synopsis: The bowl season gets off to its traditional start in the Land of Enchantment. The Rams should be familiar with the environs, having beaten usual tenant New Mexico on the same field Nov. 16. The Cougars, in their first bowl game since 2003, figure to provide CSU more of a challenge. WSU's up-and-down season has hinged on the play of QB Connor Halliday, who has amassed a lofty 4,187 yards in the Mike Leach offense with 28 TDs but 21INTs. If his throws go as intended, WRs Gabe Marks, Vince Mayle and Dom Williams will be the beneficiaries. But if he is bothered, it will likely be because of Rams LB Shaquil Barrett, the Mountain West defensive player of the year who recorded 12 sacks and 201/2 total tackles for loss. The CSU offense is more balanced, though it generally operates through TB Kapri Bibbs. He has rushed for 1,572 yards and 28 TDs. QB Garrett Grayson is capable of lending aerial support, but he'll have to watch out for Cougars S Deone Bucannon."

Conrad Alvin Barrett, 27, is charged with violating the federal Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the Justice Department said. The complaint alleges that Barrett, of Katy, near Houston, attacked the man Nov. 24, recorded the assault on his cellphone and showed the video to others.

The complaint says Barrett made several videos, including one in which he identifies himself and another in which he makes a racial slur. It also says Barrett had been working up to playing the knockout game for about a week.

According to the complaint, Barrett says in the video that “the plan is to see if I were to hit a black person, would this be nationally televised?”

The knockout game has been known by a variety of names since it came to public notice about 1992. Essentially, a person abruptly attacks a defenseless victim, trying to knock him out with a single blow. Nothing is stolen, and no other crime is reported. Recently, incidents have taken on a deeper dimension because perpetrators record the attacks, often by cellphone video, and some of those videos go viral.

In one video that caused a sensation in late November, a white Pennsylvania teacher is seen walking in broad daylight when a sucker punch from a teenager among a group of black youths sends him to the concrete. The 50-year-old teacher recovered.

Random assaults on strangers simply to knock them out have been reported over the years in St. Louis; Washington, D.C.; Syracuse, N.Y.; and Chicago, among other areas. In Jersey City, N.J., two 13-year-olds and a 14-year-old were charged as juveniles in the murder of Ralph Eric Santiago, 46, who was found Sept. 10 with his neck broken and his head wedged between iron fence posts. Prosecutors contend the youths were playing the knockout game.

In late May in Syracuse, a group of teenagers attempted to knock out a man with a single punch but wound up beating and stomping him to death, authorities say. A 16-year-old was convicted of manslaughter, and his 13-year-old codefendant pleaded guilty to assault. Both were sentenced to 18 months behind bars.

Earlier in May, Elex Murphy, now 20, was sentenced to life in prison plus 25 years for killing a Vietnamese immigrant in St. Louis as part the game in 2011.

In New York City, at least one man was recently charged with a hate-crime assault in one of several attacks against Jews in Brooklyn. African American civil rights leaders have condemned the attacks as cowardly.

“These kids are targeting innocent people and in many cases specifically targeting Jewish folks,” the Rev. Al Sharpton, a television host and civil rights leader, said this month. He called on young people to stop playing the knockout game. “We would not be silent if it were the other way around, and we will not be silent now,” he said. “This behavior is racist, period. And we will not tolerate it.”

Many experts argue that such attacks are rare, if the game exists at all. But the incidents generate a high degree of fear because they are so random. The rapid dissemination of videos through social media can prompt copycat crimes, law enforcement officials say.

“Suspected crimes of this nature will simply not be tolerated,” U.S. Atty. Kenneth Magidson of the Southern District of Texas said in a statement as he announced the charges against Barrett. “Evidence of hate crimes will be vigorously investigated and prosecuted with the assistance of all our partners to the fullest extent of the law.”

Authorities accuse Barrett of hitting the elderly man with enough force that he immediately fell to the ground. They say Barrett laughed and said “knockout” as he ran to his vehicle and fled.

The victim had two jaw fractures and was hospitalized for several days, the Justice Department said.

“It is unimaginable in this day and age that one could be drawn to violently attack another based on the color of their skin,” said Stephen L. Morris, FBI special agent in charge of the Houston division. “We remind all citizens that we are protected under the law from such racially motivated attacks, and encourage everyone to report such crimes to the FBI.”

If convicted, Barrett could face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

At Hal’s Bar & Grill here on Abbot Kinney Boulevard, he was recounting how he had recently bought 15 of them for a village in Sierra Leone, where he has been a chief, known as Gondobay Manga II, since 2006.

“Their meat is low in cholesterol, they’re a sturdy animal, they’ve been around since the beginning of time,” said Mr. Washington, who rode his black 21-speed bicycle from his home just down the street. “And they’re delicious.”

If you didn’t know that Mr. Washington was a chief in Sierra Leone, let alone that he’s buying goats for a village there, well, that’s understandable. Since being fired from the ABC series “Grey’s Anatomy” in 2007, after he reportedly used a homophobic slur during an on-set argument, and later repeated the slur backstage at the Golden Globes, this 50-year-old actor and married father of three has kept a low profile, at least in Hollywood circles.

But this year Mr. Washington is making something of a comeback. After spending a good chunk of the past six years off camera, he’s excited to talk about his coming projects, even as his conversation skitters from topics as varied as his recent trip to Rwanda, the globalization of hip-hop and why love and hate are really just two sides of the same coin. He recently starred in the Old West shoot-’em-up “They Die by Dawn,” alongside Michael K. Williams and Rosario Dawson, and plays Chancellor Jaha, leader of the few surviving humans, in the coming CW sci-fi series “The 100.”"

The Washingtonian also ""hears"" that photographer Annie Leibovitz is doing the honors, and that it might be for the March issue's cover.

Another tantalizing tidbit: President Obama's schedule is cleared for the day... meaning maybe he's involved in the shoot, too? Squeee!

The Washingtonian couldn't get a word out of Vogue reps, so no confirmation yet. But clearly the Obamas aren't opposed to posing for Vogue: Michelle Obama famously posed for the March 2009 cover with bare arms (!). The Obama family has also been snapped by Annie Leibovitz before for their official family portait in 2009, which was super adorable.

Will this upcoming Vogue shoot be a group photo with the kids? A loving couple portrait with the President and First Lady? A solo glam shot with Michelle alone? We're on the edge of our seats, waiting to find out...

Pentagon may fold historic newspaper,"Stars and Stripes — the venerable military publication that has chronicled the heroism of America's fighting men and women since the Civil War — could be on the budget-strapped Pentagon's chopping block.

The Department of Defense, which subsidizes the newspaper to the tune of $7.4 million per year, is considering a range of spending cuts that could also affect the Pentagon Channel and some programming at the American Forces Network. But word that it could shutter a proud paper read by generations of soldiers left at least one former military man disappointed.

[pullquote]

""I think it would be a terrible mistake, I really do,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told the newspaper. ""The men and women who are serving get a lot of their information this way. It’s a great conduit to spread information to the men and women who are serving all over the world.”

Stars and Stripes, which has been published continuously since World War II, currently produces its print edition Monday through Thursday, with a special weekend edition on Friday for Europe and the Pacific. It also publishes a separate Mideast edition Friday through Sunday. Roughly 200,000 people read the print edition daily, according to its website.

More On This...

Officials from the Pentagon's Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation Office told the newspaper that the entire Department of Defense is now being scrutinized as part of an exhaustive spending review ordered by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. Ironically, it was the paper itself which broke the news when officials said its presses could be stopped.

“In this budget environment, we’re looking at everything,” Navy Cmdr. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the cost assessment office, told Stars and Stripes.

Max Lederer, publisher of Stars and Stripes, said budget officials have made unprecedented requests for information, including hypothetical cuts, without being told why the review was under way.

“When you get asked questions in a vacuum, you get concerned,” Lederer told the newspaper, which mains editorial independence under federal law and has a civilian ombudsman who answers to Congress.

While the newspaper is subsidized, most of its budget comes from advertising, newspaper sales and other staff-generated revenue.

The first version of the newspaper was produced during the Civil War in 1861 by Union soldiers who used the facilities of a captured newspaper plant in Bloomfield, Mo., where they ran off a one-page paper. That publication would only appear four times, but the Stars and Stripes moniker would later be revived in World War I, appearing in Paris on Feb. 8, 1918. The weekly was produced at the time by an all-military staff to serve the American Expeditionary Force under General of the Armies John J. “Black Jack” Pershing and stopped printing after the war ended.

During World War II, Stars and Stripes published as many as 32 distinct editions, with up to 24 pages per issue. At one point, it had 25 publishing locations in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and the Pacific. The newspaper has since been published continuously since the last world war, from 1942 in Europe and 1945 in the Pacific.

Most recently, in fiscal year 2013, the newspaper has expanded its online presence, serving 9.13 million unique visitors and garnering 35.8 million page views on stripes.com."

(CNN) —

I went online this morning to see the Mountain Dew ad – the one some are calling the most racist in history – expecting to see some really offensive stuff. Instead, I saw some really silly stuff.

The goat’s funny.

The names of some of the black men in the lineup are hilarious.

ESPN LZ Granderson

The premise: ridiculous.

And I would think that’s the point of a commercial with a talking goat. It’s meant to be ridiculous and not taken seriously. It’s comedy of the absurd, along the lines of Del Shores’ “Sordid Lives,” Jerry Seinfeld’s parents on “Seinfeld” or “Dude, Where’s My Car?”

Does it play on stereotypical imagery?

Yes, and because of that, I can see how some could be a bit put off by a police lineup featuring all black men before a frightened white woman. But come on, one of the suspects’ names is “Beyonte.”

The circumstances surrounding the scene in the commercial are so outrageously over the top, I found myself snickering more than anything. Similar to the way I snickered during a skit featuring Dave Chappelle, who was making fun of racism with the creation of his character Clayton Bigsby, a blind white supremacist in the South.

And he’s black.

“You’ve never left this property, have you, Mr. Bigsby?”

“No, sir, not in many years.”

“What if I were to tell you that you are an African-American?”

“Sir! Listen! I’m gonna make this clear. I am in no way, shape or form involved in any n***erdom!”

Classic Chappelle.

The Mountain Dew commercials’ brand of frat-boy physical humor isn’t everyone’s thing. It could be seen as callous or making light of battered women. For me, though, the presence of a talking goat put me in a different “South Park”-ish mindset. There’s a reason “South Park” remains a high-rated show, why “The Simpsons” is the longest-running sitcom in history, why a third installment of “The Hangover” is being released: A lot of people like dumb, frat-boy humor draped in fantasy.

Thus I find the controversy to be as laughable as the Rev. Jerry Falwell saying the Teletubbies were bad for children because the purple one was gay. LZ Granderson

And I’m not trying to say Tyler, the Creator (whose real name is Tyler Okonma) scripted a commercial that is as brilliant as anything we’ve seen on the “Chappelle Show.” And because of the rape fantasies in his music and liberal use of homophobic slurs on Twitter, I question why the advertising executives at Mountain Dew thought it was a good idea to partner with him in the first place. But with all of that being said, I doubt his intent behind the commercial was to demonize black men.

And that’s the difference: intent.

A commercial that uses stereotypes has the potential to make any minority group featured in it uncomfortable, but is the Mountain Dew commercial really on par with, say, “Birth of a Nation,” a film that blatantly uses disparaging caricatures of black men to slander and promote fear? No, it isn’t, so can we please step back from the ledge?

In fact, I would dare say the images of black men in many of Tyler Perry’s movies, which are widely supported by the black community, are far more offensive than what I saw in that commercial.

Why? Because in Perry’s films, the dramatization is intended to be based in reality, while a thirsty gangsta goat by the name of Felicia is not.

Thus I find the controversy to be as laughable as the Rev. Jerry Falwell saying the Teletubbies were bad for children because the purple one was gay.

You know, sometimes images in pop culture are obviously insensitive or offensive, such as Lil Wayne usurping the murder of Emmett Till to make a vulgar reference about sex. And sometimes it’s all one giant inkblot, like a Rorschach test. No right or wrong answers, just a peek inside the skull of the people who consume pop culture.

The ad was pulled. I can’t help but feel it’s a sad, sad day when the policing of comedy gets to the point where we can’t even laugh at a talking goat.

No, really, once upon a time, the media saw it as its duty to be forever questioning and skeptical of Power, especially when Power was in pursuit of more power.

For example, Obama is attempting to grab more power for The State and criminals by way of gun control laws that infringe on our Second Amendment civil rights. In order to make his case, Obama is attempting to appear reasonable on the issue of guns, and one way he did this was to reassure Americans that he too is a sport shooter, and enjoys skeet shooting at Camp David.

Now, to those familiar with Obama’s record of opposing guns at every turn and lying about almost everything, that struck us as odd.

Today, however, the White House released a photo that purports to show Obama (love that tucked-in shirt) shooting skeet last August. Except… he’s shooting straight ahead, which means that there’s either a barn door somewhere in need of some patching, or Obama is such an awesome skeet shooter, he hits them as they come out of the firing device.

I keed, I keed. There are legitimate reasons that would explain the angle of his gun, but….

Because the photo is odd, some are asking perfectly legitimate questions.

But not the media.

What did the media do?

Because the media no longer questions or is skeptical of Power, and instead sees its role as protector of The State, the media mocked those who were skeptical:

—

.@dcbigjohn If you look closely, Abe Zapruder is clearly visible in the Camp David woods behind Obama. #SkeetGate — Jonathan Weisman (@jonathanweisman) February 2, 2013

—

That doesn’t include tweets mocking skeptics that the likes of Ben Smith and a number of Politico reporters are gleefully retweeting.

Thus far, I haven’t seen a single tweet from the media making the point that a single photo doesn’t quite square the circle of Obama making it sound as though he regularly shoots skeet.

Couple important things to keep in mind: Again, Obama is using skeet-shooting as a political talking point to further an agenda. So this is not an inconsequential matter, as some claim.

Secondly, while firing off this talking point, Obama made it sound as though he regularly shoots skeet. But it won’t matter that the White House has only released a single photo and thus far refuses to disclose how many times Obama’s actually shot skeet.

You see, the media is proud to publicly proclaim that it doesn’t matter if Obama lies. No, really. How depressing to know a White House reporter at a major news outlet doesn’t give a “rat’s a**” if the president of the United States is lying:

—

Question isn’t whether Obama ever shot skeet. The question is did he shoot skeet to get a photo shot… And who gives a rat’s ass? — Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) February 2, 2013

So why so much immediate mockery from the media? Well, rather than pushback against a White House trying to shut down skeptics, as soon as this tweet was released from a top Obama guy, the media did as it was told:

U.S. Army 1st Lt. Rachel Washburn walks through a village while serving one of two military tours in Afghanistan. Washburn is a Bronze Star recipient and a former Philadelphia Eagles NFL cheerleader from 2007 to 2009. Washburn, who was raised in a military family, is a graduate of Drexel University in Philadelphia.

Story highlights Rachel Washburn grew up with a military father and moved many times She went to college in Philadelphia on an ROTC scholarship She cheered for the Eagles for three seasons A Bronze Star recipient, she served two tours in Afghanistan

(CNN) —

Rachel Washburn once carried pompoms. Now she carries an M4 carbine.

The military brat who became an NFL cheerleader is today a first lieutenant in the United States Army.

On Sunday, she was honored as a Hometown Hero by the Philadelphia Eagles, the team she cheered for from 2007 to 2009.

The Bronze Star recipient served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, including one as a member of the Army’s new Cultural Support Program.

It was a dangerous and stressful job, where she would go on missions with special operations forces and help search and talk to Afghan women and children.

“We could be their voice during missions for engagement to ensure security on objectives, and we could help search and secure the females and the children during missions,” she told the Philadelphia Eagles website.

Spoken like a true soldier – which is not surprising given her father, Lon, served many years in the Army and Air Force as a pilot.

Rachel Washburn, 25, said she learned during her Army training to think of a happy place when confronted by stress. For that, she liked to think of her first game as an Eagles cheerleader. It was a beautiful August day and she was lined up for the pregame dance. It is one of her best memories, she said.

She also recalled fondly her trips to hospitals in Philadelphia and a USO trip to Iraq. Cheerleading is more than just dancing on the sideline and looking pretty, she said.

“We’re all beautiful women who are there to be entertaining at games, but also, we are incredibly involved in the community, which is something that I am incredibly proud of,” she told the Eagles.

Washburn is not a Philly native. She said she is “from a little bit of everywhere” after having moved at least a dozen times while growing up.

But she loved Philadelphia from her visits there and applied for an Army ROTC scholarship at Drexel University. She also joined the dance team.

Her next steps took her to tryouts for the Eagles cheerleading squad. She made the team on her first try.

After she graduated, Washburn joined the Army and went to Afghanistan, where near the end of her first tour she helped deliver a baby during a snowstorm while communicating with medical personnel by radio.

She told USA Today that during her second tour she was a platoon leader of an intelligence unit. She is considering re-enlisting next year, she told the paper.

Her father nominated her for the Eagles honor.

“I watched her go through two tours in Afghanistan and all of the things that she sacrificed,” he said. “It was not a very easy couple of tours and I just really kind of thought, ‘Man, what a homecoming that would be if (the Eagles) recognized her for that.’”

She returned from Afghanistan in November and is stationed at Fort Stewart in Georgia."

On a rainy day%2C President Obama performs the traditional turkey pardoning

Obama also jokes about turkey pardons

Today marked the 66th annual presentation of the National Thanksgiving Turkey

As the wind blew and the rain fell, President Obama stepped outside the White House for five minutes today for a holiday ritual: pardoning a lucky turkey named Popcorn.

Obama also engaged in another White House tradition: Telling jokes about the turkey pardoning.

""The office of the presidency — the most powerful position in the world — brings with it many awesome and solemn responsibilities,"" Obama said during a ceremony on the North Portico.

""This is not one of them.""

Noting that Popcorn was one of 80 birds that competed for a pardon from the Thanksgiving table, Obama said: ""It was, quite literally, the Hunger Games.""

As daughters Malia and Sasha and official guests looked on, Obama asserted his presidential authority: ""Popcorn, you have a full reprieve from cranberry sauce and stuffing. We wish you well.""

As for runner-up Caramel — who is also being spared this Thanksgiving — Obama joked that ""he's already busy raising money for his next campaign.""

The president, first lady Michelle Obama and their daughters were scheduled to do a Thanksgiving-related public service event later on Thursday.

This was the 66th annual presentation of the National Thanksgiving Turkey, courtesy of the National Turkey Federation.

Voters across the country got to choose between finalists Popcorn and Caramel by casting ballots via Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Caramel and Popcorn, both of whom are 20 weeks old and weigh about 38 pounds each, grew up on a farm in Minnesota. After the ceremony, they were driven to George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens for public viewing during the holidays.

Various organizations have been giving turkeys to presidents for years — the practice can be traced back to at least the 1870s — and Abraham Lincoln is said to have saved the life of a dinner-bound fowl that his son had taken a shine to.

In years past, many presidents have simply eaten turkeys presented to them.

The White House Historical Association pointed out that a Washington Post newspaper story used the terms ""pardon"" and ""reprieve"" when President John F. Kennedy said of the national turkey, ""let's keep him going.""

In 1989, President George H.W. Bush said: ""'Reprieve,' 'keep him going,' or 'pardon': It's all the same for the turkey, as long as he doesn't end up on the president's holiday table."""

State lawmakers, however, did manage to ban the sale of shark fins and slap a new tax on strip clubs.

The two measures are among more than 150 laws taking effect Tuesday. That number is down by about 50 compared with a year ago — 2012 was an election year, and with all House and Senate seats on the ballot, self-preservation was a primary focus for many at the Capitol.

Still, now on the books are laws to increase license plate sticker fees, prevent employers from requesting access to workers' social networking accounts and crack down on drivers who illegally use handicap parking placards.

Lawmakers also sought additional protections for some of the state's most vulnerable, including tougher penalties for parents who don't report their children missing to police in a timely manner. That legislation was inspired by the death of 2-year-old Caylee Anthony, of Florida, whose mother waited a month before alerting officials that her daughter was missing in a case that captured the nation's attention.

Here's a closer look at some of the new laws:

Pocketbook issues

Following years of budget cuts that led to severe maintenance problems at state parks, lawmakers approved several new fees aimed at easing the money crunch. Drivers will see $2 tacked on to the cost of a license plate sticker, and commercial fishermen and those who want to use all-terrain vehicles on state land also will see new fees.

The Illinois Department of Natural Resources hopes to raise as much as $55 million a year to chip away at a roughly $750 million backlog in maintenance projects at parks. The fees were proposed as an alternative to charging admission to visit Illinois parks, though out-of-state visitors still may be asked to pay an entrance fee.

Meanwhile, strip clubs that sell booze or let people drink alcoholic beverages will face a new tax. Club operators have the option of adding a $3 admission fee or paying taxes based on how much money they make. A strip club bringing in $2 million or more a year would pay a $25,000 tax. Ones making $500,000 to $2 million would pay $15,000 a year. Establishments making less than $500,000 would face a $5,000 tax.

The money will be used to support rape crisis centers, which have had funding cuts the past several years.

Consumer issues

Land-line telephone customers could see some relief after lawmakers outlawed ""cramming,"" a practice in which third-party companies place unwanted and unauthorized charges on phone bills.

The surprise charges often go unnoticed, but can cost customers $5 to $45 for services such as voice mail and extended warranties that they never signed up for. The charges usually appear after customers provide their phone number online for things like free recipes or pizzas. Companies use the phone number as a sort of credit card, passing along fees that appear on a customer's bill.

Historically, phone companies looked the other way because they got a piece of the profits, but that changed after the practice drew wider attention. Phone companies helped negotiate the cramming ban in Illinois, the second state to make the practice illegal. The law doesn't apply to cellphones, however.

Illinois also will become the first state without an ocean shore to ban the sale and possession of shark fins, a delicacy in Chinese culture. Environmentalists said the measure is necessary to protect shark populations.

The workplace

A new measure will make it easier for spouses of military members to get professional licenses when they move to Illinois. State regulators will be able to issue temporary licenses for those who are credentialed in other states to practice things like nursing and plumbing. That means family members of military personnel can begin immediately searching for jobs instead of waiting months for the state to vet their qualifications. The effort was inspired by first lady Michelle Obama's campaign to support military families.

Employers won't be allowed to request passwords to social networking sites of workers or job applicants, or they could face fines that start at $200. The idea is to protect the privacy of employees who use Facebook and similar sites. Bosses still can request user names to review public posts, but are not allowed to seek access to restricted portions of an account. It's unclear how many companies in Illinois were asking workers or prospective employees for such passwords.

Crime and punishment

Drivers who illegally use handicap parking plates and decals will face greater fines and penalties, including the possibility of having their licenses revoked. Fines for the unauthorized use of placards for people with disabilities will increase to $600 from $500. Fines for those caught making counterfeit placards or using parking passes in the absence of a qualified holder double to $1,000.

Additionally, doctors who submit false paperwork to help someone get a disabled plate or placard who doesn't need it will face a new $1,000 fine. Those who use handicap placards of people who have died face an even tougher punishment, with fines starting at $2,500 combined with a mandatory suspension of driving privileges for six months. Repeat offenders could have their license revoked for one year. Enforcement is key, however.

Parents and guardians of children 13 or younger who go missing could face felony charges if they fail to alert authorities within 48 hours. The time frame narrows to one hour for adults responsible for children 2 and younger. Dubbed Caylee's Law, the measure is in response to the 2008 death of 2-year-old Caylee Anthony, who was missing for a month before police were alerted. Casey Anthony was charged with her daughter's death, but a jury found her not guilty in July 2011.

It also will be easier for police officers to obtain permission to secretly record suspects when investigating drug crimes. Instead of getting a court order to eavesdrop from a judge, they can seek approval from a state's attorney. Advocates say it will speed up a process that sometimes takes so long a crime is committed before police can get it recorded.

Child victims of sex trafficking will have more time to seek justice under a new law that extends the statute of limitations for those crimes to one year after the victim turns 18 or three years after the crime was committed if the victim was 16 or 17. Before, victims had only three years to seek legal action after the crime.

Meanwhile, judges will have the ability to assign first-time, nonviolent offenders to a two-year diversion program instead of sending them to jail. The plan will operate similarly to probation and allow those who successfully complete community service, drug counseling or other programs to have their criminal record expunged. The idea is to keep low-level offenders out of prison and help them find jobs."

(Jose Cendon/Bloomberg)

Colombia continues to upgrade its air capabilities. In 2013, the air force upgraded its fleet of Israeli-made Kfir fighter jets, fitting them with Israeli-made Griffin laser-guided bombs. It has also fitted smart bombs onto some of its Super Tucanos.

Having decimated the top FARC leadership and many of the front commanders, the military, with continued help from the CIA and other intelligence agencies, appears to be working its way through the mid-level ranks, including mobile company commanders, the most battle-hardened and experienced remaining cadre. One-third of them have been killed or captured, according to Colombian officials.

The Santos administration has also targeted the financial and weapons networks supporting the FARC. Some critics think the government has been too focused on killing leaders and not enough on using the army and police to occupy and control rebel territory.

Killing an individual has never been a measure of success in war, say counterinsurgency experts. It’s the chaos and dysfunction that killing the leadership causes to the organization that matters. The air operations against the FARC leadership “has turned the organization upside down,” said a senior Pentagon official who has studied the classified U.S. history of Colombia’s war.

Some have fled to Venezuela. One member of the secretariat hides out intermittently in Ecuador, according to senior Colombia officials, breaking the important psychological bond with ground troops and handicapping recruitment.

For fear of being located and targeted, units no longer sleep in the same place two days in a row, so camps must be sparser. “They know the government has so much information on them now, and real-time intelligence,” said German Espejo, security and defense counselor at the Colombian Embassy. Worried about spies in their midst, executions are common.

The FARC still mounts attacks — a car bombing of a rural police station Dec. 7 killed six police officers and two civilians — but it no longer travels in large groups, and it limits most units to less than 20. No longer able to mount large-scale assaults, the group has reverted to hit-and-run tactics using snipers and explosives.

The weariness of 50 years of transient jungle life has taken its toll on the FARC negotiating team, too. Those who have lived in exile seem more willing to continue the fight than those who have been doing the fighting, said Colombian officials. The negotiations, Santos said in the interview, are the result of the successful military campaign, “the cherry on the cake.”

On Dec. 15, the FARC said it would begin a 30-day unilateral cease-fire as a sign of good will during the holiday season. The Santos administration rebuffed the gesture and vowed to continue its military campaign. Later that day, security forces killed a FARC guerrilla implicated in a bomb attack on a former minister. Three days later, the army killed another five.

But instead, Reid offered deal after deal to Senate Republicans. They accepted some. They honored none. Instead, the delaying tactics have continued. Frequently they have been used to block the implementation of laws the Senate had passed — the two-year filibustering of the first head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for example, just because Republicans didn’t like the law. And Republicans have paired judicial nullification with legislative nullification, blocking a record number of Obama’s judicial appointees — a power the Constitution actually mentions, unlike the filibuster — for no real reason other than that they were Democratic nominees, not Republican ones. (Democrats were guilty of this under President George W. Bush as well, it must be noted, and deserve criticism for that, even if the number of filibusters was lower.)"
http://news.yahoo.com/save-holder-white-house-tries-keep-gop-meeting-154320189.html,,[],"To Save Holder, the White House Tries to Keep the GOP from Meeting the Press","Despite strong opposition from conservatives, Eric Holder has never faced any real threat to his position. That's largely because the threats have never been substantive; the most serious, Fast and Furious, landed some distance from his desk, and the media didn't bite at right-wing efforts to make it a big deal. But the Department of Justice's heavy-handed media subpoenas and search warrants have shifted that perspective, aligning the media for the first time with the interests of a Republican Congress antsy to see Holder go. Calls for Holder's resignation aren't common in the mainstream media, but they're happening — even at the administration-friendly Huffington Post.

RELATED: Holder and the White House Try to Make the Case for Media Surveillance

Forcing Holder out, however unlikely, would be a significant blow to the administration. So the attorney general (and, presumably, his boss) have launched an effort to rebuild his reputation, operating under the assumption that, with the media anyway, it's still salvageable.

RELATED: Obama Is Pushing for a Media Shield Law That Could Also Shield Him

The campaign has two components. Step one: Meet with the press and discuss the existing rules about how the government can collect information in leak investigations. Step two: Advocate for a new media shield law. The media would be wise to be skeptical of the overtures.

RELATED: Criminal Investigation Into Bush-Era Prisoner Deaths Announced

Politico's Mike Allen first reported on the meetings earlier today. The Department of Justice is ""contacting D.C. bureau chiefs of major print and broadcast news organizations"" for a meeting with Holder.

""The A.G. realizes that things might have gotten a little out of balance, and he wants to make changes to be sure the rules fully account for the balance between the First Amendment and law enforcement,"" the source said. The first media meeting will be held at main Justice, likely later this week. A later meeting will include First Amendment advocates.

Story continues

This appears to be a follow-up to Obama's calls last week for a review of the rules around issuance of subpoenas to media organizations. The rules, articulated here, offer only guidance, not mandated regulations. But they are ""intended to provide protection for the news media from forms of compulsory process, whether civil or criminal, which might impair the news gathering function"" — the heart of the concern in the aftermath of the Associated Press and Fox News information-gathering. Under the policy, media organizations must be informed about record collection, which should only occur as a last resort and with the authorization of the Attorney General. In both the AP and Fox cases, the Justice Department has offered lengthy explanations for how it followed those rules as best it could.

RELATED: Rand Paul Gets His Answer on Drones: 'No'

Which is where the second effort comes in. Earlier this month, the president began making quiet calls to reintroduce a media shield law. The policy would establish federal protection for media sources — protection that exists in 49 states but not at the highest level of government. The problem, as we noted at the time, is that previous versions of the bill, like that introduced by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, wouldn't have done much to protect the reporters in either of the recent high-profile cases.

RELATED: How Eric Holder Will Hold on Amidst the Fury in Washington

Peter Sterne at the New York Observer explains why:

The proposed federal shield law before the Senate is even weaker than Colorado’s. It simply allows journalists to petition a judge, who weighs the story’s public interest value and decides whether the journalist should be forced to reveal his or her sources.

Matthew Cooper was investigated by the Bush White House in 2003 after writing a story for Time based on a CIA source. At our sister publication National Journal, Cooper explains that press protections are largely contingent on good will. ""Prosecutors are often aspiring politicians,"" he notes, suggesting that fear of angering the press often served as a disincentive in the 1970s to subpoena those who ""buy ink by the barrel."" That generally hasn't changed much.

Prosecutors and others are always going to have the opportunity to persuade a court that national security overrides First Amendment issues. The best we can count on is that prosecutors will use their powers with discretion, especially since in most national security cases they wind up not prosecuting for any leak itself but for false statements to the FBI.

From Holder's perspective — and the president's — there isn't a lot of value in instantiating strong media protections, beyond the value of the positive media that might result. The Department of Justice isn't investigating security leaks in an effort to ingratiate itself with The New York Times; it's doing it to try and crack down on what it sees as dangerous law-breaking. The needs of the Times and The Washington Post are and will always be secondary to that.

But for now, they need to keep the ink-barrel-buyers happy, if only to keep the barbarians on Capitol Hill at bay. How far the media will be able to push the administration on new, tighter regulations remains to be seen. If Holder isn't successful in finding middle ground, the desire for a strong shield law might do exactly what the administration wants least: Create common ground between the media and a Republican Congress. If the White House can't deliver on a law that the media likes, John Boehner and Darrell Issa would certainly be happy to call attention to any apparent antipathy by the administration to protecting the First Amendment."

Mike Lee', 'R-Ut']",House Leaders Must Shut Back Door To Comprehensive Immigration Bill,"The Gang of Eight immigration bill is a 1,200-page legislative monstrosity. Senators had roughly 72 hours to read the final version of this massive and complex bill before the votes began. Like with Obamacare, the Senate was supposed to pass the bill in order to find out what was in it.

But while lawmakers and the public were left in the dark, the White House strategists and special interest allies who crafted the bill knew exactly what it contained: immediate amnesty, weakened enforcement, and unending illegal immigration.

The House has said that it will not take up the Senate bill. Rather, it will consider immigration reform in a “step-by-step” process, one bill at a time. We share the belief that the way to address immigration policy changes is through step-by-step legislation, with individual reform measures first implemented and then verified in the proper sequence.

We are concerned, however, that the House will pass individual, incremental bills only to have them cobbled together in a backroom deal with Majority Leader Reid and the Gang of Eight. Through a series of procedural maneuvers, House leaders could agree to begin negotiations with the Senate, known as a conference, using one of these smaller, targeted bills, while the Senate could bring the Gang of Eight bill to the negotiations.

This scenario would open the back door for congressional leaders to create a new amnesty-first, enforcement-later “comprehensive” immigration bill. Once the conference approves the new bill and sends it back to each chamber, amendments are prohibited and only an up-or-down vote is allowed.

Another danger is that, after the House passes several smaller bills, congressional leaders could handpick negotiators to meet in secret and develop a “compromise” plan to “fix” the Senate bill and bring the new–even larger–comprehensive proposal to a vote in both chambers.

If House members allow any of their proposals to be combined into an omnibus immigration bill, they would, in effect, allow White House strategists and their special interest allies to determine the final outcome of immigration much the way they shaped the creation of the original Gang of Eight bill. They would be handing the reins over to the very people who have made it their mission to suspend the constitutional rule of law in matters of immigration enforcement.

House leaders, therefore, should make absolutely clear that any individual immigration bills must be considered separately by the Senate, not crammed together into a behemoth comprehensive proposal. It’s not step-by-step if the bills are merged with the Senate monstrosity at a later date–either through a formal conference or a closed-door negotiation. Any possibility of such an outcome must be ruled out. How can House leaders ask a single member of Congress to vote for step-by-step bills if they’re leaving the back door wide open to a comprehensive bill?

There must be no confusion. No word play. Step-by-step must mean just that: individual steps, not an all-in-one legislative colossus.

As we’ve seen with spending bills, an enormous amount of mischief can be accomplished by rushing through a package of different proposals in the form of one catch-all bill. It deprives lawmakers the opportunity to review and modify each element, and it deprives the public a chance to weigh in.

The devil, the saying goes, is in the details. And there are a lot of details in several thousand pages of legislation."

(CNN) - Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly sparked outrage this week by insisting that Jesus and Santa Claus are both white, saying it's ""ridiculous"" to argue that depicting Christ and St. Nick as Caucasian is ""racist.""

""And by the way, for all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white,"" Kelly said, ""but this person is arguing that we should also have a black Santa.""

Kelly was responding to an article in Slate that said St. Nick needs a makeover from fat, old white guy to something less ""melanin-deficient.""

The Fox News host would have none of it.

""Just because it makes you feel uncomfortable doesn't mean it has to change,"" Kelly said. ""Jesus was a white man, too. It's like we have, he's a historical figure; that's a verifiable fact. As is Santa, I just want kids to know that. How do you revise it in the middle of the legacy, in the story, and change Santa from white to black?""

Arguing about St. Nick, who was originally Greek before Currier & Ives got their hands on him, is one thing. But as for Jesus, people have been arguing about his skin color since the earliest days of American history. You might even call it an American tradition.

What's new about this latest brouhaha is how swiftly Kelly’s remarks were attacked. Thousands of people have rebuked her through blogs, articles, Twitter posts and Facebook updates.

Comedian Jon Stewart accused Kelly of ""going full Christmas nog.""

“And who are you actually talking to?"" Stewart said on ""The Daily Show."" ""Children who are sophisticated enough to be watching a news channel at 10 o’clock at night, yet innocent enough to still believe Santa Claus is real — yet racist enough to be freaked out if he isn’t white?”

It seems that now, if you want to call Christ — or even Santa — white, you should expect a fierce fight.

The immediate and widespread rebuttal showcases how much America has changed over the past few decades. The nation not only has a black president, but also has refused to endorse the Christian savior as white.

Since the earliest days of America, Jesus was thought of as a white man.

When white Protestant missionaries brought Bibles and whitened images of Jesus to Native Americans, at least a few mocked what they saw.

Taking the imagery seriously, the Shawnee warrior Tecumseh asked future President William Henry Harrison, “How can we have confidence in the white people? When Jesus Christ came upon the earth you kill’d and nail’d him on a cross.”

It was not until around 1900 that a group of white Americans explicitly claimed Jesus was white.

Concerned that large numbers of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, especially Jewish immigrants, were “polluting” the nation, anti-immigrant spokesmen like attorney Madison Grant asserted the whiteness of Jesus to justify calls for exclusionary legislation.

Making Jesus white was a means to distance him from Judaism.

“In depicting the crucifixion no artist hesitates to make the two thieves brunet in contrast to the blond Savior,” Grant wrote in his xenophobic best-seller ""The Passing of the Great Race.""

“This is something more than a convention,” Grant continued, and suggested that Jesus had “Nordic, possibly Greek, physical and moral attributes.”

Even Martin Luther King Jr. claimed that Jesus was white, after being asked why God created Jesus as a white man.

King responded that the color of Christ’s skin didn’t matter. Jesus would have been just as important “if His skin had been black.” He “is no less significant because His skin was white.”

Challenges to Christ’s whiteness have a long history, too.

Famed evangelist Billy Graham preached in the 1950s, and then wrote emphatically in his autobiography ""Just As I Am,"" that, “Jesus was not a white man.”

But Graham was far from the first American to contradict the whiteness of Jesus. That honor goes to Methodist and Pequot Indian William Apess.

In 1833, he wrote to white Christians, “You know as well as I that you are not indebted to a principle beneath a white skin for your religious services but to a colored one.”

Almost 100 years later, the Jamaican born, “back-to-Africa” spokesman Marcus Garvey told his followers, “Never admit that Jesus Christ was a white man, otherwise he could not be the Son of God and God to redeem all mankind. Jesus Christ had the blood of all races in his veins.”

In our age, the color of Christ has become both politically dangerous and the butt of jokes.

In 2008, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright’s words “God damn America” and “Jesus was a poor black boy” almost derailed then-Sen. Barack Obama from winning the Democratic primary.

Now, Kelly bears the brunt of attacks and, in no surprise, was pilloried by comedians like Stewart and Stephen Colbert.

Few Americans went on public record against King when he asserted Jesus had white skin in the 1950s. Today, thousands upon thousands from virtually every race and tribe of Americans have taken Kelly’s words seriously and seriously disdained them.

All the chatter about Jesus being white (or not) shows how much America has changed. There used to be “whites’ only” restaurants and schoolrooms. Now, even Jesus cannot be called white without repercussions.

What the debate hides, however, is what Jesus of the Bible actually did and how he related to people.

The gospels are full of discussions about Jesus and bodies. He healed the blind and those who suffered from disease. He touched and was touched by the sick. His body was pierced by thorns, a spear and nails. And he died.

READ MORE: What all those Jesus jokes tell us

The phenotype of Jesus was never an issue in the Bible. Neither Matthew, nor Mark, nor Luke, nor John mentioned Christ’s skin tone or hair color. None called him white or black or red or brown.

Obsessions about race are obsessions of our age, not the biblical one. When asked what mattered most, Jesus did not say his skin tone or body shape. He instructed his followers to “love the Lord your God with all your heart” and to “do unto others as you would have done unto you.”

Maybe this Christmas season, we can reflect not so much on whether or not Jesus was white and instead consider what it meant for him to be called the “light” of the world.

President Obama returns from vacation to face a busy fall agenda

One priority%3A Avoiding a government shutdown

Violence in Egypt adds to a list of foreign policy challenges

President Obama faces a full agenda when he returns from vacation this weekend, one that includes budget battles and health care fights — and that was before Egypt descended into near-chaos this week.

Pressuring Egypt's military government into holding new elections is the latest addition to a crowded fall political calendar that could make or break Obama's second term.

The president is scheduled to return Sunday evening from his week-long vacation at Martha's Vineyard, Mass.

In the days and months ahead, Obama will seek to put in place key parts of his health care law, pursue a landmark immigration bill, and — perhaps most important in the short run — avoid a government shutdown and another crisis over the debt ceiling.

The president's to-do list also includes pushing a jobs and middle-class legislative package and defending surveillance programs conducted by the National Security Agency.

At a pre-vacation news conference, Obama said he didn't expect congressional Republicans to back a government shutdown ""at a time when the recovery is getting some traction"" and jobs are starting to come back.

""I have confidence that common sense, in the end, will prevail,"" Obama said.

He added: ""We'll see what happens.""

Congressional Republicans said they don't want a government shutdown either, but that Obama needs to support bigger spending cuts in a new budget plan.

""Our good friends on the other side of the aisle have been spending the entire year trying to get us to walk away from spending reductions that we committed to on a bipartisan basis just a couple of years ago,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Obama, meanwhile, wants to end the automatic, across-the-board cuts known as sequestration.

The dispute hits a major deadline on Sept. 30. when the current fiscal year ends, as does the temporary spending plan that is now funding the government. Without at least a new continuing resolution, the government could shut down on Oct. 1.

Moreover, some conservative Republicans are advocating a shutdown if Congress does not end funding for Obama's new landmark health care law, another major item on the president's fall plate.

In October, the administration will begin attempts to sign up uninsured Americans for new health care marketplaces coming on line. In addition, at some point this fall, Congress will have to raise the current debt ceiling, which is around $16.7 trillion.

Obama has said, repeatedly, he will not negotiate to raise the debt ceiling, noting that it enables the government to pay bills already rung up.

Some congressional Republicans say the debt ceiling issue can be used to leverage more budget cuts from the administration. Two years ago, a debt ceiling standoff led to a near-default and a downgrade in the nation's credit rating.

On Sunday, though, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., spoke out against a shutdown. ""I don't think shutting down the government is a good idea, but I do think that we were elected, conservatives were elected, to try to stop this overreach, this government takeover of health care,"" Paul told Fox News Sunday.

The upcoming fall political season will see a renewed Obama effort to secure another major piece of legislation, an immigration bill. As he has in recent months, the president is planning to pressure House Republicans to sign off on the immigration bill approved by the Senate earlier this year.

Many House Republicans say a key a provision of that Senate bill — a pathway to citizenship for people already in the United States illegally — amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers.

Obama is likely to cite some of these issues this week when he embarks on a two-day bus tour of upstate New York and northeastern Pennsylvania. The president is also expected to stress education and jobs proposals.

Foreign affairs are no less crowded for the administration in the coming months.

Over the next few months, Obama faces the prospects of rising instability in Egypt, an escalating civil war in Syria and increasingly testy relations with Russia.

During the first week in September, he is scheduled to fly to St. Petersburg, Russia, for a Group of 20 nations summit, where a still-struggling global economy tops the agenda.

Even though the G-20 summit is in Russia, a meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin is not on the schedule. Obama canceled a planned summit with Putin in Moscow after a string of differences that included Russia's decision to grant temporary asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.

Snowden's leaks led to criticism of NSA tactics, and Obama has said he will work with Congress on potential improvements to surveillance programs.

Outside events can always intrude on a president's time, as they did this week during his vacation in Martha's Vineyard.

After Egypt's interim military government cracked down on supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi, Obama responded by canceling plans for joint U.S.-Egyptian military exercises. He alluded to other potential aid cuts if the military government does not follow through on pledges to call new elections and re-install a democratically elected government.

""Going forward,"" Obama said, ""I've asked my national security team to assess the implications of the actions taken by the interim government and further steps that we may take as necessary with respect to the U.S.-Egyptian relationship."""

He readily acknowledges that he thinks the United States “dodged a bullet in 2012,” and that in re-electing Barack Obama and rejecting the Republicans’ “extremist” views, America reaffirmed its identity as an essentially “centrist nation.”

Toward the end of this volume, Mr. Alter quotes Mr. Obama telling an aide that if he lost, his presidency would be “a footnote” and that “all of the progress we made in the first four years would be reversed”; if he won, his first-term achievements would be cemented for a generation and he could move ahead on promises sidetracked by the recession.

Whereas there had “famously been ‘two Clintons,’ the brilliant policy analyst” and “the volcanic and self-pitying victim of his own appetites,” Mr. Alter says, President Obama was “pretty much the same calm and self-contained guy inside the bubble as he was in public.” With one exception, Mr. Alter adds: “the intense racial consciousness that he had nurtured in his own mind since childhood was more apparent in private. He knew that if he crossed a certain line in reacting to criticism, he would hand his enemies a weapon: “ ‘See, he’s like all the rest of them.’ It was better for him to be perceived as ‘different,’ with all the challenges that brought.” This “stifling of himself,” this “inability to swing at certain pitches,” made him, according to one aide, about “5 percent more aloof than he had been before coming to the presidency.”

A similar sort of dynamic, in Mr. Alter’s opinion, helps explain the president’s dismal first debate, which jeopardized his re-election: “Obama didn’t trust himself to tangle with Romney. He thought Romney was a liar and an empty suit and would reverse everything worthy he had done as president,” and he had “long worried that his attitude would spill out. Suppressing that was part of what threw him off his game” in that Denver debate.

Such observations help propel the well-worn narrative of the presidential campaign forward, and Mr. Alter scatters some worthwhile nuggets of information along the way.

He reports that Bill Clinton had for many months thought Mr. Romney would win (“the Obama-Christie moment during Hurricane Sandy,” Mr. Alter says, changed the former president’s mind). And he provides some interesting observations on Republican-backed efforts to implement election “reform” around the country (like requiring state-issued photo ID’s and cutting back on early in-person voting) that would hold down “turnout among young people and minorities, who tended to vote Democratic.” Those efforts failed, says Mr. Alter, instead creating a backlash against Republicans as a wave of black voters headed to the polls in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia and Florida, angry at attempts to suppress their votes."

Car salesman dipping into retirement savings for chance to talk to Obama

Paul Scott says he has been assured he will get to talk to the president briefly

He is one of 25 contributors at Democratic fundraiser in Santa Monica%2C Calif.

A Los Angeles car salesman and electric car advocate is shelling $32,400 out of his retirement savings so he can make a pitch directly to President Obama at a ""private, off-the-record"" Democratic fundraiser next week.

Paul Scott, 60, says he isn't a rich guy. He's a $50,000-a-year Nissan salesman who plans to rub elbows with 24 bigwigs in a private luncheon that he says will put a crimp in his retirement plans.

But he says the goal is worthwhile. He wants to make a few points to Obama about on how to better support electric cars -- a cause that Obama already embraces -- and thought the private audience would be a fine way to do it.

So when a solicitation came for the fundraiser, Scott says he was told that he'd get a chance sometime over the luncheon to offer his advice directly to the president. ""That was something I had to confirm before I wrote the check,"" Scott says. At least two minutes, probably no more than four, he says he was told.

The fundraiser who sent the email could not be immediately be reached for comment. A copy was provided to USA TODAY, and it includes a menu of choices with prices when it comes to seeing the Obama in person at the June 7 fundraiser in Santa Monica, Calif.

For $10,000, you can be a luncheon guest. For $16,200, you can be a VIP luncheon guest and have your picture taken with Obama. For $32,400, the package ""includes an official photograph with President Obama, as well as a very special one-hour roundtable discussion with the President after the luncheon. President Obama will take your questions in a private, off-the-record conversation where you can discuss with him what you'd like. Please note this is limited to 25 people to keep it an intimate discussion, and so will sell out very fast.""

Having signed up, Scott is already mapping strategy.

""I am not going to sit quietly,"" Scott, co-founder of advocacy group Plug In America, says in an interview. ""I am not going to hope that I get to talk. If it's a free for all, I'll do what I can.""

He wants to tell Obama that as an electric car expert he believes the administration needs to push for a so-called ""carbon tax"" that would raise prices on oil-based fuels, making electric car prices more competitive.

He wants to ask Obama to increase his efforts to convince Congress to make electric-car rebates at the point of sale, not months later as part of a $7,500 tax incentive. He says he wants it even if Obama were to back down on increasing the incentive to $10,000.

And he says he wants to tell Obama to be more vigorous in standing up to opponents of electric cars and to support groups like Plug In America. ""I can sell more cars,"" says Scott, who specializes in electric vehicles, or EVs. ""I am getting hammered in the press with all the anti-EV stuff.""

He acknowledges that spending more than half a year's pay on a single hour at a group lunch with Obama will set him back. He won't be able to afford trips like the one he'd planned to Costa Rica, ""but I'm not going to starve to death.""

He considered other less expensive ways to try to make his point to Obama. But when the fundraising solicitation came, ""I figured what the hell, I'll go tell him to his face."""

Obama talks to nearly 150 business leaders, 25 governors

Obama would sign a debt ceiling hike ""as a bare minimum,"" spokesman says

Possible changes to Obamacare were discussed, GOP senators say

President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner both want talks to continue on ending the partial government shutdown and avoiding a possible debt default -- a welcome development after weeks of acrimony, if not proof a breakthrough is near.

Spokesman for both leaders, who were trading pointed barbs until a few days ago, issued statements after a Friday afternoon phone call, that ""we should all keep talking."" Conversations on Friday did yield some points of agreement among lawmakers, including on altering Obama's signature health care reforms and raising revenue to prevent forced cuts in government spending.

But overall, there has been little indication that there is any legislation yet that all the key players -- the President, the GOP-led House and the Democratic-led Senate -- will rally behind.

Much of the discussion of late revolves around a proposal from House Republicans to increase the federal borrowing limit for about six weeks to avoid a potentially harmful default as soon as October 17, when the Obama administration says the government will run out of money to pay its bills.

Republicans like Rep. Peter Roskam of Illinois say a temporary debt ceiling hike will allow all parties to ""concentrate on the continuing resolution."" His chamber could vote on the measure as soon as this weekend.

But the lack of a mechanism to immediately reopen the government -- which has been partially shut down since October 1, prompting the furlough of hundreds of thousands of workers, the closing of national parks and an increase in public anger -- could turn off some Democrats.

At the White House, press secretary Jay Carney repeated Obama's position that the partial shutdown must end before budget talks aimed to address the debt begin.

However, he didn't close the door completely on the House GOP plan, saying Obama would sign a temporary debt ceiling increase ""as a bare minimum"" as long as Republicans didn't attach partisan policy issues to it.

Sources: GOP senators losing patience with House

Meanwhile, Obama continued his outreach on Friday, including conversations with nearly 150 business leaders and 25 governors. He also reached across the aisle to Senate Republicans in a meeting Carney characterized as constructive, without offering details.

Some GOP members in the Senate have floated a plan discussed on Friday afternoon by a bipartisan group of about 10 senators, led by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, according to sources familiar with the meeting.

The proposal, which has yet to be introduced, would raise the debt ceiling and reopen the government with some qualifications. Among them: A Republican priority, backed by many Democrats, to end a tax on medical devices created by the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.

While much of their fire has been aimed at Democrats, some Senate Republicans also see their House colleagues as part of the problem.

There is growing concern being expressed in private meetings that the House GOP plan extending the debt ceiling for six weeks would come back to haunt the party, because it would expire close to the holidays, hurting retailers.

There also are worries about the impact of the partial shutdown dragging on, especially with polls showing the Republican Party getting the brunt of the blame.

Several GOP senators told CNN they will give House Speaker John Boehner a bit more time -- about 24 to 48 hours -- to reach a deal with the White House to raise the debt ceiling and reopen the government. But after that, they'll push the plan backed by moderate Senate Republicans more aggressively.

After Friday's meeting at the White House, Collins said Obama ""listened carefully"" and ""said that some of the elements were issues we could work on. But he certainly did not endorse"" the proposal.

Conservative Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said Obama called the medical device tax a ""legitimate concern"" that can be addressed because it wasn't part of the core Obamacare program.

According to other senators in the meeting, another Obamacare alteration under discussion would change the definition of a part-time worker in order to protect employees having their hours cut so businesses can avoid a requirement to provide health coverage.

Some conservatives -- like tea party favorite Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- left the meeting upset at Obama for continuing to insist the government must reopen and the debt ceiling must be increased before he would take part in full-fledged negotiations on deficit reduction.

""There was an awful lot of talking but the president still says he won't negotiate,"" said Cruz, who spearheaded the attempt last month to add anti-Obamacare amendments to a spending plan needed to prevent the government shutdown.

Source: Obama, Ryan exchange shifts tone

Even as he has continued to firmly repeat his positions, President Obama has been reaching across the aisle this week.

One potentially pivotal meeting came Thursday evening, when House GOP leaders went to the White House.

The two sides went around and around for an hour, getting nowhere. Then -- as first reported by CNN's Deirdre Walsh and Dana Bash, citing multiple attendees -- an exchange between GOP Rep. Paul Ryan and Obama seemed to clear the air.

CNN Chief National Correspondent John King told CNN's ""New Day"" that Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, ""said something to the effect of, 'Look, we know you don't like our position, we know you probably don't respect our position, but we're the Republican majority.' ""

Those comments changed the tone of the meeting, King said. Obama reiterated his opposition to negotiations before the government reopens, then urged GOP leaders to go ask their colleagues what they want done to make that happen.

Republican Rep. Steve Southerland of Florida said the interaction between the two men -- who squared off in the 2012 election, when Ryan ran as his party's vice presidential nominee -- ""was an important part of the conversation.""

""Paul and the President certainly have a past through the last election, and I think there's a great respect between them. And you can't make that up."" Southerland said.

The new atmosphere was reflected in both sides' comments after the meeting. The White House called it good and said the parties discussed ""potential paths forward."" GOP Rep. Hal Rogers of Kentucky said they were talking ""in good faith"" about both the debt and reopening the government.

""We're all working together now,"" said Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican.

In a video message to a right-wing political summit on Friday, Ryan noted conservatives can't get everything they want with Democrats holding the White House and a majority of the Senate.

""This President won't agree to everything we need to do,"" said the message from Ryan, according to excerpts provided by one of his aides. ""A budget agreement with this President and this Senate won't solve our problems. But I hope it's a start."""

A late night meeting attended by nearly every senator failed to produce an agreement to resolve the dispute.

After the hours-long session, Democratic Senate leaders reaffirmed that a key vote on the issue was scheduled for Tuesday morning.

Earlier Monday, Reid issued his ultimatum during a speech to the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress.

At issue is the Senate's own rulebook, which to lawmakers is a very serious topic. Reid is threatening to flout the normal process in order to change the rules so that key presidential nominees can be confirmed with just 51 votes -- as opposed to 60.In short, the move would curb the minority party's ability to filibuster nominees.

Despite virulent protests by Republicans, Reid called the move ""a minor change, no big deal.""

Republicans don't see it that way, and reminded Reid that he and other Democrats warned about doing such a thing when they were in the minority.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Reid's threatened action would ""change the core of the Senate."" He said it would fundamentally deny senators their right to question potential officials.

Republicans have delayed or blocked presidential nominees by using their filibuster powers, which allow 41 senators to block actions in the 100-member chamber.

Reid has teed up a test vote on several nominees for Tuesday, and now says that Republicans must confirm all seven to avoid a confrontation over what is dubbed the ""nuclear option.""

Among them are nominees to the National Labor Relations Board. Obama originally appointed them when he said the Senate was in recess -- but an appeals court ruled that Obama exceeded his authority, and Republicans likewise describe the appointments as illegitimate.

The roster also includes EPA Administrator nominee Gina McCarthy and Richard Cordray, nominee to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created as part of Wall Street overhaul legislation that was opposed by the GOP. Many Republican senators say they will not confirm anyone to the consumer post unless the bureau's leadership structure is changed.

A GOP agreement to confirm the seven nominees would defuse the tension and allow the Senate to return to normal business, Reid said.

Senate Republicans and at least one Democrat, Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, strongly oppose his proposed rules change.

All 100 senators were invited to the Monday night meeting in the Old Senate Chamber. Senators drifting in and out told reporters it was a ""very good discussion"" and the ""most bipartisan discussion in a long time.""

White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough met with Reid's chief of staff ahead of the meeting.

Some senators, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., are floating possible compromises but there is no indication yet that Reid is ready to accept. It's also not clear whether Reid would have the votes to pursue the rule change.

""The power of an extreme minority"" threatens the Senate's integrity, and forces him to act, Reid said Monday. He acknowledged that future Republican presidents were likely to benefit from the proposed rule change.

The proposed change would not end filibusters for legislation or judicial nominees. But some senators say a limited rule change now could open the gate for much deeper changes in the years ahead.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that Obama ""supports Harry Reid and is appreciative of the support Harry Reid has given to his nominees.""

Carney, asked if Obama worried that the Senate could become even more dysfunctional if rules are changed, said: ""Well, it boggles the mind how they would achieve that.""

The OCS Web site says its mission is to “train, screen and evaluate candidates, who must demonstrate a high level of leadership potential and commitment to success in order to earn a commission.”

The school breaks down into three components: leadership, academics and physical training.

At the beginning of training, candidates take a physical fitness test including a 3-mile run, pull-ups and crunches. The minimum requirements, according to the OCS, are 8 pull-ups, 70 crunches and a 3-mile run in 24 minutes for men; and 50 flexed arm hangs, 70 crunches and a 3-mile run in 27 minutes for women.

Some questioned the costs and benefits of up to $50 billion in the extra border security, which also will include high-tech surveillance equipment such as manned and unmanned aerial vehicles, radar and seismic devices.

But concerns were overshadowed by the deal's main goal: win votes for an overhaul of U.S. immigration law that will open a pathway to citizenship for up to 11 million undocumented immigrants.

Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid was expected to set a test vote for as early as Monday in a bid to have the deal added to the White House-backed bill in the form of an amendment.

A senior Democratic aide predicted the amendment would get upward of 60 votes in the 100-member chamber, more than enough to clear any procedural roadblocks.

A vote on passage of the bill is expected before the Senate departs at the end of next week for its Fourth of July holiday recess.

Backers are aiming for at least 70 votes on passage to increase pressure on the more resistant Republican-led House of Representatives to give the bill final congressional approval.

Republican John McCain, a member of the ""Gang of Eight"" senators who wrote the bipartisan bill, voiced doubt about the high cost of additional border security.

""I don't know if it's totally well spent,"" he said.

But McCain added, ""I think it's important that we do this to give people confidence that we have border security, so in that respect it's well spent.""

A leading conservative voice embraced the deal.

Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American lawmaker from Florida and another member of the Gang of Eight, said the deal was a ""dramatic improvement in border security"" during an interview on Fox News.

Rubio, touted as a possible 2016 presidential candidate, had hinged his support on improvements in border security. His endorsement is seen as crucial to winning conservative backing for the biggest changes in U.S. immigration law in a generation.

The proposal would double the overall number of U.S. border patrol agents, according to senior Senate Democratic aides.

That would mean assigning 21,000 new officers to the border with Mexico in an attempt to shut down illegal crossings by foreigners.

""I am now confident ... that the Senate will pass a strong, bipartisan immigration reform bill and that it will ultimately reach the desk of the president for his signature,"" Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York said.

The immigration bill, which is supported by President Barack Obama, currently calls for adding 3,500 Customs and Border Protection officers by 2017.

Besides doubling the number of border agents, the deal also calls for completing the construction of 700 miles of border fencing or walls, Senate aides said. About 650 miles have been built in one form or another, although some portions will have to be upgraded.

At an estimated price tag of about $40 billion to $50 billon, the amendment would represent a potentially massive investment of federal resources in securing the border at a time when conservatives are complaining about government outlays.

As originally written, the legislation called for about $6 billion in new border security spending.

CRITICS STILL UNHAPPY

Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama mocked the deal even though he has called for tougher border enforcement. He noted that it was drafted after congressional analysts estimated the bill would trim illegal immigration by just 25 percent.

""The bill gets in trouble on the floor and they scurry around to get an amendment to throw 20,000 agents ... somewhere on the border in the future, we promise."" Sessions said, adding that such promises have been made in the past but not honored.

Sessions and other conservatives have pushed for delaying any pathway to citizenship for 11 million people until the government virtually eliminates illegal border crossings.

But the Senate repeatedly has repelled such attempts. On Thursday, it voted 54-43 to kill an amendment by Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican, which would have delayed permanent legal status for undocumented immigrants until the government met strict border enforcement goals.

On Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Senate's immigration bill would save the federal government nearly $900 billion over 20 years as illegal immigrants became legal, tax-paying residents.

A Democratic aide said those projected savings gave senators the leeway to craft such an expensive border security amendment.

House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican who has promised to consider an immigration bill this year, told reporters the CBO deficit-reduction estimates, if ""anywhere close to being accurate, would be a real boon for the country.""

While the legislation authorizes the beefed-up security programs, it would be up to Congress in the future to appropriate the funding.

A Senate aide said the newly legalized residents would not get ""green cards"" allowing permanent resident status until the border security measures were in place.

Gaining permanent resident status would take 10 years under the bill, giving the federal government the time to deploy the added border officers and equipment.

It also has a more furious metabolism, which Bush hasn’t fed much since March, when he was promoting a new book on immigration and created enormous confusion about whether he does or doesn’t support a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who came here illegally. (He later clarified that he does, with caveats, and even later praised immigrants for being “more fertile.”) That awkwardness gave some of his supporters pause, as they wondered whether he’d been too long out of the fray and was too clumsy for the split-second hyperscrutiny of the Twitter era. He hasn’t run for anything since 2002, when he was re-elected as the governor of Florida, an office he left in early 2007. A whole lot has changed since.

But with the exception of that immigration mess, Bush has been a more articulate advocate of a new tone and direction for the Republican Party than have Paul, Cruz, Christie or others currently in the foreground of the 2016 race, which has already begun, on both sides of the aisle. (Hillary Clinton gave a big policy speech last week and has another already announced.)"

Um, me? I wonder how many folks within the White House, gaming out whether Republicans might not just call the bluff, bothered to consider the fact that an embrace of heedless, profligate, across-the-board budget cuts to all manner of popular government programs is a key component of hardcore conservative ideology. [...] Did anyone in the White House notice how many conservatives, including ones in positions of governmental power, after Mitt Romney’s recorded back-room admission that he couldn’t get elected because 47 percent of the electorate is addicted to suckling on the federal teat, responded that what he said was absolutely correct? [...] And what could the White House have predicted conservatives would say to those who point out that pulling the rug out from under huge chunks of federal spending will spur a recession? They could have predicted that many would say exactly what they have said: that since it’s excessive federal spending that causes recessions, what’s wrong with cutting excessive federal spending?

Bottom line: didn’t anyone whose job it is to think about such things consider that at least some powerful Republicans—not all, it is true—would relish sequestration as a marvelous thing, a historic opportunity, a gift from Obama to help further the cause they’d been proclaiming as sacred for generations: to shrink the federal government small enough so they could someday drown it in Grover Norquist’s proverbial bathtub? “Once these cuts take effect, thousands of teachers and educators will be laid off and tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find childcare for their kids,” said Obama. Did he ever consider that to a lot of Republicans, that would sound like a wish list?"

Conrad Alvin Barrett, 27, is charged with violating the federal Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the Justice Department said. The complaint alleges that Barrett, of Katy, near Houston, attacked the man Nov. 24, recorded the assault on his cellphone and showed the video to others.

The complaint says Barrett made several videos, including one in which he identifies himself and another in which he makes a racial slur. It also says Barrett had been working up to playing the knockout game for about a week.

According to the complaint, Barrett says in the video that “the plan is to see if I were to hit a black person, would this be nationally televised?”

The knockout game has been known by a variety of names since it came to public notice about 1992. Essentially, a person abruptly attacks a defenseless victim, trying to knock him out with a single blow. Nothing is stolen, and no other crime is reported. Recently, incidents have taken on a deeper dimension because perpetrators record the attacks, often by cellphone video, and some of those videos go viral.

In one video that caused a sensation in late November, a white Pennsylvania teacher is seen walking in broad daylight when a sucker punch from a teenager among a group of black youths sends him to the concrete. The 50-year-old teacher recovered.

Random assaults on strangers simply to knock them out have been reported over the years in St. Louis; Washington, D.C.; Syracuse, N.Y.; and Chicago, among other areas. In Jersey City, N.J., two 13-year-olds and a 14-year-old were charged as juveniles in the murder of Ralph Eric Santiago, 46, who was found Sept. 10 with his neck broken and his head wedged between iron fence posts. Prosecutors contend the youths were playing the knockout game.

In late May in Syracuse, a group of teenagers attempted to knock out a man with a single punch but wound up beating and stomping him to death, authorities say. A 16-year-old was convicted of manslaughter, and his 13-year-old codefendant pleaded guilty to assault. Both were sentenced to 18 months behind bars.

Earlier in May, Elex Murphy, now 20, was sentenced to life in prison plus 25 years for killing a Vietnamese immigrant in St. Louis as part the game in 2011.

In New York City, at least one man was recently charged with a hate-crime assault in one of several attacks against Jews in Brooklyn. African American civil rights leaders have condemned the attacks as cowardly.

“These kids are targeting innocent people and in many cases specifically targeting Jewish folks,” the Rev. Al Sharpton, a television host and civil rights leader, said this month. He called on young people to stop playing the knockout game. “We would not be silent if it were the other way around, and we will not be silent now,” he said. “This behavior is racist, period. And we will not tolerate it.”

Many experts argue that such attacks are rare, if the game exists at all. But the incidents generate a high degree of fear because they are so random. The rapid dissemination of videos through social media can prompt copycat crimes, law enforcement officials say.

“Suspected crimes of this nature will simply not be tolerated,” U.S. Atty. Kenneth Magidson of the Southern District of Texas said in a statement as he announced the charges against Barrett. “Evidence of hate crimes will be vigorously investigated and prosecuted with the assistance of all our partners to the fullest extent of the law.”

Authorities accuse Barrett of hitting the elderly man with enough force that he immediately fell to the ground. They say Barrett laughed and said “knockout” as he ran to his vehicle and fled.

The victim had two jaw fractures and was hospitalized for several days, the Justice Department said.

“It is unimaginable in this day and age that one could be drawn to violently attack another based on the color of their skin,” said Stephen L. Morris, FBI special agent in charge of the Houston division. “We remind all citizens that we are protected under the law from such racially motivated attacks, and encourage everyone to report such crimes to the FBI.”

If convicted, Barrett could face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Now, notice the scant attention being given to an assault on civil liberties by the misconceived Education Department’s misnamed Office for Civil Rights (OCR).

Responding to what it considers the University of Montana’s defective handling of complaints about sexual assaults, OCR, in conjunction with the Justice Department, sent the university a letter intended as a “blueprint” for institutions nationwide when handling sexual harassment, too. The letter, sent on May 9, encourages (see below) adoption of speech codes — actually, censorship regimes — to punish students who:

Make “sexual or dirty jokes” that are “unwelcome.” Or disseminate “sexual rumors” (even if true) that are “unwelcome.” Or make “unwelcome” sexual invitations. Or engage in the “unwelcome” circulation or showing of “e-mails or Web sites of a sexual nature.” Or display or distribute “sexually explicit drawings, pictures, or written materials” that are “unwelcome.”

UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh, a specialist in First Amendment jurisprudence, notes (on the indispensable Volokh Conspiracy blog) that the OCR-DOJ’s proscriptions are “not limited to material that a reasonable person would find offensive.” The Supreme Court has held that for speech or conduct in schools to lead to a successful sexual harassment lawsuit, it must be sufficiently severe and pervasive to create a hostile environment. And it must be “objectively offensive” to a reasonable person. But, Volokh notes, the OCR-DOJ rules would mandate punishment for any individual’s “conduct of a sexual nature,” conduct “verbal, nonverbal or physical,” that is not objectively offensive to a normal person. This means any conduct “unwelcome” by anyone.

Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, says a single hypersensitive person could declare herself sexually harassed because she considers “unwelcome” a classroom lecture on the novel “Lolita” or a campus performance of “The Vagina Monologues.” Do not even attempt a sex education class.

Wendy Kaminer, a civil liberties lawyer who writes for the Atlantic, traces the pedigree of the OCR-DOJ thinking to the attempt by some feminists in the 1980s to define pornography as a form of sexual assault and hence a civil rights violation. Volokh, too, believes that the government is blurring the distinction between physical assaults and “sexually themed” speech in order to justify censoring and punishing the latter.

The OCR-DOJ “blueprint” requires, Kaminer says, colleges and universities to hear harassment complaints under quasi-judicial procedures “that favor complainants.” Under 2011 rules that establish a low standard of proof, Kaminer says, “students accused of harassment are to be convicted in the absence of clear and convincing evidence of guilt, if guilt merely seems more likely than not.” And schools are enjoined to “take immediate steps to protect the complainant from further harassment,” including “taking disciplinary action against the harasser” prior to adjudication. So the OCR-DOJ “blueprint” and related rules not only violate the First Amendment guarantee of free speech but are, to be polite, casual about due process.

Hans Bader, a former OCR lawyer now with the limited-government Competitive Enterprise Institute, notes that this “Alice in Wonderland” — “sentence first, verdict afterwards” — system “casts a cloud over academic freedom and the ability to discuss topics that are offensive to some listeners.” Indeed, to one listener.

When the Education Department was created in 1980 (Jimmy Carter’s payment to the National Education Association, the largest teachers union, for its first presidential endorsement), conservatives warned that it would be used for ideological aggression to break state and local schools to the federal saddle. Lukianoff says:

“Given that the [OCR-DOJ] letter represents an interpretation of federal law by major federal agencies, most colleges will regard it as binding. Noncompliance threatens federal funding, including Pell grants and Stafford loans.”

Most of academia’s leadership is too invertebrate and too soggy with political correctness to fight the OCR-DOJ mischief. But someone will. And it is so patently unconstitutional that it will be swiftly swatted down by the courts. Still, it is useful idiocy because, coming right now, it underscores today’s widespread government impulse for lawless coercion — the impulse that produced the Internal Revenue Service’s suppression of political speech that annoys the Obama administration.

Like the IRS abuses of power, the OCR-DOJ initiative demonstrates how permeated this administration is with disagreeable people with dangerous intentions. So the administration is making conservatism’s case against the unlimited arrogance that is both a cause and a consequence of unlimited government.

""The President made a wise choice and it will serve him, the Congress, and the country for the best. Katie has the great ability to listen and then bring people together, and will be able to convey the administration's message in strong but friendly terms to members of both parties.""

In a statement announcing Fallon's promotion, Obama said, ""She has the deep expertise and strong relationships required to build on the progress we've made this year and advance my top priority: creating jobs and expanding broad-based growth and opportunity for every American.""

The news of Rodriguez's departure and Fallon's promotion was first reported by Politico on Friday morning.

The move to bolster the White House legislative affairs shop is the latest in a string of personnel changes Obama is making this month, including recruiting former legislative affairs director Phil Schiliro for a temporary assignment helping oversee the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act health insurance exchanges. Obama also hired John Podesta, former White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton and one of the Democratic Party's most seasoned strategists, to be a senior counselor.

Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, has been thinking about restructuring the legislative affairs operation to be ""more responsive to concerns on the Hill and better calibrated to promote the president's agenda,"" according to a White House official. After consulting with Obama, McDonough proposed moving Fallon into the job. She met with Obama to diagnose the White House's problems on Capitol Hill, the official said, and Obama asked her to coordinate Obama's climate change agenda and manage legislative strategy around immigration reform and the health-care law.

Fallon will begin her new assignment in January, and an aide said she plans to spend the next few weeks consulting with lawmakers about the 2014 agenda.

""Katie is whip smart, and fully understands the challenges and opportunities members of Congress face every day,"" McDonough said in a statement. ""This is an Administration committed to working with members from both parties to find common sense ways to grow the economy for all Americans. There is nobody better suited to lead our efforts on the Hill than Katie.”

Rodriguez, a former Senate aide to Hillary Rodham Clinton who joined the State Department at the start of the Obama administration, is leaving to pursue a job in the private sector.

McDonough said Rodriguez has ""helped manage some of the most complex and sensitive challenges we faced on the Hill and will be missed immensely.""

In his statement, Obama said, ""Throughout some of this year’s most contentious legislative battles, Miguel worked tirelessly to bridge the partisan divide, forge consensus, and seek out solutions that helped us move forward. As the son of immigrants, I know Miguel took particular pride in the Senate’s passage of a bipartisan, commonsense immigration reform plan — something that we are going to see through. I’m grateful for his service, and I will miss his advice and counsel."""

Council candidate asks opponent to exit race as at-large election nears,"D.C. Council candidate Elissa Silverman tried to broker a deal to get Matthew Frumin to drop out of Tuesday’s election for an at-large seat, a last-ditch effort to reduce the number of Democratic candidates counting on support from the city’s majority-white neighborhoods.

A representative of Silverman’s campaign met with Frumin earlier this month and suggested he quit the race, both candidates confirmed over the weekend. About a week ago, Silverman reached out in an e-mail asking Frumin to get out.

If he obliged, Silverman pledged she would help Frumin, who serves on a Ward 3 Advisory Neighborhood Commission, unseat D.C. Council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) next year, according to sources familiar with the discussion.

Frumin confirmed that account Sunday, although he said he would have preferred that it had not been made public. “I am not trying to end with a story like this,” he said.

Silverman’s offer provides a window into a special election that could come down to a few hundred votes because the city’s Democratic majority appears closely divided among the candidates.

At-Large DC council candidate Elissa Silverman (Amanda Voisard /Amanda Voisard )

Silverman said her campaign treasurer, Ken Archer, met with Frumin to urge him to leave the race. But Silverman, a former reporter on leave from the Fiscal Policy Institute, denied that she tried to link Frumin’s candidacy this year to Cheh’s political future and said the discussion was supposed to be confidential.

One of six candidates in the contest, Silverman said she was merely trying to coalesce “reform and progressive” Democrats behind her candidacy to keep incumbent Anita Bonds (D-At Large) or Republican Patrick Mara from winning the seat.

“I want to see a true progressive win,” Silverman said. “I don’t think Mara is a progressive reformer, and I don’t think Anita is a progressive reformer.”

Mara, making his third council bid in five years, is banking on a strong turnout from Republicans in an election that is predicted to draw just 10 percent of registered voters. Bonds, the only African American Democrat in the race, is expected to do well in neighborhoods in the eastern part of the city.

Frumin, Silverman and Democratic candidate Paul Zukerberg are hoping for strong support from Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the western part of the city. Perry Redd, a member of the Statehood Green Party, also is seeking the seat.

In Silverman’s discussion with Frumin about a week ago, she shared with him a private poll that indicated she had more citywide support than he did.

Frumin rebuffed Silverman’s request, saying the at-large race is fluid and that his campaign remains confident of his chances.

Frumin said Sunday that he doesn’t “fault” Silverman for trying but questioned whether it undermines her argument that she is a reformer.

“It was explicit that she would support me in a Ward 3 race, including against Mary Cheh,” said Frumin, who has consistently said he has no interest in running against Cheh next year. “The idea of an attempted deal, maybe that is what happens in politics, but when you are claiming a whole new politics, that is something of an issue.”

Silverman said she pledged to support Frumin “if he decided to run again” but did not specifically target Cheh’s seat.

Cheh said Sunday that she was aware of the discussion between the Silverman campaign and Frumin. Cheh declined to comment further.

The dust-up comes on the final weekend of the campaign, and all six candidates raced across the city looking for support while finalizing get-out-the-vote strategies. With turnout expected to be low, candidates say it might take as few as 15,000 votes to win.

Mara, who is hoping for crossover support from Democrats, said he had 75 volunteers on the streets reminding supporters to vote Tuesday.

“The groundwork all of my volunteers have been laying now for months is paying off,” said Mara, who represents Ward 1 on the State Board of Education.

But Al Malik Farrakan, a Ward 4 activist who is working for Bonds, predicted that “there is no question” Bonds will win, boosted by what he expects to be a robust turnout in majority black neighborhoods.

Farrakan used a van Saturday to shuttle voters to early voting. At the same time, Zukerberg was using pedicabs to get his voters to the polls. Zukerberg, who is pushing to decriminalize marijuana, sponsored a free concert on the Mall, and the pedicabs then shuttled concert-goers to early voting.

“I’ve already won,” said Zukerberg, noting all six candidates now support efforts to decriminalize marijuana. “I’ve changed the way people think. I’ve changed the dialogue and I’ve changed minds.”

There was support for each candidate among Saturday’s early voters.

Bill Schmidt, a Republican from Logan Circle, brought his girlfriend, a Democrat, so they could both vote for Mara.

“We argue about politics quite often, but for me, this is about school reform,” said Leslie Duche, 29, referring to one of Mara’s campaign themes.

Sharon Harley, 55, of Wesley Heights voted for Bonds because she said she wants to support an African American candidate.

“It’s not that I don’t believe non-African Americans can represent diverse opinions, but visually and philosophically, it’s important for African Americans to feel D.C. is still a place for them,” Harley said.

Frumin’s extensive direct-mail campaign won over Chip Walgreen, 50, of Shaw.

“He is a refreshing voice, and I think it would be beneficial to have someone on the council who doesn’t have a long history on the council,” Walgreen said.

Paul Russell, 38, of Brookland voted for Silverman because he believes she is better versed in tax policy.

“The other ones seem interested more in education, and one wanted to legalize marijuana, and at this particular time, that doesn’t really affect me,” Russell said."

O'Reilly's temper flared when Colmes claimed that Obama said that he would cut entitlements, including Medicare. The host slammed his fist on the table and told Colmes, ""You are lying here.""

O'Reilly addressed the exchange on Thursday. ""Lots of folks talking about my shootout with Alan Colmes last night where I asked him what specific — specific — budget cuts President Obama has proposed,"" he said at the start of the show. “Colmes hemmed and hawed saying the president’s promising to cut Medicare, or something. But the truth is Mr. Obama has not put forth any specific federal spending cuts. It's all a bunch of general nonsense and so Colmes and I got into it.

He went on to lament the nation's rising debt and what he called ""economic madness,"" saying that he raised his voice ""to get everyone's attention"" about Obama's stance.

""The president of the United States is not looking out for the country right now,” O’Reilly said. “He is hell-bent on destroying the Republican Party and he does not seem to care if the nation collapses as a result.""

Later on in the show, O'Reilly faced off with guest Kirsten Powers over the issue. Powers echoed Colmes' argument, telling O'Reilly that Obama has proposed spending cuts. She held up a piece of paper which she said detailed $400 billion in health care cuts that the White House wanted to make. ""You need to admit you are wrong,"" she said. ""You are wrong about this and now you’re playing a game.""

O'Reilly argued that Obama has not offered ""specific"" cuts. ""This is where you and I will never agree,"" he said.

“Because I use facts?” Powers shot back. She said that O'Reilly was ""one hundred percent wrong,"" and that Obama's plan for spending cuts was online for anyone to see.

""You and I will never reach détente because you don’t understand the word specific,"" O'Reilly concluded."

The GOP is in serious trouble — and it is trouble that we, as long-time Democrats, recognize all too well.

Since their defeat in 2012, Republicans have offered plenty of excuses: candidates who can’t fire up the base, gaps in messaging and technology, the hard-to-match charisma of a historic president. And most Republican leaders seem to hope that cosmetic changes will be enough to reverse course in 2016 — without challenging the convictions of the party’s core supporters.

A quarter of a century ago, it was our party that was in a bad way. After losing a third presidential election in a row, Democrats offered a litany of explanations for what had gone wrong. Many of the recriminations focused on 1988 candidate Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. Others pointed to fundraising and technology, media and momentum. Even after Dukakis’s defeat at the hands of a decidedly uncharismatic George H.W. Bush, Democrats continued to tell themselves that their fortunes would start looking up when Ronald Reagan left the arena.

We disagreed, and in a 1989 manifesto, “The Politics of Evasion: Democrats and the Presidency,” we set out to debunk the myths that Democrats were using to explain away their dismal defeats. “Too many Americans have come to see the party as inattentive to their economic interests, indifferent if not hostile to their moral sentiments, and ineffective in defense of their national security,” we wrote. We pointed to evidence that the party’s problems were more fundamental than the ones being discussed. And we laid out the kinds of changes the party would have to embrace if it wished to regain its competitiveness in presidential elections.

Of course, as Democrats, we welcome today’s reversal of fortunes. We’re gratified that many fewer Americans see the party as out of touch and that many more are open to the Democratic agenda. And no doubt the Democrats’ electoral success has been helped by the fact that it is now the Republican Party that is a victim of adverse demographic trends, unpopular positions on the issues and a demanding base that is far from the country’s center of political gravity.

But we also believe that our democracy is better off with two healthy political parties willing to debate fiercely — and then reach honorable compromises. A Republican Party dominated by a new generation of reform-minded conservatives who care more about solving problems than scoring points would be a huge step toward restoring a federal government that can govern. So we’d like to pass on to Republicans now some of the advice we offered Democrats then.

The first step is to dispense with the evasion. Our manifesto explored three myths that were prevalent among Democrats in 1989— and that can be seen among Republicans today.

The Myth of Fundamentalism

The Myth of Fundamentalism held that Democrats lost presidential elections because they strayed from traditional liberal orthodoxy.We argued that there simply were not enough liberals in the electorate to carry the party to victory. To win, it would need to both hold on to liberals and attract a substantial majority of the moderate vote.

Three years later, Bill Clinton sought to do that. Running for president as a “New Democrat,” he famously promised to “end welfare as we know it,” campaigned against outsize budget deficits and trade protectionism, and proposed to reinvent government, not expand it.

The Republican Party today is as out of step with the mainstream as Democrats were in 1989. For too many conservatives, “Back to Reagan” is a soothing mantra. They think conservatism’s ills can be cured by becoming more conservative. But Republicans are as far from the end of the Reagan administration as Democrats were from FDR during the Nixon era, and the party’s 1980 platform won’t solve today’s problems.

Although there are more conservatives than liberals in the electorate, the GOP still needs moderate support. But the tea party’s Wahhabi-style drive to restore pure, uncompromised conservatism has led Republicans away from an electoral majority. This is especially true with young voters and minorities, although in recent years the entire country has become more tolerant and inclusive. A party dominated by hard-edged social conservatives, opponents of the DREAM Act and climate-change deniers will have a difficult time gaining a hearing.

Republicans would also do well to acknowledge that their commitment to shrinking government entails much deeper spending cuts than most Americans are willing to accept — especially in programs such as Social Security and Medicare. And they must find a way to respond to mainstream concerns about stagnant wages and widening disparities of income and wealth.

The Myth of Mobilization

The second myth we explored was the Myth of Mobilization: the argument that on Election Day, “selective mobilization of groups that strongly support Democratic candidates, especially minorities and the poor, would get the job done for Democratic presidential candidates.” We recalculated the 1988 electoral college results based on African American turnout levels as high as 68 percent of the voting-age population, and even such a record showing wouldn’t have come close to changing the outcome.

The Republicans’ demographic problem is the mirror image of the one that Democrats faced a quarter-century ago. Back then, there weren’t enough minorities to make the Democrats’ electoral strategy work; today, there aren’t enough whites to put the Republicans over the top.

And it will only get worse for them: By the middle of this century, the Census Bureau projects, whites will no longer constitute a majority of the U.S. population. A nearly all-white party, which is what the GOP has become, will have no chance of obtaining an electoral majority. Republicans will have to compete for black, Latino and Asian votes.

The Myth of the Congressional Bastion

The final misconception we called the Myth of the Congressional Bastion. This was perhaps even more important than the other two myths in sustaining the optimism Democrats felt in 1989. It went something like this: “There’s nothing fundamentally wrong with the Democratic Party; there’s no realignment going on; the proof is that Democrats still control Congress and a majority of state and local offices as well.” (Despite Dukakis’s seven-point defeat, Democrats gained governorships and controlled 28 statehouses.)

We argued at the time that it was unrealistic to expect that the enormous Republican tide in Southern states at the presidential level would have no effect at the congressional level, and that the power of incumbency was masking what was happening in the electorate.

Five years later, the myth collapsed. In the 1994 midterm elections, Republicans won the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years, along with 10 governorships, for a total of 30.

Incumbency can protect a party against shifts in the electorate for only so long. The Republican hold on the House is not overwhelming, and it is far from permanent. Nor is the GOP’s edge among governors. If the generational replacement taking place at the presidential level continues, it will inevitably affect Congress and the states as well.

Reform on the horizon?

Who might play our iconoclast role in this version of the movie? Among the contenders are libertarians, populists and even mainstream conservatives who believe that the idea of compassionate conservatism deserves to survive George W. Bush’s presidency.

Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson and fellow Bush 43 veteran Peter Wehner are trying to build on what Bush got right — and warn the GOP away from what the tea party gets wrong. In a March Commentary magazineessay headlined “How to Save the Republican Party,” they wrote: “It is no wonder that Republican policies can seem stale; they are very nearly identical to those offered up by the party more than 30 years ago. For Republicans to design an agenda that applies to the conditions of 1980 is as if Ronald Reagan designed his agenda for conditions that existed in the Truman years.”

Gerson and Wehner propose focusing on the economic concerns of working- and middle-class Americans, welcoming rising immigrant groups, pushing back against hyper-individualistic libertarianism by demonstrating the party’s commitment to the common good, engaging social issues “in a manner that is aspirational rather than alienating,” and harnessing policy views to scientific findings. Describing opposition to same-sex marriage as a “losing battle,” they note tartly (and correctly) that “it is heterosexuals, not homosexuals, who have made a hash out of marriage,” and they suggest that Republicans and conservatives might more usefully focus on strengthening marriage in all its forms.

Gerson and Wehner also offer a theme: “The Republican goal is equal opportunity, not equal results. But equality of opportunity is not a natural state; it is a social achievement, for which government shares some responsibility.”

Despite this intellectual ferment, the transformation of the Republican Party has barely begun. There’s no substitute for a leader who has the guts to break with outdated party orthodoxy, as Clinton did on trade, fiscal policy, welfare and crime, among other issues. And he did more than that: In the famous Sister Souljah episode, when he denounced an African American rapper for comments that justified blacks killing whites, he spoke out against a tendency in the party’s base that crossed the line from protest to extremism.

Mitt Romney and the other contenders for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination had numerous opportunities to do just that, and they ducked them all. The incredible statements about women and rape by two Republican Senate candidates could have served as a Sister Souljah moment for Romney. But rather than using them to mount a full-throated protest against extremism in the party, he offered a mild rebuke that did nothing to undo the damage or to change the trajectory of the campaign. As long as aspirants for GOP leadership flinch from confronting their angry base, the American people will continue to see Republicans as uncompromising, uncaring and retrograde.

And until party leaders are willing to call extremism by its rightful name, repudiating not just mean-spirited words but also narrow-minded policies, it is unlikely that any candidate will be willing to do so. The phrase “liberal fundamentalism” made us few friends a quarter of a century ago, but it was necessary for us to utter it. We’re waiting for our counterparts among today’s Republicans and conservatives to do the same.

Detroit Free Press

Guide includes answers to 100 questions about Americans

MSU editor in residence involved journalism students in the project

Students gathered questions about Americans from their international counterparts

Page 4 explains why Americans often smile at strangers. Page 8 contains a handy tipping guide. And Page 35 offers some advice on asking someone out on a date.

Those questions — and 97 others — are gathered in a new guide aimed at helping international students understand the U.S. and its people. The guide was developed last semester by Michigan State University journalism students and delivered on the last day of class.

Called ""100 Questions & Answers about Americans,"" it's available for purchase online at Amazon and Barnes & Noble.

The guide has its genesis in the class of Joe Grimm, the visiting editor in residence at MSU's school of journalism. During his stint as ombudsman of the Detroit Free Press, Grimm said he heard from Arab and Jewish readers about issues, which led to a guide of questions and answers about Arabs.

Flash-forward more than a decade. MSU's Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives encouraged Grimm to work on the new guide. Michigan State has more than 6,700 students from 131 nations, with the most foreign students coming from China.

Grimm got the 16 students in his class involved.

""It forces students to talk to people across cultures and to learn how to ask awkward questions,"" he said.

The journalism students fanned out to find international students and gather the questions they had about America and Americans.

""It was really good training on how to talk to people and then how to find answers,"" said student Michelle Armstead, who worked on a team looking at race and social behaviors. ""We knew that there were a ton of people who didn't know much about America, other than what they had seen on TV.""

The journalism students compiled the questions and edited them down to a list of 100.

""The questions were framed by where the people were from,"" Grimm said. ""We had someone from Saudi ask why Americans work so hard. We had someone from China who asked why Americans didn't work hard.""

The students then set out to answer the questions. Some led them to census data. Other answers came from the journalism students' personal experiences.

The guide then went out to various MSU experts to vet the answers.

During the process, students learned about marketing, including what people were searching for online and how to make sure the guide popped up in result lists.

As for the answers to those earlier questions: Page 4 says Americans smile at strangers to be friendly; Page 8 says you don't have to tip the grocery bagger and Page 35 says you should spend time getting to know someone before asking for a date."

Updated 10/9/2013 at 8:00 a.m.

Washington (CNN) – There appeared to be enough votes in the House on Wednesday to approve legislation to reopen the federal government, according to an ongoing CNN survey of House members.

CNN's vote count

All 200 Democrats and 19 Republicans support passing a continuing resolution with no additional legislative strings attached that would reopen the federal government, which has been partially closed for a week over a bitter policy dispute between Republicans and Democrats on health care. With three vacancies in 435 member House, 217 votes are currently the minimum needed for the measure to win approval in the House.

CNN's vote count appears to bear out what President Barack Obama said on Monday.

""The truth of the matter is, there are enough Republican and Democratic votes in the House of Representatives right now to end this shutdown immediately with no partisan strings attached,"" Obama said.

But this does not mean a vote will happen any time soon, given that these Republicans have not indicated a willingness to try to force Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to bring a continuing resolution with no strings attached to the floor for a vote. After a meeting with Republicans on Tuesday, Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma told CNN that the speaker told members there would not be a House vote on a ""clean"" government funding bill.

The clean CR is at the center of the dispute between Obama and Republicans, the latter trying to use the government shutdown as a legislative avenue to help defund the president's health care law. Many House Republicans are demanding that passage of a continuing resolution is contingent on the health care law being delayed – the first step in an effort they hope to use to dismantle it. The president and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, have said that the GOP's efforts are a non-starter.

As is the case with all vote counts, the numbers continually evolve and change by the hour and day.

Still, Boehner has maintained that there are not enough votes in the House to pass a ""clean"" CR.

""There are not the votes in the House to pass a clean CR,"" the speaker said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""The American people expect in Washington, when we have a crisis like this, that the leaders will sit down and have a conversation. I told my members the other day, there may be a back room somewhere, but there's nobody in it.""

Republican Rep. Charles Dent of Pennsylvania disagreed with the speaker's assessment. He told CNN on Monday that if the vote were to come to the floor, he believes it would pass.

""I believe a clean CR would pass comfortably,"" said Dent. ""I'm not here to predict the number, I think it would clear the 217 vote barrier.""

In response, Obama dared Boehner on Monday to prove that he doesn't have the votes for a clean continuing resolution.

""If Republicans and Speaker Boehner are saying there are not enough votes then they should prove it,"" Obama said. ""Let the bill go to the floor, and let's see what happens. Just vote.""

On Monday, as Democrats trumpeted other vote counts that appeared to show there are enough votes in the House to pass a clean government funding bill, a number of lawmakers began to walk back previous statements.

Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California was one of those lawmakers. After telling Huffington Post and others that he supported a government funding bill with no strings attached, his spokesman said Monday that ""that was never the case.""

""He does not support a clean CR, does not support it, does not advocate it,"" said Jack Langer, a spokesman for Nunes.

Republicans Leonard Lance of New Jersey and Randy Forbes of Virginia, who other news outlets report have supported a clean government funding bill, told CNN on Monday that they did not back the measure.

""Reports that Randy Forbes supports a 'clean' CR are not true,"" a Forbes said. ""This was misrepresented in a story by the Virginian Pilot (newspaper), which subsequently was picked up by HuffPo and other national outlets – none of which bothered to contact our office to verify.""

Instead, Forbes has introduced legislation that would fund all of the government except Obamcare, the aide said.

Not all Republicans moved away from voting for a government funding bill with no strings attached.

Late on Monday, Republican Rep. David Reichert of Washington said he would ""continue to vote for any legislation that keeps the federal government open.""

Likewise on Tuesday, Republican Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado announced he supported a government funding bill with no strings attached in a Denver Post opinion-editorial and Republican Rep. Walter B. Jones of North Carolina said he wished the House ""would pass a clean CR"" during an interview with MSNBC.

Other Republican members, like Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, would not confirm a report from the Miami Herald that said the lawmaker would support a clean resolution.

""The president needs to sit down and negotiate with the speaker,"" Cesar Gonzalez, a spokesman for Diaz-Balart, said. ""In the meantime, the congressman does not think it is wise to negotiate through the press.""

The 19 Republicans who support a government funding bill with no strings attached are:

Walter B. Jones, R-North Carolina: Said during an interview with MSNBC that he wished the House ""would pass a clean CR.""

Mike Coffman, R-Colorado: Announced he supported a government funding bill with no strings attached in a Denver Post opinion-editorial.

Tim Griffin, R-Arkansas: ""Tweeted the he would support a clean government funding bill.""

Bill Young, R-Florida: A spokesman tells CNN that Young would support a clean government funding bill.

Dennis Ross, R-Florida: A spokeswoman told CNN Ross would support a one-year government funding bill at sequestration levels with no strings attached.

Mike Simpson, R-Idaho: Statement: ""Similar to Sen. Rand Paul, I could support a very short-term clean CR, perhaps one or two weeks, while we continue to negotiate on a longer-term bill.""

Frank LoBiondo, R-New Jersey: LoBiondo penned an editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer that said he supported a clean government funding bill.

Jon Runyan, R- New Jersey: Runyan penned an editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer that said he supported a clean government funding bill.

Pete King, R-New York: Told CNN he supports passing a clean government funding bill.

Michael Grimm, R-New York: Grimm told CNN he would support a clean government funding bill.

Jim Gerlach, R-Penn.: A spokesman told CNN that Gerlach would support a clean government funding bill if it came to the floor.

Pat Meehan, R-Penn.: Statement on October 1: ""I believe it’s time for the House to vote for a clean, short-term funding bill.""

Michael Fitzpatrick, R-Penn.: Fitzpatrick penned an editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer that said he supported a clean government funding bill.

Lou Barletta, R-Penn.: A spokesman told CNN that Barletta would vote yes if a clean government funding bill came to the floor. On Tuesday morning, the spokesman said while Barletta is now focused on passing a compromise that includes repealing of the medical device tax, it is fair to include him as a yes vote for a funding bill with no strings attached.

Charles Dent, R-Penn.: Told CNN he supports a clean government funding bill. ""I think now it's imperative that we just fund the government,"" he said.

Robert Wittman, R-Virgina: A spokeswoman tell CNN Wittman would vote yes on a clean government funding bill.

Scott Rigell, R-Virginia: Told CNN on October 1 that he supported passing a clean government funding bill.

Frank Wolf, R-Virginia: A spokesman tells CNN that Wolf will support a clean government funding bill.

David Reichert, R-Washington: October 7 statement: ""I will continue to vote for any legislation that keeps the federal government open.""

Additional cost-cutting measures may result in a smaller cut, around 10 percent. Although the cuts are widespread across the government, public defenders say the reductions are hitting them particularly hard. Unlike other federal programs, the public defenders say, they have little fat to trim since most of their costs are for staff and rent. Just 10 percent of their budgets are devoted to expert witnesses, investigative costs and travel.

Already, federal defenders said they have cut back on staff members and their workloads.

Almost all offices have had to furlough or lay off workers. In Virginia, a chief public defender said he had to lay off five lawyers, about 10 percent of his staff. Two other staff members retired to help save the office money, while another voluntarily went on active duty in the military.

In Delaware, public defenders had to take 15-day furloughs. In Illinois, a public defender’s office cut two lawyers and a computer technician.

“We were already defending cases with one hand behind our backs before the sequester,” said Jonathan Hawley, a federal public defender in Peoria, Ill. “Now we will have to operate with both hands behind our back.”

The cuts have made for some hard choices.

Michael S. Nachmanoff, a federal public defender for the Eastern District of Virginia, who has represented Somali pirates and illegal arms and drug dealers, said he faced a difficult decision this year when he had to choose between paying staff members or continuing a case without adequate resources."

USA TODAY

The day after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed a joint session of Congress. His speech that day, which summoned a nation to war, would become among the most iconic in American history — particularly Roosevelt's famous line describing the outrageous attack the prior day:

""Yesterday, December 7, 1941 — a date which will live in infamy — the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.""

Times of crisis often bring out the best in orators. USA TODAY Network looks back at some other famous quotes from the World War II era — both before and after the ""date which will live in infamy.""

Pearl Harbor: Complete coverage of 75th anniversary of attack

Franklin D. Roosevelt

In an effort to keep the United States out of war, Roosevelt made the case during a fireside chat on Dec. 29, 1940, that the nation must provide additional support to Great Britain. During his remarks, he coined the famous ""arsenal of democracy"" phrase.

""We must be the great arsenal of democracy. For us this is an emergency as serious as war itself. We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war.""

In that same speech, FDR discussed what had become increasingly clear: appeasing Adolf Hitler and the Nazi government in Germany was not a rational policy.

""No man can tame a tiger into a kitten by stroking it. There can be no appeasement with ruthlessness. There can be no reasoning with an incendiary bomb. We know now that a nation can have peace with the Nazis only at the price of total surrender.""

Winston Churchill

Perhaps no leader in history used oratory more effectively than Churchill during World War II. His decisive and defiant addresses inspired a nation teetering on the brink. In his first speech as the British prime minister before the House of Commons in May 1940, Churchill made clear his commitment to the cause:

""I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.""

""You ask what is our aim? I can answer in one word: Victory. Victory at all costs. Victory in spite of all terror. Victory however long and hard the road may be. For without victory there is no survival.""

A month later in June, Churchill rallied the British not long after France fell to Germany:

""Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.' ""

In August of that year, the prime minister spoke of the sacrifices many British pilots had already made:

""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.""

George S. Patton

Patton achieved legendary status during World War II, and his plainspoken style endeared him to U.S. troops. Among the quotes credited to him:

""May God have mercy upon my enemies, because I won't.""

Dwight Eisenhower

Eisenhower, commander of allied troops in Europe, delivered this message to allied forces just before they embarked on the Normandy invasion on June 6, 1944:

""Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force! You are about to embark upon a great crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty loving people everywhere march with you."""

Washington (CNN) - President Barack Obama continued what's become an annual post-Thanksgiving tradition by stopping at a bookstore for Small Business Saturday.

With his two daughters alongside, the President went to Politics and Prose in Washington to pick up a few books, telling reporters he bought a ""long list"" of titles for every age group, including his own. (Read the full list below)

The President chatted at length with several customers, while his daughters, Sasha and Malia, browsed.

He went to the cashier to make his purchase after about 20 minutes. As he left the shop, the President wished everyone a ""great holiday,"" and customers applauded.

Started by two people in 1984, Politics and Prose has grown to a staff of 50 employees and is known as a popular spot for book discussions and readings, with daily visits by authors.

First lady Michelle Obama, who was not with the family Saturday, held a book signing at Politics and Prose in May to promote “American Grown,” a book about the White House garden and her campaign against obesity.

Last year, the Obamas shopped at a different bookstore - One More Page Books - in the Washington suburb of Arlington, Virginia.

Small Business Saturday is a tradition started by American Express in 2010.

In 2011, they went to Kramerbooks and Afterwords Café in Washington.

List of books purchased by Obama, according to the White House:

“Half Brother” by Kenneth Oppel

“Heart of a Samurai” by Margi Preus

“Flora and Ulysses” by Kate DiCamillo

“Jinx” by Sage Blackwood

“Lulu and the Brontosaurus” by Judith Viorst and Lane Smith

“Ottoline and the Yellow Cat” by Chris Riddell

“Moonday” by Adam Rex

“Journey” by Aaron Becker

Amid the increasing scrutiny, Mark Emmert, the N.C.A.A.’s president, disclosed in late January that the organization’s investigators had made “shocking” missteps in a major inquiry involving the University of Miami — and as a result, the N.C.A.A. commissioned an unprecedented outside investigation of its own enforcement program.

On Monday, the N.C.A.A. released the investigation’s findings, showing how its enforcement staff had run afoul of its own rules in the Miami case in such a way that even Emmert said he was embarrassed.

“Obviously, this is an outcome that nobody wants to see on their watch or anybody else’s,” Emmert said."

That is the question that residents in Weld County will face in November after county commissioners voted unanimously Monday in favor of putting a 51st state initiative on the ballot, the Greeley Tribune reports.

The initiative, which calls for the creation of the state of North Colorado, has already made it onto the ballot in Cheyenne, Sedgwick and Yuma Counties. Logan, Phillips, Washington and Kit Carson Counties have also set dates to vote on the initiative.

Several rural, predominantly Republican counties of north and and northeastern Colorado announced their plan to create a 51st state back in June. Supporters have cited a number of laws -- including gun control measures, an increase in renewable energy standards in rural areas, the curbing of perceived cruel treatment of livestock and expanded regulation of oil and gas production -- that the Democratically-controlled state legislature passed this year, as the impetus for the secession movement.

""Rural residents are now a disenfranchised minority of Colorado,"" Phillips County Administrator Randy Schafer told The Denver Post last month. ""National and urban values and needs are trumping rural values and needs.""

On the ballot, the initiative will read: ""Shall the Board of County Commissioners of Weld County, in concert with the county commissioners of other Colorado counties, pursue becoming the 51st state of the United States of America?""

The vote, however, has been regarded as largely symbolic, since the new state would have to be approved by the state legislature, the governor and Congress.

“We had to do something that would grab Denver’s attention,” said Weld County Commissioner Sean Conway."

RALEIGH, N.C. — The North Carolina House approved plans Tuesday to immediately strip Charlotte of the airport it has run for more than 70 years and turn over control of the country's eighth-busiest airline hub to an appointed body.

The House voted 75-39 to hand management of US Airways' top hub to a regional authority. Changes made by House lawmakers, including the immediate transfer of the assets and management, still must be approved by the state Senate. The plan does not require Gov. Pat McCrory's approval to take effect because it is considered a local issue, and he cannot veto it.

Charlotte officials are warning of a lawsuit to block the move. Ex-mayor Anthony Foxx fought the move before becoming U.S. transportation secretary this month.

US Airways is close to merging with American Airlines and deciding where to place major operations.

Advocates for the change say they want to protect the commerce that depends on the easy flight connections of a major airline hub. Banana giant Chiquita Brands International decided in 2011 to move its global headquarters from Cincinnati in part because of the greater access to foreign flights in and out of Charlotte Douglas International Airport.

""The airport is not like regular city departments. It really is a business. And smart business people don't wait until the system is broken before they fix it. They look ahead, prepare to avoid dangers and to capture opportunities,"" said Rep. Ruth Samuelson, R-Mecklenburg, a former county commissioner. ""A smart business person recognizes that when her biggest customer, in this case US Airways, is undergoing a major reorganization impacting every factor of their business including hub locations, she needs to be well-positioned to capture that opportunity.""

Charlotte-area Democrats urged their Republican colleagues to reject the plan, the latest in a series of local disputes in which the Legislature's GOP majority has intervened this year. Opponents of a takeover by a regional operating authority noted US Airways already enjoys some of the lowest operating costs in the country at Charlotte's airport.

""We've started out with a conclusion and then tried to figure out how to jury-rig the structure to support that conclusion,"" said Rep. Kelly Alexander, D-Mecklenburg. ""I appeal to you - you were elected to use your brains.""

Charlotte proposed transferring some airport control of to an independent 11-member governing body whose members would be appointed by the city and not state leaders, Mayor Patsy Kinsey said Tuesday. Airport employees would continue working for the city.

Kinsey criticized legislative Republicans for appearing intent on taking the airport away from Charlotte.

""The citizens of Charlotte built that airport; Raleigh didn't,"" Kinsey said in a video released by city officials.

""The city's proposal is designed to avoid litigation and remove the cloud of uncertainty hanging over Charlotte Douglas International Airport's future,"" she said."

“Bob Filner’s announcement that he will be taking a leave of absence prolongs the pain he is inflicting on our city at a time when San Diegans are calling for an end to this civic nightmare,” Council President Todd Gloria said in a statement.

Gloria said that although Filner has acknowledged his “serious disorder,” he must hold himself to a higher standard because he is a government leader.

“Since the City Charter hasn’t clearly spelled out how to handle this situation, it requires us to ask in the strongest terms possible for the Mayor’s resignation in a manner that allows the continuation of effective government for all San Diegans,” the statement said. “The time for indecisiveness and inaction is over. I again call upon the Mayor to resign.”

At a news conference at City Hall on Friday, Filner continued to refuse calls for his resignation. He said he would undergo two weeks of intensive therapy starting Aug. 5. He planned to return to work full time Aug. 19, but will continue to be briefed morning and evening on city business.

Filner did not answer questions at the news conference.

Filner is the first Democratic mayor in 20 years, elected on promises of improving neighborhood services and breaking up the “old boy’s network” that he says has run City Hall for decades.

He acknowledged Friday that, “I must become a better person.”

“I hope in becoming a better person, I hope I can be in a position to be forgiven,” he said.

But other council members also said they did not approve of his announcement on Friday.

“Two weeks of therapy will not end decades of bad behavior,” Councilman Kevin Faulconer said.

Seven women have accused Filner of sexual harassment. One former top aide filed a lawsuit Monday.

Veronica “Ronne” Froman, a retired Navy rear admiral who became the city’s chief operating officer under Filner’s mayoral predecessor, Jerry Sanders, said that during a meeting with Filner while he was in Congress, Filner “stopped me and he got very close to me. And he ran his finger up my cheek like this and he whispered to me, ‘Do you have a man in your life?’”

Froman said she rebuffed Filner but was so rattled that she told two men who were at the same meeting to “never leave me alone in a room with Bob Filner again.”

Joyce Gattas, dean of the College of Professional Studies and Fine Arts at San Diego State, told KPBS that Filner held her tightly, kissed her and put his hands on her knee. She also said she had seen Filner make “sexual comments to others.”

Also this week, a school psychologist and a political consultant accused Filner of inappropriate touching. The former said he tried to kiss her; the latter said he patted her buttocks.

One thing that lawyers and reporters soon learn is not to make public predictions or big wagers on the outcome of a trial based on opening statements or the demeanor and apparent slip-ups of witnesses or the facial expressions of the defendant or how awake this or that juror may appear during crucial testimony. Good to remember that during the trial of George Zimmerman, which started out this week with the prosecution's ""fucking punks"" and the defense's lame ""knock-knock"" joke. Even with highly paid, supposedly scientific jury-selection consultants on the job, what actually turns a juror toward a particular verdict often just isn't all that clear even to the experts of various disciplines who study the intricacies of such matters.

Witnesses so far have described what they saw or think they saw 16 months ago when, against the admonition of a police dispatcher, Zimmerman followed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin into a gated community of modest townhomes, got into a confrontation with him that nobody directly witnessed the beginning or end of and finished up by shooting him dead less than a minute's walk from the residence where Martin was visiting his father's fiancée together with his father.

Jurors have seen the grim photos of Martin's body, the cheap 9mm pistol Zimmerman was legally carried concealed, and one of Zimmerman's fingerprints lifted from that gun. They've heard a police technician explain how crime scenes are preserved and documented and how Zimmerman's gun, holster and flashlight were processed along with the Skittles and can of iced tea whose purchase was the reason Martin was out walking in the drizzly February evening.

They've heard from the woman who runs the Sanford Police Department's volunteer programs discuss Zimmerman's work with the community's neighborhood watch programs and from residents who said he seemed conscientious in that role.

They've heard contradictory testimony from a few neighbors who heard or saw part of the fight that ended with Martin face down in the grass. They listened to the EMTs and police officers who were first on the scene tell how they tried to revive Martin without success. Of how one officer arrested Zimmerman at gunpoint, handcuffing and taking away his gun after Zimmerman admitted he had shot Martin. They've heard those witnesses, police and civilian alike, describe Zimmerman's appearance, his bloody, swollen nose and head lacerations, and his behavior, one saying he seemed confused, another saying he didn't. They've heard how after he was given first aid, Zimmerman refused to go to the hospital.
