Obama to hold first bilateral meeting with China%27s Xi Jingping

Obama hasn%27t yet addressed the disclosures of data-mining programs

National Intelligence director calls media reports on NSA programs %22reprehensible%22 and inaccurate

LOS ANGELES — Fresh disclosures that the U.S. government has been secretly collecting data on Americans' phone calls and Internet activity are threatening to overshadow President Obama's weekend summit with China's President Xi Jinping.

The summit, a two-day meeting at the Sunnylands estate in Southern California, was billed by the White House as an opportunity for Obama to build rapport with Xi and raise questions about Chinese cyberhacking, currency manipulation and other thorny issues in the U.S.-China relationship.

While the U.S.-China relationship remains as complicated as ever, the Obama administration has been cautiously optimistic about the ascension of Xi, who they believe is more open to building a substantive dialogue with the U.S. than any of his recent predecessors.

But now Obama's conversations with Xi are in danger of becoming a side note to the revelations that the National Security Agency was collecting mountains of data on Americans' communications with people in the U.S. and overseas.

Obama addressed the disclosures of the programs for the first time during an appearance in San Jose Friday and argued that the programs help prevent terrorist attacks.

""It's important to recognize that you can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,"" Obama said.

He also denounced the leak of the programs to the media. ""If every step that we're taking to try to prevent a terrorist act is on the front page of the newspapers or on television, then presumably the people who are trying to do us harm are going to be able to get around our preventive measures,"" he said.

The president's scheduled to take questions again from reporters Friday evening at the conclusion of his first bilateral meeting with Xi, and it seems almost certain that he'll be pressed on the issue again.

The first in two bombshell revelations came late Wednesday, when Britain's The Guardian newspaper first reported that the NSA was able to get Verizon Communications to turn over information on all domestic and international calls for three months. The data collected by the NSA included the phone numbers, the length of the calls and other identifying information, but not the content of the conversations.

On Thursday, The Washington Post and The Guardian were reported that the NSA and FBI have for six years received information from the central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies, including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook and YouTube. That program, code-named PRISM, lets the government track people's movements and contacts through audio, video, photographs, e-mail, documents and connection logs.

The administration's initial response to the reports about the PRISM program was outrage.

James Clapper, director of National Intelligence, acknowledged existence of the program Thursday night but blasted the reports as ""reprehensible"" and inaccurate.

Clapper said the program does not allow the targeting of U.S. citizens or any person in the U.S. He also ordered information about the program declassified so that the public can understand what information is being collected.

""I believe it is important for the American people to understand the limits of this targeted counterterrorism program and the principles that govern its use,'' he said.

It is too early to predict the extent of the fallout from the revelations of the two surveillance programs for Obama.

But the controversy comes at an undoubtedly inopportune time for the White House, which has been basking in the afterglow of getting the Chinese to agree to such an informal meeting for Xi's first visit to the U.S.

The controversy also creates a potentially awkward moment for Obama, when talking to Xi about the China's heavy-handed treatment—including closely monitoring internet of activity—of its people.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest on Friday dismissed the notion that the existence of the programs will undercut Obama's message to Xi.

""This is a pretty good illustration of type of conversation we want to have about respecting civil liberties and protecting the constitutional rights of the people that you govern,"" Earnest said. ""What the president did, was he put in place a very strict oversight regime, one that he strengthened when he took office…one that constrained his own ability, constrained his own authority. I think that is a testament to the strength of our system of government.""

Regardless, Obama will be forced to juggle making what he hopes is a historic breakthrough in the U.S.-China relationship and dealing with the fallout of what could be one of the most controversial moments of his presidency."

The decision to deploy a Patriot missile battery and F-16 aircraft to Jordan was made late Friday at a meeting with top military and civilian Defense Department officials to bolster U.S. military support for Jordan - a crucial ally in the Middle East - as the violence from the Syrian civil war spreads, according to a senior U.S. official, CNN has learned.

The official declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation and also declined to say who was in the meeting. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has been traveling outside the United States, and it could not be learned if he attended via teleconference, although several officials tell CNN he was aware of the discussions and approved the deployment.

The overall goal is to demonstrate U.S. military support for an increasingly fragile Jordan, which is bearing the burden of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees and a growing potential threat from extremist elements including an al Qaeda affiliate organization operating inside Syria.

The weapons systems will be sent initially as part of a military exercise called Eager Lion, planned for later this month, with an understanding they may stay in the country. There is clearly a broader message being sent, according to U.S. military officials.

""In order to enhance the defensive posture and capacity of Jordan, some of these assets may remain beyond the exercise at the request of the government of Jordan,"" Lt .Col. T.G. Taylor, a spokesman at the U.S. Central Command, told CNN.

The Patriot missiles were originally expected to be sent from their base at Ft. Bliss, Texas, but the senior official said they may simply be redeployed from Patriots already in the Middle East. Jordan does not face a Scud missile threat from Syria, but the deployment comes amid growing concern that some Syrian missiles are being shipped to Hezbollah and could be used to attack targets across the region.

In recent days, violence has spread to Lebanon, and Israeli forces have increased security along their northern border. The F-16s and air crews will train with Jordanian combat air forces amid growing pressure from some in Congress for the White House to support a no-fly zone over Syria.

Separately from the exercise, the United States is sending 200 military planners from the headquarters of the 1st Armored Division at Fort Bliss to Jordan to assist in long-term planning with Jordanian forces in case a chemical weapons crisis erupts, or if a wide scale humanitarian relief mission is ordered."

Special for USA TODAY

Al-Qaeda has had a presence in the region for a decade at least

Al-Qaeda militants rose from a few hundred in 2010 to more than a thousand in 2012

Imams worry that military-heavy tactics push people into the arms of militancy

MUKALLA, Yemen — After more than a decade of U.S. counterterrorism efforts and drone strikes in Yemen, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula remains a potent and growing force.

Some say it is time for a change in strategy.

Imam Abu al-Harith Omar bin Salem Bawazeer said he is one of many Muslim clerics who are part of a campaign to persuade Yemenis to reject the militancy and jihadist ideology al-Qaeda spreads in Yemen. He sees signs of success.

""These efforts not only have a significant role in raising awareness but have led to some coming back … they abandoned this (al-Qaeda) ideology,"" he said.

But he worries that the military-heavy tactics of the U.S.-backed central government in Sanaa are pushing people into the arms of militancy.

""Unfortunately, our efforts have not been supported by the state,"" Bawazeer said.

Mukalla is a picturesque port on the eastern edge of the Gulf of Aden famous for its abundant fish. Traditional wooden boats bob in clear green water along the town's crumbling corniche overlooked by the former palace of long-gone sultans.

Al-Qaeda has had a presence in the region for a decade at least, often recruiting from the thousands of mujahedin who returned home after fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan. The Yemeni government has partnered with the U.S. military to crush the group.

Al-Qaeda in the Arabia Peninsula as the Yemen branch calls itself has not been wiped out. In fact, it has been described by the Obama administration as the most lethal wing of the core group that attacked New York and Washington on Sept. 11, 2001. Its self-stated goal is to impose by an Islamic cleric-run caliphate in Yemen and the Middle East free of non-Muslim influence.

AQAP has been accused of a failed 2009 assassination attempt on a Saudi prince and the British ambassador in Sanaa. In May 2012, a suicide bomber killed more than 100 Yemeni soldiers rehearsing for a military parade.

AQAP has also been implicated in Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's failed 2009 Christmas Day bombing and Faisal Shahzad's attempted 2010 Times Square bombing, along with a failed plot to down cargo flights bound for Chicago.

More recently it has shown it can operate militarily as well despite joint U.S.-Yemen attacks against it. This month AQAP allegedly launched a coordinated attack against a military base in Mukalla. Fighters dressed in Yemeni security forces uniforms seized the building and killed several soldiers before being driven out.

Long before the U.S.' drone program in Yemen began in earnest in 2011, and five years prior to the 2009 creation of AQAP, Bawazeer began warning of the threat posed by the ideology of al-Qaeda and its insurgent arm, Ansar al-Sharia.

An imam and head of an Islamic institute for Koranic and Sharia studies based in Mukalla, the provincial capital of Hadhramaut, Bawazeer along with scholars and tribal sheikhs have been running programs for Yemeni youth who are susceptible to AQAP's message justifying violence.

Bawazeer and his colleagues said an alternative solution must be found to the primarily military one used by the government. But he said their warnings and labors have not been heeded by the government and the threat has spread.

John Brennan, Obama's former chief counterterrorism adviser and now head of the CIA, noted recently that the number of al-Qaeda militants in Yemen had risen from a few hundred in 2010 to ""more than a thousand"" in April 2012.

However, Yemen's government said it has not failed to act against the dissemination of al-Qaeda's ideology.

Jabri Ibrahim Hassan Kamil, general director of preaching and guidance for a government ministry, said state-run programs training imams to promote moderate Islam have been used successfully across the country along with educational and media campaigns against al-Qaeda's extreme interpretation of Islam.

""If it weren't for these (government) efforts, al-Qaeda would now be pervasive in the country,"" Kamil said. ""The aim is to disseminate moderation and rationalize the religious discourse.""

Bawazeer said he has repeatedly been rebuffed when he has asked for help from the government and international organizations to rehabilitate former al-Qaeda militants and prevent new recruits through media campaigns, education programs and cultural activities.

He said his work along with fellow imams and tribal leaders prevented insurgents from taking over towns in the southern provinces of Abyan and neighboring Shabwah when security broke down during Yemen's political uprising of 2011. But some have paid with their lives.

Salim Ahmed bin Ali Jaber, a friend of Bawazeer's, denounced the militants during Friday prayers in an August 2012 sermon to his congregation in the small village of Khashamir in northern Hadhramaut. He challenged al-Qaeda to show him ""one piece of evidence in Islam that said killing is justified,"" according to Salim's brother-in-law, Faisal bin Ali Jaber.

Faisal bin Ali Jaber said he tried to persuade him to tone down his challenge to the militants but Salim Ahmed bin Ali Jaber told him he was determined to speak out.

""If I don't use my position to make it clear to my congregation that this ideology is wrong, who will?"" Salim told his brother-in-law.

The following evening, Faisal said Salim was killed by what he said was a U.S. drone strike as Salim stood outside the village mosque talking to three strangers who had come looking for him. The strike may have targeted the strangers, but no one knows because the United States will not comment on strikes.

Southern Hadhramaut's security director, Fahami Mahroos, agrees that the response to terrorism can't depend on military or law enforcement, a sentiment expressed by President Obama as well. Mahroos said the strategy against al-Qaeda needs to be a dual offensive: firstly tackling their ideology via religious scholars and secondly with military action.

But he conceded that there is a huge lack of cooperation between the central government and local community leaders in confronting the extremist ideology.

""The main responsibility should be laid on the local people and community leaders,"" Mahroos said. ""Maybe the government doesn't have the skills or the abilities to do this.""

The Obama administration strategy has largely been to keep taking out senior leaders of al-Qaeda, Katherine Zimmerman, a scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, told the House Committee on Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence last month.

In Yemen, the strategy has killed senior leader Anwar al Awlaki, USS Cole bombers Abdul Munim al Fathani and Fahd al Quso, AQAP senior operative Mohamed Said al Umdah, spiritual leader Adil al Abab, and deputy leader Said al Shihri. But AQAP has still managed to expand during that time, Zimmerman said.

Bawazeer said two things he believes are needed to reverse the trend and challenge al-Qaeda's ideology: a guarantee for those who leave al-Qaeda and go through rehabilitation won't be automatically re-arrested, and support from international aid agencies to fund projects, small businesses and help provide jobs.

""As long as these two things were guaranteed then things would be easier,"" he said.

Frank Cilluffo, director of the Homeland Security Institute at George Washington University, agreed in testimony before Congress last month.

""Ideology is the lifeblood that sustains al-Qaeda,"" he said.

Bawazeer may not be there to challenge that ideology. He and several of his family members have received multiple death threats from al-Qaeda because of his work and don't want to be involved, Bawazeer said.

""Now I'm really discouraged to go on,"" he said. ""I've stopped."""

USA TODAY

The White House fired back at Russian President Vladimir Putin for his op-ed article Thursday, saying Russia's own actions prove that the United States is an ""exceptional"" nation.

""Unlike Russia, the United States stands up for democratic values and human rights in our own country and around the world,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

Carney said The New York Times publication of Putin's column underscores the American commitment to freedom of expression, and ""that is not a tradition shared in Russia ... And it is a fact freedom of expression has been on the decrease over the past dozen or so years in Russia.""

Putin challenged the notion of American exceptionalism in a Times op-ed in which he said that a military strike at Syria ""would increase violence and unleash a new wave of terrorism.""

An attack could also ""undermine multilateral efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear problem and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and further destabilize the Middle East and North Africa."" Putin added.

Putin also said his relationship with President Obama ""is marked by growing trust,"" but he criticized Obama's claims of ""American exceptionalism.""

""It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation,"" Putin wrote. ""There are big countries and small countries, rich and poor, those with long democratic traditions and those still finding their way to democracy. Their policies differ, too.""

Playing to American opinion, Putin also referenced recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan:

""It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States. Is it in America's long-term interest? I doubt it. Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan 'you're either with us or against us.'""

Back at the White House, Carney said the op-ed underscores the fact that Russia's ""prestige and credibility"" is on the line as Putin calls for Syria to surrender its chemical weapons to international control.

""It is also worth noting,"" Carney said, ""that Russia is isolated and alone in blaming the opposition for the chemical weapons attack on Aug. 21."""

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/opinion/keller-secrets-and-leaks.html,2013-06-03 00:00:00,['Bill Keller'],Secrets and Leaks - The New York Times,"A federal shield law has been a goal of news organizations for decades. Such legislation has passed the House twice with large bipartisan majorities, and in 2009 a version won the approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee — only to stall after the hemorrhage of classified documents from the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks.

A lot of people I respect, including some eminent journalists, have questioned the idea that Congress should exempt reporters from the civic duty to give evidence. Anthony Lewis, the Times correspondent, columnist and self-taught legal scholar who died this year, worried six years ago that giving reporters an inviolable right to protect sources might make it hard for someone who had been ruined by false allegations to find his accuser and get justice. Walter Pincus, the veteran Washington Post investigator who has himself been a target of leak-hunting subpoenas, argues that a shield law would make the press too beholden to Congress and subject to a worrisome degree of government regulation. He insists that the right to protect sources already exists in law. (The Supreme Court, in its 1972 ruling in Branzburg v. Hayes, failed to find such a right in the Constitution, but a few federal judges have found it in common law. The fact that every state in the country except Wyoming offers a measure of protection for confidential sources has persuaded some judges that this is society’s will, even if Congress has not yet said so.)

Pincus and other critics complain that a sanctimonious press is quick to wrap itself in the First Amendment but often slow to acknowledge that some secrets are worth keeping. A closer look at the two cases currently fueling media indignation suggests they have a point.

In the first case, The Associated Press disclosed last year that the C.I.A. had thwarted a terrorist plot to blow up an airliner. The initial scoop uncorked a gusher of sensitive details as other news organizations raced to advance the story and the Obama administration tried to supply some self-serving context. So we now know this: A C.I.A.-Saudi-British operation planted a mole inside the Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. The agent volunteered to blow up an airliner using a new bomb designed to get past airport security. Instead, he turned over the device to his handlers."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/world/asia/us-accuses-chinas-military-in-cyberattacks.html,2013-05-07 00:00:00,['David E. Sanger'],U.S. Accuses China’s Military in Cyberattacks,"But the Pentagon report describes something far more sophisticated: a China that has now leapt into the first ranks of offensive cybertechnologies. It is investing in electronic warfare capabilities in an effort to blind American satellites and other space assets, and hopes to use electronic and traditional weapons systems to gradually push the United States military presence into the mid-Pacific nearly 2,000 miles from China’s coast.

The report argues that China’s first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, commissioned last September, is the first of several carriers the country plans to deploy over the next 15 years. It said the carrier would not reach “operational effectiveness” for three or four years, but is already set to operate in the East and South China Seas, the site of China’s territorial disputes with several neighbors, including Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. The report notes a new carrier base under construction in Yuchi.

The report also detailed China’s progress in developing its stealth aircraft, first tested in January 2011.

Three months ago the Obama administration would not officially confirm reports in The New York Times, based in large part on a detailed study by the computer security firm Mandiant, that identified P.L.A. Unit 61398 near Shanghai as the likely source of many of the biggest thefts of data from American companies and some government institutions.

Until Monday, the strongest critique of China had come from Thomas E. Donilon, the president’s national security adviser, who said in a speech at the Asia Society in March that American companies were increasingly concerned about “cyberintrusions emanating from China on an unprecedented scale,” and that “the international community cannot tolerate such activity from any country.” He stopped short of blaming the Chinese government for the espionage.

But government officials said the overall issue of cyberintrusions would move to the center of the United States-China relationship, and it was raised on recent trips to Beijing by Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey.

To bolster its case, the report argues that cyberweapons have become integral to Chinese military strategy. It cites two major public works of military doctrine, “Science of Strategy” and “Science of Campaigns,” saying they identify “information warfare (I.W.) as integral to achieving information superiority and an effective means for countering a stronger foe.” But it notes that neither document “identifies the specific criteria for employing a computer network attack against an adversary,” though they “advocate developing capabilities to compete in this medium.”"

The more the public gets to know Hagel, the less they like him. Over the course of a month, as public awareness increased, Hagel’s favorables increased a mere four points, from 18 to 22, while his unfavorables jumped from 17 to 28 points.

The pressure isn’t letting up, either. Today, Senator Lindsey Grahem sent a letter to Hagel asking for clarification on another round of controversial comments supposedly attached to the nominee:

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) sent a letter to Chuck Hagel today, asking whether he had made the reported comments (or anything like them) that “Israel has violated every UN resolution since 1967, that Israel has violated its agreements with the quartet, that it was risking becoming an apartheid state if it didn’t allow the Palestinians to form a state, … that the settlements were getting close to the point where a contiguous Palestinian state would be impossible … that Netanyahu was a radical … [and] that Hamas has to be brought in to any peace negotiation.” Moreover, Graham by no means has given up on seeking the financial information Hagel so far has refused to provide.

There’s another development today in the great state of Nebraska. The University of Nebraska-Omaha is refusing to release Senator Hagel’s archives to the media. According to the Weekly Standard, Hagel stands by the university’s decision to keep sealed thousands of his papers, audio, video and transcripts of speeches:

Chuck Hagel’s record in the Senate is well documented in the public domain,” says Hagel spokesman Marie Harf in an emailed statement.

“Given his extraordinary disclosures to date, which surpass the threshold applied to nominees, there is no need to make this archived material public.”

The archives are not open to the public, university officials say, because not everything there has been processed.

However, the university has also said that with Hagel’s permission, they would grant the Weekly Standard’s Daniel Halper access to the archive.

Thus far, Hagel is refusing that permission.

Gaffney'],Feinstein: Jihadists Will Stop Hating the West Only When They Achieve Shariah Law,"Yesterday was a red letter day–or perhaps it should be called an Islamic green letter one–for U.S. intelligence. For the first time I can recall, the top legislator on a congressional oversight committee actually made clear what motivates our enemies in what used to be called euphemistically the “War on Terror,” and what Team Obama now dubs even more opaquely as the effort to “counter violent extremism.”

This breakthrough came in the course of a joint appearance on CNN’s State of the Union by the chairpersons of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI), respectively. The media seized on the ostensibly big news from their remarks: bipartisan agreement that the United States is at greater risk of terrorist attack today than two years ago.

But important, ominous, and accurate as that assessment is, it was not the most important point made by these two respected lawmakers. Instead, it was Sen. Feinstein’s observation in response to a question about what causes the “hatred” that makes our situation more perilous:

There is a real displaced aggression in this very fundamentalist jihadist Islamic community, and that is that the West is responsible for everything that goes wrong and that the only thing that’s going to solve this is Islamic shariah law.

What makes this incontrovertible statement so noteworthy? It is the fact that the intelligence community is not allowed to say it. Under Obama administration guidelines, for intelligence officers-and for that matter, law enforcement, Homeland Security and military personnel-to talk about Islamic jihadism and shariah as the motivation for terrorism can be a career-ending offense.

For example, on May 10, 2012, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, used a press conference to denounce a highly decorated and up-and-coming Army officer, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Dooley, for teaching an elective course at the Joint Forces Staff College using approved curriculum. According to Gen. Dempsey, what prompted this extraordinary action was that a student–who it turns out, had not actually been enrolled in Col. Dooley’s class–“was concerned that the course was objectionable and that it was counter to our values …our appreciation for religious freedom and cultural awareness. And the young man who brought it to my attention was absolutely right. It’s totally objectionable.”

At the core of what was so “totally objectionable” is the fact that students were exposed to information that made plain the gravity of the threat of which Sen. Feinstein warned: the supremacist, totalitarian Islamic doctrine of shariah and the jihad or holy war it obliges adherents to perform. Col. Dooley’s promising career was cut short and the files of his institution and that of the rest of the national security community have been purged of all such information deemed by unidentified “experts” engaged for the purpose to be “counter to our values.”

Sen. Feinstein’s forthright declaration is particularly gratifying as I had an opportunity to discuss the danger posed by shariah with her in the course of testimony I provided the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 24, 2013 at the invitation of her colleague, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). In the course of making the case for keeping the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay open, I observed:

We have been obliged to go to war because it was thrust upon us. And, if we are to prevail in this conflict, we must understand the nature of the enemies with whom we are at war. They are shariah-adherent jihadists who believe, in accordance with that doctrine, that it is God’s will that they destroy our way of life and subjugate us to theirs.

At the time, Sen. Feinstein strongly disagreed with my view that shariah’s dictates make it impossible to safely release its adherents from Gitmo or, alternatively, to incarcerate them in this country instead–where they might exploit rights foolishly conferred upon them to secure their freedom and wage jihad here. I hope that the clarity she expressed Sunday about the inexorable nature of the shariah doctrine and the supremacist hatred it impels will cause the senior senator from California to insist that such insights are once again inculcated in those responsible for our security and to reconsider her support for closing Guantanamo Bay.

The fugitive, believed to be holed up in the transit zone of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, was supported by 55 percent of those surveyed by researchers at Quinnipiac University, Connecticut.

About one-third (34 percent) of those polled said they believed Snowden had betrayed his country.

Of those who backed his decision to leak the contents of classified documents in order to expose the extent of government-sanctioned surveillance, there was equal representation from almost every gender, social group and political persuasion.

The remaining 11 percent did not have an opinion.

Peter Brown, assistant director of the school’s Polling Institute said the result illustrated public shock at the scope of intelligence-gathering by government agencies seeking to prevent future terror attacks.

""The fact that there is little difference now along party lines about the overall anti- terrorism effort and civil liberties and about Snowden is in itself unusual in a country sharply divided along political lines about almost everything,” he said.

“Moreover, the verdict that Snowden is not a traitor goes against almost the unified view of the nation's political establishment.""

Researchers asked 2,014 American voters: ""Do you regard Edward Snowden, the national security consultant who released information to the media about the phone scanning program, as more of a traitor, or more of a whistle-blower?""

Brown added: ""Americans' views on anti-terrorism efforts are complicated. They see the threat from terrorism as real and worth defending against, but they have a sense that their privacy is being invaded and they are not happy about it at all.""

Venezuela is the ""most likely"" asylum choice for former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, the journalist who published the contents of the self-professed leaker's classified documents said Tuesday.

But his travel problems could take time to resolve as his U.S. passport has been canceled and U.S. allies may deny airspace to any flight on which he is believed to be traveling.

http://news.yahoo.com/hagel-warns-china-cyberattacks-072516292.html,,[],Hagel warns China on cyberattacks,"SINGAPORE (AP) — Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel delivered a two-pronged message to Beijing — holding out hope for a slowly improving military relationship with the Asian giant while issuing a stern warning on cyberattacks coming from that country. But he was met with immediate skepticism from the Chinese delegation in the audience, who questioned America's role in the Pacific.

Speaking Saturday at a security conference in Singapore that he helped to form more than a decade ago, Hagel said: ""The United States has expressed our concerns about the growing threat of cyber intrusions, some of which appear to be tied to the Chinese government and military."" While he is not the first U.S. official to publicly blame China for computer-based attacks that steal data from U.S. government and corporate networks, he delivered the rebuke in China's backyard, with members of Beijing's government in the audience.

His comments triggered a wry response from Maj. Gen. Yao Yunzhu, director of the Center for China-America Defense Relations, at the People's Liberation Army's Academy of Military Science, who challenged him to better explain America's intentions in its building up of the military across the region.

""Thank you for mentioning China several times,"" she told Hagel, minutes after he concluded his remarks, and began taking questions from the audience. As an audible murmur and some quiet chuckles rose from the crowd, she added that America's new shift to the Pacific has been widely interpreted as an ""attempt to counter China's rising influence, and to offset the increasing military capabilities of the Chinese PLA. However, China is not convinced.""

She asked Hagel how he can assure China that the increased military deployments to the region are part of an effort to build a more positive relationship with Beijing.

""That's really the whole point behind closer military-to-military relationships,"" Hagel responded. ""We don't want miscalculations and misunderstandings and misinterpretations. And the only way you do that is you talk to each other.""

Story continues

He said the U.S. welcomes a strong and emerging China that takes on responsibilities for security in the region, and that Beijing and Washington have to be inclusive and direct with each other. ""I think we've made continued progress,"" he said. ""And we'll make more progress.""

Defense officials said Hagel also broadly raised the issue of cybersecurity in a brief, informal meeting with Lt. Gen. Qi Jianguo, PLA deputy chief, on Friday evening. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to publicly discuss the content of the meeting, said it was one of several subjects that were touched on in the session and that Hagel mentioned plans for the formation of a cyber working group.

In his speech, Hagel said the U.S. is determined to work closely with China and other nations to establish appropriate standards for behavior in cyberspace. And the U.S. will also be looking to China for help in resolving ongoing problems with North Korea, which in recent months has ratcheted up tensions in the region with a series of rocket launches, an underground nuclear test and threats of nuclear strikes against the U.S. and its allies.

Noting America's longstanding tensions with China, Hagel said: ""The key is for these differences to be addressed on the basis of a continuous and respectful dialogue."" The two nations, he said, must build trust in order to avoid military miscalculations.

Much of the speech, however, was designed as a follow-up to last year's gathering, when then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta first detailed what has been called the military's new pivot to the Pacific. Hagel assured Asian nations that despite sharp budget cuts, the Pentagon will continue to shift its military troops, ships and aircraft to the Pacific region.

Where Panetta had laid out promises, Hagel was able to point to results. Marines have been deployed to the northern city of Darwin in Australia, a combat ship has arrived in Singapore and plans are unfolding for Army units that will rotate in and out of the region.

Hagel also suggested that the Pentagon's five-year budget plan continues to plan for additional F-22 Raptor fighter jets and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters in the region, along with a fourth fast-attack submarine deployed to Guam.

He provided a glimpse into the broad review he ordered to determine whether budget cuts will force the U.S. military strategy to change — a year after Panetta unveiled it.

International leaders have been watching the deliberations in Washington closely to see what the roughly $487 billion in automatic spending cuts over the next 10 years will mean to America's commitment's abroad. Already the military services have curtailed flight and combat training for many units, grounded some Air Force squadrons and delayed or canceled some ship deployments.

The Pentagon has also announced it will furlough about 680,000 civilian employees for up to 11 days through the end of the fiscal year.

The initial report on the strategy review was due to Hagel on Friday, and while he said the outcome is not final, it should reflect the rise of Asia.

""For the region, this means I can assure you that coming out of this review, the United States will continue to implement the rebalance and prioritize our posture, activities and investments in Asia-Pacific,"" he said.

The Asia-Pacific, said Hagel, is at the epicenter of historic changes around the world and the U.S. is committed to strengthening its military, economic and diplomatic partnerships with nations across the region. As part of that he noted that the U.S. will set aside $100 million to expand its military exercises in the region.

Just finishing his third month as Pentagon Chief, Hagel used the speech to introduce himself on a more personal level to the audience. For many he is a familiar face, since he was one of the founders of the conference in 2002, and as a U.S. senator, was a speaker at the first three gatherings.

He talked about his long ties to the region, including his father's service in World War II flying B-25 bombers in the South Pacific, and his own service in Vietnam with his brother. Hagel was wounded and twice received the Purple Heart.

Later, he traveled to Asia as the co-founder of a cellular telephone company and then, as a GOP senator from Nebraska, he served on the Foreign Relations Committee.

""What I took away from all these experiences,"" Hagel said, ""was a firm belief that the arc of the 21st century would be shaped by events here in Asia."""
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/opinion/about-those-black-sites.html,2013-02-18 00:00:00,[],About Those Black Sites - The New York Times,"The details of American antiterrorism policies, put in place after 9/11, are still largely hidden, but more pieces of this sordid history are dribbling out.

A valuable new report issued this month by the Open Society Justice Initiative documents the extent of the Central Intelligence Agency’s use of extraordinary rendition — the practice of abducting suspected terrorists and transferring them to countries with reputations for torturing prisoners during interrogations.

Reporting by The Times and other news media has long established that the C.I.A. operated a secret detention program with “black site” prisons outside the United States. In December, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved a highly critical, classified report on this program that has not been released. Committee members invoked its findings without revealing any useful new information at the recent confirmation hearing for John Brennan, the Obama administration’s top counterterrorism official, who was named to head the C.I.A. But the committee chairwoman, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, has said that the black sites and coercive techniques were “terrible mistakes.”

According to the Open Society report, 54 countries participated in this program, including many where the rule of law is weak or nonexistent, like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Malaysia and Somalia. More surprising and alarming is the collusion of leading democracies. Belgium, Finland and Denmark, among others, allowed their airports and airspace to be used for flights associated with C.I.A. rendition operations. Britain, Italy, Germany and Australia helped interrogate one or more suspects and either allowed or actively aided in their transfers."

One day after President Obama’s top national security aides huddled at the White House, senior lawmakers appeared on television on Sunday with ominous warnings about intelligence “chatter,” first revealed on Thursday, similar to what American spy agencies picked up in the weeks before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Such is the strange, wait-and-see climate surrounding a threat that appears to be both specific and maddeningly vague. American officials say that they are confident they have intercepted electronic communications discussing attacks in the coming days, but that they have no clear information about where they should try to defend against them.

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem accused the Obama administration of engaging in a “double standard,” pledging support for a political solution while helping to bankroll the Syrian insurgency.

“We know that the United States is important and has a role, [and] if it wanted, it actually can halt the violence and bloodshed in Syria,” Moallem said during a visit to Iran.

The Syrian diplomat repeated his government’s stated willingness to negotiate with armed rebels, even though it labels its adversaries “terrorists” in daily communiques.

“Even those who took up arms can play a role in building Syria’s future,” Moallem said at a news conference in Tehran.

The Iranian foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, told reporters at the conference that Bashar Assad would remain Syria’s “legitimate president” until his fate is decided by voters in national elections scheduled next year.

The comments come during a week in which the conflict to oust Assad has generated intense diplomatic debate but no clear path to stopping the bloodshed that has left almost 70,000 dead, according to the United Nations.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, representing the U.N. and the Arab League, said Saturday that the U.N. would be willing to “facilitate a dialogue” between opposition and government representatives. The pair voiced regret that both sides had become “increasingly reckless with human life,” the U.N. said.

A day earlier, the White House said President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin had spoken by telephone about Syria and “agreed on the need to advance a political transition to end the violence as soon as possible.”

But also Friday, Russia — Syria’s other key ally — accused the United States of promoting “extremists” who are determined to seize power by force.

The barrage of criticism of the U.S. from several fronts was set off by Secretary of State John F. Kerry’s announcement Thursday in Rome that Washington would provide tens of millions of dollars in nonlethal aid to the Syrian opposition, including medical supplies and food for rebel fighters.

Kerry rejected dissident requests for weapons or other direct military aid. However, rebel forces have reportedly been receiving arms with the help of various U.S. allies, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Turkey and Qatar.

Throughout his trip, his first abroad as secretary of State, Kerry has repeatedly emphasized that Washington favors a “political solution” to the Syrian crisis. But he has not endorsed Russian-led efforts to broker peace talks between the opposition and the government in Damascus.

The sticking point remains the future of Assad. The opposition, backed by Washington and allied governments, says any talks must lead to the ouster of Assad and his security apparatus. Damascus rejects “preconditions” that require Assad’s removal from power.

While assailing U.S. support for Syrian rebels, both Russia and Iran have provided substantial aid to Assad’s government, though the amount of military assistance remains unclear.

Washington has accused Iran of providing arms and training for the Syrian military, a role it denies. Russia says it provides only “defensive” weapons to Syria. Last year, however, a ship carrying three refurbished attack helicopters to Syria was forced to return to Russia after its British insurer canceled coverage.

In Syria, both sides reported fierce fighting Saturday in various battle zones, including the suburbs of Damascus and the provinces of Homs in central Syria, Dara in the south, Aleppo and Idlib in the north and Dair Alzour in the east.

Opposition activists said scores had been killed in intense battles in the north-central city of Raqqah, which is under rebel siege. The city, situated along the Euphrates, is home to more than 200,000 residents but has seen its population swell with people displaced by fighting in other areas.

The government responded to the insurgent attack on Raqqah with airstrikes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based pro-opposition group.

The group also reported that a rebel battalion had executed two civilians accused of collaborating with Syrian authorities in the Damascus suburb of Yarmouk, home to many Palestinian refugees. A photo on the group’s Facebook page showed what appeared to be the bodies of two men dangling from ropes, apparently having been lynched.

The two were accused of “placing chips that directed regime bombardment,” the observatory said. Human rights groups have accused both sides in the conflict of carrying out extrajudicial executions.

(CNN) —

U.S. officials were pleasantly surprised and encouraged by the initial declaration that Syria has submitted to the world’s chemical weapons watchdog outlining its inventory of the munitions, a senior administration official said Saturday.

The official said the declaration was more complete than what the officials had expected the Syrians to put forth.

The news came hours after the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons announced that Syria had handed over a list of what it says is its chemical arms stockpile.

“The Technical Secretariat is currently reviewing the information received,” the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

The handover occurred a day before the organization is to meet at The Hague in the Netherlands to discuss Syria.

The timing meets the terms set in a deal forged last week between the United States and Russia in Geneva to begin destroying Syria’s chemical arsenal.

Under the fast-tracked Geneva deal, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was to declare the weapons no later than Saturday.

The normal 60-day process for declaring arms was expedited to seven days “because of the extraordinary concern about Syria’s weapons,” said Michael Luhan, a spokesman for the organization.

“Until now, each country has been typical. The United States, Russia, Libya, India, none have been in a state of war or conflict,” Luhan said Friday.

His organization planned to begin reviewing Monday, he said.

“We have to go through it in detail and plan how to conduct the on-the-ground inspection mission, to verify the accuracy of the declaration and put seals on all the materials to make sure they are secure,” Luhan said.

The stakes over halting the Syrian civil war heightened after an August 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus that U.S. officials estimate killed 1,400 people.

The United States and other Western nations blame the regime for the attack. Russia and Syria say they think rebels used the weapons.

Citing international norms against the use of chemical weapons, U.S. President Barack Obama called for authorization from Congress to use military force in Syria.

As the United States threatened force to degrade Assad’s ability to carry out chemical weapons attacks, a diplomatic opportunity arose between Russia and the United States to put Syria’s stockpile under international control.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov hammered out a deal in Geneva last week compelling Syria to accept the agreement. Syria has agreed to it.

Speaking ahead of next week’s U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York, Kerry said Thursday that while “the complete removal of Syria’s chemical weapons is possible here, through peaceful means,” urgency is needed.

The U.N. Security Council must be prepared to act next week, Kerry said, citing a U.N. chemical weapons report about the attack.

While the report did not assign responsibility for the attack, Kerry said it offered “crucial details,” making the case implicating Assad “only … more compelling.”

Russia called the report “distorted” and said it was based on insufficient information.

Even as diplomatic efforts were continuing, U.S. officials have not dropped their threat to use force and are wary, saying Syria could be using the diplomacy as a stalling tactic.

“Time is short,” Kerry said. “Let’s not spend time debating what we already know.”

Also on Saturday, the Syrian opposition coalition rejected an offer made by Iran to broker a peace deal between rebels and the government, calling it “ridiculous and desperate.”

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is also planning to attend the U.N. General Assembly meeting, said he can help bring peace to Syria, a long-time Iranian ally torn by civil war.

In a Washington Post op-ed on Thursday, the recently elected Iranian president called for an end to “the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart.” And he signaled his desire for better engagement with the West.

Given Iran’s closeness to Syria’s government, it seems unlikely rebels would consider Rouhani an independent broker. But Rouhani’s tone is far less fiery than that of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. And Rouhani’s promise of more positive engagement with the world during his election campaign appeared to propel him to victory.

“The Syrian National Coalition considers Iran’s offer as ridiculous amid all the bloodshed that Iran participated with the (Bashar) al-Assad regime, through political, economic support and military support during the past two and a half years.”

Rouhani, 65, has promised more positive engagement with the world.

But the Syrian opposition coalition said Iran is part of the problem.

“There is no doubt that Rouhani’s offer is a desperate attempt to prolong the crisis and increase the complexity,” the coalition said in a statement.

The United Nations estimates more than 100,000 people have died since March 2011, a period in which harsh government crackdowns against protesters devolved into an all-out civil war.

Another 2 million people have fled their homeland, and more than 4.25 million have been displaced within Syria, the United Nations says.

More violence

Government forces killed at least 26 people Saturday in Hamas suburbs, according to the opposition group Local Coordination Committees. CNN could not independently verify the claim.

Out of all the places Edward Snowden could have chosen to hide, he selected this city, with its towering buildings, glittering nightscape and reputation for protecting free speech.

But some in Hong Kong aren’t sure what the man who has admitted leaking information about a top-secret U.S. surveillance program is doing in this semi-autonomous jurisdiction, which has a strong extradition treaty with the United States.

“Hong Kong is definitely not a safe harbor for him,” said Regina Ip, a current legislator and chair of the New People’s Party.

The U.S Department of Justice has said it is in the first stages of investigating the unauthorized disclosure of classified information about the surveillance programs, and some U.S. lawmakers are calling for Snowden, the self-declared source of the leak, to be prosecuted.

If Snowden, 29, remains in Hong Kong and the U.S. government seeks to arrest or question him about the leak, the former NSA contractor’s fate would depend on a 16-year-old treaty that guarantees extraditions between the United States and Hong Kong except under rare circumstances.

The treaty says that Hong Kong can refuse to transfer a suspected criminal to the United States if the person is a People’s Republic of China national and giving up that person “implicates” the “defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy” of the PRC.

Experts said because Snowden doesn’t fall into that category, if the United States wanted to charge him with breaking espionage laws, Hong Kong was likely to transfer him to U.S. custody.

“This agreement has been enforced for at least 10 years,” said Ip, who said Hong Kong has also benefited from the U.S. government’s assistance with fugitives over the years.

The treaty with Hong Kong says that any request to extradite must originate from the U.S. Department of Justice, and would be channeled through the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong. A spokesperson for the consulate declined to comment, deferring questions to the Justice Department in Washington.

Snowden has not revealed to reporters exactly where in Hong Kong he was staying, although he told The Washington Post he was holed up at a hotel near the CIA base at the consulate, which is located in the heart of Hong Kong island.

A receptionist at the Mira Hotel, in a neighborhood just across the harbor from the main island, said a guest named Edward Snowden had been staying there, but checked out Monday. Citing guest privacy rules, the receptionist declined to say how long Snowden had stayed in the hotel in the Tsim Sha Tsui neighborhood, which is known for a popular promenade overlooking the harbor and offering gorgeous night views.

In an e-mail to a Washington Post reporter on May 24, he said he would consider applying for asylum in Iceland or some other country “with strong internet and press freedoms,” although “the strength of the reaction” to the leaked information “will determine how choosy I can be.”

Hong Kong has its own legislative and legal systems but ultimately answers to Beijing, under the so-called “one country, two systems” arrangement, established when oversight of Hong Kong was transferred from the British to the Chinese in 1997. The extradition treaty between Hong Kong and the United States was established at the time of the British-Chinese handover, since the treaty also needed the blessing of Hong Kong’s new sovereign rulers, the Chinese government.

Given the touchy nature of China’s relationship with both the United States and Hong Kong, however, experts said the Chinese government was likely to stay in the background with Snowden’s case.

“I don’t think the central government will deal with this incident directly,” said Jin Canrong, professor and associate dean of the School of International Studies at Renmin University of China. Jin said the government would probably let Hong Kong handle Snowden, although he said the Chinese might still have the final say, given its power over the semiautonomous city.

The situation is tricky since Hong Kong residents easily chafe at any perception that Beijing is encroaching on their rights. Every year, thousands of residents hold a candlelight vigil on June 4 to mark the date of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. At this year’s event, gatherers called for Chinese President Xi Jinping to expand democracy.

Given this legacy, a few in Hong Kong cheered Snowden’s selection of Hong Kong, saying it was flattering to the city.

“I’m not surprised because Hong Kong is famous for our freedom of expression and our defense of press freedom,” said Alan Leung, a legislator who heads Hong Kong’s Civic Party. “We should take [Snowden’s arrival] as complimentary.”

More than a week has passed since U.S. officials asked the Hong Kong government to arrest Edward Snowden, but the whereabouts of the former contractor who leaked documents about top-level surveillance programs remained unknown Saturday.

The reason for the apparent lack of action in the case is unclear. The delay could be related to the issuing of the warrant. Or officials may still be looking for Snowden, who is believed to be in Hong Kong but could also have found a way to leave the semiautonomous region.

The U.S. government asked Hong Kong to detain Snowden on a provisional arrest warrant June 14, the same day it filed criminal charges against him, including theft, “unauthorized communication of national defense information” and “willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person.”

The fact that the U.S. government asked Hong Kong to detain Snowden emerged Friday when The Washington Post disclosed the contents of a sealed criminal complaint that alluded to the request.

Under an extradition treaty between Hong Kong and the United States, a provisional warrant, as opposed to a regular one, is a faster way to detain suspected criminals since it does not require the initial approval of Hong Kong’s leader, currently Leung Chun-ying.

Manning was acquitted of aiding the enemy but convicted of most of the more than 20 crimes he was charged with for passing more than 700,000 government and military files to the anti-secrecy Web site WikiLeaks. The material included sensitive diplomatic cables and videos of airstrikes that killed civilians. Read the article. Cliff Owen/AP Wait 1 second to continue.

Instead, a judge can issue the warrant immediately. Simon Young, a legal professor at the University of Hong Kong, said that means a warrant for Snowden’s arrest could have been issued as early as June 14.

The office of Leung, Hong Kong’s chief executive, declined to comment on Snowden’s case Saturday. The police department did not respond to calls and e-mails.

Meanwhile, plans to protect Snowden appeared to be unfolding. Olafur Sigurvinsson, an Icelandic businessman, told reporters Thursday that he has a private jet ready to take Snowden to Iceland, a potential safe haven named by Snowden in interviews.

A spokesperson representing the Hong Kong Aviation Center, which handles private jet flights out of Hong Kong, did not comment on whether Snowden, or anyone on his behalf, had made plans to fly out.

“For privacy reason [sic], we do not disclose to external parties the identity of our passengers or information about their flight arrangement,” KK Yuen said in an e-mail.

Yuen also said that all passengers must go through immigration and customs checks. In other words, Snowden could have trouble leaving on a private jet without tipping off authorities.

A potentially drawn-out and complex legal process awaits the former contractor, who turned 30 on Friday, and the U.S. officials trying to remove him from Hong Kong.

If Snowden is arrested, he must be brought “as soon as practicable” before a Hong Kong judge, according to the extradition treaty. That judge will then decide whether he should be removed from Hong Kong under the terms of the treaty.

Among other things, the treaty requires that any criminal charges filed against Snowden must be both listed in the treaty and involve an offense that could land him in prison for more than a year in both the United States and Hong Kong.

Young, the legal expert, said that while the crime of theft clearly passed that test, the two communication-related charges “will likely attract litigation and dispute in the courts.” Those two charges are not listed explicitly in the treaty, although “offences involving the unlawful use of computers” is included, something U.S. officials may use in their legal arguments.

Snowden can challenge any initial ruling to extradite him all the way to Hong Kong’s highest court, a process that could take months to run its course.

In addition, he can submit an application for asylum to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees’ office in Hong Kong, which processes most asylum claims in the city. An enormous backlog means an application from Snowden could take months or even years to clear. Under Hong Kong law, the government would not be able to extradite him until his asylum request was processed.

UNHCR did not respond to requests for comment Saturday.

Regina Ip, a Hong Kong legislator and former security secretary, said Snowden will have plenty of defenders if he is arrested.

“I think if he stays in Hong Kong, there will be no lack of human-rights lawyers who are happy to help him,” she said Saturday.

Last weekend, 200 to 300 protesters marched by the U.S. Consulate to support Snowden, applauding his release of classified documents showing secret surveillance operations by the United States.

Hong Kong is in an unusual position in the matter, in that it has an independent legal system but must ultimately answer to mainland Chinese leadership in Beijing.

Snowden’s story has occasionally made the headlines in China, where some of his critiques of the U.S. government echo allegations by China’s leadership that the United States points fingers at other countries even as it violates civil liberties itself.

On Saturday, some Chinese netizens praised Snowden on hearing the news that criminal charges had been filed against him. Others expressed doubt that he would receive a fair trial in the United States.

“I reckon it will be a secret trial . . . or just no trial,” wrote a used named Xiaolai on the Twitter-like microblog weibo.

Said another user, Kingbo Lee: “Snowden is a hero, a hero of the world’s people. Foreign countries must offer political asylum and support Snowden.”

Washington (CNN) - As President Barack Obama weighs launching a military strike against Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons, American public opinion over whether the U.S. should get involved appears conflicted.

The most recent national polling over the past few months suggests that most Americans, weary after more than a decade of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, don't favor getting its military involved in the bloody fighting in Syria. But some surveys also indicate that the public feels that Washington would be justified in using military action against Damascus if there was proof the Syrian regime used chemical weapons against their own people.



Sixty-one percent of those questioned in a Quinnipiac survey conducted in late June and early July said that it was not in the national interest for the U.S. to be involved in the war in Syria. And nearly six in 10 said they opposed the U.S. sending military arms or supplies to the rebel forces fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Those findings were consistent with earlier surveys from Gallup, Pew Research Center, and CBS News/New York Times that were conducted in June.

""In past foreign crises, polls have shown that support for U.S. action changes depending on three things: whether ground troops might become involved, whether the U.S. is acting alone or as part of an international coalition, and whether there is a specific reason to use U.S. force. The reason may be forward-looking or in retaliation for something that already happened, but the public doesn't like writing blank checks,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

But factor in chemical weapons, and public opinion shifts.

In May, a CNN/ORC Poll asked, ""If the United States were able to present evidence that convinced you that the Syrian government has chemical weapons and has used them to kill civilians in that country, do you think the U.S. would or would not be justified in using military action against the Syrian government?""

Two thirds of those questioned answered yes, with three in 10 saying no.

An ABC News/Washington Post poll from last December had similar results, with more than six in 10 supporting military action Syria if it used chemical weapons against its people.

The United States has concluded Syria carried out chemical weapons attacks against its people, Obama said Wednesday, a claim that comes amid a looming diplomatic showdown over whether to strike against al-Assad's government.

""We do not believe that, given the delivery systems, using rockets, that the opposition could have carried out these attacks. We have concluded that the Syrian government in fact carried these out,"" Obama told ""PBS NewsHour.""

""If, in fact, we can take limited, tailored approaches, not getting drawn into a long conflict, not a repetition of, you know, Iraq, which I know a lot of people are worried about – but if we are saying in a clear and decisive but very limited way, we send a shot across the bow saying, stop doing this, that can have a positive impact on our national security over the long term,"" the president added.

One limited military option is cruise missile attacks against Syrian government and military targets.

According to the Quinnipiac poll, Americans by a 49%-38% plurality said the U.S. should use weapons that don't risk the lives of American forces, such as cruise missiles or drones, to attack Syrian government targets.

""After the Vietnam war, Americans were much less likely to support the use of U.S. force, a phenomenon often referred to as the Vietnam syndrome,"" Holland added. ""Will Americans suffer from an Iraq syndrome in future conflicts? We may get an answer to that question in the next few weeks."""

""Arming the rebels -- that's an option,"" Hagel said at a Pentagon news conference.

Asked directly if the administration was reconsidering its opposition to that option, Hagel said ""yes.""

The comment cracks the door open, if only a little, to the U.S. getting more involved in the bloody Syria war.

President Obama, speaking separately at a press conference in the middle of a trip to Mexico, said Thursday that Hagel's remarks were ""what I've been saying now for months."" Obama said the U.S. still needs to ""look before we leap,"" and make sure any steps the country takes serve to advance the cause of regime change.

The administration last week revealed that U.S. intelligence found evidence that the regime used chemical weapons, specifically sarin, ""on a small scale"" in Syria. The White House, however, stressed that investigators would need to find out more about how that nerve gas was released before acting on that intelligence.

Obama has long called the use of chemical weapons in Syria a ""red line"" that could prompt U.S. action if crossed.

Hagel said Thursday that the U.S. must ""rethink all options,"" though ""it doesn't mean you do or you will"" use those options.

""These are options that must be considered with partners, with the international community,"" he said.

At the same news conference, British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said his government has not yet provided arms to the Syrian rebels but would not rule it out. He also said it appears the regime is ""largely in control of its chemical weapons"" sites.

The administration could be faced with several options if it chooses to get more involved in the Syria conflict. Some have called for the establishment of a no-fly zone, and even limited air strikes, but arming the opposition could represent a middle ground. Some lawmakers have been urging the administration for months to take that step.

Obama, in a press conference Tuesday, warned against ""rushing to judgment without hard, effective evidence.""

He said it's important to move forward ""in a prudent way.""

http://news.yahoo.com/-obama-on-syria--u-s--%E2%80%98does-not-do-pinpricks%E2%80%99-220312524.html,,[],Obama: Strikes ‘absolutely’ on hold if Syria quits chemical arms,"President Barack Obama said Monday that he will “absolutely” hold off on striking Syria if President Bashar Assad puts his chemical weapons arsenals under international control in line with a Russia-backed proposal.

In a series of six television interviews, Obama also said he was not “confident” of getting congressional authorization to use force and had not decided whether to go ahead with attacking Syria if he doesn’t. But he warned that “the U.S. does not do pinpricks.”

The president’s unprecedented public relations blitz came as public opinion polls showed that a solid majority of Americans oppose going to war with Syria in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack by Assad’s forces on Aug. 21. The United States says it is sure the regime carried out that assault and that it left about 1,400 dead, including several hundred children.

In addition to interviews with ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox and PBS, Obama was to deliver a prime-time address to the nation on Tuesday night.

On ABC, Obama pledged to hold off on attacking if Assad and Syria’s patron Russia prove they are serious about taking steps to put the regime’s chemical weapons under international control in an “enforceable and verifiable” way. The notion was first floated by Secretary of State John Kerry in London on Monday, and quickly seized on by Russia, a long-time patron of Syria, as a way to defuse the threat of American military action.

Obama, standing on the threshold of one of the most consequential decisions of his presidency, told NBC that the Russian-backed proposal could turn out to be “a significant breakthrough” — or a bust.

“I think you have to take it with a grain of salt initially,” he said. The Moscow-backed proposal only came about because of the “credible threat of a military strike from the United States” that forced Russia and Syria to consider such a dramatic step.

“This could potentially be a significant breakthrough. But we have to be skeptical because this is not how we've seen them operate over the last couple a years,” he said.

Story continues

Obama, speaking hours after Kerry promised “unbelievably small” strikes, underlined that “our military is the greatest the world has ever known” and that any attack would be limited but effective.

“The U.S. does not do pinpricks,” he said.

Asked whether he would go to war with Syria even if Congress votes against giving him authorization to do so, Obama told NBC: “I haven’t decided.”

“I read polls like everybody else,” he said. Unleashing America’s military absent a direct, imminent threat to the United States and without Congressional backing, he said, is “not the kind of precedent I want to set.”

Obama noted the outreach to skeptical lawmakers as well as his appeals to the public, culminating in a prime-time speech to the nation on Tuesday night.

“And I'll evaluate after that whether or not we feel strongly enough about this that we're willing to move forward,” the president said.

So is he confident that Congress will give him the authority?

“I wouldn't say I'm confident,” Obama replied. “I'm confident that the members of Congress are taking this issue very seriously and they're doing their homework, and I appreciate that.”

When CBS pointed out that the public did not support his approach, Obama replied: “Yeah, well, not yet.”"

An influx of heavy weaponry has aided anti-regime forces in recent weeks in a conflict in which an estimated 70,000 people have been killed.

The Obama administration is moving toward a major policy shift on Syria that could provide rebels there with equipment such as body armor and armored vehicles, and possibly military training, and could send humanitarian assistance directly to Syria’s opposition political coalition, according to U.S. and European officials.

The administration has not provided direct aid to the military or political side of the opposition throughout the two-year-old conflict, and U.S. officials remain opposed to providing weapons to the rebels.

Elements of the proposed policy, which officials cautioned have not yet been finalized, are being discussed by Secretary of State John F. Kerry in meetings this week and next with allies in Europe and the Middle East as part of a coordinated effort to end the bloody stalemate, which has claimed about 70,000 lives.

Those talks — along with a nearly two-hour meeting in Berlin on Tuesday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and a Thursday conference with allies and leaders of the Syrian Opposition Coalition in Rome — are expected to weigh heavily on administration deliberations.

Kerry has repeatedly made indirect references to a policy shift during his travels. He told a group of German students Tuesday that the United States wants a “peaceful resolution” in Syria, but if its leaders refuse to negotiate and continue to kill citizens, “then you need to at least provide some kind of support” for those fighting for their rights.

On Monday in London, he said: “We are not coming to Rome simply to talk. We’re coming . . . to make decisions about next steps.”

Opposition political leaders had threatened to boycott the Rome meeting, but they were persuaded to attend after telephone calls in which Kerry and Vice President Biden said substantive proposals would be on the table.

The pending shift to a more active role comes as the administration and its partners backing the opposition, including Britain, France and countries in Syria’s region, have concluded that there is little immediate chance for a negotiated political settlement with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Western officials have also acknowledged that the opposition coalition is unlikely to quickly develop a governing infrastructure or attract significant support from fence-sitting Syrian minorities and Assad supporters.

The opposition, meanwhile, has been strident in its criticism of the United States and others for refusing to provide it with the resources to organize a quasi-government and broaden its support inside Syria.

The Obama administration, citing legal restrictions on direct funding of the opposition, has funneled $385 million in humanitarian aid through international institutions and nongovernmental organizations, most of which operate under Syrian government supervision.

On the military side, the administration has established direct contact with rebel leaders but has limited aid to communications equipment delivered indirectly. A push last summer to arm the rebels, backed by then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, then-CIA Director David H. Petraeus and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, was rejected by the White House in favor of continued efforts to build the political opposition.

While anti-government fighters have made significant gains against Assad’s military, concern has grown that militants linked to al-Qaeda have begun to dominate the opposition force. Early this year, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries directly arming the opposition fighters increased weapons shipments to secular and moderate Islamist rebel factions after consultations with Washington.

A senior Arab official in the region said those armaments, including antitank weapons and recoilless rifles, have begun flowing into Syria. The New York Times reported Tuesday that at least some of those weapons were purchased in Croatia.

Britain and France have pushed to lift a European Union arms embargo on Syria. At a meeting in Brussels last week, political representatives of some of the E.U.’s 27 members refused to lift the year-long embargo entirely when it expires this Friday. Instead, they renewed it for three months and agreed to reconsider it in May.

More important, according to several European officials, the E.U. inserted a clause that allows member countries “to provide greater non-lethal support and technical assistance for the protection of civilians.”

Finalization of the new provision will be announced Thursday as Kerry and representatives of other governments meet with the opposition coalition in Rome, said officials close to the deliberations.

Although a number of countries opposed the change, it was favored by Britain, France, Germany and Italy, according to a European official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss rapidly evolving policies.

“Under the old E.U. setup, we couldn’t do anything,” a senior European official said. The new rule will allow “things that don’t of themselves kill people,” including night-vision equipment, armored vehicles and military training.

Another European official said, “We’re talking about things that can be helpful on the ground — bulletproof jackets, binoculars and communications.”

Each country participating in the effort is expected to decide for itself what equipment it will supply. The European officials said they have been in close contact with the Obama administration about its intentions and have been told that discussions are ongoing.

Asked Tuesday about prospects for expanding U.S. military support for the rebels, Kerry said he would not speculate on the outcome of the meeting with opposition leaders.

“We’re going to Rome to bring a group of nations together precisely to talk about this problem,” Kerry said. “I don’t want to get ahead of that meeting or ability to begin to think about exactly what will be a part of it.”

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Kerry and Lavrov, his Russian counterpart, spent the bulk of their meeting discussing Syria. Lavrov met in Moscow on Monday with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who said the Assad government is willing to talk with opponents while continuing its fight “against terrorism.”

Opposition leader Mouaz al-Khatib deflected a Russian offer to visit Moscow amid disagreements within the coalition.

Lavrov called his meeting with Kerry “constructive” and told reporters that they agreed to do everything in their power “to create the best conditions to facilitate the soonest possible start of a dialogue between the government and the opposition,” Reuters reported.

He said Russia wants the opposition to name representatives for talks with the government, and he blamed “extremists” in the coalition for stopping progress toward negotiations.

It's unclear whether the demands would slow down the administration, as it begins to build the public case for a military strike. One Defense official told Fox News that a U.S. strike is ""not a matter of if, but when.""

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney stressed Tuesday afternoon that the president has not yet decided to authorize the use of military force. But he made a legal argument for doing so, saying that the United States and 188 other nations are signatories to a chemical weapons convention opposing the use of such weapons, and that there must be a response to a clear violation of those terms.

While officials had indicated the intelligence documents implicating the Assad regime might be released as early as Tuesday, the administration has not yet made them public.

The quickly moving developments, in response to an alleged chemical weapons strike by the Assad regime last week, have lawmakers -- currently on summer recess -- clamoring for influence in a decision that has wide-ranging implications for both the Syrian civil war and the U.S. itself.

Republican Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia is asking colleagues to sign a letter to Obama that urges him to reconvene Congress and seek approval first for any military action.

Other lawmakers are stopping short of demanding a vote, but still want the administration to bring them into the process before moving ahead.

""I expect the Commander in Chief would consult with Congress in the days ahead as he considers the options available to him,"" Rep. Buck McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, R-Calif., said in a statement, while urging the administration to ""act decisively.""

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, on Tuesday urged the administration to submit a ""detailed plan"" on the objectives and cost of any strike.

After House Speaker John Boehner's office complained that the White House had not been in touch, a White House official reached out to Boehner Monday afternoon to discuss the Syria situation.

Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said the speaker, too, ""made clear that before any action is taken there must be meaningful consultation with members of Congress, as well as clearly defined objectives and a broader strategy to achieve stability.""

Likewise, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said: ""Absent an imminent threat to United States national security, the U.S. should not be engaged in military action without congressional approval.""

Secretary of State John Kerry has been reaching out to Congress on the sidelines.

Lawmakers, in urging the administration to consult with them, point in part to the War Powers Resolution of 1973. The resolution technically requires the president to seek congressional authorization when the military is sent into ""hostilities"" for anything but a retaliatory attack or formally declared war. But presidents have routinely flouted or found ways around that resolution -- the resolution, for instance, did not stop Obama from teaming up with Britain and France for airstrikes in Libya against Muammar Qaddafi's government.

The Obama administration seems to be waiting for top allies -- like Britain and France -- to get on board before advancing with any plans to attack Syria.

In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron has called back Parliament to debate and vote on a Syria plan on Thursday. And in France, President Francois Hollande on Tuesday said France ""is ready to punish"" those who gassed hundreds in Syria.

In Washington, some members of Congress have long been opposed to intervention in Syria. But a number of high-ranking officials are speaking out in favor of a limited strike. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., was the latest to say a multinational military action would be ""appropriate""

Polls over the past year have shown the public is far less interested in getting more deeply involved in Syria. A Fox News poll in July found only 11 percent of voters favored sending weapons to the opposition. Forty-four percent said the U.S. should get out of the conflict entirely.

Corker considering bill to block Obama administration from loosening Iran sanctions,"Sen. Bob Corker is considering legislation that would block the Obama administration from easing sanctions on Iran, as the U.S. prepares for talks this week with Tehran on its nuclear program.

An aide to Corker, R-Tenn., confirms to Fox News Corker is considering a proposal that would prohibit the White House from loosening sanctions on the Iranian regime unless it made major concessions on its missile and nuclear programs. Corker’s plans were first reported by The Daily Beast.

Corker’s legislation would require concessions far beyond those currently being considered ahead of Iran’s talks with the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany in Geneva.

""We've crafted an amendment to freeze the administration in and make it so they are unable to reduce the sanctions unless certain things occur,"" Corker told The Daily Beast. ""They have the ability now to waive sanctions. But we're very concerned that in their desire to make any deal that they may in fact do something that is very bad for our country.""

If Corker’s legislation came to fruition, it could pose a significant obstacle to negotiators already dealing with resistance from both Washington and hard-liners in Iran.

Iranian hard-liners want significant sanctions reductions in exchange for scaling back enrichment, while some U.S. lawmakers want the enrichment to stop altogether in exchange for loosening sanctions. In the talks Thursday and Friday, negotiators will face strong pressure from both camps even as they try to find common ground among their own positions.

The talks concern the size and output of Iran's enrichment program, which can create both reactor fuel and weapons-grade material suitable for a nuclear bomb. Iran insists it is pursuing only nuclear energy, medical treatments and research. However, new reformist President Hassan Rouhani has indicated he could cut back on the nuclear program in exchange for an easing of the crippling economic sanctions.

Both the U.S. administration and Iran's clerical leadership are urging critics at home to support the talks. In Tehran on Sunday, Khamenei asked Iranians not to ""weaken"" the negotiators, and deputy U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Monday that ""the U.S. needs to speak with one voice when we're sitting down at the table.""

A senior U.S. official, speaking to reporters on Wednesday said both sides are coming to the table Thursday with an understanding of what they want from each other as a `'first step"" -- and what they are willing to give in return. She asked for anonymity as a condition for participation in her briefing.

She said the six world powers are ready to offer `'limited, targeted and reversible"" sanctions relief in response to agreement by Iran to start rolling back activities that could be used to make weapons.

But in a nod to skeptics in Congress, she emphasized that any economic relief given Iran can be canceled, should Tehran renege on commitments it makes in Geneva. And she said the six powers were looking to test the durability of any initial nuclear limits Iran agreed to by waiting -- possibly for as long as for six months -- after such agreement before any sanctions relief kicked in..

Corker says his plan would bar the White House from creating any limited sanctions relief before Iran had actually scaled back its nuclear program.

""This would keep an interim deal from happening unless there is actual tangible changes that take place, Corker told the Daily Beast.

In Tehran, Iran's Revolutionary Guard leaders have been mollified somewhat for now by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's suggestion that he will give Rouhani only a limited time to negotiate an end to the sanctions. Underscoring the support that the hard-liners enjoy in Tehran, tens of thousands marked Monday's anniversary of the 1979 storming of the U.S. Embassy with chants of ""Death to America!""

Thursday in Berlin, he announced his intent to march further along “The Road to Zero”—toward a world without nuclear weapons.

Movie stars aren’t expected to understand the intricacies of nuclear weapons policy, but the commander-in-chief should know better than to follow this path.

For decades, nuclear weapons have played a critical role in U.S. security, deterring potential aggressors from attacking our homeland and troops deployed abroad. Our allies have relied on has U.S. nuclear umbrella, as well. It’s been so effective—and so reliable—most of our allies have foregone developing nuclear weapons of their own.

[pullquote]

While “Demand Zero” may sound great on red carpets in Hollywood and Manhattan, it sure doesn’t ring true in Tokyo and Seoul. People living there know they face a real threat: nuclear-armed North Korea.

Pyongyang has repeatedly threatened to turn South Korea – and the United States – to “a sea of fire.” Kim Jong Eun already has ballistic missiles that can reach Japan and U.S. troops deployed throughout the region. The need for deterrence remains.

But President Obama has been hitting the Road to Zero for years.

In February 2011, his negotiating team signed off on the New START—a treaty with Russia that limits each nation to no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads.

For the U.S., that means reducing our nuclear arsenal by 250 warheads over a seven-year period.

For Russia, it means zero reductions; they don’t have that many strategic warheads… yet. (The treaty did, however, allow them to keep their 10-1 advantage over the U.S. in tactical nukes.)

Now, the president wants to cut deeper. In Germany, he proposed slashing the number of American strategic nuclear weapons by up to a third—to as low as 1,000.

Many argue that, if the U.S. reduces its stockpile of nuclear weapons, other nations will follow its lead. That is magical thinking. There is absolutely no historical evidence to support the Field of Dreams-like notion that “If we scrap ‘em, they will too.”

Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. has eliminated around 80 percent of its nuclear arsenal. No other nation has followed suit.

Yes, South Africa gave up its nukes, but that happened while the U.S. was still testing its weapons and expanding its arsenal. But since we began drawing down our stocks, North Korea and Pakistan have emerged as new nuclear powers—and Iran is nipping at their heels.

The world may take its cues from Hollywood on matters of fashion and style, but world leaders don’t follow their advice—or the president’s example—when it comes to geopolitics.

Other nations will not follow the U.S. lead in anything—unless they think it’s in their interest. To assume that they will “do as the U.S. does” is both arrogant and contrary to the historical evidence.

Heck, we don’t know how those New START reductions will impact other states yet. While the treaty codified unilateral U.S. reductions, it left Russia room to build up. And since signing the treaty, Russia has launched the most extensive nuclear weapons modernization program since the end of the Cold War.

This puts the U.S. in dramatically weaker position for the new round of negotiations the President now is seeking.

Meanwhile, the U.S. remains the only nuclear power without a substantive nuclear weapons modernization program. This alone should make Washington think twice before ridding ourselves of weapons that have prevented mass slaughters for more than six decades.

As for our allies, no one can blame them if they start feeling a little antsy about the future of the protective “nuclear umbrella.” When seeking Senate ratification of New START, President Obama certified he would follow through with all phases of the Phased Adaptive Approach—his missile defense plan to protect the U.S. and Europe. But this March, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced that won’t happen. He gutted the last Phase.

What if the Russians, who objected strenuously to the president’s Phased Adaptive Approach, balk at going along with a proposal that would actually cut their nuclear arsenal as well as ours?

Would the president be willing to jettison U.S. nukes unilaterally?

Or might he will offer concessions not even the Russians can refuse. After all, he did promise former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev some second-term “flexibility.”"

As part of the program's ""Guns in America"" franchise, Piers Morgan welcomed Ben Shapiro, an individual who had been outwardly critical of the show's recent direction.

The Breitbart editor-at-large has described the host as having a ""full-scale gun control agenda,"" implied that Morgan is a Liberal, and began his visit by producing a copy of the U.S. Constitution from his jacket pocket.

""You have deliberately tried to frame this as a left-wing attack on the American Constitution and the Second Amendment,"" said Morgan, objecting to his guests perspective. ""You come in, you brandish your little book...""

""My little book? That's the Constitution of the United States, our founding document,"" Shapiro exclaimed.

""I know what's in your Constitution,"" insisted the host.

""Do you really?"" asked the conservative political commentator who turns 29 on Tuesday.

""I've been debating this for a very long time,"" Morgan stated.

Pushing forward on the issue he's most passionate about, the host asked Shapiro to explain why he feels a civilian would need an assault weapon:

""They need them for the prospective possibility of resistance to tyranny,"" he explained.

""Where do you expect the tyranny to come from?"" wondered Morgan.

""It could come from the United States,"" came Shapiro's answer.

""Do you understand how absurd you sound?"" asked the host.

""Here's where you go into the absurd and the bullying,"" claimed Shapiro, repeating an assertion he'd made recently in his on-line writings, all the while mocking Morgan's accent.

""I'm not the one that came in here and accused you of standing on the graves of dead children,"" reminded Morgan.

Watch the clip, and listen to the rest of the debate, as Shapiro further makes his point that of late Morgan has ""gone off the rails,"" and attempts to convince the host, and the viewers, that assault weapons have a place on the streets and in civilian hands.

Tom Price,"A comprehensive immigration reform bill that includes a path to citizenship for immigrants living in the country illegally is ""highly unlikely"" to pass the Republican-majority House of Representatives, Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price, the vice chair of the House Budget Committee, said.

During a Christian Science Monitor breakfast meeting Wednesday, a reporter asked Price if a majority of House members could support a path to legality for immigrants similar to the provision in the bill currently moving through the Senate.

""I think at this point, that would be highly unlikely,"" Price said. ""Because I don't think there's a trust of our conference in the administration to enforce the current laws that are on the books as they relate to much of immigration. And not just this administration—it has been previous administrations as well.""

Price, who opposes the comprehensive approach taken in the Senate—which combines enhanced border security with a path to legality—pointed to the failure of the comprehensive immigration reform bill signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. Despite promises at the time that the law would end the flow of illegal immigration, millions still reside in the United States outside the bounds of the law.

Price said that the Obama administration would need to prove that it can enforce current laws before he would consider supporting new comprehensive legislation. In the meantime, Price said he would rather Congress take a piecemeal approach.

""There's no trust at all. The first step in regaining that trust is living up to the promise that was made to the nation back in 1986, and that is controlling and securing the border,"" Price said. ""So until the administration is able to do that, I don't think that there's any trust that whatever could pass would be enforced or made certain that it would work in a positive way.""

The Senate Judiciary Committee in May approved its own immigration bill, which supporters hope will receive a vote by the full chamber by July 4. A bipartisan group of House members are still negotiating a version for the lower chamber.

Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, one of the lead architects of the Senate bill, will attend a meeting of conservative House members to discuss the bill on Wednesday."
http://news.yahoo.com/-obama-aides-to-brief-all-senators-as-syria-strike-looms--130540322.html,,[],"Obama aides to brief Senators on Saturday, House members Sunday as Syria strike looms","With the United States edging closer to a possible military strike on Syria, President Barack Obama on Saturday ramped up efforts to convince skeptical American lawmakers and wary international partners of the need to act.

Obama’s top national security aides planned to hold the first of two days of weekend briefings for Congress. And the president and top aides were expected to continue consultations with foreign allies.

Senate Republicans and Democrats were to get separate briefings on Saturday. House members of both parties received an invitation to attend a members-only classified briefing at 2 p.m. ET Sunday.

It was not clear what the weekend sessions meant for the timing of a possible attack. Obama has signaled that he does not think he needs explicit congressional authorization to make war on Bashar Assad’s regime — but it seemed somewhat unlikely that the president would pull the trigger before the Sunday briefing.

National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral James Winnefeld, were to update Senators via an unclassified conference call ""this afternoon,"" a senior administration official said.

The calls aimed “to continue the Administration's consultations regarding the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons in Syria on August 21,” the official told reporters by email.

House members were to get briefed on Sunday, according to a message from Republican House Speaker John Boehner.

“Please note, that if your Member is unable to participate that this will be one of many classified briefings. However, given the numerous requests made, the Speaker wanted Members to have an opportunity this weekend,” according to the message.

Boehner also invited representatives to review the Obama Administration’s classified intelligence finding that the Assad regime was behind an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack.

Story continues

Lawmakers were required to review the document in person in the offices of the House Intelligence Committee.

The briefings come after administration officials briefed House Armed Services Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee members on Friday.

Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office announced the Senate GOP briefing late Friday, saying it was being held at his request.

“Sen. McConnell believes it’s important for the whole Conference to have the opportunity to communicate directly with the administration on this important issue,” spokesman Don Stewart said in a statement.

The briefings came at a time when a growing chorus of lawmakers was insisting that Obama secure explicit congressional authorization for any military action against Assad’s regime in Damascus.

The White House repeatedly has said it will “consult” with Congress, but has made it clear Obama does not think he needs the green light from lawmakers.

The Republican Senate briefing was to occur at 1 p.m. Washington time. It was not immediately clear at what time Democrats were to get their briefing."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/02/20/Benghazi-Survivors-Remained-Gagged-By-Federal-Law,2013-02-20 00:00:00,['Kerry Picket'],Benghazi Survivors Remain Gagged by Federal Law,"Many continue to ask why the media and lawmakers have not spoken to or brought forth those who survived the deadly attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi last September. The truth of the matter is the Americans who survived that attack cannot legally reveal to members of the press or most lawmakers that they were even witnesses to the attack in Benghazi.

According to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, immediately following the attack, the FBI, as part of the agency’s investigation, interviewed survivors of the Benghazi attack.

Bill Bransford, a Washington, D.C. attorney at Shaw Bransford & Roth P.C. who specializes in federal employment law told Breitbart News on Tuesday, “First of all, I’m assuming that most of these people who witnessed the attack, except for the State Department folks, would be intelligence people, and they are not covered by the whistle blower protection laws.”

Bransford added, “They are covered by whatever policies their agency has. An executive order that President Obama issued in the late fall in which he ordered the intelligence community to come up with a more effective whistle blower protection system, which has not yet been developed.”

However, as federal employees, State Department personnel must sign non-disclosure agreements. Bransford stressed, “If somebody violates one of these non-disclosure agreements, the consequences could include: interfering with a criminal investigation, obstruction of justice, criminal charges for releasing classified information, and those are pretty serious.”

Serious indeed. The Obama administration’s Justice Department has prosecuted more federal employees for leaking information to the press under the 1917 Espionage Act than all other administrations combined. Bloomberg News reported last September:

Lowell, the Washington defense lawyer who has counted as his clients the likes of Jack Abramoff, the former Washington lobbyist, and political figures including former presidential candidate John Edwards, said the Obama administration is using the Espionage Act “like a club” against government employees accused of leaks. The prosecutions, which Obama and the Justice Department have defended on national security grounds, mean that government officials who speak to the media can face financial and professional ruin as they spend years fighting for their reputations, and, in some cases, their freedom.

Since Breitbart News first broke in December that the Obama administration was hiding Benghazi attack survivors, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) began demanding the FBI hand over to Congress the interviews the agency conducted with individuals who survived the deadly attack.

Senator Graham spoke to Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday last weekend about his frustration regarding the issue:

WALLACE: Senator, let me pick up on one of them I find, frankly, quite astonishing. What is the administration’s explanation for the fact the FBI interviewed the survivors, all the Americans who safely got out of Benghazi, right after the attack, months ago, and that they refused to give the transcripts of the interviews to Congress. What’s their explanation for that? GRAHAM: This is an ongoing criminal investigation is what they told me. We are going back to the law enforcement model, where we’re treating al Qaeda as sort of a mafia, common criminal element rather than enemy combatants. And here’s what was really stunning, the FBI interviewed the survivors, two days after the attack in Germany and, the CIA never called the FBI for weeks, wanting the results of the interview before they made their assessments — we are going back to the pre-9/11 mentality of — where we treat it as a law enforcement function, and FBI and the CIA never talk to each other, which is very dangerous. Benghazi was system failure, before, during and after.

Clinton testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January that there were about 25 to 30 survivors and she only spoke to one. Many of the individuals who worked at the U.S. compound were either CIA or State Department employees.

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center is not only heavily guarded on the outside but on the inside as well, some say. In December 2012, visitors to the amputee ward at the NNMMC (Bethesda Hospital) observed what appeared to be Secret Service personnel moving in and out of a closed wing of the floor that was off-limits to everyone else.

According to Fox News, former Senator John Kerry, now Secretary of State, visited Benghazi survivors at Walter Reed on February 4th. Fox News host Greta Van Susteren asked Senator Graham about Kerry’s visit.

I’ve been asking in November, we wrote to the president. The person I blame above all others is President Obama, did you know president Obama, in April or June why wasn’t the Congress informed. They were interviewed two days by the FBI you know the CIA never called up the FBI and say, what did they say about the attack. If you talk to the survivors, you would have known it was a coordinated terrorist attack and not a mob.

Bransford points out that, to the extent that these potential witnesses are State Department employees, they are governed by the whistle blower protection act as modified by the Whistle Blower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, which just went into effect six weeks ago. According to Bransford, it does have a provision in it about non-disclosure agreements, but that some of the changes may not yet be in effect because the law is so new and the employee is supposed to be aware of the non-disclosure policies.

For example, it would be consistent with the law on classified information and what they’re allowed to tell Congress. That’s an area that’s kind of brand new and it would only apply to the non-intelligence people–like diplomatic security agents. The FBI probably interviewed them. It is customary and probably consistent with valid non-disclosure policy to tell somebody who is a witness in an ongoing criminal investigation, which of course the FBI is there, so it’s criminal and counter-terrorism, to tell (witnesses) they are not to discuss the substance of the interview or what they discussed with the investigating agents with anyone. And that would be consistent with a valid non-disclosure policy. So, at this stage, to get (Benghazi survivors) to talk might be tough.

Is there any recourse for Benghazi survivors to ever tell their stories? Certain members of Congress who are authorized to receive information of an ongoing FBI investigation may be these individuals’ only outlets to do so.

He added, “Does that mean that they can’t release it later? Maybe. Meaning there could be some political stuff going on to try and get that information but I’m not sure what’s going to happen with that.”

Senator Charles Grassley (R – IA), the co-author of the Whistle Blower Protection Enhancement Act sent a statement to Breitbart News on the law:"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/28/issa-subpoenas-state-department-for-benghazi-documents/,2013-05-28 00:00:00,[],Issa subpoenas State Department for Benghazi documents,"Republican Rep. Darrell Issa issued subpoenas Tuesday for a host of State Department emails and other communications on the Benghazi terror attack, signaling that the Obama administration's recent document dump would not satisfy congressional investigators.

Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, claimed in a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry that the department is still ""withholding documents.""

He demanded the department release more on the administration's behind-the-scenes discussions, in the days after the attack, on how they would describe the strike. These documents have since become known as the ""Benghazi talking points.""

""The State Department has not lived up to the administration's broad and unambiguous promises of cooperation with Congress. Therefore, I am left with no alternative but to compel the State Department to produce relevant documents through a subpoena,"" Issa wrote to Kerry.

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said Tuesday that the department ""remains committed to working cooperatively with the Congress"" and would ""take stock"" of any requests for information -- but noted that the department has provided thousands of pages of documents.

More On This...

""We have demonstrated an unprecedented degree of cooperation with the Congress on the issue of Benghazi, engaging in over 30 hearings and briefings for members and staff, and sharing over 25,000 pages of documents with committees,"" he said. ""All of us -- in the administration, in the Congress, in the media -- we should all be focused on the issue of protecting the American diplomats and development experts who are working every day to advance America's national interest and global leadership.""

Issa, in the letter, said he was issuing a subpoena that would cover ""all documents and communications"" for 10 current and former State Department officials.

This includes former spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, as well as nine others. Nuland is the official who, in the emails released earlier this month, could be seen pressing other agencies to remove references to prior attacks and security warnings in Benghazi -- expressing concern that the warnings could be used by lawmakers to criticize the State Department.

She also questioned references to Islamic extremists.

Issa wrote that her comments suggest ""that she did not raise these concerns in a vacuum,"" noting specifically that Nuland said some of the changes did not ""resolve all my issues or those of my building leadership.""

Issa wrote: ""The documents the enclosed subpoena covers will help the Committee understand why, although on the day after the attacks senior State Department leadership believed that Islamic extremists were involved, there were reservations about publicly acknowledging any such involvement just three days later. This issue is at the heart of the Committee's ongoing investigation.""

The committee confirmed to Fox News that the subpoena has been served.

Issa gave the department until June 7 to comply. The subpoena would cover communications under the leadership of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

The intelligence community's final talking points compiled for members of Congress suggested the Sept. 11 attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans stemmed from protests over an anti-Islamic video rather than an assault by extremists. Five days after the attack, U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice relied on the talking points in a series of interviews on the Sunday talk shows.

Republicans have accused the Obama administration of trying to mislead the American people about an act of terrorism in the heat of the presidential campaign. The White House says Rice reflected the best information available while facts were still being gathered.

After several revisions, the gist of the talking points read: ""The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi and subsequently its annex. There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations.""

Issa said the emails and documents failed to answer the question of who else at the department other than Nuland had concerns about the early versions of the talking points. The chairman is seeking all documents and communications related to the talking points from former officials such as Nuland; Cheryl Mills, counselor and chief of staff to Clinton; and Philippe Reines, a deputy assistant secretary to Clinton; as well as Deputy Secretary of State William Burns.

His Latest Novel Is', 'The Paladin.']",David Ignatius: Sequestration is feeding a slow-motion decay,"For people (like me) who worry that the U.S. government is becoming dysfunctional, it’s worth studying the subtle and largely hidden effects of sequestration on the military and other agencies. What’s happening is the slow-motion decay of programs and readiness, which should scare the heck out of most citizens.

Sequestration, you will remember, was the meat-ax approach to budget-cutting whose consequences were thought to be so capricious and damaging that Congress would have to come up with a more rational alternative. Congress instead chose the path of least resistance — which was doing nothing — so the automatic, across-the-board cuts mandated by the 2011 Budget Control Act took effect in March.

The conventional wisdom now seems to be that sequestration isn’t as bad as people expected and that the Obama administration cried wolf unnecessarily. Sorry, but the wolf is here all right; he’s just eating the seed corn stored out of sight in the warehouse, as opposed to the food on the table. Officials at different agencies provide a sense of what’s at risk.

Let’s start with effects on the military — not because the Pentagon deserves any special budget breaks but because the consequences are easy to understand. A simple way to think about it is that sequestration is preserving what’s politically popular — soldiers’ pay, veterans’ benefits, military bases and the like — and cutting things such as training, which the politicians care little about. The effect, a few years from now, will be degraded performance.

The Air Force has grounded 13 fighter squadrons, or about one-third of its total. That amounts to about 250 planes. The danger isn’t that we’ll be defenseless to a foreign attack but that pilots who don’t fly and mechanics who don’t fix engines will lose their edge — or maybe quit and work for the commercial airlines. The Air Force is canceling for the rest of the year its big “Red Flag” combat training exercises, along with courses at the Air Force Weapons School.

“We are not as capable as we historically have been at handling a pop-up contingency,” says an Air Force spokesman.

The Army is sharply cutting training above the basic squad and platoon level. All but one of the Combat Training Center rotations scheduled for brigades this fiscal year have been canceled. Depot maintenance has been halted for the rest of the fiscal year, meaning that six divisions won’t have the necessary equipment readiness. The Army will cut 37,000 flying hours from its aviation training, creating a shortfall of 500 pilots by the end of the fiscal year.

“Should a contingency arise, there may not be enough time to avoid sending forces into harm’s way unprepared,” Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, told Congress in February.

The Navy reports that by the end of this fiscal year, two-thirds of its non-deployed ships and aviation squadrons won’t meet readiness targets. The Navy has also delayed planned fleet deployments, including the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman to the Persian Gulf and the frigate USS Thach to the South Atlantic. “In the near term, we will not be able to respond in the way the nation has expected and depended on us,” Adm. Jonathan Greenert, the chief of naval operations, told Congress in February.

The effects on the intelligence community are also scary. Contracts, collection systems and analysis are all being trimmed. Some satellite reconnaissance systems may be decommissioned. “We’ll reduce global coverage and may risk missing the early signs of a threat,” says Shawn Turner, spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Now, let’s look at civilian programs. Here, again, the effects are mostly hidden from immediate view, but they could impact the long-term health, education and welfare of the country.

The National Institutes of Health has delayed or halted 700 research awards that help fund the study of diseases affecting millions of Americans. The Labor Department estimates that 1.5 million claimants for emergency unemployment compensation have been affected. The Education Department says nearly $600 million has been cut from special education funding and $700 million from assistance to low-income school districts.

What’s depressing is that the sequestration cuts are being imposed in part so that Congress can avoid making decisions about real fiscal reforms that add revenues and reduce spiraling future costs in Medicare and Social Security. People who wonder why the federal government’s performance is deteriorating should consider what their family or business finances would look like if they had to be approved by Congress.

USA TODAY

Snowden is charged with leaking classified information under the Espionage Act

U.S. lawmakers say Snowden must be returned to USA

Hong Kong said extradition request didn%27t fully comply with Hong Kong law

MOSCOW — NSA leaker Edward Snowden has asked for political asylum in Ecuador after fleeing Hong Kong for Russia, the Ecuador Foreign Ministry said Sunday.

Russian news site RT reported that Snowden was to leave Moscow on Monday for Havana, and then move on to Caracas, Venezuela. But the Ecuador ministry and WikiLeaks, a website that divulges state secrets and is assisting Snowden, said he will try to get to Ecuador instead.

A Russian security source indicated on Monday that Moscow had no basis to extradite Snowden.

""Snowden has not committed any unlawful act on Russian territory,"" RIA Novosti quoted an unnamed security source as saying on Monday morning. ""Russian law enforcement has no order to detain him, so there is no basis to do so.""

Earlier the White House urged Russia to consider ""all options available,"" according to National Security Council Spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden cited by Associated Press.

Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino has confirmed, meanwhile, that Snowden had requested asylum in his country, and pledged that his request would be considered in the shortest time possible, according to televised remarks carried by the Latin-American channel Telesur.

RIA Novosti reported at about 2:00 a.m. Monday morning that Ecuador's Ambassador to Russia, Patricio Alberto Chavez Zavala was seen leaving Sheremetyevo's transit zone, with several people getting into his car.

Interfax reported that Snowden has not been able to leave the airport because he does not have a Russian visa. He was accompanied by WikiLeaks representative Sarah Harrison, a British citizen who does have a Russian visa, according to Interfax.

""(Snowden) is bound for a democratic nation via a safe route for the purposes of asylum,and is being escorted by diplomats and legal advisers from WikiLeaks,"" the group said in a statement.

Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, told Australian Sydney Morning Herald that Snowden will be met by ""diplomats from the country that will be his ultimate destination"" in the airport, who'll accompany him on a further flight to his destination.

A Russian lawmaker commented on Monday that the Snowden affair would have little effect on Russia-US relations.

""It won't improve these relations, but it won't harm them,"" RIA Novosti quoted Leonid Kalashnikov, first deputy head of the State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee as saying. Kalashnikov added that Russia should give Snowden citizenship and asylum. ""Why should he fly to Ecuador? This isn't about a political refugee, but about a humanitarian one.""

Snowden was allowed to leave Hong Kong just hours after Obama administration officials announced they filed a formal petition with Chinese authorities seeking Snowden's arrest and return to the United States.

An unofficial intermediary for the Hong Kong government told Edward Snowden that he was free to leave the city, according to Albert Ho, a local legislator who said on Monday that he was part of the former NSA contractor's legal team.

Ho said the message was passed to Snowden after Ho met with a senior government official on Friday to discuss whether Hong Kong would extradite Snowden to the U.S. and whether he might be detained at the airport if he tried to leave on his own.

He said Snowden originally planned to leave Saturday evening, but then hesitated as he tried to confirm the identity of the intermediary who had given him the all clear. Ho said he thought the person might have been an official from the Chinese government.

""I have reasons to believe that ... those who wanted [Snowden] to leave represented Beijing authorities,"" Ho said. ""Beijing would not step foward to the front stage because it would affect Sino-U.S. relations.""

On Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder had pressed the request for Snowden's arrest directly with Hong Kong Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen.

A U.S. official told the Associated Press that Snowden's passport was revoked before he left Hong Kong. Hong Kong's immigration department stated that so far no notification has been received from the United States government about the issue.

Snowden's travel plans could be complicated, but airlines or countries are allowed to overlook a withdrawn passport if a senior official so orders, the AP reported.

""We will continue to discuss this matter with Hong Kong and pursue relevant law enforcement cooperation with other countries where Mr. Snowden may be attempting to travel,'' U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Nanda Chitre said Sunday.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said the U.S. government must exhaust all legal options to get Snowden back.

""Every one of those nations is hostile to the United States,"" Rogers, R-Mich., said on NBC's Meet the Press.

""When you think about what he says he wants and what his actions are, it defies logic,"" said Rogers, who repeated his assertion that Snowden's leaks of secret government surveillance programs had damaged U.S. national security.

The Hong Kong government said Snowden, 30, was allowed to fly out ""on his own accord"" because the U.S. extradition request announced Saturday did not fully comply with Hong Kong law.

Hong Kong said in a statement that it allowed Snowden to leave because documents provided by the U.S. government for extradition did not ""fully comply with the legal requirements under Hong Kong law,"" and the U.S. had not yet provided the additional information requested to consider the U.S. request for a provisional arrest warrant.

After the announcement Saturday of the extradition request, an Obama administration official told USA TODAY that Hong Kong risked harming relations with the two sides if it did not comply with its legal obligations. Regina Ip, a legislator and Cabinet member in Hong Kong, said, ""I don't think we need to be concerned about any consequences.""

Snowden has been the focus of a criminal investigation since he acknowledged earlier this month that he was the source of materials detailing surveillance programs that collected telephone records for millions of Americans and a separate operation that targeted the Internet communications of non-citizens abroad who were suspected of terrorist connections.

He has been charged in U.S. federal court with espionage.

The South China Morning Post meanwhile reported that Snowden had provided information to show that the NSA had hacked into the Hong Kong system of Pacnet, which runs undersea telecommunications cables around the Pacific, and into 63 computers and servers at Tsinghua University in Beijing, one of China's most elite schools.

""The NSA does all kinds of things like hack Chinese cellphone companies to steal all of your SMS data,"" Snowden told the newspaper.

Snowden, who was employed by Booz Allen Hamilton as an NSA systems analyst in Hawaii, fled to the Chinese territory of Hong Kong last month with top-secret documents and court orders on government surveillance operations.

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said she was not surprised that Snowden would seek safe haven in Cuba or Venezuela, ""two regimes that have a longstanding history of giving refuge to fugitives from U.S. law.""

""The cruel irony is that there are no press freedoms in either Cuba or Venezuela, yet Snowden who supposedly stands for transparency in government seeks refuge in police states like these two countries,"" she said.

Hagel's unannounced visit on Saturday lands him in the center of the chaos, but he has no plans to meet with Karzai and may have little impact on the matter during his stopover.

The U.S. has made its position on the security agreement clear and Karzai has tentatively endorsed the deal. Still, he refuses to sign it after it was approved by a council of tribal elders known as the Loya Jirga. The council said the agreement with the U.S. should be signed by the end of December, as U.S. officials have demanded.

Karzai says he wants his successor to decide after the April 5 elections. Washington and NATO officials say they want a quick decision on the bilateral security agreement, which allows U.S. troops to stay in Afghanistan after 2014 to do training and some counterterrorism missions.

Without a signed agreement, all U.S. troops would leave at the end of next year, along with all foreign forces. Military leaders have said they need time to plan and coordinate with allies for the post-2014 mission, which could involve around 8,000 U.S. forces and another 6,000 allies troops.

Karzai has said he won't sign any agreement that allows continued raids on Afghan homes. Under Afghan law, any agreement must be signed twice — once to get it to parliament and, if approved, then by Karzai alone in his capacity as president.

Pentagon spokesman Carl Woog said Hagel is traveling to Afghanistan ""to thank troops for their service fighting far away from home and commend the progress they have made this year"" in improving the Afghan security forces. He said Hagel plans to meet with Afghan Minister of Defense Bismillah Khan Mohammadi and Minister of Interior Mohammad Umer Daudzai. He will also travel around the country to visit with coalition service members.

Story continues

Earlier this week, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Washington that the White House has not instructed him to plan for a so-called ""zero option"" that would leave no U.S. troops in Afghanistan after 2014. But he cautioned that it is a possibility, given the ongoing impasse.

This is Hagel's second trip to Afghanistan since he began as defense chief early this year.

His visit in March was marked by drama. His less than three day stay was riddled with bombings, security threats, political gridlock and wild accusations from Karzai.

A suicide bomber targeted the Afghan defense ministry a day before Hagel was scheduled to go there, and the Pentagon chief had to cancel a planned news conference because of a security threat.

In addition, Karzai accused the U.S. of colluding with the Taliban. The comments drew sharp rebukes from other U.S. officials as days passed."

""Reforms are taking shape,"" Assange said in a statement released Saturday

President Obama has rejected characterizations of Snowden as a whistle-blower

Snowden, who has temporary asylum in Russia, faces felony charges in the U.S.

President Barack Obama's plan to review U.S. surveillance programs has validated fugitive NSA leaker Edward Snowden's role as a whistle-blower, the head of the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks said Saturday.

The statement came a day after Obama outlined steps to reform intelligence gathering measures, saying the classified leaks by Snowden created a public distrust in programs meant to safeguard Americans.

""As Snowden has stated, his biggest concern was if he blew the whistle and change did not occur,"" Julian Assange said in a written statement.

""Well, reforms are taking shape, and for that, the president and people of the United States and around the world owe Edward Snowden a debt of gratitude.""

Obama has refused any characterization of Snowden as a ""whistle-blower"" or ""patriot,"" telling reporters there were ""other avenues"" the former National Security Agency contractor could have taken instead of leaking national security surveillance information.

The president said Snowden's leaks came in ""dribs and drabs,"" giving a false general impression that ""we are somehow out there willy-nilly sucking information from everybody.""

At the same time, Obama sought to assure the public that there are safeguards in place, while acknowledging the need for transparency.

Among the steps being taken, according to the president: Working with Congress to pursue appropriate improvements of the telephone data program; reforming the secret court that approves that initiative; improving transparency to provide as much information as possible to the public, including the legal rationale for government collection activities; and appointing a high-level, independent group of outside experts to review surveillance technologies.

Snowden stepped forward publicly in June to claim responsibility for leaking to the media that the NSA had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the United States. The agency also collected information from U.S. companies on the Internet activity of overseas residents, he said.

Snowden fled first to China and then to Russia before Moscow granted him temporary asylum despite pressure from the Obama administration to return him to the United States to face charges.

He has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, for the leaks.

If Snowden believes his actions were right, ""he can appear before a court with a lawyer and make his case,"" the president said.

Snowden and others have contended that he did America and the world a service by revealing information on secret programs, which they say wrongly impinge on people's right to privacy in furtively giving too much information to the U.S. government.

""The simple fact is that without Snowden's disclosures, no one would know about the programs and no reforms could take place,"" Assange said.

Assange released the statement from Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he sought refuge to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over alleged sex crimes."

(CNN) —

Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who spilled U.S. surveillance secrets to the world, is a “free man” biding his time in a Moscow airport, Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters Tuesday.

Putin said Snowden – who flew to Moscow from Hong Kong on Sunday – is in the “transit area” of Sheremetyevo International Airport, the zone between arrival gates and Russia’s passport control checkpoints. While he said Russia won’t hand Snowden over to the United States, he seemed eager to have the focus of international intrigue off his hands.

“The sooner he selects his final destination point, the better both for us and for himself,” Putin said from Finland of Snowden, who is wanted by U.S. officials on espionage charges for disclosing classified details of U.S. surveillance programs.

Putin’s comments end, for now at least, the international pastime of “Where’s Snowden?” There have been rumors for days that the former NSA contractor had perhaps duped the world into thinking he was in Moscow to throw pursuers off his trail as he seeks a safe haven from U.S. prosecution.

Kristinn Hrafnsson – a spokesman for WikiLeaks, an organization that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information and has one of its members with Snowden in Russia – told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday only that Snowden “is in a safe place and is comfortable and possibly simply relaxing after a very stressful week.”

Noting the United States and Russia do not have an extradition agreement, Putin said Snowden can’t be turned over to U.S. authorities and has committed no crimes on Russian soil.

But he also said Russian security forces have not been “working with” Snowden and expressed hope that the incident would not “affect the cordial nature of our relations with the U.S.” Hrafnsson offered a similar story, saying there’s been “no cooperation or coordination with the Russian authority” before or since Snowden arrived in Moscow.

A senior Obama administration official called Putin’s comments “potentially positive” while reiterating hopes that Snowden would be expelled from Russia and returned to the United States.

U.S. officials believe Russian authorities have a “clear legal basis to expel Mr. Snowden, based on the status of his travel documents and the pending charges against him,” National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said.

Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking to reporters while traveling in Saudi Arabia, said the United States isn’t looking to Russia to enforce U.S. law, only to “allow him to be subject to the laws of our land and our Constitution.”

“We are not looking for confrontation, we’re not ordering anybody,” Kerry said. “We’re simply requesting under a very normal procedure for the transfer of somebody, just as we transferred to Russia seven people in the last two years that they requested, that we did without any clamor, without any rancor, without any argument and according to our sense of the appropriateness of meeting their request.”

Snowden left Hong Kong on Sunday after a couple of weeks spent doling out details of classified U.S. intelligence programs to journalists.

With his passport revoked by U.S. officials, Snowden traveled out of the semiautonomous Chinese territory on refugee papers issued by Ecuador, one of the countries from which he is seeking asylum.

International tiff

His travels have sparked international dust-ups, with U.S. officials accusing China of making a “deliberate choice” to let Snowden go free and criticizing Russia for failing to hand him over in a spirit of international cooperation.

Measured tones mask Washington’s fury with Hong Kong over Snowden

On Tuesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman rejected the U.S. claims as “unreasonable,” according to the official Xinhua news service.

“The accusation that the U.S. side made against the Central Government of China fell short of proof. The Chinese side will absolutely not accept it,” spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.

Rimsky Yuen Kwok-keung, Hong Kong’s justice secretary, likewise denied that authorities there intentionally let Snowden leave before acting on U.S. requests.

“All along, we acted fully in accordance with the law and any suggestion that we have been deliberately letting Mr. Snowden go away or to do any other thing to obstruct the normal operation is totally untrue,” Yuen said Tuesday.

Authorities in Hong Kong were seeking answers from U.S. authorities around when Snowden left, the justice secretary added. Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-Ying said Monday that authorities acted independently from Beijing “to follow procedural fairness and procedural justice.”

In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the U.S. complaints “absolutely groundless and unacceptable.”

“I want to say, right away, that we have nothing to do with Mr. Snowden or his movements around the world,” Lavrov said.

The White House is eager to avoid a repeat of what happened in Hong Kong, where authorities let Snowden leave despite a U.S. request for his arrest and extradition. Washington has described that move as a “serious setback” to building trust between the United States and China.

Lawmakers say tenuous ties shaken further as Snowden lands in Russia

But the Obama administration doesn’t have much leverage with Moscow, said Matthew Rojansky, an expert on U.S. and Russian national security at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

“We really need Russian cooperation, I think, much more in most areas than the Russians need us,” he said.

4 options for the U.S. to get Snowden back

U.S. diplomatic headache

Washington is also telling other countries where Snowden might end up – notably Ecuador, which says it’s analyzing an asylum request from Snowden – that they should hand him over if he lands on their soil. They note that his U.S. passport has been revoked.

“The U.S. is advising these governments that Mr. Snowden is wanted on felony charges and as such should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than is necessary to return him here to the United States,” Carney said.

One rumored destination is Venezuela, whose leaders have been frequently at odds with Washington in recent years.

According to the AVN state news agency, President Nicolas Maduro said Tuesday his country has not received a formal request for political asylum from Snowden. But if it did, the government would consider it on humanitarian grounds, the agency reports.

In its quest to get Snowden, the United States has limited options. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the issue now “is much more of a political and diplomatic matter than it is a legal matter.”

“In an ordinary case, sure, you need a passport to get around,” Toobin said. “But here, where this case is causing increasing embarrassment for the United States, governments that want the United States to be embarrassed are only too happy to waive some of the technical legal rules.”

The leak controversy

Snowden has acknowledged he leaked classified documents about the NSA’s surveillance programs to the Guardian newspaper in Britain and The Washington Post.

The documents revealed the existence of programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of people overseas residents.

The disclosures shook the U.S. intelligence community and raised questions about whether the NSA is eroding American civil liberties.

Snowden worked as a Hawaii-based computer network administrator for Booz Allen Hamilton, an NSA contractor, before he fled to Hong Kong last month with laptops full of confidential information.

The South China Morning Post newspaper published a story Monday quoting Snowden as saying he took the job to gather evidence on U.S. surveillance programs.

He told the Guardian that he exposed the surveillance programs because they pose a threat to democracy, but administration officials said the programs are vital to preventing terrorist attacks and are overseen by all three branches of government.

Carney questioned Snowden’s assertion that he acted in defense of democratic transparency, saying his argument “is belied by the protectors he has potentially chosen – China, Russia, Ecuador.”

“His failures to criticize these regimes suggests that his true motive throughout has been to injure the national security of the United States, not to advance Internet freedom and free speech,” Carney told reporters.

Snowden’s search

Snowden is seeking asylum from Ecuador, Iceland and other, unspecified countries, a WikiLeaks attorney said Monday.

Interactive: En route with Snowden

Ecuador has already given WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange freedom if he can find a way out of the country’s embassy in London.

In his aslyum request read by Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo, Snowden compared himself to Pvt. Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier accused of leaking classified information through WikiLeaks.

He said U.S. officials have treated Manning inhumanely by holding him in solitary confinement, and he predicted a similar “cruel and unusual” fate for himself if he falls into U.S. hands.

Snowden has come under some criticism for seeking out help from nations with questionable histories on free speech and press freedom.

For instance, The Committee to Protect Journalists has criticized Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa’s government for pushing legislation that would roll back press freedoms, calling its policies increasingly repressive.

Snowden isn’t looking for “political nirvana,” said Glenn Greenwald, the columnist for the Guardian who broke his revelations.

“He’s searching for a place where he can be safe and remain free and participate in the debate, and Ecuador seems to be the place he has chosen,” Greenwald told CNN’s “The Lead.”

Some have speculated Snowden has “doomsday insurance” in the form of even more top-secret U.S. documents that will go public if he’s ever detained by U.S. authorities.

Hrafnsson, the WikiLeaks spokesman, said he didn’t know about Snowden’s specific plans, but did suggest more secrets may be revealed.

“This is simply information that should be out in the public,” he said. “There is more to come.”

At a brief news conference Saturday, Hong Kong Police Commissioner Andy Tsang said only that the matter would be handled according to law, and refused to answer a question about whether Snowden was in a police “safe house.” After initially spending time in a Hong Kong hotel, Snowden reportedly moved to a private residence in the territory of 10 million, which has its own legal system apart from the mainland’s.

Hong Kong and the U.S. have a treaty that allows for extraditions; however, there are several scenarios under which Snowden might avoid being returned to the United States. The treaty carries an exception for political offenses; some experts say espionage cases could certainly be regarded as political. Snowden could also file an asylum claim.

PHOTOS: Famous document-leakers in history

According to Simon N.M. Young, director of the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, once Hong Kong receives a formal request for Snowden’s surrender, the territory’s chief executive, C.Y. Leung, must issue what’s known as an authority to proceed.

Hypothetically, Leung could refuse to issue such an authority -- if, for instance, he determines that this would violate Hong Kong law. Hong Kong authorities can’t honor the extradition request unless they have some statute in their own law that corresponds with a violation of U.S. law.

Snowden has been charged with theft of government property and two violations of the Espionage Act: unauthorized communication of national defense information and providing U.S. classified intelligence to an unauthorized person.

Once an authority to proceed is issued by Leung, a magistrate can issue an arrest warrant; in exceptional cases, a provisional arrest warrant may be issued without an authority to proceed.

Were Snowden to be detained, Young said, bail is difficult to obtain. He would then go before a magistrate for “committal proceedings” -- during which the judge essentially assesses whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant Snowden’s trial.

If the magistrate finds there is insufficient cause to surrender Snowden, or determines that doing so would violate Hong Kong law, Snowden could be freed. If the magistrate finds in favor of sending Snowden back to the United States, Snowden could appeal.

Concurrently, Snowden could also file an asylum claim, arguing that he faces political persecution, punishment that would constitute torture, or punishment that is cruel, inhuman or degrading.

“If he goes through the entire process and fights every issue, it certainly could be prolonged,” Young said. “The extent to which he’s willing and able to do that, it’s unclear.”

Jeffrey Smith of The Center for Public Integrity pens a must-share piece about the waste, fraud and abuse that was ""commonplace"" in the Iraq reconstruction effort. A report by Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction Stuart W. Bowen Jr. has found that ""contracting abuses and mismanagement that wasted at least $8 billion of the $60 billion spent by Washington on Iraq’s postwar recovery"":



James Jeffrey, the U.S. ambassador in Iraq from 2010 to 2012, told Bowen that “the U.S. reconstruction money used to build up Iraq was not effective. ... We didn’t get much in return.” [...] The biggest footprint Americans left behind, most of these Iraqi officials said, was more corruption and widespread money laundering. Such a huge investment “could have brought great change in Iraq,” Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said, but the gains were often “lost.” [...] An Iraqi government watchdog agency, the Board of Supreme Audit, noted last year that $800 million in profits from illicit activities was being transferred out of Iraq each week, effectively stripping $40 billion annually from the economy, according to Bowen’s report.

Dollar estimates of the combined war costs range from $1.4 trillion to $4 trillion spent and obligated, or a bill of between $4,500 and $12,742 for every man, woman and child in the U.S. The human cost and death toll are immense. It is estimated that between 225,000 to more than 1 million have been killed when we take into account all the lives lost in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. To this tragedy are added the tens of thousands who came home injured, with similar numbers of injured in the war-zone countries. Significant brain and spinal injuries to coalition forces approach 20 percent, and 30 percent of soldiers suffer from PTSD. The costs of treating these problems will continue for decades to come.

On Tuesday, at this 10th anniversary of the American Invasion of Iraq, we would do well to remind ourselves about some painful facts. [...] [T]he leaders of the Bush administration were intent on invading from the beginning of their time in the White House. When the 9-11 attacks occurred, Bush cabinet members immediately discussed how that tragedy could be used to justify an invasion. Bush himself asked me to try to pin the blame for 9-11 on Iraq.

Robert F. Dodge , in a guest column at the Times of Trenton, reflects on the costs of the war:Former advisor Richard Clarke on the Bush administration's breach of trust: The Daily Beast has a slideshow of the most iconic images of the Iraq War.

Newsweek correspondent Scott C. Johnson recalls in stirring details of his convoy being attacked. ""The possibility of death became real,"" he writes, when his car flipped over and he was trapped inside:



I was wearing military-issue boots that I had picked up at a store in Kuwait City. I kicked, and the window didn’t budge. I kept kicking. I kicked until I saw a crack, then another. A web began to form. I kicked as hard as I could; I kicked the s--t out of that window. A small hole began to form, a tiny thing at the center of the web, and I kicked it until it became about as big as my head. I could hear the attackers shouting nearby. The firing continued. I heard feet. I heard the click of chambers, the dumping of bags, running, panting, breathing.

Imagine that in the rush toward war with Iraq, the sales pitch had gone like this: ""We must put our troops in harm's way to depose a brutal dictator, Saddam Hussein, and give Iraqis a chance at democracy. This will not be easy. It will take eight years, cost the lives of 4,488 U.S. troops and leave tens of thousands more grievously injured. Al-Qaeda will gain a new foothold, and the civil war we unleash will kill more than 100,000 Iraqis. We will spend $3 trillion, our war in Afghanistan will be orphaned and the big winner will be Iran. But Iraq will be a better place."" That, of course, is an assessment of the war Tuesday on the 10th anniversary of the invasion. The outcome could not have been known with such precision in advance. But if history has made anything obvious, it is that the Bush administration used false premises to peddle the war.

After the war, some of the United States’ leading newspapers were forced to apologize for getting it so wrong. But two reporters consistently got it right: Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel, former Knight Ridder reporters for the McClatchy newspapers. In an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour marking the tenth anniversary of the Iraq War, they cited reporters’ access to top officials in Washington as one of the top problems. The top-level bureaucrats, they said, had more of a propensity to spin toward the line that the Bush Administration was pushing."

http://news.yahoo.com/nsa-leaker-39-mission-39-already-accomplished-39-033430455--politics.html,,[],NSA leaker: 'Mission's already accomplished',"WASHINGTON (AP) — After six months when he was rarely heard from except through the documents he leaked, fugitive former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden says his ""mission's already accomplished"" after leaking NSA secrets that have caused a reassessment of U.S. surveillance policies.

Snowden told The Washington Post in an interview published online Monday night that he was satisfied because journalists have been able to tell the story of the government's collection of bulk Internet and phone records, an activity that has grown dramatically in the decade since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

""For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already accomplished,"" he said. ""I already won.""

""As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated,"" Snowden told the Post. ""Because, remember, I didn't want to change society. I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself.""

NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines offered no comment on the interview Tuesday, nor did the State Department. White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said via email Tuesday: ""Mr. Snowden faces felony charges here in the United States and should be returned to the U.S. as soon as possible, where he will be afforded due process and all the protections of our criminal justice system.""

President Barack Obama hinted Friday that he would consider some changes to NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records to address the public's concern about privacy. His comments came in a week in which a federal judge declared the NSA's collection program probably was unconstitutional. A presidential advisory panel has suggested 46 changes to NSA operations.

Snowden was interviewed in Moscow over two days by Post reporter Barton Gellman, who has received numerous leaks from Snowden. The interview was conducted six months after Snowden's revelations first appeared in the Post and Britain's Guardian newspaper.

Story continues

Gellman described Snowden as relaxed and animated over two days of nearly unbroken conversation, fueled by burgers, pasta, ice cream and Russian pastry.

In June, the Justice Department unsealed a criminal complaint charging Snowden, a former NSA contractor, with espionage and felony theft of government property. Russia granted him temporary asylum five months ago.

The effects of Snowden's revelations have been evident in the courts, Congress, Silicon Valley and capitals around the world, where even U.S. allies have reacted angrily to reports of U.S. monitoring of their leaders' cellphone calls. Brazil and members of the European Union are considering ways to better protect their data and U.S. technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Yahoo are looking at ways to block the collection of data by the government.

Snowden, now 30, said he is not being disloyal to the U.S. or to his former employer.

""I am not trying to bring down the NSA, I am working to improve the NSA,"" he said. ""I am still working for the NSA right now. They are the only ones who don't realize it.""

Snowden is scheduled to speak again to the public this week, when he delivers the annual ""Alternative Christmas Message"" on Wednesday for Britain's Channel 4, in a slot typically reserved for provocative or offbeat addresses."

From The Nation:



“I don’t want these individuals to die,” Obama told reporters on April 30, adding that “the Pentagon is trying to manage the situation as best as they can.” He also recommitted to closing Guantánamo, calling on Congress to “step up and help.” It’s true that lawmakers on both sides have fought hard to make transfers impossible. But Obama’s words ignored how his own policies set the stage for the crisis. “He has said the right thing before,” Guantánamo lawyer Pardiss Kebriaei of the Center for Constitutional Rights told The Nation. “It’s time now for action.” The CCR is calling on Obama to end his “self-imposed moratorium” on releasing Yemenis and resume prisoner transfers. It has also called for Obama to appoint a senior official to “shepherd the process of closure.” As the hunger strike approaches its hundredth day on May 17, more than 100 of Guantánamo’s 166 prisoners are refusing food. The president must start living up to his rhetoric about closing the prison, the CCR warns, or “the men who are on hunger strike will die, and he will be ultimately responsible for their deaths.”

Some progress has been made. The detainee population is down to 166 from a peak of nearly 800. Of the prisoners who remain, 46 are deemed too dangerous to let go but impossible to prosecute, even under the looser standards of military commissions, for lack of evidence or because evidence is compromised by torture. If released or repatriated, there's a high probability they'd resume jihad. What to do with this group — prisoners of war in a war without end — is a question with no satisfactory answer. They have to be held. But both Obama and Congress could do more to winnow down the rest, including 86 prisoners cleared for transfer three years ago who remain incarcerated. If Obama is still serious about closing Guantanamo, there are obvious steps he can take, many without congressional assent.

He specifically mentioned Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan and Egypt as nations, alongside unspecified ""others,"" that the U.S. will defend. Those others likely would include Israel, the strongest U.S. ally in the region.

""The United States will be there for the defense of our friends and our allies,"" Kerry told reporters in Cairo. ""We will not allow those countries to be attacked from outside. We will stand with them.""

Kerry spoke during the first stop on his trip to the Middle East, Europe and North Africa.

After Egypt, he headed later Sunday to Saudi Arabia, where the biggest rifts with the Obama administration have emerged.

Saudi officials have complained that the United States did not follow through on its threat to punish Syrian President Bashar Assad with military strikes for his government's use of chemical weapons. The Saudis also have watched warily as President Barack Obama has opened a tentative rapprochement with Iran, Saudi Arabia's archrival.

Kerry acknowledged U.S. divisions with Gulf nations over Syria and Iran, but he played down those differences. He said some countries do differ with U.S. ""tactics"" in Syria.

""There may some differences on a tactic here and there,"" he said. But he said they all agree on the goal of ending the fighting and forming an interim government.

""We can have a difference on a policy, on the tactics of the policy,"" he said. ""For instance, there are some countries in the region that wanted the United States to do one thing with respect to Syria and we have done something else.""

He stressed, though, that ""those differences on an individual tactic on a policy do not create a difference on the fundamental goal of the policy. We all share the same goal that we have discussed, that is the salvation of the state of Syria and a transition government put in place ... that can give the people of Syria the opportunity to choose their future.""

Story continues

Kerry added that that the United States would never allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. The administration is seeking a pause from the U.S. Congress in putting in place fresh penalties against Iran, in order to provide flexibility in negotiations.

A new round of nuclear talks between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany is set to begin Thursday in Geneva.

""Iran will not get a nuclear weapon,"" he said. ""That is a promise by the president of the United States."""

In a letter to congressional leaders, Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said the administration had deliberately killed Anwar Awlaki, a radical Muslim cleric who was slain in September 2011 in Yemen, but had killed three other Americans inadvertently.

They include Samir Khan, an Al Qaeda propagandist who grew up in Queens, N.Y., and who was killed in the car with Awlaki, and Awlaki’s 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman, who was born in Denver and killed in Yemen two weeks later. The previously unknown fourth was Jude Mohammed, who lived in Raleigh, N.C., and was killed in November 2011 in Pakistan.

“These individuals were not specifically targeted by the United States,” Holder wrote.

The development raises the stakes for the policy speech Obama is scheduled to deliver Thursday at the National Defense University. He is facing growing public pressure to explain the use of drone missile strikes to kill suspected terrorists around the globe, and to outline his evolving strategy against a weakened Al Qaeda.

Obama, who personally approves individual CIA drone strikes in some cases, has never publicly explained the legal framework his administration uses to select who is targeted and what evidence is considered and why. The highly classified program receives congressional oversight but no apparent judicial review.

The fact that drones have killed four Americans and that only one, Awlaki, was specifically targeted suggests the process is not as precise as officials have suggested.

Korea, jihadist groups top U.S. threats","Story highlights Director of national intelligence gave a report to Congress Clapper says the Internet is increasingly being used as a tool by nations and terror groups North Korea's rhetoric is an ""indicator of their attitude'' and ''intent,'' the director says

(CNN) —

Cyberattacks pose more of a threat to the United States than a land-based attack by a terrorist group, while North Korea’s development of a nuclear weapons program poses a “serious threat,” the director of national intelligence told Congress on Tuesday.

The warning by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper came in his annual report to Congress on the threats facing the United States.

“Attacks, which might involve cyber and financial weapons, can be deniable and unattributable,” Clapper said in prepared remarks before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. “Destruction can be invisible, latent and progressive.”

The Internet is increasingly being used as a tool both by nations and terror groups to achieve their objectives, according to Clapper’s report.

However, there is only a “remote chance” of a major cyberattack on the United States that would cause widespread disruptions, such as regional power outages, the report says. Most countries or groups don’t have the capacity to pull it off.

While Clapper emphasized possible cyberthreats, committee members raised questions about the potential nuclear dangers posed by North Korea and Iran, the increasing prevalence of al Qaeda in Syria and the effect of cuts to the U.S. budget on intelligence activities.

President Obama cracks whip on cybercrime

’Belligerent rhetoric’

Angered by U.N. Security Council sanctions over its nuclear test, North Korea threatened for the first time to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the United States and South Korea.

Even by North Korean standards, the threat of a nuclear strike and the scrapping of a 1953 truce that effectively ended the Korean War have been incredibly provocative, Clapper said.

“The rhetoric, while it is propaganda laced, is also an indicator of their attitude and perhaps their intent,” he said, adding he was concerned what, if any, provocative action North Korea would take against its southern neighbor.

Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, quizzed Clapper about what, if any, deterrence, works with North Korea and Iran, who have been slapped with numerous U.N. Security Council sanctions over the development of a nuclear program.

“Mutually assured destruction? Are they responsive to that kind of rational thinking that has guided U.S. policy for 50 years? Are these countries like the (former) Soviet Union, that we can have some confidence that they’re gonna make a rational decision knowing that if they do something crazy they are going to be wiped out?” King asked.

Clapper told the committee he believed that both North Korea and Iran understand that.

North Korea, for whatever reason, believes the United States would use a nuclear weapon against it, Clapper said.

“They certainly respect the capability for our military,” he said.

“They’ve gone to school on what we’ve done starting with Desert Storm. I know that for a fact. So I think deterrence in this broadest context does work and does have impact on decision-making calculus of those these two countries.”

Opinion: Have the courage to deal with cyber war

Al Qaeda’s influence in Syria

Clapper also warned the committee that Syria’s chemical weapons program has the potential to inflict mass causalities.

“It adds to our concern that the increasingly beleaguered regime, having found its escalation of violence through conventional means inadequate, might be prepared to use the chemical weapons against the Syrian people,” he said.

He said the obvious question is how long embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad can hang on to power. Syria has been mired in a civil war for more than two years.

“And our standard answer is his days are numbered. We just don’t know the number,” he told the committee.

“I think our assessment is, he is very committed to hanging in there and sustaining control of the regime.”

Perhaps the bigger concern is the rising influence and strength of the al-Nusra Front, an “al Qaeda in Iraq” offshoot, among the Syrian rebels, he said.

The potential of the core of al Qaeda to “launch a coordinated, massive attack” against the United States, according to Clapper, has diminished, while the global jihadist movement is more decentralized and, therefore, more of a threat.

“Lone wolves, domestic extremists and jihadist-inspired groups remain determined to attack Western interests as they’ve done most recently in Libya and Algeria.”

The threat assessment describes an environment where jihadist terrorists are increasingly decentralized, creating challenges for the prevention of attacks.

Al Qaeda vs. jihadist groups

Many of these groups have gained a foothold in the Arab Spring countries, where a spike in threats to U.S. interests has been recorded, the threat assessment report said.

“The dispersed and decentralized nature of the terrorist networks (that are) active in the region highlights that the threat to U.S. and Western interests overseas is more likely to be unpredictable,” it states.

It cites the Benghazi, Libya, attack that killed four Americans, and an attack on an Algerian oil field as examples of how splinter groups or individuals with jihadist sympathies can act, even without direction from higher in the terrorist chain, Clapper told the committee.

Iran: Haven or prison for al Qaeda?

’Cyberespionage and cyberattacks’

For the first time, the emphasis of Clapper’s report was on cyberthreats, in the form of cyberattacks or cyberespionage.

Already, foreign intelligence and security services have “penetrated numerous computer networks” in the United States belonging to the government and private sector alike, the report says.

Although classified networks have been targeted, the majority of these attacks have involved unclassified networks, it states.

The United States has enjoyed a technological edge over other nations, but advances in information technology and business practices are evening the playing field, according to the report.

“This is almost certainly allowing our adversaries to close the technological gap between our respective militaries, slowly neutralizing one of our key advantages in the international arena,” it said.

However, there is only a “remote chance” of a major cyberattack on the United State that would cause widespread disruptions, such as regional power outages, the report says. Most countries or groups don’t have the capacity to pull it off.

The report names China and Russia as two of the most “advanced cyber actors,” but says they are unlikely to launch an attack.

Obama administration takes on hackers stealing trade secrets

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/23/key-suspects-in-benghazi-terror-attack-were-working-with-al-qaeda-senior/,2013-10-23 00:00:00,['Catherine Herridge'],"EXCLUSIVE: Key suspects in Benghazi attack include former courier, bodyguard for Al Qaeda, sources say","At least two of the key suspects in the Benghazi terror attack were at one point working with Al Qaeda senior leadership, sources familiar with the investigation tell Fox News.

The sources said one of the suspects was believed to be a courier for the Al Qaeda network, and the other a bodyguard in Afghanistan prior to the 2001 terror attacks.

The direct ties to the Al Qaeda senior leadership undercut early characterizations by the Obama administration that the attackers in Benghazi were isolated “extremists"" -- not Al Qaeda terrorists -- with no organizational structure or affiliation.

The head of the House Intelligence Committee, Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., who receives regular intelligence briefings and whose staffers continue to investigate the Benghazi terrorist attack, would not discuss specific suspects or their backgrounds.

But he said the ties to Al Qaeda senior leadership, also known as Al Qaeda core, are now established.

More On This...

“It is accurate that of the group being targeted by the bureau, at this point, there’s strong Al Qaeda ties,” Rogers told Fox News. ""You can still be considered to have strong ties because you are in the ring of operations of Al Qaeda core. ... There are individuals that certainly fit that definition.""

Counterterrorism expert Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News that investigators are finding ""more and more ties -- not just to Al Qaeda's branch in North Africa ... but Al Qaeda senior leadership in Pakistan.""

A year ago, Fox News' Bret Baier was first to report that a former Guantanamo detainee, Sufian bin Qumu, was suspected of training jihadists in eastern Libya for the attack.

Now, sources tell Fox News that Benghazi suspect Faraj al Chalabi, also a Libyan national whose ties to Usama bin Laden date back to 1998, is believed to be a former bodyguard who was with the Al Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan in 2001.

After the Benghazi attack, al Chalabi fled to Pakistan where reports suggest he was held, then later returned to Libyan custody and eventually released. He was first publicly identified as a suspected terrorist in 1998 by the regime of former Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi for his alleged role in the murder of a German intelligence official, Silvan Becker and his wife. An Interpol arrest warrant in March 1998 named al Chalabi, two other Libyans and bin Laden as the likely perpetrators.

“Our sources say al Chalabi is suspected of bringing materials from the compound to Benghazi to Al Qaeda senior leadership in Pakistan. It's not clear what those materials consisted of but he is known to have gone back to Pakistan immediately after the attack,” Joscelyn said.

Separately, and for the first time, Rogers laid out a timeline for the attack which suggests significant advance planning. According to the congressman, there was an “aspirational phase” several months out, where the idea of an attack was thrown around, followed by “weeks” of operational planning, and then the ramp up to the Sept. 11 assault which lasted up to several days. This assessment is in stark contrast to initial administration statements that the attack was “spontaneous” and achieved with little planning.

“I believe that they had an operational phase that lasted at least a couple of weeks, maybe even longer. And then an initiation phase that lasted a couple or three days prior to the event itself. And so this notion that they just showed up and decided this was a spontaneous act does not comport with the information at least with what we have seen in the intelligence community,” Rogers told Fox News.

Some counterterrorism analysts concur with Roger’s assessment, describing the mortars used to strike the CIA annex in the second wave of the attack as ""smoking gun"" evidence -- as mortars require skill to fire, and typically must be pre-positioned to ensure accuracy. On Sept. 11, two mortars struck the CIA annex, killing former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.

The opposing analysis is that the mortars were set in the early morning hours of Sept. 11, and that the terrorists did not bring equipment with them that suggests significant planning.

Fox News contacted the FBI which is in the lead on the Benghazi investigation, as well as the CIA and the National Counterterrorism Center, or NCTC. Both the NCTC and the CIA declined to comment. There was no immediate response from the FBI."
http://news.yahoo.com/seymour-hersh-alleges-obama-administration-lied-syria-gas-204437397.html,,[],Seymour Hersh Alleges Obama Administration Lied on Syria Gas Attack,"Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh has dropped yet another bombshell allegation: President Obama wasn't honest with the American people when he blamed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for a sarin-gas attack in that killed hundreds of civilians.

In early September, Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States had proof that the nerve-gas attack was made on Assad's orders. ""We know the Assad regime was responsible,"" President Obama told the nation in an address days after this revelation, which he said pushed him over the ""red line"" in considering military intervention.

But in a long story published Sunday for the London Review of Books, Hersh — best known for his exposés on the cover-ups of the My Lai Massacre and of Abu Ghraib – said the administration ""cherry-picked intelligence,"" citing conversations with intelligence and military officials.

A former senior intelligence official told me that the Obama administration had altered the available information – in terms of its timing and sequence – to enable the president and his advisers to make intelligence retrieved days after the attack look as if it had been picked up and analysed in real time, as the attack was happening. The distortion, he said, reminded him of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, when the Johnson administration reversed the sequence of National Security Agency intercepts to justify one of the early bombings of North Vietnam. The same official said there was immense frustration inside the military and intelligence bureaucracy: ‘The guys are throwing their hands in the air and saying, “How can we help this guy” – Obama – “when he and his cronies in the White House make up the intelligence as they go along?”’

Here's what Hersh alleges:

The administration buried intelligence on the fundamentalist group/rebel group al-Nusra. It was seen, Hersh says, as an alarming threat by May, with the U.S. being aware of al-Nusra member able to make and use sarin, and yet the group – associated with the rebel opposition in Syria – was never considered a suspect in the sarin attacks. Hersh refers to a top-secret June cable sent to the deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency that said al-Nusra could acquire and use sarin. But the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Office of the Defense Intelligence Agency could not find the document in question, even when given its specific codes.

Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, told a press conference: ‘It’s very important to note that only the [Assad] regime possesses sarin, and we have no evidence that the opposition possesses sarin.’ It is not known whether the highly classified reporting on al-Nusra was made available to Power’s office, but her comment was a reflection of the attitude that swept through the administration.

The administration was learning about the attack at roughly the same speed civilians were. Hersh says the thorough daily intelligence briefings in the days surrounding the gas attack did not make a single mention of Syria, even as videos and photos of the attack went viral across the Internet. He added that there was revealed a sensor system in Syria that had, in December 2012, shown sarin production at a chemical weapons depot arranged by the Syrian army. Though it was unclear whether this was a simulation or not – all militaries, Hersh says, practice simulations of such things – Obama promptly warned Syria that use of sarin gas would be ""unacceptable.""

‘If what the sensors saw last December was so important that the president had to call and say, “Knock it off,” why didn’t the president issue the same warning three days before the gas attack in August?’

The media succumbed to confirmation bias in response to a UN report on the attack. That report, which is less than certain in its terms, said that the spent weapon ""indicatively matches"" the specifics of a 330mm calibre artillery rocket. MIT professor Theodore Postol and other munitions experts later reviewed the photos and said that it was improvised, likely made locally, didn't match anything in the Syrian arsenal and would not have been able to travel the nine kilometres from the Syrian army base that the media presumed it was fired from.

Postol and a colleague, Richard M. Lloyd, published an analysis two weeks after 21 August in which they correctly assessed that the rockets involved carried a far greater payload of sarin than previously estimated. The Times reported on that analysis at length, describing Postol and Lloyd as ‘leading weapons experts’. The pair’s later study about the rockets’ flight paths and range, which contradicted previous Times reporting, was emailed to the newspaper last week; it has so far gone unreported.

Though a UN resolution nullified the chances of American military intervention, the impact would be significant if the allegations hold up; recall that President George W. Bush's legacy was deeply tainted by charges that the U.S. had no proof of nuclear weapons in Iraq when they said they did. Hersh hints at the seriousness of the charges himself: ""The cherry-picking was similar to the process used to justify the Iraq war.""

Two U.S. senators say Dzhokar Tsarnaev should be questioned without a lawyer

Federal terrorism charges against Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev could be filed soon, even as he remains hospitalized, a Justice Department official told CNN on Saturday. The 19-year-old could also face murder charges at the state level.

At the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where Tsarnaev was in serious condition while being held in federal custody, federal prosecutors were formulating the charges.

The development came amid questions as to what's next for the suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings.

""There are still many unanswered questions,"" Obama said Friday night. ""Why did these young men who grew up and studied here as part of our communities and our country resort to such violence? How did they plan and carry out these attacks? And did they receive any help? The families of those killed so senselessly deserve answers.""

Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are accused of setting off bombs at the marathon Monday, killing three people and wounding more than 170.

On Thursday night, they allegedly killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer before the older brother was killed during a shootout with police.

Dzhokar Tsarnaev was captured Friday night after he was found hiding in a boat in a backyard in Watertown, Massachusetts.

When will the suspect be in court?

Tsarnaev could be in a courtroom for an arraignment soon.

Ordinarily at an arraignment, the suspect is provided a lawyer, and the defense and prosecution try to make a case for whether he should be released on bail.

""He will not get bail obviously,"" said senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.

""They will set a preliminary hearing that could happen in the next 30 days. He will be indicted with the grand jury. And that's when the case will begin.""

After the charges are filed, the Federal Public Defender Office in Boston will be appointed to represent Tsarnaev, according to Miriam Conrad, the federal public defender for the Massachusetts district.

Should bomber suspect be questioned without a lawyer?

For now, the government is invoking the public safety exception, a designation that allows investigators to question Tsarnaev without reading him his Miranda rights, a Justice Department official told CNN on condition of anonymity.

In ordinary cases, a suspect is told by police he has the right to remain silent and he has the right to a lawyer.

But this is not an ordinary case, say U.S. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham.

They urged that Tsarnaev be held as an ""enemy combatant,"" a designation that allows a suspect to be questioned without a lawyer and without being informed of his Miranda rights.

""Now that the suspect is in custody, the last thing we should want is for him to remain silent. It is absolutely vital the suspect be questioned for intelligence gathering purposes,"" the senators said. ""Under the law of war we can hold this suspect as a potential enemy combatant not entitled to Miranda warnings or the appointment of counsel.""

But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Saturday that the suspect should not be held as an enemy combatant.

""I am not aware of any evidence so far that the Boston suspect is part of any organized group, let alone al Qaeda, the Taliban, or one of their affiliates -- the only organizations whose members are subject to detention under the Authorization for Use of Military Force, as it has been consistently interpreted by all three branches of our government,"" he said.

""In the absence of such evidence I know of no legal basis for his detention as an enemy combatant. To hold the suspect as an enemy combatant under these circumstances would be contrary to our laws and may even jeopardize our efforts to prosecute him for his crimes.""

Alan Dershowitz, a prominent defense attorney and Harvard law professor, scoffed at the Republican senators' statement.

""Impossible. There's no way an American citizen committing a domestic crime in the city of Boston could be tried as an enemy combatant,"" he told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""It could never happen. And that shows absolute ignorance of the law.""

Dershowitz also said statements made by police in Boston seems to contradict the government's reasons for invoking the public safety exception.

""The police have said there's no public safety issue; it's solved, it's over,"" Dershowitz said. ""There are no further threats. But the FBI is saying there's enough further threats to justify an exception.""

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said the federal government may have known about international threats about which state officials were not aware.

""You would have to know the internals of what they have before you can assess whether there is a sensible invocation or not,"" Giuliani said.

If the government had prior knowledge of Tsarnaev's activities, it hasn't disclosed it. It did say that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been on the FBI's radar in the past

FBI agents interviewed Tamerlan two years ago and also looked at his travel history, checked databases for derogatory information and searched for Web postings. The agency found no connection with terror groups, an FBI official told CNN.

Two key Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee -- Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas, the panel's chairman; and Rep. Peter King of New York -- will press the Obama administration for details about the FBI's questioning of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, according to a GOP congressional source.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was not a U.S. citizen, traveled to Sheremetyevo, Russia, in January 2012, according to travel records provided by a U.S. official. He returned six months later.

Federal or state trial?

Dershowitz said there are many arguments that can be made to try the case in state court. It may be hard for a prosecutor to prove which crimes were committed by Tsarnaev or his older brother, Dershowitz said.

""If he says my intent was to please my brother, they could raise the question of federal jurisdiction,"" Dershowitz said.

This fight over federal or state jurisdiction could mean life or death.

Massachusetts does not have the death penalty.

There's another big question: The National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 requires temporary military custody of certain terrorist suspects, but Dzhokar Tsarnaev is a U.S. citizen, and the act doesn't apply to Americans.

What is the reaction in the suspects' homeland?

Tsarnaev's family lives in the Russian republic of Dagestan, which is next to the suspects' homeland of Chechnya, located in the North Caucasus region of southern Russia.

Russia's investigative committee in Dagestan said it will not engage with the Tsarnaev family unless there is ""an order from above"" to do so, spokesman Rasul Temerbekov told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Saturday.

A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said Saturday that Russia wants to get official information from the United States about the bombing suspects, and he wants there to be contact between investigators in both countries."

Brinley Bruton', 'Nbc News']",Venezuela: Snowden has until Monday to respond to asylum offer,"Venezuelan officials say they have not heard from Edward Snowden since the country offered the professed NSA leaker asylum, but would wait until Monday to hear if he would take up the offer.

“There has not been any type of communication,'' Foreign Minster Elias Jaua said on state television late on Saturday. “We are waiting until Monday to know whether he confirms his wish to take asylum in Venezuela.”

News of the apparent deadline followed the announcement by the president of Bolivia that it was joining Venezuela and Nicaragua in indicating that they would offer asylum to fugitive, who is believed to be hiding inside the transit zone of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport as the United States continues efforts to have him extradited.

Bolivia’s Evo Morales made his offer Saturday, three days after a plane carrying the leftist leader over Europe was rerouted amid reports that Snowden was aboard. The change in flight plan set off a diplomatic storm that heightened tensions between the United States and the South American nation.

President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela both condemned the U.S. spy programs that Snowden revealed and said he deserved protection.

“Who is the guilty one? A young man ... who denounces war plans, or the U.S. government which launches bombs and arms the terrorist Syrian opposition against the people and legitimate President Bashar al-Assad?'' Maduro asked, to applause and cheers from military officers at a parade on Saturday.

Venezuela ""decided to offer humanitarian asylum to the young American Edward Snowden"" so he can live without ""persecution from the empire,"" Maduro said, referring to the U.S. He extended the invitation to Snowden during a speech Friday commemorating the anniversary of Venezuela's independence, according to the Associated Press.

Since winning a presidential vote in April that followed leader Hugo Chavez's death from cancer, Maduro has often criticized the United States, and accused it of plotting to kill him.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers told CNN on Sunday that he “absolutely” thinks one of the South American countries will provide Snowden with travel documents.

Rogers (R-MI) said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that the U.S. should “send a very clear message” to the nations offering Snowden asylum “that we won’t put up with this kind of behavior.”

Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told CNN on Sunday that Snowden’s revelations have hurt U.S. diplomatic relationships and “the importance of trust.”

North Korea warned Seoul on Saturday that the Korean Peninsula had entered ""a state of war."" It also threatened to shut down a border factory complex that is the last major symbol of cooperation between the Koreas.

""We've seen reports of a new and unconstructive statement from North Korea. We take these threats seriously and remain in close contact with our South Korean allies,"" said Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council. ""But, we would also note that North Korea has a long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats, and today's announcement follows that familiar pattern.""

North Korea's threats are seen as part of an effort to provoke the new government in Seoul to change its policies toward Pyongyang, and to win diplomatic talks with Washington that could get it more aid. The moves also are seen as ways to build domestic unity as North Korea's young leader, Kim Jong Un, strengthens his military credentials.

In recent days, the U.S. flew a pair of nuclear-capable B-2 stealth bombers over an uninhabited South Korean island, dropping dummy munitions as part of annual defense drills that North Korea views as rehearsals for an invasion. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also announced that the U.S. will fortify its defenses against a potential North Korean missile attack on the U.S. by adding more than a dozen missile interceptors to the 26 already in place at Fort Greely, Alaska.

North Korea said in a statement Saturday that it would deal with South Korea according to ""wartime regulations"" and would retaliate against any provocations by the U.S. and South Korea without notice.

""Now that the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK have entered into an actual military action, the inter-Korean relations have naturally entered the state of war,"" said the statement, which was carried by the official North Korean news agency and referred to the country by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Story continues

Provocations ""will not be limited to a local war, but develop into an all-out war, a nuclear war,"" the statement said.

The White House has stressed the U.S. government's capability and willingness to defend itself and its allies and interests in the region, if necessary.

""We remain fully prepared and capable of defending and protecting the United States and our allies,"" Hayden said.

Snowden, the fugitive American security contractor granted temporary asylum by Russia, has appealed to Washington to stop treating him like a traitor for revealing that the United States has been eavesdropping on its allies, a German politician who met with Mr. Snowden said on Friday.

Mr. Snowden made his appeal in a letter that was carried to Berlin by Hans-Christian Ströbele, a veteran member of the Green Party in the German Parliament. Mr. Ströbele said he and two journalists for German news outlets met with Mr. Snowden and a person described as his assistant — probably his British aide, Sarah Harrison — at an undisclosed location in or near Moscow on Thursday for almost three hours.

Mr. Ströbele had gone to Moscow to explore whether Mr. Snowden could or would testify before a planned parliamentary inquiry into the eavesdropping. Any arrangements for Mr. Snowden to testify would require significant legal maneuvering, as it seemed unlikely that he would travel to Germany for fear of extradition to the United States.

In his letter, Mr. Snowden, 30, also appealed for clemency. He said his disclosures about American intelligence activity at home and abroad, which he called “systematic violations of law by my government that created a moral duty to act,” have had positive effects."

Sometimes, the internal dynamics of White House debates on military action are cloaked in mystery, emerging years afterward in the memoirs of participants. Other times, the details surface quickly, if someone leaks a version of events. And in some cases, the pictures tell the tale.

Such is the case with the Obama administration’s anguished deliberations over how to respond to the Syrian civil war, the deadly chemical weapons attack outside Damascus last month and the president’s own wrestling with whether to seek Congressional approval for a military strike."

The image was sent to reporters by Tanya Lokshina, a researcher for Human Rights Watch in Russia who was invited to the meeting. The woman seated to Mr. Snowden’s right was Sarah Harrison, a British WikiLeaks activist; at his left was a translator. After the meeting ended, WikiLeaks released a full transcript of Mr. Snowden’s statement to the group and a brief video clip of the meeting was published on a Russian news site.

Video

In the video, obtained by Life News, Mr. Snowden read the beginning of his statement, saying: “A little over one month ago, I had family, a home in paradise, and I lived in great comfort. I also had the capability without any warrant to search for, seize, and read your communications. Anyone’s communications at any time. That is the power to change people’s fates. It is also a serious violation of the law. The 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of my country, Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and numerous statutes and treaties forbid such systems of massive, pervasive surveillance.”

After a pause for translation, he continued, “While the U.S. Constitution marks these programs as illegal, my government argues that secret court rulings —” at which point he was interrupted by an airport announcement, provoking laughter from the room. He commented wryly, “I’ve heard that many times in the last couple of weeks.”

More video of his statement, apparently shot from the same angle, was broadcast on Russian television later.

Ms. Lokshina also revealed that Mr. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, said that he has decided to apply for political asylum in Russia. When asked about Mr. Snowden earlier this month, President Vladimir V. Putin told reporters, “If he wants to stay here, there is one condition: He must cease his work aimed at inflicting damage to our American partners, as strange as it may sound from my lips.” (More information on the meeting, which was still in progress when this post was first published, will be added in updates below as it reaches us via @EllenBarryNYT and other reporters.)

USA TODAY

Mission compared to making Assad eat cereal with a fork instead of a spoon

No Air Force assets included in the mission planning

%22Degrading%22 Syria%27s military is a term of art%2C not a science

WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's choice of the term ""degrade"" to describe an attack on Syria has been interpreted by Pentagon planners as guidance for a limited strike, according to senior military officials.

The weapon of choice is the Tomahawk cruise missile aboard four Navy destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean. Though powerful, the missiles alone would likely not be capable of crippling Bashar Assad's regime, which is accused of using chemical weapons. The targets selected for attack are meant to punish Assad, not swing the tide in favor of rebels seeking his ouster, said a senior officer familiar with the planning.

That officer, another officer with experience in the Middle East and two senior defense officials with knowledge of the planning told USA TODAY the type of weapons that would be used and the type of targets that would be hit. All spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the planning.

The attack would involve launches of missiles solely from ships, according to the two senior officers familiar with the planning. The Air Force can fire missiles from outside Syrian air space but are not expected to take part in the mission, the officers said.

""Degrade"" is not a military textbook term, the four officers and officials said. In other words, it is open to interpretation.

Pentagon press secretary George Little said repeatedly in a briefing Thursday that an attack on Syria would not require U.S. ground troops, or ""boots on the ground."" The mission would be limited to deterring and degrading Assad's ability to use chemical weapons.

The strike would be limited in scope and duration, Little said. The security of chemical weapons stockpiles is being taken into account by the Pentagon.

The strike, as envisioned, would be limited in the number of targets and done within a day or two. It could be completed in one fell swoop with missiles, said one senior official familiar with the weapons involved. A smaller, follow-on strike could be launched if targets aren't sufficiently damaged.

A second senior official, who has seen the most recent planning, offered this metaphor to describe such a strike: If Assad is eating Cheerios, we're going to take away his spoon and give him a fork. Will that degrade his ability to eat Cheerios? Yes. Will it deter him? Maybe. But he'll still be able to eat Cheerios.

The two officers with current and recent service in the Middle East say the term ""degrade"" is so vague that it could be used to describe the effect of a single cruise missile strike.

Hagel, appearing Wednesday on Capitol Hill, said a strike would cost ""tens of millions of dollars."" An operation in that range would likely be limited to the cost of launching missiles from U.S. destroyers cruising within range of Syria, according to budget analysts. The Tomahawk missiles aboard the ships, which generally carry dozens of them, cost about $1.1 million each.

A broader strike, one aimed at destroying Syria's air defenses and creating a no-fly zone, for example, would cost $500 million to establish and $1 billion per month to maintain, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has told Congress in a letter.

Likely targets in a limited strike include Syrian air defenses, said Peter Singer, director of the Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence at the Brookings Institution. Another might be the Syrian Army's Fourth Division, which apparently carried out the chemical attack on Aug. 21 that the Obama administration says killed 1,400 people, Singer said.

Buildings housing headquarters associated with the Syrian military, its intelligence and chemical weapons program are other likely targets."

The strategy, which does not focus exclusively on cyber theft, seeks to improve coordination of existing efforts by U.S. intelligence agencies and the State and Justice departments, but it does not include new penalties or sanctions.

Obama last week signed an executive order for the government to share more classified information about cyber threats with U.S. companies that own or operate crucial infrastructure, including dams and energy and telecommunications facilities.

“We know that trade secret theft can cripple a company’s competitive advantage in foreign markets, diminish export prospects around the globe and put American jobs in jeopardy,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday.

The modest steps were announced a day after computer security company Mandiant Corp. in Alexandria, Va., released a report that says a secretive Chinese military unit has stolen digital blueprints, plans, bidding orders and other sensitive data from at least 141 U.S. and Canadian companies over the last six years. Chinese authorities in Beijing denied any involvement and questioned the report’s veracity.

Carney said the United States and other countries need to develop “an understanding of acceptable behavior in cyberspace.”

“We repeatedly, and will continue to, raise our concerns at the highest levels about cyber theft with senior Chinese officials, including in the military,” he said.

Briefing reporters at the White House, Robert Hormats, undersecretary of State for economic growth, called China’s theft of intellectual property “a serious and highly troubling issue.”

The White House distributed a 2011 report by the National Counterintelligence Executive office, titled “Foreign Spies Stealing U.S. Economic Secrets in Cyberspace,” that named China as a “persistent collector” of U.S. corporate secrets.

U.S. intelligence officials said China has mounted a concerted campaign to siphon intellectual property and feed it to state-sponsored industries to save on research-and-development costs.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the pace of cyber thefts from China has accelerated over the last six months.

“I think we need to confront China on this,” he said. “We need to let China know in no uncertain terms that this is a relationship-altering, continuing offense, and it will have the most serious consequences.

Advertisement

“We need to make it clear that they are seeking an unfair economic advantage in their cyber theft practices, and they are going to have to change those practices.”

Intellectual property also is frequently stolen by human spies, some of whom are caught and prosecuted.

U.N. approves sanctions against North Korea

Pyongyang threatened a nuclear strike against U.S.

White House%3A Rogue regime %22will achieve nothing by threats or provocations%22

WASHINGTON — The White House said Thursday that the United States is fully capable of defending against a North Korean ballistic missile strike.

Earlier Thursday, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously for new sanctions against North Korea, which carried out a third nuclear test Feb. 12. Pyongyang threatened a nuclear strike against the United States.

""The United States is fully capable of defending against any North Korean ballistic missile attack,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said.

North Korea is prepared to ""exercise the right to a pre-emptive nuclear attack to destroy the strongholds of the aggressors,"" and Washington is ""set to light a fuse for a nuclear war,"" according to a statement from a Foreign Ministry spokesman carried by the Korean Central News Agency.

Carney said the rogue regime ""will achieve nothing by threats or provocations.""

Friday, Pyongyang announced that it was canceling a hotline and a nonaggression pact with South Korea.

Shortly after Kim Jong Un was elevated to succeed his father as ruler of North Korea, U.S. negotiators reached an understanding with Pyongyang that was announced Feb. 12, 2012.

The North Koreans agreed to suspend their uranium enrichment program and allow U.N. inspectors back in the country, moves that gave the United States and other allies a sliver of hope that six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program could be revived.

Sixteen days after the deal was reached, North Korea announced it would launch a satellite attached to a rocket into space, compelling condemnation from the Obama administration and international community. The launch was carried out April 13, 2012, and the North Koreans carried out a subsequent long-range missile launch Dec. 12, 2012.

The situation reached a new low last month when North Korea conducted it's latest nuclear activity.

""Pyongyang's Feb. 12 announcement of a third nuclear test ... and its subsequent threats to conduct even more follow-on measures are only the latest in a long line of reminders that [North Korea's] nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs and proliferation activities pose serious threats to U.S. national security, to regional security in the Asia-Pacific and to the global non-proliferation regime,"" Glyn Davies, the State Department's special representative for North Korea policy, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday."

“We believe these assurances eliminate these asserted grounds for Mr. Snowden’s claim that he should be treated as a refugee or granted asylum, temporary or otherwise,” Mr. Holder said in the letter, which was sent to Justice Minister Aleksandr V. Konovalov.

http://news.yahoo.com/defiant-clinton-takes-lawmakers-libya-attack-212245534--politics.html,,[],Defiant Clinton takes on lawmakers on Libya attack,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton delivered fiery rejoinders Wednesday to Republican critics of the Obama administration's handling of the deadly attack on a U.S. mission in Benghazi, facing off with lawmakers who included potential 2016 presidential rivals.

At times emotional and frequently combative, Clinton rejected GOP suggestions in two congressional hearings that the administration tried to mislead the country about the Sept. 11 attack that killed Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, and three other Americans. She insisted the State Department is moving swiftly and aggressively to strengthen security at diplomatic posts worldwide.

In her last formal testimony before Congress as America's top diplomat — but perhaps not her last time on the political stage — Clinton once again took responsibility for the department's missteps and failures leading up to the assault. But she also said that requests for more security at the diplomatic mission in Benghazi didn't reach her desk, and reminded lawmakers that they have a responsibility to fund security-related budget requests.

Three weeks after her release from a New York hospital — admitted for complications after a concussion — Clinton was at times defiant, complimentary and willing to chastise lawmakers during more than 5 ½ hours of testimony before two separate committees. She tangled with some who could be rivals in 2016 if she decides to seek the presidency again.

Her voice cracking at one point, Clinton said the attack and the aftermath were highly personal tragedies for the families of the victims who died — Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty — as well as herself.

""I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters and the wives left alone to raise their children,"" she told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at a packed hearing.

Story continues

Clearly annoyed with Republican complaints about the initial explanation for the attack, she rose to the defense of U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, who was vilified for widely debunked claims five days after the attack that protests precipitated the raid rather than terrorism.

Clinton said, ""People were trying in real time to get to the best information."" And she said her own focus was on looking ahead on how to improve security rather than revisiting the talking points and Rice's comments.

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., pressed her on why ""we were misled that there were supposedly protests and something sprang out of that, an assault sprang out of that.""

""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,"" she said, her voice rising and quivering with anger as she and Johnson spoke over each other.

""Was it because of a protest? Or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they would go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.""

If Johnson's comments drew an irritated response from Clinton, she notably ignored Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., when he said he would have fired her if he had been in charge and found that she had not read cables from her team in Libya asking for more security. Paul is a potential 2016 presidential candidate.

""Had I been president and found you did not read the cables from Benghazi and from Ambassador Stevens, I would have relieved you of your post,"" Paul said. ""I think it's inexcusable.""

Clinton and other officials have testified that requests for additional security did not reach her level, and a scathing independent review of the matter sharply criticized four senior State Department officials who have been relieved of their duties.

""I did not see these requests. They did not come to me. I did not approve them. I did not deny them,"" she said.

Later, before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina repeatedly challenged Clinton's claim to have looked at the tragedy with ""clear eyes,"" saying she should have personally ensured security at the mission.

He said Clinton had ""let the consulate become a death trap"" in denying requests for additional security and called it ""malpractice.""

Clinton said she could have let the review board's report remain classified and told Congress ""goodbye"" before leaving office. But she said, it's ""not who I am. It's not what I do.""

Absent from the Senate hearing was Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., the man tapped to succeed Clinton, who is leaving the administration after four years. Kerry, defeated by George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election, is expected to win swift Senate approval. Clinton is to introduce him at his confirmation hearing on Thursday.

Politics play an outsized role in any appearance by Clinton, who was defeated by Barack Obama in a hard-fought battle for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. She is the subject of constant speculation about a possible bid in 2016.

A former New York senator and the wife of former President Bill Clinton, she is a polarizing figure but is ending her tenure at the State Department with high favorability ratings. A poll last month by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press found 65 percent of Americans held a favorable impression of her, compared with 29 percent unfavorable.

On the panel at the Senate hearing were two possible 2016 Republican presidential candidates — Florida's Marco Rubio and Paul, a new member of the committee — as well as John McCain of Arizona, who was defeated by Obama in November 2008.

Clinton, 65, did little to quiet the presidential chatter earlier this month when she returned to work after her hospitalization. On the subject of retirement, she said, ""I don't know if that is a word I would use, but certainly stepping off the very fast track for a little while.""

In a second round of questioning on Wednesday, Clinton testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee where Republican members pressed her on why cables and other memos about security deficiencies in Benghazi seemed to be ignored.

""The dots here were connected ahead of time. The State Department saw this was coming,"" said Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., the chairman of the panel. ""The State Department didn't act.""

Clinton told senators the department is implementing the 29 recommendations of the review board and going beyond the proposals, with a special focus on high-threat posts.

""Nobody is more committed to getting this right,"" she said. ""I am determined to leave the State Department and our country safer, stronger, and more secure.""

Clinton had been due to testify in December but postponed her appearances after fainting, falling and suffering a concussion while recovering from a stomach virus that left her severely dehydrated. She was then diagnosed with a blood clot near her brain and returned to work only on Jan. 7.

She won bipartisan well-wishes on her recovery, but while Democrats were quick to praise her for accomplishments as secretary of state, Republicans then hit her with withering criticism.

""It's wonderful to see you in good health and combative as ever,"" said McCain.

But in the same breath, he dismissed her explanation of events, the administration's response to warnings about the deteriorating security situation in Libya and even the attention paid to Libya after rebels toppled Moammar Gadhafi. ""The answers, frankly, that you've given this morning are not satisfactory to me,"" McCain said.

To McCain, a friend that Clinton served with in the Senate, she replied matter-of-factly: ""We just have a disagreement. We have a disagreement about what did happen and when it happened with respect to explaining the sequence of events.""

Some Democrats raised the point that Congress had cut funding for embassy security.

""We have to get our act together,"" she told the panels, chiding House GOP members for recently stripping $1 billion in security aid from the hurricane relief bill and the Senate panel for failing for years to produce a spending authorization bill.

In something of a valedictory, Clinton noted her robust itinerary in four years and her work, nearly 1 million miles and 112 countries.

""My faith in our country and our future is stronger than ever. Every time that blue and white airplane carrying the words ""United States of America"" touches down in some far-off capital, I feel again the honor it is to represent the world's indispensable nation. And I am confident that, with your help, we will continue to keep the United States safe, strong, and exceptional.""

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., expressed incredulity that the independent review board did not interview Clinton for its extensive report. She also complained about the department's ""false narrative"" that four employees lost their jobs over the attack.

""There's just been a shuffling of the deck chairs,"" said Ros-Lehtinen.

Clinton said earlier that she was not asked to speak to the review board but would have been available. She said the four employees have been removed from their jobs and have been placed on administrative leave, but federal rules prevent the department from taking more drastic steps.

Her testimony followed more than three months of Republican charges that the Obama administration ignored signs of a deteriorating security situation and cast an act of terrorism as mere protests over an anti-Muslim video in the heat of a presidential election. U.S. officials suspect that militants linked to al-Qaida carried out the attack.

Sanger', 'Nicole Perlroth']",Chinese Hackers Resume Attacks on U.S. Targets,"Mandiant said that the Chinese hackers had stopped their attacks after they were exposed in February and removed their spying tools from the organizations they had infiltrated. But over the past two months, they have gradually begun attacking the same victims from new servers and have reinserted many of the tools that enable them to seek out data without detection. They are now operating at 60 percent to 70 percent of the level they were working at before, according to a study by Mandiant requested by The New York Times.

The Times hired Mandiant to investigate an attack that originated in China on its news operations last fall. Mandiant is not currently working for The New York Times Company.

Mandiant’s findings match those of Crowdstrike, another security company that has also been tracking the group. Adam Meyers, director of intelligence at Crowdstrike, said that apart from a few minor changes in tactics, it was “business as usual” for the Chinese hackers.

The subject of Chinese attacks is expected to be a central issue in an upcoming visit to China by President Obama’s national security adviser, Thomas Donilon, who has said that dealing with China’s actions in cyberspace is now moving to the center of the complex security and economic relationship between the two countries.

But hopes for progress on the issue are limited. When the Pentagon released its report this month officially identifying the Chinese military as the source of years of attacks, the Chinese Foreign Ministry denied the accusation, and People’s Daily, which reflects the views of the Communist Party, called the United States “the real ‘hacking empire,’ ” saying it “has continued to strengthen its network tools for political subversion against other countries.” Other Chinese organizations and scholars cited American and Israeli cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities as evidence of American hypocrisy.

At the White House, Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said Sunday that “what we have been seeking from China is for it to investigate our concerns and to start a dialogue with us on cyberissues.” She noted that China “agreed last month to start a new working group,” and that the administration hoped to win “longer-term changes in China’s behavior, including by working together to establish norms against the theft of trade secrets and confidential business information.”

In a report to be issued Wednesday, a private task force led by Mr. Obama’s former director of national intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, and his former ambassador to China, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., lays out a series of proposed executive actions and Congressional legislation intended to raise the stakes for China."

Nations in every part of the world have traveled this difficult path. Europe, the bloodiest battlefield of the 20th century, is united, free and at peace. From Brazil to South Africa, from Turkey to South Korea, from India to Indonesia, people of different races, religions, and traditions have lifted millions out of poverty, while respecting the rights of their citizens and meeting their responsibilities as nations.

And it is because of the progress that I’ve witnessed in my own lifetime, the progress that I’ve witnessed after nearly four years as President, that I remain ever hopeful about the world that we live in. The war in Iraq is over. American troops have come home. We’ve begun a transition in Afghanistan, and America and our allies will end our war on schedule in 2014. Al Qaeda has been weakened, and Osama bin Laden is no more. Nations have come together to lock down nuclear materials, and America and Russia are reducing our arsenals. We have seen hard choices made -- from Naypyidaw to Cairo to Abidjan -- to put more power in the hands of citizens.

At a time of economic challenge, the world has come together to broaden prosperity. Through the G20, we have partnered with emerging countries to keep the world on the path of recovery. America has pursued a development agenda that fuels growth and breaks dependency, and worked with African leaders to help them feed their nations. New partnerships have been forged to combat corruption and promote government that is open and transparent, and new commitments have been made through the Equal Futures Partnership to ensure that women and girls can fully participate in politics and pursue opportunity. And later today, I will discuss our efforts to combat the scourge of human trafficking.

All these things give me hope. But what gives me the most hope is not the actions of us, not the actions of leaders -- it is the people that I’ve seen. The American troops who have risked their lives and sacrificed their limbs for strangers half a world away; the students in Jakarta or Seoul who are eager to use their knowledge to benefit mankind; the faces in a square in Prague or a parliament in Ghana who see democracy giving voice to their aspirations; the young people in the favelas of Rio and the schools of Mumbai whose eyes shine with promise. These men, women, and children of every race and every faith remind me that for every angry mob that gets shown on television, there are billions around the world who share similar hopes and dreams. They tell us that there is a common heartbeat to humanity.

So much attention in our world turns to what divides us. That’s what we see on the news. That’s what consumes our political debates. But when you strip it all away, people everywhere long for the freedom to determine their destiny; the dignity that comes with work; the comfort that comes with faith; and the justice that exists when governments serve their people -- and not the other way around.

The United States of America will always stand up for these aspirations, for our own people and for people all across the world. That was our founding purpose. That is what our history shows. That is what Chris Stevens worked for throughout his life.

And I promise you this: Long after the killers are brought to justice, Chris Stevens’s legacy will live on in the lives that he touched -- in the tens of thousands who marched against violence through the streets of Benghazi; in the Libyans who changed their Facebook photo to one of Chris; in the signs that read, simply, “Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans.”"

USA TODAY

Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev suffered multiple serious injuries before his capture, including a skull fracture and a gunshot to the face, according to newly unsealed court documents.

The 19-year-old was caught in a shootout with police four days after the April 15 bombings, yet managed to escape in a car. He was captured the next day while hiding in a boat in the backyard of a home in Watertown, Mass.

His 27-year-old brother, Tamerlan, was killed during the earlier confrontation with police.

The pair were being sought in connection with the bombings at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15 that killed three people and injured more than 250.

Details of the younger Tsarnaev's injuries were contained in testimony given shortly after his arrest by Stephen Ray Odom, a trauma surgeon who treated Tsarnaev at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The transcript of his testimony was ordered unsealed Monday.

""He has multiple gunshot wounds, the most severe of which appears to have entered through the left side inside of his mouth and exited the left face, lower face,"" Odom said, according to the transcript.

""This was a high-powered injury that has resulted in skull-base fracture, with injuries to the middle ear, the skull base, the lateral portion of his C1 vertebrae, with a significant soft-tissue injury, as well as injury to the pharynx, the mouth, and a small vascular injury that's been treated,"" he testified.

Odom also treated Tsarnaev for several days after he was taken to the hospital.

""He has multiple gunshots (sic) wounds to the extremities that have been treated with dressing to the lower extremities; and in the case of his left hand, he had multiple bony injuries as well that were treated with fixation and soft-tissue coverage, as well as tendon repair and vascular ligation,"" Odom told the court.

Tsarnaev, who is being held at a prison medical facility in Devens, Mass., pleaded not guilty on July 11 to bomb-related charges found in a 30-count federal indictment."

President Obama made a statement on Saturday to update the country on his Syria deliberations

Members of his national security team briefed lawmakers on Saturday

Obama overrode top advisers%27 objections

WASHINGTON — President Obama said on Saturday that he was ready to take military action against Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime in retaliation for its alleged use of chemical weapons, but that he will seek the approval of Congress before carrying out any military strike.

Obama says congressional leaders have agreed to schedule a debate and vote when they return to session. They are scheduled to return from their summer recess on Sept. 9.

The president did not say whether he'd forgo a strike if Congress rejects his call to action.

""After careful deliberation, I have decided that the United States should take military action against Syrian regime targets,"" Obama said. ""This would not be an open-ended intervention. We would not put boots on the ground. Instead, our action would be designed to be limited in duration and scope.

""This attack is an assault on human dignity,"" Obama said of the alleged Aug. 21 chemical assault the U.S. intelligence community has linked to Assad's regime. ""It also presents a serious danger to our national security.""

The remarks came amid a flurry of briefings for skeptical lawmakers by the president's national security team. Shouts from hundreds of activists outside the White House protesting against military action could be heard from the Rose Garden shortly before Obama spoke.

""Over the last several days, we've heard from several members of Congress who want their voices to be heard,"" Obama said. ""I absolutely agree.""

House Speaker John Boehner announced in a joint statement with the GOP House leadership that he expected to consider a measure that would authorize the president to carry out a military strike the week of Sept. 9.

""Under the Constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress,"" the statement said. ""We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised. This provides the president time to make his case to Congress and the American people.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., welcomed Obama's decision.

""The president's role as commander in chief is always strengthened when he enjoys the expressed support of the Congress,"" McConnell said.

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, praised Obama's decision to seek congressional authorization as ""absolutely the right decision."" Corker in recent weeks had been a public advocate for an authorization vote, contending that the Congress too often takes a back seat on determining critical foreign policy decisions.

Obama said some have advised not to seek Congress' approval, noting that the British Parliament this week rejected a similar call for action by Prime Minister David Cameron. Obama also rejected Boehner's notion that he must seek congressional authorization.

""While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,"" Obama said. ""We should have this debate. The issues are too big for business as usual.""

The president's senior advisers had initially advised him not to seek congressional authorization for a military strike, according to a senior administration official.

Obama indicated last Saturday during a National Security Council meeting that he was leaning toward taking action against Syria, but had not made a final decision, said the official, who asked not to be identified to discuss internal deliberations.

But when Obama convened his senior advisers on Friday night to tell them he had decided to take military action, he also told his advisers that he would seek Congressional authorization, the official said.

In the Friday night meeting and again on Saturday morning, Obama explained his reasoning to his advisers for seeking congressional backing. The same aides who had advised him not to go to lawmakers for backing threw their support behind his plan.

Obama's remarks on Saturday afternoon came hours after United Nations experts, who had been collecting samples from last week's alleged chemical weapons strike outside Damascus, left Syria bound for the Netherlands.

The chemical weapons experts were working to determine what occurred in the apparent chemical weapons attack near Damascus on Aug. 21, which U.S. intelligence reports say left 1,429 people dead, including 426 children. They have taken blood and urine samples from victims and soil samples from areas where chemical attacks have been reported. The samples will be tested in Europe.

Obama attempted to put the onus on Congress, which he suggested has a moral responsibility to take action. He noted that Americans have become weary after more than a decade of war, but that something as heinous as a chemical attack could not be ignored.

""Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?"" Obama said.

The president had long expressed skepticism about the merits of American involvement in the civil war in Syria that has left more than 100,000 dead. But Obama stated publicly just over a year ago that movement or deployment of chemical weapons was a ""red line"" that must not be crossed.

The White House had determined earlier this summer that Assad's regime had previously used chemical weapons against rebels and civilians on a small scale, but had resisted taking action or offering any significant new military aid to the rebel groups.

Obama said that Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, has advised him that the U.S. military's capacity to execute a strike is not time-sensitive. Five U.S. Navy destroyers equipped with land-attack cruise missiles are deployed in the eastern Mediterranean and stand ready to carry out an assault on the president's order.

""In the coming days, my administration stands ready to provide every member with the information they need to understand what happened in Syria and why it has such profound implications for America's national security,"" Obama said. ""And all of us should be accountable as we move forward, and that can only be accomplished with a vote."""

http://money.cnn.com/2013/02/19/technology/china-military-cybercrime/index.html,2013-02-19 00:00:00,['Charles Riley'],Report: Chinese military engaged in 'extensive cyber espionage campaign',"An American cybersecurity firm has linked one of the world's most prolific groups of computer hackers to the Chinese government, saying in a new report that an extensive cyber-espionage campaign is being waged from a location near Shanghai.

The security firm, Mandiant, detailed the allegations in a 60-page report published Tuesday that describes the group's tactics over a six-year period.

The Virginia-based Mandiant, which helps companies detect and respond to cyber threats, said it has observed the group of hackers -- called the ""comment crew"" -- systematically steal hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations across 20 industries worldwide since 2006.

Mandiant claims the activity can be traced to four networks near Shanghai -- with some operations taking place in a location that is also the headquarters of Unit 61398, a secret division of China's military.

""The sheer scale and duration of sustained attacks against such a wide set of industries from a singularly identified group based in China leaves little doubt about the organization behind [the group],"" Mandiant said. ""We believe the totality of the evidence we provide in this document bolsters the claim that [the group] is Unit 61398.""

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei dismissed the hacking charges on Tuesday, insisting that China is the victim of many cyberattacks -- most originating in the United States.

""Making baseless accusations based on premature analysis is irresponsible and unprofessional,"" he said. ""China resolutely opposes any form of hacking activities.""

Last month, the Chinese defense ministry said the country's military ""has never supported any hacker activities.""

The latest accusation against Beijing comes amid concerns about the breadth and depth of cyberattacks originating in China. Recently, several leading U.S. news organizations reported their computer systems had been attacked by China-based hackers.

Mandiant estimates that hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of people work within Unit 61398, which is housed in a 12-story, 130,663 square-foot facility.

Organizations in English-speaking countries are the primary victims of the comment crew -- making up 87% of the 141 attacks observed by Mandiant. Of that, 115 attacks targeted organizations in the United States.

The hackers have a ""well-defined attack methodology,"" and Mandiant said the group has stolen large volumes of intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes and business plans.

The report did not list companies or agencies that have been attacked, but the comment crew is known to have attacked Coca-Cola, security firm RSA, and consultancy Chertoff Group.

The Coca-Cola (CCE) hack occurred in 2009 when the beverage giant was trying to purchase China's Huiyuan Juice Group. According to reports, comment crew stole Coca-Cola's negotiation strategy along with other information about the proposed offer. The deal was scuttled just days after the hack, when the Chinese government said it could not accept the deal on antitrust grounds.

RSA was attacked by the group in 2011, which compromised the security of some of its SecurID tokens used to gain entry into corporate systems. Using information gained from the RSA hack, the group subsequently attacked aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin (LMT).

All of these attacks started the same way: via a cleverly worded emails -- written in perfect English -- that appeared to be from someone inside the company. Instead, it contained malicious software designed to gain access to the corporations networks.

Mandiant was able to pinpoint the identities of three individuals working with the group. The report identifies the hackers who use the monikers ""Ugly Gorilla,"" ""dota"" and ""SuperHard."" It tracks their activities in an unusually detailed manner, including information on their e-mail accounts, cell phones and hacking techniques.

Government and intelligence officials in the United States are increasingly concerned about the threats posed by cybercrime, especially from government actors.

Outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said last year that a cyberattack could be crippling, citing risks to the power grid, Wall Street and the financial system.

""We are literally getting hundreds of thousands of attacks everyday that try to exploit information in various agencies and departments and frankly throughout this country,"" Panetta said.

In a statement, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said the administration is aware of the Mandiant report, and is acting to negate these threats.

""The United States has substantial and growing concerns about the threats to U.S. economic and national security posed by cyber intrusions,"" Vietor said. ""We have repeatedly raised our concerns at the highest levels about cyber theft with senior Chinese officials, including in the military, and we will continue to do so.""

Earlier this month, President Obama signed an executive order designed to address the country's most basic cybersecurity needs -- and highlighted the effort in his State of the Union address.

The order will make it easier for private companies in control of the nation's critical infrastructure to share information about cyberattacks with the government. The order also directs the government to work with the private sector on standards that will help protect companies from cybercrime.

In recent weeks, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal have disclosed that their computer networks had been targeted by hackers in China.

The New York Times, which hired Mandiant to help mitigate the threat, reported Tuesday that the comment crew was not the source of the attack on its network.

China is not the only country believed to be involved in cyberattacks. The existence of several other state-sponsored cyberweapons have also been reported in recent years, with names like Stuxnet, Duqu and Flame. The U.S. government is widely believed to have played a role in developing some of those viruses, with an eye toward containing Iran."

Obama’s top national security aides planned to hold the first of two days of weekend briefings for Congress. And the president and top aides were expected to continue consultations with foreign allies.

Senate Republicans and Democrats were to get separate briefings on Saturday. House members of both parties received an invitation to attend a members-only classified briefing at 2 p.m. ET Sunday.

It was not clear what the weekend sessions meant for the timing of a possible attack. Obama has signaled that he does not think he needs explicit congressional authorization to make war on Bashar Assad’s regime — but it seemed somewhat unlikely that the president would pull the trigger before the Sunday briefing.

National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral James Winnefeld, were to update Senators via an unclassified conference call ""this afternoon,"" a senior administration official said.

The calls aimed “to continue the Administration's consultations regarding the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons in Syria on August 21,” the official told reporters by email.

House members were to get briefed on Sunday, according to a message from Republican House Speaker John Boehner.

“Please note, that if your Member is unable to participate that this will be one of many classified briefings. However, given the numerous requests made, the Speaker wanted Members to have an opportunity this weekend,” according to the message.

Boehner also invited representatives to review the Obama Administration’s classified intelligence finding that the Assad regime was behind an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack.

Story continues

Lawmakers were required to review the document in person in the offices of the House Intelligence Committee.

The briefings come after administration officials briefed House Armed Services Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee members on Friday.

Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office announced the Senate GOP briefing late Friday, saying it was being held at his request.

“Sen. McConnell believes it’s important for the whole Conference to have the opportunity to communicate directly with the administration on this important issue,” spokesman Don Stewart said in a statement.

The briefings came at a time when a growing chorus of lawmakers was insisting that Obama secure explicit congressional authorization for any military action against Assad’s regime in Damascus.

The White House repeatedly has said it will “consult” with Congress, but has made it clear Obama does not think he needs the green light from lawmakers.

The Republican Senate briefing was to occur at 1 p.m. Washington time. It was not immediately clear at what time Democrats were to get their briefing."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/opinion/south-koreas-nuclear-ambitions.html,2013-04-19 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],South Korea’s Nuclear Ambitions - The New York Times,"The United States and South Korea are negotiating a new nuclear cooperation agreement that will have consequences for the conflict with North Korea and President Obama’s broader nonproliferation agenda. As part of the deal, the South Korean government has requested American approval to enrich uranium and to reprocess nuclear fuel originally bought from the United States.

This technology, which is prohibited in the current agreement, would enable South Korea to produce its own nuclear fuel and bring it closer to making nuclear weapons. Granting that approval would be a serious mistake. A United States-South Korean nuclear agreement was first negotiated in 1974 and expires in 2014. The agreement has enabled resource-poor South Korea to become the sixth-largest producer of nuclear energy. The nuclear industry says South Korea is running out of space to store the spent fuel rods from the country’s 21 power reactors and that it wants to recycle the rods for use again as fuel.

Rising tensions with North Korea are a factor in South Korea’s increased interest in reprocessing nuclear fuel and possibly having the option of producing nuclear weapons. It dabbled with developing a secret weapons program in the 1970s until that was abandoned under American pressure. Allowing the South to produce nuclear fuel would make it even harder for the United States to argue credibly for restraining weapons-related nuclear fuel programs in North Korea and Iran.

Such a decision could also give impetus to Japan to pursue nuclear weapons development; it has had American approval to reprocess fuel for energy purposes since 1988 and is considering whether to open a new reprocessing plant that could produce enough plutonium to make 1,000 to 2,000 bombs a year."

Early this morning, Snowden left the Moscow airport after he was granted temporary asylum by Russia.

Carney also stated that Snowden isn’t a whistleblower or a dissident and described the situation as ‘not a positive development’ for U.S.-Russia relations. The move undermines Russia’s record of law enforcement cooperation with the U.S.

The White House is considering cancelling a planned fall summit between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“We are extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step despite our very clear and lawful requests in public and private that Mr. Snowden be expelled and returned to the United States,” said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

Moscow did not give any advanced notice to the White House before they announced their decision to grant a one year, temporary asylum request to Snowden. Relations between the US are already strained because of differences regarding the war in Syria, but Putin did say the request was granted contingent upon Snowden refraining from hurting U.S. interests.

This “disappointment” is a switch from Obama’s cavalier attitude toward Snowden when the leaks were first brought to light. Initially, Obama dismissed Snowden and the NSA leaks to the media by saying “No, I’m not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker,” Obama said.

The President also said “I shouldn’t have to” personally call the leaders of China and Russia to have them turn over Snowden after details of classified documents were made public.

“We’ve got a whole lot of business that we do with China and Russia,” Obama said. “And I’m not going to have one case of a suspect that we’re trying to extradite suddenly being elevated to the point where I’ve got to start doing wheeling and dealing and trading on a host of other issues, simply to get a guy extradited so that he can face the Justice system here in the United States.”

In a telephone call to President Obama on Wednesday evening, the chancellor noted that a visit to Washington by senior officials from the German government and its intelligence services offered the chance for an “intensive discussion” of concerns over the scope of American intelligence activities, data protection and privacy, the statement said.

But French officials, speaking to reporters, made it clear that they would still favor delaying trade talks if there was no movement from the Americans on the espionage by next week.

And now, the uproar has encompassed Latin America as well.

“In some sense, it parallels ironically what the N.S.A. is doing,” said Faiza Patel, a co-director of the liberty and national security program of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a research and advocacy organization. “The N.S.A. is reaching its tentacles aross the world.”

Mr. Snowden and his disclosures have touched different chords in each region. In Europe, Ms. Patel noted, they have provoked memories of the police states created by fascism and communism, with their heavy-handed surveillance of their own people. In Latin America, she said, they have touched on a wellspring of resentment over the legacy of colonialism and American power, as well as the region’s own history of secretive dictatorships.

The latest burst of outrage came in response to the diversion of a plane carrying Bolivia’s president, Evo Morales, as he was flying home from Moscow on Tuesday. He had attended a meeting of nations that export natural gas and had told Russian television that he was open to giving asylum to Mr. Snowden."

Such threat happen routinely before U.S.-South Korean exercises

The exercises come in the wake of a recent nuclear test in North Korea

South Korea's military is already in a state of heightened alert

Ahead of annual, routine military exercises between South Korea and the United States, North Korea issued its usual caustic objections Saturday.

It threatened ""miserable destruction,"" if ""your side ignites a war of aggression by staging the reckless joint military exercises ... at this dangerous time.""

Though customary, the stark posturing by North Korea stands in the shadow of an underground nuclear test two weeks ago that was preceded by the launch of a long-range missile capable of transporting a warhead.

The detonation of the nuclear charge was the third in Pyongyang's history and the first under supreme leader Kim Jong Un's rule. South Korea's military reacted with fierce military drills, including a public display of newly deployed cruise missiles with pinpoint accuracy.

It has been on heightened readiness ever since.

The test also triggered a global wave of condemnation, including from Beijing, and plans for new sanctions against Pyongyang.

North Korea issued the objections to exercises Key Resolve and Foal Eagle scheduled for March and April to U.S. commander James D. Sherman, state run news agency KCNA reported.

The message was delivered over the phone in English, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported.

It also condemned the threat of new sanctions over North Korea's recent actions.

A United Nations military commission informed Pyongyang of the upcoming routine exercises, according to a joint statement from U.S. and South Korean military officials.

The commission also told North Korea that they are ""not related with the current situations on the Korean Peninsula.""

Around 10,000 U.S. forces will participate in Foal Eagle from March 1 to April 30. Key Resolve will involve 10,000 South Korean troops and 3,500 U.S. troops in exercises March 11 to 21.

Key Resolve will include U.N. troops and neutral supervisors."

Hundreds of pages of court documents in Kansas City and New York illustrate how Khalid Ouazzani -- a Kansas City used auto parts salesman and failed real estate investor -- and two other naturalized American citizens were fleeced out of tens of thousands of dollars by Al Qaeda leaders who exploited their zeal to wage holy war, The Kansas City Star reported.

In a recent letter to a New York federal judge, a lawyer representing cell member Sabirhan Hasanoff -- a Brooklyn accountant at PricewaterhouseCoopers who moved to Dubai in 2007 -- acknowledged that Hasanoff once dreamed about jihad glory but instead got taken by a Yemeni con man.

""The defendants never had any authentic access to terrorism networks or Islamic extremists, and were victims of a rudimentary fraud,"" the lawyer wrote.

Federal prosecutors responded that while Hasanoff couldn't control how his contributions would be used, he intended them to support Al Qaeda's terrorist goals.

Ouazzani, Hanoff and Wesam El-Hanafi, who was an information security specialist in Brooklyn with Lehman Brothers before moving to Dubai around 2005, all aspired to ""support violent extremist Islamic causes,"" prosecutors have said. They are awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in Kansas City and New York to various federal crimes.

All three also are married, have children and didn't care much for the idea of blowing themselves up for the cause.

Court records show that El-Hanafi connected with two experienced terrorists in Yemen in mid-2007. One of the men, referred to in court records as ""Suffian,"" had recently left prison and was eager to resume his work for Al Qaeda.

The other man, referred to as ""The Doctor,"" was an experienced jihadi who claimed to have fought the Soviets in Afghanistan and pledged his support in the 1990s to an organization that later merged with Al Qaeda. He also ran an automobile business in Yemen.

The three Americans began sending $300 a month to their new friends in Yemen to prove they were serious. Ouazzani also offered a $6,500 commitment to the cause, which he couldn't afford most likely because of real estate losses in Kansas City. Hasanoff covered Ouazzani's contribution and later badgered him with emails demanding repayment.

The three also sent watches, cold-weather gear, Garmin GPS units and a remote-control car to the terrorist leaders.

After being arrested by Yemeni authorities, Suffian and The Doctor told FBI agents the Americans believed the money and equipment were being set aside for their military training that eventually would land them in Somalia, Iraq or Afghanistan.

Instead, The Doctor admitted he and Suffian divided the material loot between themselves, gave some of the money to the families of Islamic martyrs and bought a couple of automobiles.

The three Americans also had planned to send a $45,000 contribution in late 2008, which The Doctor had earmarked for a personal investment.

""(The Doctor's) plan was to take the Americans' money,"" Suffian is quoted as saying in one FBI interview. ""For example, (The Doctor) was planning on using the $45,000 to open an appliance store.""

Eventually the Americans became impatient and pressed The Doctor and Suffian for word about when they would travel for jihad. The Yemenis urged patience, saying the three were better suited for an operation in the U.S. than fighting in foreign countries.

The process would be sped up dramatically, though, if they consented to a ""martyrdom"" operation, one of Suffian's terror contacts told him.

""The Americans . advised (Suffian) that they did not want to do a martyrdom operation, but still wanted to travel for jihad,"" the FBI reported."
http://ca.news.yahoo.com/obama-makes-push-syria-examine-russian-proposal-chemical-200152169.html,,[],Russian proposal complicates U.S. Syria strike debate,"By Roberta Rampton and Thomas Ferraro WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, struggling to gain support for U.S. military action in Syria, called Russia's proposal on Monday to put Syria's chemical weapons under international control a ""potentially positive"" move that should be viewed skeptically. Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid pushed back a Senate test vote on whether to authorize military strikes against Syria that had been scheduled for Wednesday as lawmakers evaluate the Russian plan. The vote is still expected this week. In a round of six television interviews on Monday, Obama said he prefers a diplomatic solution in Syria and will have U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry explore the Russian proposal. ""I think you have to take it with a grain of salt initially,"" Obama told NBC News on the Russian offer. ""But between the statements that we saw from the Russians, the statement today from the Syrians, this represents a potentially positive development. We are going to run this to the ground."" However, administration officials also said the proposal would not derail efforts to get congressional authorization for strikes, saying the threat of strikes motivated Russia's offer. Obama faces an uphill struggle to win approval on military intervention from Congress, where a majority of lawmakers are still undecided on whether to use military force to punish Syria for an August 21 chemical weapons attack on civilians. ""I wouldn't say I'm confident"" of winning approval, Obama told NBC, but he plans an intensified lobbying blitz for support over the next few days. In addition to the six interviews, Obama was due to visit the Capitol on Tuesday to make his case to lawmakers from both parties before making a televised address to the nation from the White House in the evening. The Russian offer provided the administration a new option on Syria. It came a few hours after Kerry had suggested in London, in response to a reporter's question, that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad could avoid a military strike by surrendering his chemical arsenal. Syria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem ""welcomed"" the Russian proposal. Britain and France gave tentative support, and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon separately said on Monday he may ask the U.N. Security Council to demand that Damascus move its chemical arms stocks to sites where they can be safely stored and destroyed. A senior U.S. official described Kerry's comment as rhetorical, but said Kerry told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in a later phone call that while he was skeptical about the prospect he would examine any serious proposal. Administration officials emphasized, however, that the Russian effort should not be an excuse to delay congressional authorization of a military strike. ""It's important to note that this proposal comes in the context of the threat of U.S. action and the pressure that the president is exerting,"" Obama's deputy national security adviser, Tony Blinken, told reporters at the White House. Some lawmakers reacted positively to the Russian plan. Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham, leading supporters of the strikes, said the Russian proposal should make it easier to win support in Congress. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democratic chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Russia could be ""most effective"" in encouraging Assad to place his chemical arsenal under U.N. control. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a potential presidential candidate in 2016, waded into the debate, endorsing Obama's drive for Congress to approve military action. She said the surrender of chemical weapons would be an ""important step"" but said such a proposal could only have come ""in the context of a credible military threat by the United States.""

And It Should. - The New York Times,"THE United States is currently enjoying an unprecedented respite in the foreign policy arena — a temporary relief from the normal rigors of history that allows us to take stock at home and abroad.

It may seem outlandish to claim that we’re in the midst of a lull, given that America faces a civil war in Syria, an Iran that seems to be seeking nuclear weapons, an irresponsible North Korea that already possesses them, continuing threats from terrorists, a rising China and rapid climate change.

Yet the United States enjoys a respite all the same. For the three and a half centuries of the modern international era, great powers have almost always confronted rivals determined to defeat them and replace the global order they worked to bring about. In the last century, this process unfolded three times. The results were violent, costly and dangerous, and included two world wars and a cold war.

Today, there are threats, but they tend to be regional, years away or limited in scale. None rises to the level of being global, immediate and existential. The United States faces no great-power rival. And this is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future."

First, diplomacy takes work, and agreements rarely flow seamlessly from beginning to end. Second, if all those inveighing against any deal — namely members of Congress, Israel and Saudi Arabia — see the weekend results as a new opportunity to sabotage it, what is the alternative?

No one has proposed a better path than negotiations, and getting the best deal possible should remain the goal for Iran and the major powers — the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany — as they look to another round of talks later this month.

American, European and Iranian negotiators had raised expectations that an interim agreement — one that would temporarily freeze Iran’s nuclear program, while a longer-term agreement was worked on — could be reached. The 11th-hour arrival of Secretary of State John Kerry and other foreign ministers at the talks in Geneva added to a sense of a potential breakthrough.

On Monday, what prevented the deal was still in dispute. After Mr. Kerry placed responsibility on Iran for being unprepared to accept a proposed draft agreement, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran said Mr. Kerry’s “conflicting statements” had damaged confidence in a process that all sides had agreed would be conducted in secret. One primary obstacle involves Iran’s insistence that it has a right to enrich uranium (which can be used for nuclear power plants or weapons), something Washington is not ready to concede."

Snowden in his daring flight from Hong Kong, mounting a bold defense of the culture of national security disclosures that it has championed and that has bedeviled the United States and other governments.

Accompanying Mr. Snowden on the Aeroflot airliner that carried him on Sunday from Hong Kong to Moscow — continuing a global cat-and-mouse chase that might have been borrowed from a Hollywood screenplay — was a British WikiLeaks activist, Sarah Harrison. The group’s founder, Julian Assange, who has been given refuge for the last year in Ecuador’s embassy in London, met last week with Ecuador’s foreign minister to support Mr. Snowden’s asylum request. And Baltasar Gárzon, the legal director of WikiLeaks and a former Spanish judge, is leading a volunteer legal team advising him on how to stay out of an American prison.

“Mr. Snowden requested our expertise and assistance,” Mr. Assange said in a telephone interview from London on Sunday night. “We’ve been involved in very similar legal and diplomatic and geopolitical struggles to preserve the organization and its ability to publish.”

By Mr. Assange’s account, the group helped obtain and deliver a special refugee travel document to Mr. Snowden in Hong Kong that, with his American passport revoked, may now be crucial in his bid to travel onward from Moscow."

At the end of the 90-minute session, which was held on Thursday, Mr. Hagel, a former enlisted soldier who was wounded twice in Vietnam, surprised them with a promise. “Remember, you always have a friend in the secretary of defense,” one of those present quoted him as saying.

Even so, Mr. Hagel did not hide the quiet storm that is gathering, one that will test his empathy with the enlisted ranks as he begins to make tough calls over coming weeks about further shrinking the Pentagon after more than a decade of war and free spending.

Even more, as President Obama — who has placed some of the military’s long-favored weapons programs in his sights — continues to negotiate with Congress over a spending and revenue deal, Pentagon officials acknowledge they are bracing for a protracted period in which they may have to manage even larger budget reductions than anticipated."

Since the capture of 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on April 19 and the death of his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, U.S. officials have said the siblings appeared to have acted alone and were not part of a wider conspiracy.

But Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said it was too early to rule out the possibility that others were involved. He criticized what he called a “rush to judgment” by some in the Obama administration.

“I think given the level of sophistication of this device, the fact that the pressure cooker is a signature device that goes back to Pakistan, Afghanistan … and the way they handled these devices and the tradecraft leads me to believe there was a trainer,” McCaul said on “Fox News Sunday.”

“Are they overseas in the Chechen region or are they in the United States?” he said. “In my conversations with the FBI, that’s the big question. They’ve cast a wide net, both overseas and in the United States, to find out where this person is. But I think the experts all agree that there is someone who did train these two individuals.”

Two members of the House Intelligence Committee said investigators want to speak with several people in the U.S. and others abroad.

“There are still persons of interest in the United States that the FBI would like to have conversations with,” said Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), chairman of the House intelligence panel.

“We’re looking at phone calls before and after the bombing,” added Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.). Both appeared on ABC’s “This Week.”

Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat who is on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said investigators have to yet to find evidence pointing to a larger plot.

“There is no evidence at this point that these two were part of a larger organization, that they were in fact part of a -- some kind of terror cell or any kind of direction,” McCaskill said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “It appears, at this point, based on the evidence, that it’s the two of them.”

On Saturday, a U.S. counter-terrorism official told the Los Angeles Times that Russian authorities had secretly wiretapped a 2011 conversation between a man believed to be Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother discussing the idea of jihad.

The Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB, also intercepted a second telephone call between the mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, and another man living in southern Russia who has been the subject of a separate FBI investigation, the official said.

The vague substance of the calls was shared only a few days ago with U.S. officials investigating the April 15 bombing near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, which killed three people and injured more than 260.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that despite hitting a “snag” in nuclear negotiations last week, Iran is committed “100 percent” to reaching a comprehensive final agreement. But he voiced tough positions on key issues and said “it’s going to be a bumpy road,” with difficult bargaining ahead.

Zarif, who is Iran’s top chief negotiator, outlined his views in an hour-long interview at the foreign ministry here Sunday. He said that his country would continue the talks, despite what he called the “extremely counterproductive” U.S. Treasury Department announcement last week of new steps to enforce existing sanctions.

Iranian concern was eased, Zarif said, after his contacts last week with Secretary of State John Kerry, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the chief European Union negotiator, Lady Catherine Ashton. “What I have heard from Secretary Kerry and Lady Ashton is that they are committed to an early finalization of the Geneva process with a view to reaching a comprehensive agreement. I share that objective.”

Dressed in a diplomat’s blue pinstripe suit and speaking fluent, American-educated English, Zarif presented Iran’s case on nuclear and regional issues. He was frank about his disagreements with leaders of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and said Iran was ready to play a more active role in ending the war in Syria and in providing greater security in the Persian Gulf.

Zarif, seen by critics as the leader of Iran’s “charm offensive,” has become the most visible international face of a regime seeking a deal that would end punishing economic sanctions. He helped negotiate the breakthrough interim agreement reached last month in Geneva to freeze Iran’s nuclear program for six months. He said that in a follow-on comprehensive agreement, Iran would affirm its commitment to a peaceful nuclear program. But he didn’t provide specific responses to administration concerns about activities the U.S. argues aren’t consistent with a civilian program.

On enrichment, for example, Zarif insisted that Iran could continue its domestic program with some limits and greater transparency. “We do not see any reason now that we have put so much time and effort in it, and brought [the West] to the point of abandoning the illusion of zero enrichment in Iran, why should we accept anything less.”

As for Iran’s heavy-water reactor at Arak that would produce plutonium that could be reprocessed as nuclear fuel, Zarif explained: “We cannot roll back the clock 20 years and ask Iran to simply get rid of a project that has been the subject of a great deal of human and materiel investment. However, there are various ways of making sure that this reactor will remain exclusively peaceful.”

Asked about a U.S. demand to close the enrichment facility at Fordow, built into a mountainside, Zarif said: “If you sit in Iran, and you see people having concerns about Fordow, the only conclusion you can draw is that they want to attack you.”

Zarif said he didn’t want to negotiate in public, and he argued that acceptable compromises could be found on such issues. But President Obama, pressed by Israel, has said he would reject an agreement that doesn’t reverse the Iranian program and ensure that it will be restricted to civilian uses only.

“We do not follow a policy of ambiguity; this is not our intention. We follow a policy of clarity — that we do not seek nuclear weapons,” Zarif said. “But we’re not going to accept diktats.”

Zarif acknowledged his recent public dispute with Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, about what Zarif said were Iran’s limited military capabilities. “I respect Gen. Jafari’s remarks, his views, and I expect him to have differences of views with me,” he said. He also noted that some hard-liners in Iran who oppose a deal with the West “have asked for my removal.”

But Zarif insisted that he and President Hassan Rouhani lead a consensual process in all areas of foreign policy, including regional issues such as Syria. “Iran believes there is no military solution for Syria,” Zarif said, noting that he is ready to attend a so-called Geneva 2 conference to seek a political settlement, so long as there are no preconditions for the removal of President Bashar al-Assad.

“We’re living at a crossroad,” the Iranian foreign minister said. But he rejected former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger’s argument that Iran must become “a nation rather than a cause.” He argued that, like America, Iran wanted to press both its values and its interests. America isn’t alone in seeing itself as an “extraordinary nation,” Zarif said: “We do, too.”

Obama%27s efforts to get support for action in Syria at the G20 conference came to nothing.

Polls show Americans are against a military strike.

If I were George W. Bush or Mitt Romney%2C I%27d be sorely tempted to laugh.

Remember that dumb cowboy George W. Bush, who alienated all our allies and dragged us into wars of choice in the Mideast? And remember that goofball Mitt Romney, whom Joe Biden a year ago accused of wanting to go to war in Syria?

Both of them must be having a big laugh over the way things are going for Obama now. When I wrote last week on our bumbling Syria diplomacy, it seemed that things couldn't possibly go further downhill. Boy, was I wrong.

Last week, it seemed our only ally was France. But now the French are having second thoughts. Obama's efforts to get support at the G20 conference came to nothing. Even the pope is undercutting him.

Meanwhile, at home, polls show Americans are against a strike, and Obama is facing double-digit defections among Democrats in the Senate. The outlook for passage in the House, meanwhile, looks so bad that a resolution to authorize war may not even make it to a vote. If it's sure to fail, why force members -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- to go on record? You can bet they don't appreciate Obama putting them in this position. The Pentagon isn't happy, and even The Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates, a reliable Obama supporter, calls his policy ""dumb.""

Some critics are even comparing the collapse of American influence under Obama to the end of the Soviet Union. Well, that may be an exaggeration -- but Obama promised a ""fundamental transformation,"" after all.

At least Hollywood is still behind the president -- or, anyway, is mostly keeping quiet about its opposition because, as old-line Hollywood liberal Ed Asner reports, they ""don't want to feel anti-black."" So it's come to this -- while George W. Bush was savaged for ""bombing brown people,"" now if you're against bombing brown people you're ""anti-black.""

As I said, if I were George W. Bush or Romney, I'd be sorely tempted to laugh, because Obama's chickens are coming home to roost. Obama was elected after he and his party sowed distrust of U.S. military endeavors, mocked ""intelligence estimates"" about ""weapons of mass destruction,"" and suggested that anything the United States did in the region was probably somehow a scheme to benefit oil companies. Now Obama and his administration are shocked to find that when they go on about intelligence estimates and weapons of mass destruction, people don't take them seriously.

Likewise, Obama has repeatedly shown his disdain for Congress and his willingness to act without congressional approval in all sorts of areas, from ObamaCare implementation to gun control. So it's not surprising that members of Congress seem to be a bit . . . distant now that Obama suddenly wants them to bail him out of his unfortunate ""red line"" remark.

But I'd bet that Bush and Romney aren't actually laughing. That's because they're both serious men who understand international politics and who care for the future of the country. They no doubt understand that, as fun as it is to watch a political opponent twist in the wind due to his own ineptitude, the price will ultimately be paid not by Obama, but by the people of America.

Our diplomacy is a joke, our president is a laughing stock, our enemies are emboldened, and we've still got over three years of this to go. Nothing funny there at all, alas.

Is Glenn Greenwald endangering America?

To listen to U.S. security officials, the columnist who revealed secret surveillance by the U.S. National Security Administration has exposed to terrorists the methods that the American government uses to prevent attacks.

Greenwald rejected and took issue with that argument in an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Monday.

“I think that suggestion is so ludicrous that it’s actually an insult to the intelligence of the people at whom it’s directed,” he told Amanpour from Hong Kong, where the man who leaked intelligence on the NSA program is in self-imposed exile.

“Any terrorist that’s unaware that the government wants to [spy on them],” Greenwald said, “is a terrorist incapable of writing his own name, let alone detonating a bomb successfully on American soil.”

The identity of the leaker was revealed on Sunday as 29-year-old Edward Snowden, a contractor for the NSA with high-level security clearance.

Before Greenwald began publishing his articles in The Guardian, Snowden fled to Hong Kong, though his whereabouts are unknown since he checked out of his hotel Monday.

“I spent a long time trying to understand his motives,” Greenwald told Amanpour.

He said that Snowden had a choice of leaking information about the NSA program to a foreign intelligence agency or an adversary of the U.S., but chose instead to give it to the media.

“He felt like it was his duty as a human being to disclose it,” Greenwald said.

The American Government has begun a criminal investigation into Snowden’s leak.

“There are extremely invasive spying programs that the public still does not know about,” Greenwald said. “To the extent that we can shine light on them and bring transparency to them, consistent with national security, we fully intend to do so, and to do so as quickly as we can.”

(CNN) —

Two years after the end of the Iraq war, the U.S. State Department confirmed this week that it is providing the fragile country with sophisticated weapons and drones. Iraq needs help fighting against a growing and serious threat – al Qaeda.

For those who don’t avidly follow the complicated machinations of the globe’s top terror group, this could be confusing.

Hasn’t the line for years from the U.S. government and its allies been that al Qaeda is on the run, that its fiercest fighting ability has been weakened by U.S. strikes?

That truth is far more complex, of course. The terror group’s manpower has increased in recent years, it has gained control of more territory in North Africa and the Middle East and is taking a different approach to death, according to top lawmakers privy to high-level intelligence and experts who have observed al Qaeda’s activities since September 11.

A stake in Yemen

While al Qaeda suffered significant setbacks after Navy SEALs shot and killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, and drone strikes have taken out top terrorists along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, the terror group and its close allies have rebounded in Yemen, the Sinai region of Egypt, Libya, Iraq, and parts of east and west Africa, among other places.

Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, headquartered in Yemen, is particularly concerning.

CNN has learned of recent intercepts of messages among senior al Qaeda operatives in Yemen, but the messages don’t name specific targets. One source told CNN that the chatter suggested “active plotting.”

“There are multiple indications that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is plotting attacks both within Yemen, against U.S. and Western structures and overseas,” said Seth Jones, an analyst at Rand Corp. The Yemeni group is already notorious for sending an operative on board a flight into the United States on Christmas day in 2009 with explosives in his underwear.

Al Qaeda in Yemen “are still capable of conducting attacks” and particularly adept at “taking down aircraft,” Jones said.

Al Qaeda: We’re sorry about Yemen hospital attack

The U.S. has been fighting back, but not every strike has been successful. This month a drone failed to kill an al Qaeda planner believed to be behind a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa. Instead, the drone hit a wedding party, Yemeni officials said.

A powder keg in Syria

Al Qaeda-linked militants have established a formidable foothold in the complicated civil war in Syria.

There are up to 11,000 foreign fighters from 74 nations in the conflict that has raged since April 2011, according to the December report from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalism (ICSR).

The majority have traveled from other Arab countries, creating a significant risk of blowback when these fighters return home.

“The concern is that the al Qaeda networks of the future are being created in this jihadist melting pot,” said Paul Cruickshank, a CNN terrorism analyst who has specialized for years in studying al Qaeda.

READ MORE: Cruickshank: Concerns over al Qaeda’s resurgence

An increasing number of them are from Europe – approaching two thousand, according to the ICSR, an unprecedented number, according to experts.

The United States and its allies fear that those fighters will be able to more easily launch attacks in their homelands or against Western targets, said Cruickshank.

“Syria is now the fuel for the jihadist movement and some of the most experienced operatives from Pakistan and Iraq have relocated there,” he said. “Syria has helped al Qaeda rebuild its operations in the Arab world, which has always been its intention anyway.”

READ MORE: Al Qaeda-linked group strengthens hold in northern Syria

Cruickshank saiid it’s especially scary to consider that al Qaeda members in Syria could receive training in the terror group’s traditionally sophisticated bomb-making and detonating courses.

Consider that the Boston Marathon bombing utilized what are considered low-grade explosives, he said. Al Qaeda generally sets the bar higher for destruction on par with the London attacks in the summer of 2005.

“It’s possible that new recruits could get training like what we saw al Qaeda in Pakistan giving – showing people how to make high-explosive bombs made of chemicals bought at beauty or home goods stores and detonate them.” Cruickshank said. “All they would need to do is return to Europe, buy what they need to and carry out an attack.”

Flashpoint partners, a U.S outfit that tracks jihadist websites, provided the terror analyst with an al Qaeda video that emerged on Christmas day. It features the Boston bombing and also the slaying of a London soldier in May of this year.

The Christmas Day-published video is an updated English language version of al Qaeda’s central video “You are Only Responsible for Yourself” which was first issued in June 2011. That video featured senior al Qaeda leaders including Ayman al Zawahiri and American-born al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn.

It calls for al Qaeda sympathizers to take things into their own hands and launch attacks in the West.

Both attacks are called models for the future.

An elusive peace in Iraq

Syria borders Iraq. Though the causes of violence in Iraq are many-fold, al Qaeda’s presence there, aided by Syria’s weakened state, is being felt among the fragile nation’s law enforcement and civilian population. Between January and November 2013, more than 7,000 Iraqi civilians were killed, including 952 Iraqi Security Forces, according to the United Nations.

April 2013 was Iraq’s deadliest month in five years.

Since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Sunni Arabs have been politically marginalized and Shiites, who represent a majority of Iraqis, have emerged with more power. That has led to sectarian violence – constant bombings and various smaller attacks. Al Qaeda is targeting Shiites in an attempt to plunge the country into another civil war and hopes to carve out a larger zone of territory under their control on either side of the Syria-Iraq border, Cruickshank says.

Smaller bursts of violence are the hallmark of al Qaeda’s new approach to terrorism, according to the chairs of the Senate and House intelligence committees who appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” in early December.

CNN’s Candy Crowley asked House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Rogers if he thought Americans were safer in 2013 than they were a few years ago.

He insisted they’re not, and that U.S. intelligence and security officials are having a tougher time than ever before trying to stop so many smaller-scale plots.

But does that translate into a threat specifically in the U.S.? To Rogers, it does.

“All of them have at least some aspiration to commit an act of violence in the United States or against Western targets all around the world,” he said.

However, CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen said earlier this month that the data on al Qaeda-linked or influenced militants indicted in the United States suggests that the threat of terrorism has actually markedly declined over the past couple of years.

At least for the moment, “these al Qaeda groups in Syria and Iraq are completely focused on overthrowing the Assad regime (in Syria) or attacking what they regard as the Shia-dominated government of Iraq. And, at least so far, these groups have shown no ability to attack in Europe, let alone in the United States,” he said in a column published on CNN.com.

Bergen: Are we hyping the terror risk?

The new Al Qaeda

What motivates al Qaeda’s newest members?

Sen. Dianne Feinstein told Crowley she thought there is still a pervasive belief among extremists that a caliphate – an Islamic state governed strictly by Sharia, or Islamic, law – is possible and should be fought for.

“I think there is a real displaced aggression in this very fundamentalist, jihadist, Islamic community,” she said. “And that is that the west is responsible for everything that goes wrong…I see more groups, more fundamentalists, more jihadists more determined to kill to get to where they want to get.”

Cruickshank points to the disappointment many young men felt over what they perceive as a failed Arab Spring revolution.

(Al Qaeda is still mostly comprised of younger men, though women are taking backseat support roles, he added.)

In 2011, tens of thousands of protesters staged a revolution in Egypt that unseated longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak. Mohamed Morsy, then a Muslim Brotherhood leader, was elected president in the country’s first democratic election in 2012. He was deposed by the military last summer.

This week Egypt’s military-backed government declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group. On Thursday, dozens of members of the Islamist party were arrested and their property seized, authorities said.

“The great hope of the Arab Spring was that it would liberate the political system. But instead it resulted in increased repression against Islamists,” Cruickshank said. “For a lot of young men going into Syria, in some respect, it’s a reaction to that feeling.”

“They see the Egyptian and Syrian government as tarred with the same brush. They see those governments as blocking the true flourishing of Islam.”

USA TODAY

Bolivian President Evo Morales%27 plane was rerouted to Austria

France%2C Portugal and Spain refused to let it cross their airspace

Morales is now on his way back to Bolivia after Snowden was not found

Bolivia has called a decision by European authorities to force a jet carrying President Evo Morales to land in Austria and undergo a search for former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden an ""act of aggression.""

The plane carrying Morales departed Europe for Bolivia on Wednesday after being diverted to Vienna over suspicions it was carrying NSA leaker Snowden, but Austria's deputy chancellor confirmed Wednesday that Snowden was not on the plane.

Morales had been flying back to Bolivia from Moscow, where he was attending a summit on gas. Snowden is thought to be at Moscow's international airport.

Bolivia said it would file a complaint to the United Nations over a blockade by France, Spain and Italy that saw them deny airspace to the presidential jet, Bolivia's ambassador to the United Nations said Wednesday.

Sacha Llorentty Soliz told reporters he had no doubt that the orders to divert Morales' plane came from the United States, and said the search was a ""violation of international law"" as well as an aggressive act.

In a midnight press conference in La Paz, Bolivian Vice President Alvaro Garcia described Morales as being ""kidnapped by imperialism"" in Europe.

There was no immediate U.S. or European response.

Bolivia said Spain agreed to allow the plane to refuel in the Canary Islands on its way back home Wednesday — but only if Bolivian authorities agreed to allow it to be inspected.

EU Transport spokeswoman Helen Kearns said it is up to national governments to allow or refuse planes entry into their airspace. She said it's unclear what happened with the Bolivian plane and whether or not it was refused access and why.

Earlier, Russian news agencies quoted Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Snowden, unhappy with the conditions Russia has set, had taken back his application for asylum there.

Of the list of 21 countries where Snowden has applied for asylum, at least 10 have either turned him down flatly or said his request was invalid because he was not physically on their territory. The rest are pending.

Separately, the French government wants major trade negotiations between the U.S. and the European Union suspended for two weeks amid anger over alleged U.S. eavesdropping on European allies.

Operated from a Predator surveillance drone, the radar system has collected evidence that Border Patrol agents apprehended fewer than half of the foreign migrants and smugglers who had illegally crossed into a 150-square-mile stretch of southern Arizona.

The number of “gotaways,” as the Border Patrol calls those who escape apprehension, is both more precise and higher than official estimates.

RELATED: Is the border secure?

According to internal reports, Border Patrol agents used the airborne radar to help find and detain 1,874 people in the Sonora Desert between Oct. 1 and Jan. 17. But the radar system spotted an additional 1,962 people in the same area who evaded arrest and disappeared into the United States.

In contrast, the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated in January that the Border Patrol had caught 64% of those who illegally crossed into the Tucson sector in 2011.

The new tally of unlawful border crossings could complicate White House efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform after Congress returns from recess next week.

The Obama administration contends America’s borders are more strictly policed than ever, with nearly 365,000 apprehensions last year. Republicans have demanded more guards, drones, fencing and other security measures before legal status is granted to the estimated 11 million people believed to have entered America illegally or overstayed their visas.

President Obama is scheduled to visit Mexico in early May, and efforts to maintain rigorous border security — to stop economic migrants moving north and American-made weapons flowing south — are likely to be among his priorities in discussions with Mexico’s newly elected president, Enrique Peña Nieto.

The new system is called Vader, for Vehicle Dismount and Exploitation Radar. It was borrowed from the Army’s Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland and has been deployed in Arizona since March 2012.

Michael Friel, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the Vader remained in a “preliminary testing phase.” He also said the method used in the agency’s internal reports to compare apprehensions to arrests was flawed because it didn’t include people who were detained after the airborne radar had left the area.

Officials warn that the radar would not work well near border towns and areas where migrants and smugglers can quickly load into a car and blend into highway traffic.

“There is no silver bullet in border technology,” Friel said.

The tests have gone well enough that the agency has asked Congress to allocate money to purchase two more Vader systems. Each system costs about $5 million per year to maintain and operate.

The Pentagon’s internal research and development group, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, helped design the Vader to aid U.S. forces in spotting insurgents burying improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan. Two of the systems are in use there.

The radar is sharp enough to detect and track individuals on foot from a Predator five miles overhead. It uses a synthetic aperture radar to collect high-contrast black-and-white images and to follow scores of moving targets in real time. The processed signals are transmitted from the drone to a ground station, where the figures are displayed as moving dots on a detailed map.

“It’s a match made in heaven for border security,” said a former U.S. law enforcement official.

He said the radar had helped Border Patrol agents watch migrants and smugglers gathering on the Mexican side of the border before they start trekking north. But not all of the agents are happy to get a precise head count for the first time of how many people they are missing.

“The rank-and-file guys are afraid it will make them look bad,” the official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the program are not public.

The system is being tested along with military-grade camera towers and surveillance blimps developed for use in Iraq and Afghanistan in an effort to provide more accurate coverage of remote border areas.

Most of the Vader flights have focused on a stretch of border flanked by desert and the craggy Baboquivari Mountains west of Nogales, Ariz. The radar is used three or four days a week, for eight to 12 hours a day.

“That is the kind of technology we would like to see all across the border,” Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, said in a telephone interview.

McCaul said he was briefed on the Vader during a visit to the border in Arizona on Feb. 18. He is writing a bill that would compel the Department of Homeland Security to write a national strategy that accurately measures the effectiveness of border security efforts.

“You can’t measure what you can’t see,” he said. “There is an awful lot we’re not seeing.”

Marshall Fitz, director of immigration policy for the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington with close ties to the White House, said linking immigration policy to illegal border crossings is a “political gimmick” designed to delay any real reforms.

No matter how many border agents or high-tech systems are deployed on the border, Fitz said, “you are never going to get to the point where you can raise the ‘Mission accomplished’ banner.”

Obama hits a wall in Berlin

The question of whether Barack Obama’s second term will be a failure was answered in the affirmative before his Berlin debacle, which has recast the question, which now is: Will this term be silly, even scary in its detachment from reality?

Before Berlin, Obama set his steep downward trajectory by squandering the most precious post-election months on gun-control futilities and by a subsequent storm of scandals that have made his unvarying project — ever bigger, more expansive, more intrusive and more coercive government — more repulsive. Then came Wednesday’s pratfall in Berlin.

There he vowed energetic measures against global warming (“the global threat of our time”). The 16-year pause of this warming was not predicted by, and is not explained by, the climate models for which, in his strange understanding of respect for science, he has forsworn skepticism.

Regarding another threat, he spoke an almost meaningless sentence that is an exquisite example of why his rhetoric cannot withstand close reading: “We may strike blows against terrorist networks, but if we ignore the instability and intolerance that fuels extremism, our own freedom will eventually be endangered.” So, “instability and intolerance” are to blame for terrorism? Instability where? Intolerance of what by whom “fuels” terrorists? Terrorism is a tactic of destabilization. Intolerance is, for terrorists, a virtue.

It is axiomatic: Arms control is impossible until it is unimportant. This is because arms control is an arena of competition in which nations negotiate only those limits that advance their interests. Nevertheless, Obama trotted out another golden oldie in Berlin when he vowed to resuscitate the cadaver of nuclear arms control with Russia. As though Russia’s arsenal is a pressing problem. And as though there is reason to think President Vladimir Putin, who calls the Soviet Union’s collapse “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,” is interested in reducing the arsenal that is the basis of his otherwise Third World country’s claim to great-power status.

Shifting his strange focus from Russia’s nuclear weapons, Obama said “we can . . . reject the nuclear weaponization that North Korea and Iran may be seeking.” Were Obama given to saying such stuff off the cuff, this would be a good reason for handcuffing him to a teleprompter. But, amazingly, such stuff is put on his teleprompter and, even more amazing, he reads it aloud.

Neither the people who wrote those words nor he who spoke them can be taken seriously. North Korea and Iran may be seeking nuclear weapons? North Korea may have such weapons. Evidently Obama still entertains doubts that Iran is seeking them.

In Northern Ireland before going to Berlin, Obama sat next to Putin, whose demeanor and body language when he is in Obama’s presence radiate disdain. There Obama said: “With respect to Syria, we do have differing perspectives on the problem, but we share an interest in reducing the violence.” Differing perspectives?

Obama wants to reduce the violence by coaxing Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, who is winning the war, to attend a conference at which he negotiates the surrender of his power. Putin wants to reduce the violence by helping — with lavish materiel assistance and by preventing diplomacy that interferes — Assad complete the destruction of his enemies.

Napoleon said: “If you start to take Vienna — take Vienna.” Douglas MacArthur said that all military disasters can be explained by two words: “Too late.” Regarding Syria, Obama is tentative and, if he insists on the folly of intervening, tardy. He is giving Putin a golden opportunity to humiliate the nation responsible for the “catastrophe.” In a contest between a dilettante and a dictator, bet on the latter.

Obama’s vanity is a wonder of the world that never loses its power to astonish, but really: Is everyone in his orbit too lost in raptures of admiration to warn him against delivering a speech soggy with banalities and bromides in a city that remembers John Kennedy’s “Ich bin ein Berliner” and Ronald Reagan’s “Tear down this wall”? With German Chancellor Angela Merkel sitting nearby, Obama began his Berlin speech: “As I’ve said, Angela and I don’t exactly look like previous German and American leaders.” He has indeed said that, too, before, at least about himself. It was mildly amusing in Berlin in 2008, but hardly a Noel Coward-like witticism worth recycling.

His look is just not that interesting. And after being pointless in Berlin, neither is he, other than for the surrealism of his second term.

(CNN) – The names of dozens of detainees held at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were released for the first time on Monday after a newspaper sued the federal government for the information.

The list identifies 46 inmates being held for “continued detention” at the facility, which President Barack Obama has vowed to close. The report was made public after a lawsuit from the Miami Herald. The Obama administration first acknowledged that detainees were being held indefinitely in Guantanamo in 2010, but didn't make their identities public until now.



As of Tuesday, 104 of the 166 current Guantanamo detainees are staging a hunger strike. They are protesting their treatment and indefinite detention, resulting in force feedings of 44, according to Capt. Robert Durand, a spokesperson for the Joint Task Force.

Durand said they ""do not comment on the detainees in Camp 7."" That camp holds 15 ""high-value detainees,"" so the accrual number of detainees on strike could be higher.

The list released Monday was the product of a 2010 federal review of the status of each detainee, which was commissioned by President Barack Obama as a step toward closing the facility.

Obama has recently renewed his vow to shut the prison established last decade to house suspected terrorists.

Of the 46 detainees listed for indefinite detention, the report shows that 26 are from Yemen, 10 are from Afghanistan, three are from Saudi Arabia, two each are from Libya and Kuwait, and one each are from Kenya, Somalia and Morocco.

Human rights groups have long protested the detention of suspected enemy fighters who haven’t been charged with crimes.

The government says the detainees are too dangerous to transfer but cannot be tried, characterizing them as war prisoners under the 2001 “Authorization for Use of Military Force Act.”

“It is fundamental to democracy that the public know the identities of the people our nation is depriving of liberty and why they are being detained,” said Dixon Osburn, the director of the Law and Security Program at the group Human Rights First.

“The United States has held some of the men at Guantanamo now for over a decade. Today’s revelation is welcome, though long overdue. The administration should use its authority under current law immediately to transfer the 86 detainees already cleared for transfer out of Guantanamo,"" Osburn said.

Of the 86 detainees cleared for transfer, 56 are from Yemen. Currently, a moratorium is in place on transferring prisoners back to Yemen, citing the country’s current security situation.

One of Obama’s initiatives in his new bid to close Guantanamo is lifting that ban.

After four days of talks that repeatedly appeared ready to collapse, officials announced that they had agreed on a six-month deal aimed at giving Iran limited sanctions relief in return for temporary curbs on its nuclear program.

The deal could ease the threat of war and reduce tension between the U.S. and Iran, but it could also prove difficult to implement, and the follow-up long-term agreement could be far more difficult to nail down, U.S. officials acknowledge.

“Iran, like any nation, should be able to access peaceful nuclear energy, but because of its record of violating its obligations, Iran must accept strict limitations on its nuclear program that make it impossible to develop a nuclear weapon,” President Obama said in a late-night statement aired from the White House.

“The burden is on Iran to prove to the world that its nuclear program will be exclusively for peaceful purposes,” Obama said.

Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said on his Twitter account at 3:03 a.m. Geneva time, “We have an agreement.”

The deal, described by Obama as “an important first step toward a comprehensive solution,” is intended to open the way for what is likely to be even tougher bargaining to reach a comprehensive agreement.

U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, speaking in Geneva, said that limiting Iran’s nuclear program would expand the time Tehran would need to reach a nuclear weapons capability.

“It will make our ally Israel safer,” he said in a news conference.

But the deal was quickly denounced by leading Republicans in Washington.

“Amazing what WH will do to distract attention from O-care,” Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said in a Twitter statement.

Obama administration officials have said an agreement would ease what has been long viewed as one of the world’s most urgent security challenges. Iran is believed by some experts to be close to acquiring bomb-making capability, and the administration has threatened to use force, if necessary, to prevent it from acquiring a nuclear weapon.

Even though the six countries and the new government in Iran were eager for a deal, they had clashed over a series of issues related to how closely supervised Iran’s huge nuclear program would be and how much relief it would get from the penalties that have been crushing its economy.

A senior U.S. official said the agreement would halt progress at nuclear facilities at Fordow and Natanz and the partially built heavy-water reactor at Arak. It also calls for more intrusive inspections of Iran’s nuclear facilities and for the “neutralization” of its medium-enriched uranium, which is considered a threat because it can be readily converted to bomb fuel.

Iranian news agencies said the deal recognized Iran’s “right to enrich” uranium, but U.S. officials denied that.

Zarif acknowledged after the announcement that the right demanded by Iran was not spelled out in the text of the agreement. But in a news conference, he said it did not need to be specified because it was Iranians’ inalienable right.

Under the deal, Iran will be allowed to continue producing low-enriched uranium, suitable for energy generation, and it won’t be required to send its nuclear material out of the country, as Western governments previously demanded, said the official Fars News Agency.

As part of the deal, Iran agreed not to install any additional centrifuges, and not to begin operating any of the thousands that are not yet operational. But the deal doesn’t require Iran to dismantle any of its centrifuges, a demand made by Israel.

The agreement will allow Iran to accumulate more low-enriched uranium, to eight tons from the current seven. But it also provides that by the end of the six-month period it must turn that extra material into an oxide form that makes it at least temporarily unusable as bomb fuel.

Sanctions on the use of gold and other precious metals in trading will be lifted, as will sanctions on insurance and the transportation industry.

But that easing will be temporary, and the six nations — the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany — have insisted that core sanctions blocking oil exports and banking transactions will remain in place.

Kerry said the easing of sanctions would be worth $5.7 billion to Iran — $4.2 billion in revenue from oil sales and $1.5 billion in revenue through easing of sanctions on precious metals and the transportation sector. But he said that the remaining penalties would deprive Iran of $14 billion to $16 billion during the six-month period.

Obama will issue an executive order to carry out the sanctions relief, meaning that he won’t have to seek Congress’ approval.

The president has long hoped that reaching out to the Iranian government, an adversary since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, could bear fruit. Administration officials hope the deal can open the way to a new relationship between the countries.

But it is likely to come under fire from Israel and other Mideast allies, which have expressed fear that an agreement would prove too lenient and would open the way for Iran to secretly acquire a nuclear weapons capability.

Congress could also seek to legislate conditions that could hobble the agreement.

Sen. Mark Steven Kirk (R-Ill.), a chief advocate for sanctions, said the agreement “appears to provide the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism with billions of dollars in exchange for cosmetic concessions that neither fully freeze nor significantly roll back its nuclear infrastructure.

“Furthermore, the deal ignores Iran’s continued sponsorship of terrorism, its testing of long-range ballistic missiles and its abuse of human rights,” he said.

White House officials made calls to Capitol Hill on Saturday evening as the news broke, a senior administration official said. The administration believes that lawmakers will see that this test of negotiations “is far preferable to the alternative,” the official said.

The official said the president planned to speak to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday.

The official also acknowledged that the U.S. had conducted separate bilateral discussions with the Iranians throughout the fall. He was responding to an Associated Press report that outlined secret talks between the two countries.

The official said those talks complemented rather than competed with the multinational negotiations. The conversations were an attempt to discuss “ideas that could then be merged” into the negotiations, the official said.

Ali Vaez, an Iran specialist at International Crisis Group in Istanbul, Turkey, though a strong supporter of the diplomatic effort, said he thought the next round of negotiations may prove “almost impossible.”

Zarif said at the news conference that the deal was “an important achievement. But it’s a first step.”

He said the two sides had agreed to create a special commission to oversee the new restrictions on the nuclear program and the easing of sanctions.

“I hope the outcome of this process, in addition to the resolution of the nuclear issue, will be to take concrete steps in the restoration of confidence, particularly the confidence of the Iranian people toward the West,” Zarif said. “That would be a new beginning.”

Asked whether the deal had averted the threat of war, he said, “If we have been able to prevent an illegal action, that will be a major accomplishment.”

The agreement was announced during the third round of talks in the last five weeks. Negotiators for both sides have been alternatively expressing confidence that they were on the edge of a deal and warning that talks might be broken off.

Iran has been resistant to accepting curbs on its nuclear program, which its citizens view as a sign of the country’s technological prowess. From 2003 until this year, Iran showed little interest in acceding to the wishes of the United Nations Security Council to accept limits on its program.

But Iran’s tone shifted in June, after Hassan Rouhani unexpectedly won the presidency with a mandate to ease the crushing economic pressure.

Advertisement

Rouhani was open to the Obama administration’s diplomatic outreach and spoke on the phone with the president in September, the first time the country’s leaders had spoken in 34 years.

Kerry said it was not yet time to begin considering other steps to improve the U.S.- Iran relationship. “It’s too early for us to talk about other things,” said Kerry. “It’s just not right.”

Iran’s goodwill has to be proved “by the actions that it takes,” he said.

http://news.yahoo.com/exclusive-snowden-persuaded-other-nsa-workers-passwords-sources-030552654.html,,[],Exclusive: Snowden persuaded other NSA workers to give up passwords - sources,"By Mark Hosenball and Warren Strobel WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden used login credentials and passwords provided unwittingly by colleagues at a spy base in Hawaii to access some of the classified material he leaked to the media, sources said. A handful of agency employees who gave their login details to Snowden were identified, questioned and removed from their assignments, said a source close to several U.S. government investigations into the damage caused by the leaks. Snowden may have persuaded between 20 and 25 fellow workers at the NSA regional operations center in Hawaii to give him their logins and passwords by telling them they were needed for him to do his job as a computer systems administrator, a second source said. The revelation is the latest to indicate that inadequate security measures at the NSA played a significant role in the worst breach of classified data in the super-secret eavesdropping agency's 61-year history. Reuters reported last month that the NSA failed to install the most up-to-date, anti-leak software at the Hawaii site before Snowden went to work there and downloaded highly classified documents belonging to the agency and its British counterpart, Government Communication Headquarters. It is not clear what rules the employees broke by giving Snowden their passwords, which allowed the contractor access to data that he was not authorized to see. Snowden worked at the Hawaii site for about a month last spring, during which he got access to and downloaded tens of thousands of secret NSA documents. COVERING TRACKS ""In the classified world, there is a sharp distinction between insiders and outsiders. If you've been cleared and especially if you've been polygraphed, you're an insider and you are presumed to be trustworthy,"" said Steven Aftergood, a secrecy expert with the Federation of American Scientists. ""What agencies are having a hard time grappling with is the insider threat, the idea that the guy in the next cubicle may not be reliable,"" he added. Officials with the NSA and the Office of Director of National Intelligence declined to comment due to a criminal investigation related to Snowden, who disclosed previously secret U.S. government mass surveillance programs while in Hong Kong in June and then fled to Russia where he was granted temporary asylum. People familiar with efforts to assess the damage to U.S. intelligence caused by Snowden's leaks have said assessments are proceeding slowly because Snowden succeeded in obscuring some electronic traces of how he accessed NSA records. The sources did not know if the NSA employees who were removed from their assignments were given other duties or fired. While the U.S. government now believes it has a good idea of all the data to which Snowden could have accessed, investigators are not positive which and how much of that data Snowden actually downloaded, the sources said. Snowden and some of his interlocutors, such as former Guardian writer Glenn Greenwald, have said that Snowden provided NSA secrets only to media representatives such as Greenwald, filmmaker Laura Poitras, and a reporter with the British newspaper. They have emphatically denied that he provided any classified material to countries such as China or Russia. The revelation that Snowden got access to some of the material he leaked by using colleagues' passwords surfaced as the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill intended in part to tighten security over U.S. intelligence data. One provision of the bill would earmark a classified sum of money - estimated as less than $100 million - to help fund efforts by intelligence agencies to install new software designed to spot and track attempts to access or download secret materials without proper authorization. The bill also requires that the Director of National Intelligence set up a system requiring intelligence contractors to quickly report to spy agencies on incidents in which data networks have been penetrated by unauthorized persons.

USA TODAY

MOSCOW — National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden is ""exhausted"" and misses his American girlfriend, but has settled into a safe, undisclosed location with the help of newly acquired American friends after getting temporary asylum in Russia, according to his lawyer.

Snowden received immigration papers on Thursday from his lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, and immediately jumped into a taxi with a pre-packed suitcase and headed into Moscow.

""Snowden is in a safe place. I didn't suggest it to him, it was his decision,"" Kucherena told Dozhd TV, RIA Novosti reports. ""He will decide for himself how to live his life from now on. He has friends with him, including Americans with whom he made contact via his friends from the United States when he was still in the (airport) transit zone.""

Snowden has also been assisted in Moscow by a WikiLeaks representative, Sarah Harrison.

Kucherena said the 30-year-old former defense contractor is ""exhausted"" and will need to go through a period of ""rehabilitation"" to get over the grueling experience since he arrived in Russia from Hong Kong on June 23.

""Snowden can live in a hotel or rent a flat in Russia,"" said Kucherena, according to RT.com. ""But the personal safety issue is a very serious one for him.""

Security levels are so high, Kucherena told Vesti FM radio, that Snowden ""can't go for a walk on Red Square or go fishing.""

The lawyer told Julia Ioffe of The New Republic that Snowden, after receiving the asylum papers. at first didn't seen to fully understand internally how his life had changed.

""Because he had been waiting for it for so long, he had been so worried,"" the lawyer told the magazine. ""He said, 'It can't be!' That he wouldn't believe it 'til he saw the documents. Then, of course, he was happy.""

Kucherena said that Russia has no plans to prevent Snowden from leaving the country at any moment, but added that he ""has no intention to travel abroad as of now.""

Snowden has been offered asylum by three Latin American countries — Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua — but has been unable to travel since the U.S. revoked his passport and charged him under the Espionage Act for leaking information to reporters about the NSA's worldwide surveillance and data-gathering networks.

He has said he went public with the information in order to ""correct this wrongdoing.""

In his only public statement since getting asylum, Snowden said in a statement issued through WikiLeaks: ""Over the past eight weeks we have seen the Obama administration show no respect for international or domestic law, but in the end the law is winning. I thank the Russian federation for granting me asylum in accordance with its laws and international obligations.""

In Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration is ""extremely disappointed"" with Russia's decision to grant him a one-year political asylum.

Carney also said that President Obama, who is scheduled to visit St. Petersburg, Russia, in early September for a G-20 summit, is undecided about a side trip to Moscow for private meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The Russians have said that they will not extradite Snowden, but have been assured by him that he will not leak any additional information harmful to the United States while he is on Russian territory.

Kucherena told The New Republic that Snowden has gotten ""a lot of job offers"" already in Russia.

Pavel Durov, founder of VKontakte, a Russian version of Facebook, said he would be pleased to have Snowden on board.

Otherwise, Snowden appears to be settling into life as an American ex-pat in Moscow, including local cuisine, such as the traditional Georgian bread with cheese.

""I brought him khachapuri — he really liked it,"" Kucherena told Vesti FM radio. He added that while Snowden likes Russian food, he didn't really have a chance to try it in the airport transit zone.

The young American is also aiming to get his social life back on track.

""When I told him about the people who were calling him, including girls, such Russian girls, he told me 'Anatoly, I still miss my girlfriend.'""

Julia Mills, a self-described acrobatic pole dancer who apparently had no advance warning that Snowden was leaving the country, has moved out of their home in Hawaii.

In a blog post purportedly written by Mills after Snowden's departure became public, she said, according to ABC News, ""My world has opened and closed all at once. Leaving me lost at sea without a compass."""

A number of senators, from both sides of aisle, appear to be pushing sanctions as a contingency plan in case the agreement on Iran's nuclear program falters. But some may not be willing to wait -- presenting a problem for the Obama administration, since the deal signed with Iran and five other nations guarantees no new sanctions for six months.

If the Senate gets impatient and plows ahead with new legislation, Obama could be forced to veto -- and risk being overridden.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was among those calling for the pursuit of additional sanctions now, arguing that the interim deal does little to take Iran off the nuclear course.

""There is now an even more urgent need for Congress to increase sanctions until Iran completely abandons its enrichment and reprocessing capabilities,"" Rubio said.

More On This...

Other senators want to continue to prepare sanctions legislation, but build into it a six-month window to let the current track play out.

""I expect that the forthcoming sanctions legislation to be considered by the Senate will provide for a six month window to reach a final agreement before imposing new sanctions on Iran, but will at the same time be immediately available should the talks falter or Iran fail to implement or breach the interim agreement,"" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said in a statement.

The deal reached over the weekend would ease roughly $7 billion worth of sanctions. In exchange, Iran would suspend parts of its nuclear program while diplomats try to work out a longer-term deal.

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told ""Fox News Sunday"" that Iran was celebrating because its deal with the U.S. and the five other world powers allows it to continue to enrich uranium while getting billions in crippling sanctions lifted.

""They're spiking the ball in the end zone,"" Corker said.

He also said his greatest concern was that the Obama administration wouldn't follow through on the terms of the deal -- including daily inspections on Iran's nuclear facilities and ensuring that the country sticks to new thresholds for nuclear enrichment -- below levels toward building a nuclear weapon.

He also repeatedly said he didn't want the interim deal to ""become the norm"" and suggested Congress is ready to reinstate sanctions and impose more.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also said Sunday that he'll continue to work with colleagues ""to keep the pressure on the Iranian regime, including by action on additional sanctions.""

California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, offered what appears to be some of the most unequivocal support for the deal.

""I support the agreement ... which I believe is a significant step toward solving one of the most difficult security challenges facing the world today,"" she said, while also expressing caution. ""By any standard, this agreement is a giant step forward and should not be undermined by additional sanctions at this time."""

A White House official said he “will discuss why the use of drone strikes is necessary, legal and just, while addressing the various issues raised by our use of targeted action.”

While Mr. Obama may not explicitly announce the shift in drones from the Central Intelligence Agency in his speech, since the agency’s operations remain formally classified, the change underscores a desire by the president and his advisers to balance them with other legal and diplomatic tools. The C.I.A., which has overseen the drone war in the tribal areas of Pakistan and elsewhere, will generally cede its role to the military after a six-month transition period as forces draw down in Afghanistan, officials said.

Drone strikes have already been decreasing in the past few years as targets have been killed and opposition has grown. John O. Brennan, the new C.I.A. director, has been eager to shift the agency more toward espionage, intelligence gathering and analysis and away from the paramilitary mission it has adopted since Sept. 11.

Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said that after more than a decade of war it was time to “rebalance” the missions of the Pentagon and C.I.A. “The policy is intended to refocus the activities of the intelligence community to collection, which is crucial,” he said.

But Mr. Obama’s moves may provoke criticism from some Republicans who say a law enforcement approach underestimates the continuing threat from terrorism. An aide to Representative Howard P. McKeon of California, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said his boss would insist on “concrete answers” about what Mr. Obama planned to do with “terrorists who are too dangerous to be released” from Guantánamo.

In his letter to Congressional leaders, Mr. Holder confirmed that the administration had deliberately killed Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical Muslim cleric who died in a drone strike in September 2011 in Yemen. Mr. Holder also wrote that United States forces had killed three other Americans who “were not specifically targeted.”

The American involvement in Mr. Awlaki’s death has been widely reported, but the administration until now had refused to confirm it. Likewise, Mr. Holder confirmed the government’s role in the deaths of Samir Khan, who was killed in the same strike, and Mr. Awlaki’s son, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, who died in another strike. The letter disclosed the death of a fourth American named Jude Kenan Mohammad but gave no further details."

USATODAY

War is expensive, and no one wants to risk American lives by fighting on the cheap. But in Afghanistan, the U.S. government's open checkbook has too often produced the sort of wasteful spending that can undermine public support for the war.

In the nearly 12-year-long fight, American taxpayers have spent nearly $93 billion on ""reconstruction,"" which includes everything from building schools to equipping the Afghan military and securing the government. That's about the same amount the U.S. government is spending this year on domestic highways, airports and other transportation projects.

How much of the Afghan spending has been wasted is unknown, but examples uncovered by John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, suggest that the amounts are substantial.

Some would be comical if they weren't so infuriating:

The Defense Department built a 64,000-square-foot, $34 million headquarters building in southwestern Afghanistan, even though a Marine commander said he didn't want or need it. The building has never been occupied and will likely be torn down without ever being used.

The Pentagon is spending more than $770 million to buy 18 Swiss turboprop planes and 30 Russian helicopters for Afghanistan's counternarcotics and counterterrorism air wing, despite a shortage of Afghan pilots capable of flying the aircraft and mechanics who can maintain them.

The Defense Department spent $11.5 million to build four incinerators for solid waste at a key U.S. military base. Sopko found that the two largest incinerators were not being used; instead, solid waste was being burned in an open pit, worsening the already bad air quality at the base.

U.S. officials hired an Afghan contractor so inept that the courthouse he built was unusable. The same contractor is bidding to, yes, tear the building down.

Other examples of mismanagement are anything but amusing:

The Pentagon hired Afghan contractors to install ""culvert-denial systems"" to stop the Taliban from planting explosive devices inside the culverts underneath roadways where U.S. troops travel. But contract officers rarely bothered to check on the work. The Afghan contractors often installed the grates incorrectly or not at all, contributing to the deaths of least two U.S. soldiers .

Despite repeated complaints, American contracts and money are going to about 60 Afghan contractors with ties to al-Qaeda or the Taliban, which means U.S. taxpayers could be helping to fund the enemy.

The Pentagon agrees with some of Sopko's findings but disputes others. Officials say the unneeded building, for example, represented $13 million of a $34 million contract. There's a plan to train pilots and mechanics for the helicopters and turboprops. The officials say they take oversight seriously and work hard at it.

If so, there's room for improvement. Afghanistan is unquestionably a tough place to operate — with a harsh security environment and often unreliable allies. But that's no excuse for serial breakdowns in basic planning, oversight and accountability. Who, for example, signed off on that unused building? The Defense Department can't say.

Congress has a role here, too, of course, because the appropriators provide the money in the first place, often in such great gobs that it seems no politician wants to be accused of having lost the war by giving the Pentagon too little.

Americans might think this will all be moot when U.S. troops leave Afghanistan next year, but not so fast: The spending in Afghanistan is set to go on long after the troops come home. If Pentagon officials expect continued backing for such spending, they'll have to do a better job of keeping it from going down a rat hole.

Gordon', 'Thomas Erdbrink']","In New Nuclear Talks, Technological Gains by Iran Pose Challenges to the West","GENEVA — Iran is expected to make an offer on Tuesday to scale back its effort to enrich uranium, a move that a year ago would have been a significant concession to the West. But Iran’s nuclear abilities have advanced so far since then that experts say it will take far more than that to assure the West that Tehran does not have the capacity to quickly produce a nuclear weapon.

With thousands of advanced centrifuges spinning and Iranian engineers working on a plant that will produce plutonium, which also can be used in a weapon, Iran’s program presents a daunting challenge for negotiators determined to roll back its nuclear activities.

Both sides enter the nuclear talks that begin here on Tuesday with inherent strengths and weaknesses. Iran walks in with a nuclear program that cannot easily be turned back, while the West has imposed sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy.

And if Iran is going to maintain the right to enrich uranium to even low levels, as it continues to insist it must, the West will surely demand highly intrusive inspections — far more than Iran has tolerated in the past. How these matters are resolved will go far in deciding the success or failure of the talks."
http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/snowden-live-chat-144220722.html,,[],Snowden: U.S. ‘not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me’,"Edward Snowden, America's most-wanted whistle-blower, says the truth about the government spying program he revealed will eventually come out, regardless of what happens to him.

""All I can say right now is the US Government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me,"" Snowden wrote in a live online chat with the Guardian on Monday. ""Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped.

The 29-year-old former defense contractor, who exposed the National Security Agency's massive domestic surveillance program after fleeing the United States, answered a series of questions submitted through the Guardian's website and Twitter (hashtag #AskSnowden).

First, Snowden stressed that his controversial leaks did not reveal any U.S. ""operations against legitimate military targets"":

I pointed out where the NSA has hacked civilian infrastructure such as universities, hospitals, and private businesses because it is dangerous. These nakedly, aggressively criminal acts are wrong no matter the target. Not only that, when NSA makes a technical mistake during an exploitation operation, critical systems crash. Congress hasn't declared war on the countries—the majority of them are our allies—but without asking for public permission, NSA is running network operations against them that affect millions of innocent people. And for what? So we can have secret access to a computer in a country we're not even fighting? So we can potentially reveal a potential terrorist with the potential to kill fewer Americans than our own Police? No, the public needs to know the kinds of things a government does in its name, or the ""consent of the governed"" is meaningless.

He was asked how many copies of the NSA documents he made, and ""if anything happens to you, do they still exist?""

[Related: Is Edward Snowden a hero or traitor?]

According to the U.K. newspaper, the hour-and-a-half chat was subject to Snowden's ""security concerns and also his access to a secure Internet connection."" Snowden did not disclose his location.

Story continues

Earlier this month, Snowden was interviewed by the Guardian's Glenn Greenwald in his hotel room in Hong Kong. After the paper revealed his identity (at his request), he reportedly checked out of the hotel and went into hiding.

""I carefully evaluated every single document I disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest,"" Snowden said in his original interview. ""There are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that I didn't turn over, because harming people isn't my goal. Transparency is.""

On Monday, Snowden was asked if he was ""suggesting that Manning indiscriminately dumped secrets into the hands of WikiLeaks"" and intended to harm people. Bradley Manning, whose trial by court-martial is in its third week, is a former Army intelligence analyst charged with aiding the enemy.

""No, I'm not,"" Snowden responded. ""WikiLeaks is a legitimate journalistic outlet and they carefully redacted all of their releases in accordance with a judgment of public interest. The unredacted release of cables was due to the failure of a partner journalist to control a passphrase. However, I understand that many media outlets used the argument that 'documents were dumped' to smear Manning, and want to make it clear that it is not a valid assertion here.""

[Also read: NSA whistle-blower’s girlfriend feels ‘adrift’]

He was asked to elaborate on how much ""direct access"" the NSA had to phone-call records and if analysts could listen to the content of domestic calls without a warrant.

""The reality is this: if an NSA, FBI, CIA, DIA, etc analyst has access to query raw SIGINT databases, they can enter and get results for anything they want. Phone number, email, user id, cell phone handset id (IMEI), and so on—it's all the same,"" Snowden replied. ""The restrictions against this are policy based, not technically based, and can change at any time. Additionally, audits are cursory, incomplete, and easily fooled by fake justifications.""

Under authorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Snowden continued, ""Americans’ communications are collected and viewed on a daily basis on the certification of an analyst rather than a warrant. They excuse this as 'incidental' collection, but at the end of the day, someone at NSA still has the content of your communications"":

All of it. IPs, raw data, content, headers, attachments, everything. And it gets saved for a very long time—and can be extended further with waivers rather than warrants.

Snowden was also asked why he did not fly directly to Iceland, where he told the Guardian he would have preferred to seek asylum:

Leaving the US was an incredible risk, as NSA employees must declare their foreign travel 30 days in advance and are monitored. There was a distinct possibility I would be interdicted en route, so I had to travel with no advance booking to a country with the cultural and legal framework to allow me to work without being immediately detained. Hong Kong provided that. Iceland could be pushed harder, quicker, before the public could have a chance to make their feelings known, and I would not put that past the current US administration.

Snowden, who said he had not had contact with the Chinese, scoffed at speculation that he would provide classified information to the Chinese or other governments in exchange for asylum.

""This is a predictable smear that I anticipated before going public, as the US media has a knee-jerk 'RED CHINA!' reaction to anything involving [Hong Kong] or the [People's Republic of China] and is intended to distract from the issue of US government misconduct,"" Snowden replied. ""Ask yourself: if I were a Chinese spy, why wouldn't I have flown directly into Beijing? I could be living in a palace petting a phoenix by now.""

He also responded to the argument, made by U.S. officials, that the NSA spy program has foiled dozens of terror plots:

Journalists should ask a specific question: since these programs began operation shortly after September 11th, how many terrorist attacks were prevented SOLELY by information derived from this suspicionless surveillance that could not be gained via any other source? Then ask how many individual communications were ingested to acheive that, and ask yourself if it was worth it. Bathtub falls and police officers kill more Americans than terrorism, yet we've been asked to sacrifice our most sacred rights for fear of falling victim to it.

Snowden thinks his revelation of the NSA spy program gives President Barack Obama ""an opportunity to appeal for a return to sanity, constitutional policy, and the rule of law rather than men. He still has plenty of time to go down in history as the President who looked into the abyss and stepped back, rather than leaping forward into it.""

Snowden added that he's become disillusioned with the public debate over his leak:"

(CNN) —

Barack Obama came to Washington to end wars. Not to start them.

That much was crystal clear only three months ago when Obama gave a keynote speech on May 23 at the National Defense University in Washington in which he called for an end to the “boundless war on terror” and “perpetual wartime footing” that has existed in the U.S. since 9/11.

Obama focused part of this speech on the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that Congress passed days after 9/11 and that gave President George W. Bush the authority to go to war in Afghanistan.

Obama looks to Congress to bolster legal case for Syria strike

No one in Congress who voted for this resolution at the time realized that he or she was in effect authorizing in Afghanistan what would become America’s longest war.

Nor did they realize that they were giving a virtual blank check to the president to wage covert U.S. wars in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen where, according to data compiled by the New America Foundation, thousands have been killed in CIA drone strikes with almost no input from Congress.

During his defense speech, Obama vowed to help end the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that set in motion the seemingly endless war the U.S. has been fighting since 2001.

Tim Hetherington for CNN Peter Bergen

This is some of the context of Obama’s decision to go to Congress to seek authorization for a military strike on Syria. Obama has wanted to leave office in 2016 as the president who had made it harder, not easier, for future presidents to go to war unilaterally without the input of Congress.

In going to Congress for authorization of any military operation in Syria, we see Obama the former constitutional law professor at work, but we also see Obama the pragmatist.

Opinion: Obama’s Syria dilemma

The Obama administration could have always made the argument in the past few days that it could justify attacking the regime of Bashar al-Assad on humanitarian grounds to prevent further massacres of the Syrian people with chemical weapons despite the fact that there was no international authorization for attacking Syria and no congressional resolution sanctioning such an attack.

But that argument would be a novel one as a matter of international law, and it would not be particularly compelling as a matter of domestic politics when the American public seems, at best, split on whether the U.S. should deploy force in Syria.

Unilateral U.S. military actions are, of course, generally uncontroversial after an attack on American targets by a foreign power or group.

President Bill Clinton didn’t seek congressional approval for the cruise missiles he launched at al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan in 1998 after the terrorist group’s attacks on two U.S. embassies in Africa.

Nor did President George H.W. Bush go to Congress to sign off on his invasion of Panama in 1989, which he authorized because a U.S, Marine had recently been killed there and tens of thousands of other Americans living in the country were purportedly at risk.

Opinion: U.S. needs U.N. approval on Syria

Syria hasn’t attacked any U.S. targets or citizens, so the argument that an attack on the Assad regime is designed to protect American interests or lives is moot.

That leaves the Obama administration with the option of extracting some kind of authorization for an attack from international bodies such as the United Nations, NATO or the Arab League.

As is now well-known, there isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell of getting a U.N. authorization since Russia and China have continuously made clear they would veto such a resolution.

There also seems little possibility, for the moment, that NATO will authorize a “humanitarian” mission as it did in Kosovo in 1999 to roll back Serbian aggression there. And even if there was such an authorization, right now a major NATO member, the United Kingdom, couldn’t participate because the British Parliament voted against such a mission on Thursday.

Indeed, NATO said Monday it wants a “firm international response” in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria, but that it won’t take any military action itself.

The Arab League, which signed off on the operation to topple Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, has so far not signaled a readiness to authorize war against Syria. The League said the world community should take action against those responsible for the use of chemical weapons but did not specify if it would endorse military action by the U.S. or other parties. That said, the usually hypercautious Saudis publicly urged war on Sunday.

In going to Congress for the Syria authorization, we see not only the former constitutional law professor and pragmatist in Obama, but also the calculated risk taker.

On matters of considerable importance where the potential payoff is large, Obama has shown he is willing to take risks. Think no further than his decision two years ago to authorize a Navy SEAL raid to capture or kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, a raid he undertook against the advice of Vice President Joe Biden and then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. If that operation had gone poorly, as a number of Obama’s top national security officials believed it could, Obama might now be splitting his time between Chicago and Hawaii.

For Obama, a congressional authorization on the use of force in Syria would help him if he needs to authorize additional military actions down the road in Syria. It would also help him if he feels compelled to go to war with Iran. Of course, if he doesn’t get such an authorization, he will endure the same kind of humiliation that British Prime Minster David Cameron has just gone through in Parliament.

Is it ‘High Noon’ for Obama on Syria?

Obama has, however, no doubt tried to game out how this vote might play out.

He probably calculates that for Republican skeptics in Congress, they will have to explain to the American public why it is that they will not sanction military action on Syria after its large-scale use of chemical weapons while they continue to describe Syria’s closest ally, Iran, and its nuclear weapons program – which still has yet to produce any nuclear weapons– as a grave threat to the world.

We can be sure that in the next days, the administration will make the argument that if you let Syria take a pass on its large-scale and repeated use of chemical weapons, you can forget any chance of slowing or ending Iran’s nuclear program, something that is a matter of great importance for much of the Republican Party.

For those on the left of the Democratic Party in Congress who are generally skeptical of U.S. military actions, Obama can essentially ask, “If not now, when?” At what point will self-described liberals intervene to stop the use of weapons so vile that they have been banned by the civilized world for almost a century?

USA TODAY

Deal capped a series of events that seemed unlikely at beginning of year

Israel%2C Persian Gulf nations remain skeptical

Obama warns%2C %22we will turn off the relief%2C and ratchet up the pressure%22 if Iran doesn%27t meet commitments.

With the historic announcement out of Geneva on Saturday that Iran has agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for an easing of sanctions, President Obama scored one of the most unlikely — and potentially most meaningful — foreign policy victories of his time in office.

The capture of Osama bin Laden by Navy SEALs was thrilling and brought some closure to many Americans' collective grief over the Sept. 11 attacks, but the al-Qaeda leader posed a limited threat to American security after escaping Tora Bora, Afghanistan, in 2001.

By ending the Iraq War in his first term, Obama followed through on closing out an unpopular war and fulfilling a 2008 campaign pledge, but the endgame was inevitable and expected.

Just six months ago, it was close to fantasy for even some of the most optimistic Iran watchers that Tehran would be willing to come to the negotiation table with world powers, let alone the country it once deemed the ""Great Satan.""

This unlikely diplomatic route started with an exchange of letters between Obama and Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, this summer, followed with a telephone call between the two leaders earlier this year, and culminated with the agreement that was nailed down in the middle of the night in Geneva. (The White House also confirmed after the agreement was reached that senior administration officials secretly met on several occasions with Iranian officials in recent months.)

In his brief comments to Americans late Saturday to announce the interim agreement, Obama made clear that this was ""just a first step"" but an ""important first step.""

""Today, that diplomacy opened up a new path toward a world that is more secure — a future in which we can verify that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful, and that it cannot build a nuclear weapon,"" Obama said.

It's also remarkable that the Obama administration appears to have gotten most of the concessions they were seeking from Iran going into the Geneva talks. That's evidence, the White House notes, that demonstrates that years of sanctions Obama and Congress pressed on Tehran did the trick.

The concessions by Iran are meaningful. As the president noted, Iran has committed to halting certain levels of enrichment, and and cannot use its next-generation centrifuges — which are used for enriching uranium. Iran has agreed to halt work at its plutonium reactor and new inspections will be made of Iran's nuclear facilities, so the international community can make certain that Iran is keeping up their end of the bargain.

In return, the U.S. and international partners will provide ""limited, temporary, targeted, and reversible relief to Iran."" The Obama administration said on Saturday following Obama's announcement that the sanctions relief amounts to $6 billion to $7 billion — significant but hardly giving up the farm.

.

Going into this weekend's talks, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle — not to mention Israel and many Arab allies — have expressed an enormous amount of skepticism. After the deal was brokered, White House officials immediately began a round of calls to lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill to try to begin easing concerns about the interim agreement and warn that Congress enacting new sanctions would derail the agreement.

The White House stresses that Obama is entering the deal with his eyes wide open.

""The U.S. and other P5+1 nations won't impose any new sanctions during the interim agreement, but the broader architecture of sanctions remains in place and we will continue to enforce them vigorously,"" he said Saturday night .

""And if Iran does not fully meet its commitments during this six-month phase, we will turn off the relief, and ratchet up the pressure,"" Obama warned.

But if Iran plays ball and honors their commitment, the deal could point the way out of years of isolation for Tehran and make a complicated part of the world safer.

""Now, we must use the months ahead to pursue a lasting and comprehensive settlement that would resolve an issue that has threatened our security — and the security of our allies — for decades,"" Obama said. ""It won't be easy. Huge challenges remain ahead.""

And if this interim deal leads to a comprehensive solution and a definitive endgame, the pay off to American — and international — security will be huge."

USA TODAY

Interpol has issued a global security alert calling for increased vigilance for terrorist activity after suspected al-Qaeda involvement in prison escapes including those in Iraq, Libya and Pakistan.

The international police organization says prison breakouts have occurred in nine Interpol member countries in the past month alone and requests the agency's 190 member countries' assistance to figure out whether such events are linked, the group said in a statement on its website Saturday.

Interpol's alert comes a day after the State Department issued a global travel alert because of an al-Qaeda terrorist threat, saying the potential for terrorism is particularly strong in the Middle East and North Africa. That travel alert goes through Aug. 31.

The U.S. also announced this week that it would close more than a dozen embassies and consulates throughout the Muslim world on Sunday, and possible longer.

The full statement from Interpol's alert reads:

Following a series of prison escapes across nine INTERPOL member countries in the past month alone, including in Iraq, Libya and Pakistan, the INTERPOL General Secretariat headquarters has issued a global security alert advising increased vigilance.

With suspected Al Qaeda involvement in several of the breakouts which led to the escape of hundreds of terrorists and other criminals, the INTERPOL alert requests the Organization's 190 member countries' assistance in order to determine whether any of these recent events are coordinated or linked.

INTERPOL is asking its member countries to closely follow and swiftly process any information linked to these events and the escaped prisoners. They are also requested to alert the relevant member country and INTERPOL General Secretariat headquarters if any escaped terrorist is located or intelligence developed which could help prevent another terrorist attack.

Staff at INTERPOL's 24-hour Command and Coordination Centre and other specialized units are also prioritizing all information and intelligence in relation to the breakouts or terrorist plots in order to immediately inform relevant member countries of any updates.

August is the anniversary of violent terrorist incidents in Mumbai, India and Gluboky, Russia as well as in Jakarta, Indonesia. This week also marks the 15th anniversary of the US Embassy bombings in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in which more than 200 mostly African citizens were killed and 4,000 others injured.

In recent years, terrorist attacks focusing on diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan, Greece, India, Kenya, Libya, Pakistan, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tanzania, Turkey and Yemen have also resulted in hundreds of casualties of all nationalities.

The US State Department has also issued a global travel alert in response to credible intelligence suggesting that Al-Qaeda and affiliated organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks between now and 31 August, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. In addition to the US authorities announcing the one-day closure of more than 20 diplomatic missions on Sunday 4 August, the UK Foreign Office has also confirmed the closure of the British embassy in Yemen on 4 and 5 August.

Story highlights NEW: Iran's foreign minister says Iran retains the right to nuclear technology NEW: But it does not retain the right to enrich uranium, Secretary of State John Kerry says The deal includes substantial limitations to prevent the creation of nuclear weapons, Obama says The deal follows marathon talks that stretched into early Sunday morning

(CNN) —

A historic deal was struck early Sunday between Iran and six world powers over Tehran’s nuclear program that slows the country’s nuclear development program in exchange for lifting some sanctions while a more formal agreement is worked out.

The agreement – described as an “initial, six-month” deal – includes “substantial limitations that will help prevent Iran from creating a nuclear weapon,” U.S. President Barack Obama said in a nationally televised address.

The deal, which capped days of marathon talks, addresses Iran’s ability to enrich uranium, what to do about its existing enriched uranium stockpiles, the number and potential of its centrifuges and Tehran’s “ability to produce weapons-grade plutonium using the Arak reactor,” according to a statement released by the White House.

Iran also agreed to provide “increased transparency and intrusive monitoring of its nuclear program,” it said.

There was no immediate reaction from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has consistently asked the West to be wary of any deals with Iran.

However, Israeli Intelligence Minister Yubal Steinitz reiterated the Israeli government stance when he said Sunday morning that the last-second amendments put into the agreement are “far from satisfactory.”

“This agreement is still bad and will make it more difficult than before to achieve an appropriate solution in the future,” he said.

Obama warned that if Tehran violates terms of the deal, “We will turn off the relief and ratchet up the pressure.”

You can be sure that President Obama will speak to Prime Minister Netanyahu” on Sunday about the Iran agreement,

A senior administration official said Obama will speak with Netanyahu sometime Sunday.

“Ultimately, we understand why Israel is particularly skeptical about Iran,” the official said, adding, “This is not simply about trusting the Iranian government. There are strict verification measures.”

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called the deal an opportunity “to avert an unnecessary crisis.”

Zarif said he hopes the nuclear agreement will lead to “concrete steps” to improve relations between Iran and Western powers.

As part of the deal, according to Zarif, Iran retains the right to nuclear technology, including the enriching of uranium under the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons – which requires it not to create nuclear weapons or enable other countries to obtain them.

Iran has agreed to what U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry described as “unprecedented international monitoring” of its nuclear program.

“The first step, let me be clear, does not say that Iran has a right to enrich uranium,” Kerry said, appearing to contradict claims earlier by Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi.

Araghchi – on Twitter feed commonly attributed to him by Iranian media – said that “our enrichment program was recognized.”

In exchange for Iran’s concessions, sanctions on its oil revenues will be eased. But Kerry said the agreement does not roll back the “vast majority of the sanctions that are currently in place.”

The deal was formally announced by Catherine Ashton, the EU’s foreign policy chief, in Geneva where the foreign ministers representing Iran, the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany were meeting.

But closed-door negotiations had been taking place for a while.

A senior administration official told CNN that in the months leading up to the Geneva talks, U.S. and Iranian officials held private, previously unknown discussions to generate ideas for the wider P5+1 negotiations.

The official said talks began after Hassan Rouhani was elected Iran’s president, and that as the discussions were occurring, U.S. officials were briefing the P5+1 partners. The official suggested other partners were meeting with the Iranians and briefing the U.S. about the progress of those discussions.

The Iran nuclear deal is a first step requiring actions by both sides, which have “a strong commitment to negotiate a final comprehensive solution,” Ashton said.

According to a statement released by the White House, the deal halts Tehran’s nuclear program, including halting the development at the Arak reactor and requiring all of the uranium enriched to 20% – close to weapons-grade – to be diluted so it cannot be converted for military purposes.

The Arak heavy water reactor under construction southwest of Tehran had been a sticking point in earlier negotiations.

For years, Iran and Western powers have left negotiating tables in disagreement, frustration and at times open animosity.

But the diplomatic tone changed with the transfer of power after Iran’s election this year, which saw President Hassan Rouhani replace Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Caustic jabs at the United States and bellicose threats toward Israel were a hallmark of Ahmadinejad’s foreign policy rhetoric.

He lambasted the West over the economic sanctions crippling Iran’s economy and at the same time, pushed the advancement of nuclear technology in Iran.

Rouhani has struck up a more conciliatory tone and made the lifting sanctions against his country a priority.

Despite the sanctions, Iran today has 19,000 centrifuges and is building more advanced ones, according to Mark Hibbs, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

The diplomatic gridlock between Iran and the West seemed immovable for decades. But on Sunday, diplomats made history when Iran and six world powers came together on an agreement over Iran’s nuclear program.

We Finally Have An Answer,"This morning I heard something that prospectively fleshed out an important part of Secretary Kerry's presentation a few hours later. With that I think I'm officially off the fence.

This morning on NPR retired Gen. Jack Keane explained something that cause me to change my mind. It was alluded to in John Kerry's speech this morning in which Kerry stated,



We know that the regime was specifically determined to rid the Damascus suburbs of the opposition, and it was frustrated that it hadn’t succeeded in doing so.

But the details of what Kerry was saying were not included in his speech. That detail was provided this morning by Gen. Keane.

Keane said that Assad's regime has been trying to clear the rebels from this Damascus suburb for some time without success using aircraft. Then a few weeks ago the rebels received a shipment of arms from Saudi Arabia that included shoulder fired antiaircraft weapons. Using those weapons the rebels shot down two of Assad's aircraft. Since then, no aircraft have flown. Instead, Assad tried continual barrages of conventional artillery but had no luck in dislodging the rebels. That is why he decided to use chemical weapons.

I have thought that the use of chemical weapons would be suicidal for Assad and that most regimes are not suicidal. That is why I was highly skeptical that Assad had use these weapons, believing it equally likely that this was a disinformation campaign. This had the feeling of a Syrian version of the Iraq curveball exercise, where the anti-Hussein factions used every conceivable form of deceit to dupe us into invading. However, it is not suicidal to use chemical weapons when they are your only choice in defeating an enemy. That is why Saddam Hussein use them when he was losing the war against Iran and apparently that is why Assad is using them now.

As a general matter I agree that ""dead is dead."" Generally it makes no difference what the means of your demise is. But chemical weapons are different in the sense that their affects are usually indiscriminate. And in this case they are being used deliberately against civilian targets. Additionally, the method of death can be important if it is one that causes long periods of extended suffering. That is what chemical weapons do. They often don't kill but leave the victims maimed. In the case of blister agents, they also leave the victims horribly disfigured and in terrible agony.

Since Assad has apparently decided that he can use chemical weapons I am now convinced it is incumbent upon someone, anyone, and if no one else, the United States, to tell him no. You are violating international norms and you will be held to account. You must understand that he cannot adopt a strategy of using chemical weapons against his people.

I believe the president makes this decision very reluctantly. I suspect that he may see it as the moral equivalent of Rwanda. But while he makes this decision reluctantly, I'm certain he feels he has no other choice.

Additional note. I did not write about Keane's NPR interview this morning because, though thought provoking, I had never heard it before. While he often has good inside information I'm a real skeptic when it comes to his policy judgements and recommendations. But confirmation came for me in Secretary Kerry's speech. He was briefly saying what Keane had said in more detail. That put me over the edge."

http://news.yahoo.com/top-us-officials-meet-discuss-embassy-threat-012212625.html,,[],Top US officials meet to discuss embassy threat,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Top U.S. officials met Saturday to review the threat of a terrorist attack that led to the weekend closure of 21 U.S. embassies and consulates in the Muslim world and a global travel warning to Americans. President Barack Obama was briefed following the session, the White House said.

Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, led the meeting and then joined Lisa Monaco, Obama's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism, in briefing the president, the White House said in a statement.

""The president has received frequent briefings over the last week on all aspects of the potential threat and our preparedness measures,"" according to the statement.

Among those at the meeting Saturday afternoon were the secretaries of state, defense and homeland security and the directors of the FBI, CIA and the National Security Agency, according to the White House. Also attending was Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

In an interview Friday with ABC News, Dempsey said officials had determined there was ""a significant threat stream"" and that the threat was more specific than previous ones. The ""intent is to attack Western, not just U.S. interests,"" he said.

The global travel warning was the first such alert since an announcement before the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

The warning comes less than a year since the deadly September attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, and with the Obama administration and Congress determined to prevent any similar breach of an American embassy or consulate.

The State Department's warning urged U.S. travelers to take extra precautions overseas. It cited potential dangers involved with public transportation systems and other prime sites for tourists, and noted that previous attacks have centered on subway and rail networks as well as airplanes and boats.

Travelers were advised to sign up for State Department alerts and register with U.S. consulates in the countries they visit.

Story continues

The statement said that al-Qaida or its allies might target either U.S. government or private American interests. The alert expires on Aug. 31.

The State Department said the potential for terrorism was particularly acute in the Middle East and North Africa, with a possible attack occurring on or coming from the Arabian Peninsula. The diplomatic facilities affected stretch from Mauritania in northwest Africa to Afghanistan.

U.S. officials pointed specifically to Yemen, the home of al-Qaida's most dangerous affiliate and the network blamed for several notable plots against the United States, from the foiled Christmas Day 2009 effort to bomb an airliner over Detroit to the explosives-laden parcels intercepted the following year aboard cargo flights.

""Current information suggests that al-Qaida and affiliated organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks both in the region and beyond, and that they may focus efforts to conduct attacks in the period between now and the end of August,"" a department statement said.

Yemen's president, Abdo Rabby Mansour Hadi, met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House on Thursday, where both leaders cited strong counterterrorism cooperation. This past week, Yemen's military reported a U.S. drone strike killed six alleged al-Qaida militants in the group's southern strongholds.

Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., the House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, said the embassy threat was linked to al-Qaida and concerned the Middle East and Central Asia.

""In this instance, we can take a step to better protect our personnel and, out of an abundance of caution, we should,"" Royce said. He declined to say if the National Security Agency's much-debated surveillance program helped reveal the threat.

And It Should. - The New York Times,"THE United States is currently enjoying an unprecedented respite in the foreign policy arena — a temporary relief from the normal rigors of history that allows us to take stock at home and abroad.

It may seem outlandish to claim that we’re in the midst of a lull, given that America faces a civil war in Syria, an Iran that seems to be seeking nuclear weapons, an irresponsible North Korea that already possesses them, continuing threats from terrorists, a rising China and rapid climate change.

Yet the United States enjoys a respite all the same. For the three and a half centuries of the modern international era, great powers have almost always confronted rivals determined to defeat them and replace the global order they worked to bring about. In the last century, this process unfolded three times. The results were violent, costly and dangerous, and included two world wars and a cold war.

Today, there are threats, but they tend to be regional, years away or limited in scale. None rises to the level of being global, immediate and existential. The United States faces no great-power rival. And this is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future."
http://news.yahoo.com/snowden-mass-surveillance-making-us-less-safe-124458045.html,,[],Snowden: mass surveillance making us less safe,"MOSCOW (AP) — Former National Security Agency systems analyst Edward Snowden says surveillance programs used by the United States to tap into phone and Internet connections around the world are making people less safe.

In short video clips posted by the WikiLeaks website on Friday, Snowden said the NSA mass surveillance he revealed before fleeing to Russia ""puts us at risk of coming into conflict with our own government.""

Snowden, who faces espionage charges in the U.S. over the leak, described the techniques as ""dragnet mass surveillance that puts entire populations under sort of an eye that sees everything even when it's not needed.""

""They hurt our economy. They hurt our country. They limit our ability to speak and think and live and be creative, to have relationships and to associate freely,"" Snowden said.

The videos are the first of Snowden speaking since July 12, when he was shown at a Moscow airport pleading with Russian authorities to grant him asylum, which they did on Aug. 1.

That decision has strained the relations between the U.S. and Russia. President Barack Obama called off a meeting with President Vladimir Putin at a summit hosted by Russia in September.

Snowden said the U.S. government was ""unwilling to prosecute high officials who lied to Congress and the country on camera, but they'll stop at nothing to persecute someone who told them the truth.""

In a note accompanying the videos, WikiLeaks said Snowden spoke on Wednesday in Moscow as he accepted the Sam Adams Award, given annually by a group of retired U.S. national security officers and named for a CIA analyst during the Vietnam War who accused the U.S. military of deliberately underestimating the enemy's strength for political purposes.

Four former U.S. government officials who were at the ceremony told The Associated Press on Thursday that Snowden is adjusting to life in Russia and said they saw no evidence that he was under the control of local security services. They refused to say where they met with Snowden or where he is living."
http://news.yahoo.com/bin-laden-spokesman-pleads-not-guilty-plot-152021026.html,,[],Bin Laden spokesman pleads not guilty to plot,"NEW YORK (AP) — A senior al-Qaida leader and son-in-law of Osama bin Laden, captured in Jordan in the past week, pleaded not guilty Friday in federal court in New York to plotting against Americans in his role as the terror network's top spokesman.

Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was brought into the largest courtroom at the federal courthouse shortly after 10 a.m. and entered the plea through a lawyer to one count of conspiracy to kill Americans in a case that marks a legal victory for President Barack Obama's administration.

Black cuffs bound his hands behind him as he was led into a courtroom with about 80 spectators, mostly journalists, lawyers and court employees. He was bearded and wearing a blue prison uniform. The cuffs were taken off, and he was seated next to his court-appointed lawyer, federal defender Philip Weinstein.

Abu Ghaith was arrested overseas the night of Feb. 28, gave an ""extensive post-arrest statement"" that totaled 22 pages, and arrived here March 1, Assistant U.S. Attorney John P. Cronan said. The prosecutor gave no details on the statement.

Through an interpreter, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan asked whether Abu Ghaith understood his rights. Abu Ghaith nodded yes. Asked whether he had money to hire an attorney, Abu Ghaith shook his head no. He nodded when asked whether he had signed an affidavit describing his financial situation.

Bail was not requested, and none was set. The judge said he would set a trial date April 8. Prosecutors said a trial would last about three weeks.

The Obama administration has long sought to charge senior al-Qaida suspects in American federal courts instead of military tribunals at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But it runs counter to demands by Republicans in Congress who do not want high-threat terror suspects brought into the United States.

Abu Ghaith was born in Kuwait and was bin Laden's son-in-law. The Department of Justice said he was the spokesman for al-Qaida, working alongside bin Laden and current leader Ayman al-Zawahri, since at least May 2001. Abu Ghaith is a former mosque preacher and teacher.

Story continues

The day after the Sept. 11 attacks, prosecutors say, he appeared with bin Laden and al-Zawahri and called on the ""nation of Islam"" to battle against Jews, Christians and Americans.

A ""great army is gathering against you,"" Abu Ghaith said on Sept. 12, 2001, according to prosecutors.

Shortly afterward, Abu Ghaith warned in a speech that ""the storms shall not stop — especially the airplanes storm"" and advised Muslims, children and al-Qaida allies to stay out of planes and high-rise buildings. In one video, he was sitting with bin Laden in front of a rock face in Afghanistan. Kuwait stripped him of his citizenship after Sept. 11.

In 2002, under pressure as the U.S. military and CIA searched for bin Laden, Abu Ghaith was smuggled into Iran from Afghanistan, prosecutors said.

Abu Ghaith's trial will mark one of the first prosecutions of senior al-Qaida leaders on U.S. soil. Charging foreign terror suspects in American federal courts was a top pledge by Obama shortly after he took office in 2009, aimed, in part, to close Guantanamo Bay.

Republicans have fought the White House to keep Guantanamo open. Several GOP lawmakers on Thursday said Abu Ghaith should be considered an enemy combatant and sent to Guantanamo.

Generally, Guantanamo detainees have fewer legal rights and due process than they would have in a court in America but could potentially yield more information to prevent future threats.

(CNN) - The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee said the threat of terrorism overseas is ""getting worse, not better.""

""I personally see it spreading like a spiderweb, like a wildfire, through Northern Africa and the Middle East,"" Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, told CNN's Candy Crowley on ""State of the Union.""



""As that threat increases overseas, so too does it increase to the homeland - and that's my basic concern as Homeland chairman, is to keep that threat outside the United States.""

Leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees told CNN earlier this month on “State of the Union” that terrorists have gained ground in the past two years and that the U.S. is not any safer than it was at the outset of 2011. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, agreed that the Obama administration has lost ground in the ongoing battle with global terrorism.

McCaul said that though policies put in place as a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks have prevented a similar large-scale event on U.S. soil, President Barack Obama is pushing a false narrative about the nation's safety in the world.

""When the President of the United States talks about the, downgrades the threat, his narrative is that al Qaeda is on the run, and since bin Laden has been killed the threat is no longer existing - I think is a false narrative and premise because, as we see this threat all throughout northern Africa, as we saw Egypt fall, Libya, now Syria is a great culmination of the Sunni-Shia conflict.""

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said Feinstein’s and Rogers' comments surprised him but acknowledged that low-level attacks by lone-wolf actors, like the Boston Marathon bombing, are still ""very threatening.""

But is the U.S. more effective now at keeping terrorism off its shores?

""I think we are better now than we have ever been, but we are never going to be 100% safe,"" Schiff said, pointing to the ongoing conflict in Syria, a country that he said has become a ""magnet"" for those looking to join Jihad.

McCaul agreed: ""I think Syria is now the training ground for the world. … These rebel forces are more of a threat than anything.""

Hare coursing is being streamed live to Chinese gamblers by organised criminals, a senior politician has revealed. Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said rural offending can be ""incredibly profitable"" and result in ""big money"" for those involved. He said one example of this type of crime involves ""highly organised criminals"" hare coursing and streaming the events to China, where they are bet on. The practice involves dogs, usually greyhounds or lurchers, which are trained to chase and overtake a hare that has been flushed out by a line of beaters. Mr Pollard, the MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, said: ""It's incredibly profitable work, and there is big money involved with this hare coursing. For instance, I was hearing about how it's webcast live to betting syndicates in China. ""So we're not talking about some people organising an illicit activity in a barn somewhere – we're talking about highly organised criminals preying on rural communities."" Mr Pollard said he had been told gangs in rural communities knew their crimes would not be reported or, if they were, that they would not get caught. He added: ""We know that rural communities have seen the real brunt of the cut to police numbers since 2010. And we know that it takes a very long time for an emergency response – not because the police aren't working hard enough, simply because there's not enough of them and the geographies they have to cover are so big. ""It's really increased the fear around rural crime. And we know that there are criminal gangs preying on rural communities, not just in terms of county lines but also in terms of the threats to people living in rural communities."" Mr Pollard's comments come after the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales and the Countryside Alliance called on police and crime commissioners to put rural policing at the forefront of their agenda. Tim Bonner, the Countryside Alliance chief executive, said: ""The real danger is rural policing gets locked into a cycle of decline because the perception is the police are not taking it seriously. The theft of a tractor is just as relevant as someone's factory being trashed in a town. These are often serious, organised criminals and they are prepared to commit violent acts."" Mr Pollard said: ""Part of the challenge I think, at the heart of it, is to look at rural life the way it actually is now, not through picture postcards or our romantic views of rural life in the past but what's it like today. There's such pride in our countryside from the people who live there – but there are problems that need addressing."""

She says the Syria decision features a president who famously opposed a war

Also in spotlight is John McCain, who lost to Obama and disapproves of his foreign policy

Borger: McCain may wind up backing Obama on Syria to avoid catastrophic defeat for U.S.

All presidential decisions are, in the end, difficult and complex. And under any circumstance, the decisions on issues of war (surgical strikes included) are agonizing. The decision to use force -- the repercussions, the cost in blood and treasure, the geostrategic implications -- is complicated and the implications obviously immense.

But as the Syria story unfolds, there is an almost Shakespearean drama beneath the surface -- one of political careers made and broken, of past positions held and almost abandoned. Not to mention the political enemies now finding themselves -- awkwardly -- on the same side of history.

As the public debate plays out, the political past lingers, and haunts every moment.

First consider the irony of Barack Obama himself. It's no surprise to anyone that this president is a reluctant warrior. His rise to national prominence was based, in part, on his antiwar sentiment on Iraq.

Gloria Borger

In the past, he's been a forceful proponent of the need for congressional authorization for the use of force. He tells the American people, at every opportunity, that he is extracting us from two wars. That was at the top of his to-do list, and he's doing it.

So now this, er, wrinkle in which Obama becomes the conscientious aggressor. He is the president who defends his National Security Agency surveillance strategy and his frequent use of drones to an unhappy Democratic base. He drew the red line on chemical weapons (which he now explains was also the world's red line).

He's certain we need to hit Bashar al-Assad but seeks support from a Congress he generally disdains. Like Lewis Carroll's Alice in ""Through the Looking Glass,"" Obama could well be asking, ""I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.""

JUST WATCHED Sen. McCain's take on Syria hearing Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sen. McCain's take on Syria hearing 10:02

Indeed.

As the president himself pointed out Wednesday in Sweden, ""had I been in the Senate, I would have suggested Congress have the ability to weigh in."" It was hardly lost on him that it would seem, well, a tad hypocritical that someone who had spoken repeatedly about a congressional buy-in on the use of force was now willing to go it alone. So after the British said no, the president looked homeward for a coalition of the willing.

And so, another irony: The president's legacy now is in the hands of a notoriously paralyzed and partisan Congress -- a Congress that hasn't exactly friended him.

And that brings us to the agony part of this drama -- Sen. John McCain. Here's the man who lost to Obama in 2008 and remains his foreign policy nemesis. McCain is the GOP's major (and increasingly lonely) hawk-in-residence. He thinks Obama made a huge mistake in not arming the Syrian rebels and charges the president with dawdling for two years while this civil war intensified. Oh, and by the way, he believes Obama's surgical strike is too little, too late.

And yet, here he is, on the verge of supporting Obama—and taking on the libertarians in his own party. And not because he likes him, and not because he likes the policy—but because he believes that a congressional no-vote could be ""catastrophic"" for the nation. In the end, he may still balk because the mission, as defined by Congress, is too narrow. But he clearly wants to find a way to stand with the president.

""Alice in Wonderland"" would be right at home. ""I can't go back to yesterday,"" she understood. ""Because I was a different person then."""

Washington (CNN) – President Barack Obama has responded to critics who disagree with his handling of the situation in Syria, saying he's more concerned about the end goal - no chemical weapons in Syria - than about ""style points.""

In an interview that aired Sunday on ABC's ""This Week,"" Obama downplayed the controversy over Vladimir Putin's opinion piece in The New York Times last week, saying ""this is not a Cold War"" and that he welcomes the Russian president's involvement in the issue.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

As for the public perception of his own management of the U.S. response to the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime, Obama said, ""Folks here in Washington like to grade on style.""

""And so had we rolled out something that was very smooth and disciplined and linear - they would have graded it well, even if it was a disastrous policy,"" he continued. ""We know that, 'cause that's exactly how they graded the Iraq War - until it ended up… blowing up in our face.""

Asked by ABC's George Stephanopoulos whether the recent events changed his view of former President George W. Bush, Obama said, ""No, no. What it says is that I'm less concerned about style points. I'm much more concerned about getting the policy right.""

Obama got some of his most candid criticism last week from an ally, Republican Sen. Bob Corker. The senator told CNN's Dana Bash that the president has lost his credibility and is ""very uncomfortable being commander in chief.""

And following a deal reached between the U.S. and Russia on Saturday for Syria to hand over its chemical weapons to international control, two Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, said the Syria deal ""does nothing to resolve the real problem in Syria"" and allows Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to ""go on slaughtering innocent civilians and destabilizing the Middle East.""

Talking about his relationship with Putin, Obama said he doesn't think his Russian counterpart ""has the same values that we do"" and that Putin has a ""different attitude about the Assad regime."" But, he said, both countries ""have an interest in preventing chaos"" and ""preventing terrorism.""

""This is not a contest between the United States and Russia. I mean, the fact of the matter is that if Russia wants to have some influence in Syria post-Assad, that doesn't hurt our interests,"" he said.

""And I think there's a way for Mr. Putin, despite me and him having a whole lot of differences, to play an important role in that,"" he continued. ""And so I welcome him being involved. I welcome him saying, 'I will take responsibility for pushing my client, the Assad regime, to deal with these chemical weapons.'""

On Iran, Obama said recent negotiations over Syria could still deter Tehran from building nuclear weapons, even though the U.S. did not use force to address the chemical weapons crisis in Syria.

The president confirmed that he and the new Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, have communicated indirectly through letters. Obama believes Iran understands that the nuclear issue is far more significant to U.S. security interests than are chemical weapons in Syria.

""A nuclear arms race in the region is something that would be profoundly destabilizing,"" he said. ""And so I - my suspicion is that the Iranians recognize they shouldn't draw a lesson that we haven't struck to think we won't strike Iran. On the other hand … what they should draw from this lesson is that there is the potential of resolving these issues diplomatically.""

""Negotiations with the Iranians is always difficult. I think this new president is not going to suddenly make it easy,"" he added. ""But you know, my view is that if you have both a credible threat of force, combined with a rigorous diplomatic effort, that in fact you can strike a deal."""

Ranchers and farmers often build ladders over their fences in hopes that migrants won't damage the fences when crossing.

Story highlights The Senate's immigration bill calls for doubling the size of the border patrol The House is debating a strong security component to its bill, too Those who live on the border have a nuanced view of security Many want work permits for undocumented immigrants

(CNN) —

Joe Metz, a straight-talking Texas rancher on the U.S.-Mexico border, awoke recently to find 50 cows roaming freely in his front yard. Undocumented immigrants, he says, left a gate open as they crossed his land, which abuts the Rio Grande.

For years, he’s witnessed migrants and drug smugglers touch American soil for the first time on his property.

“We deal with this every day,” he said.

But as a rancher in Hidalgo County, he also knows firsthand the need for labor to keep producers in the Rio Grande Valley operating. The traffic through his land frustrates him – particularly the potentially dangerous drug traffic – but he acknowledges that most crossers are looking for opportunity.

It is an open secret that many of these undocumented immigrants will indeed find jobs in the local economy.

More than 1,700 miles away, U.S. lawmakers are engaged in their own debate over how to balance security concerns and immigrant labor needs.

The Senate has proposed one solution in the form of a sweeping immigration bill that the chamber passed last month. Border security figures prominently in that bill, and is also a priority for members of the House, where the debate has moved.

Five reasons immigration reform isn’t close

Those who live and work on the border say there is a disconnect between the debate in Washington and the realities on the ground.

Voices of the border communities

Miles of border fencing built by the federal government – actually a levy that was cut in half and reinforced with concrete to form a wall – run across Metz’s property near Mission, Texas. Two 40-foot gaps exist in the barrier so that workers can access all parts of the ranch, but there are no gates, creating a funnel for migrants and traffickers to cross.

Google Maps Map: Texas-Mexico border towns

Metz’s experiences make him hawkish on beefing up the border, but he doesn’t just want more border patrol agents. He wants to see work permits granted the millions of undocumented immigrants already living in the United States.

The agriculture industry in the Rio Grande Valley depends on immigrant labor, he said.

“They (the government) just need to face up to the situation and give all these people work permits,” Metz said.

Opinion: Immigrants are driving the housing recovery

Migrants will keep coming across the border as long as there is work and a chance to make money, the rancher said.

“Farmers need the help, no doubt about that, because nobody wants to do the work,” said Jimmie Steidinger, a farmer and agricultural producer, in Donna, Texas.

How immigration reform would affect 3 families

For those whose lands are traversed by migrants, the biggest concern is drug traffickers, more so than economic migrants, he said.

Putting undocumented immigrants on a path to citizenship would provide not just more able hands, but the relief of knowing who is crossing the border, he said.

For others, securing the border is not about how many boots are on the ground.

Border security means that people on both sides of the boundary feel safe, said Michael Seifert, coordinator of the Rio Grande Valley Equal Voice Network. That is not the case, he said.

The Equal Voice Network represents 11 community-based organizations focused on the area’s poorest residents.

To many of these residents, the border patrol is something threatening, Seifert said.

Reports of heavy-handedness by border agents – including use of force – has bred mistrust among some border residents.

In one case in Arizona last year, a border patrol agent shot and killed an adolescent who had been throwing rocks alongside several others at the border. The border patrol confirmed that agents were being assaulted with rocks and that after verbal warnings to stop, one agent fired his service weapon.

Many in the community hear the stories of alleged beatings or use of stun guns by border agents and have become wary of their presence.

“We have a completely different perception” than outsiders, Seifert said.

The fears of the community are compounded by the fact that many families live in mixed-status households, where some members are living in the country legally and others aren’t, creating fear of separation.

Seifert said a further buildup along the border would be bad both for businesses and the welfare of the communities.

The view from Washington

The Senate immigration overhaul bill passed only after being amended to include tough border security measures: Doubling the number of border patrol agents on the southern border to nearly 40,000, increasing fencing to 700 miles and deploying more technology.

In the Republican-controlled House, border security is being touted as a prerequisite before any undocumented immigrants are placed on a potential path to citizenship.

“I understand the issues our borders face and am committed to making sure the first thing that must be addressed with any immigration bill is strengthening and protecting the border,” said Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, a member of the bipartisan House group working on a bill.

But some who study the border say the boundary with Mexico is as safe as it’s ever been, and it doesn’t make sense to flood the place with border agents.

“It sounds good and it looks good politically,” to add more agents, said Maureen Meyer, Senior Associate for Mexico and Central America at the Washington Office on Latin America, or WOLA. “Calls for border security don’t always reflect reality.”

Opinion: Should U.S. be more like Mexico?

Currently, the border patrol is already double the size it was in 2005. As the agency grew, the number of illegal crossers apprehended decreased.

In 2005, each border agent – on average – apprehended 118 undocumented immigrants that year, according to data extrapolated by WOLA. Last year, that number fell to 19 apprehensions per agent.

If the border patrol is doubled in size again, how much further would that number fall? Would there be a lot of agents standing on the border doing nothing?

Not just a border issue

About 70 miles north of the Rio Grande Valley lies Brooks County, a community that has seen the cost of illegal immigration up close, even though it is not located on the border.

The county includes the town of Falfurrias, the site of the last border patrol checkpoint on Highway 281. Make it past the checkpoint, and a smuggler or migrant could be home free.

David S. Holloway/CNN Brooks County Judge Raul Ramirez in his private office in the town of Falfurrias, Texas.

Most migrants try to avoid the checkpoint altogether, choosing instead to go around it by hiking deep into the vast tracts of ranch land.

But too often they become lost, or succumb to the unforgiving heat and die.

In 2012, 129 bodies of migrants were found in Brooks County. At least 42 have been found so far this year – 11 in the past two weeks.

It can cost the county nearly $2,000 to pick up a body, transport it, and perform an autopsy. The county is also burdened with the costs of sending its deputies to these scenes instead of patrolling the community. The counties that are right on the border have access to federal funds to offset law enforcement and other costs, but Brooks County does not.

KSAT: Immigrants survive wild ride in U-Haul truck

The border “isn’t secure, and I don’t think they will ever secure it,” Brooks County Judge Raul Ramirez said.

Still, Ramirez says that doubling the border patrol and prioritizing border security before immigration reform is not the answer.

“I think they don’t get it. I don’t think that’s the solution,” he said.

More agents will not stop determined migrants, but will simply drive up the price that a smuggler charges, he said. It also raises the likelihood that smugglers will choose riskier routes, meaning that even more people may die from exposure, he said.

What Ramirez would like to see is a deployment of current border agents to high-crossing areas, and a focus on catching drug traffickers.

What do border agents want?

The border patrol would appear to have the most to gain from an immigration bill with a tough security component. It would mean more money and more manpower.

David S. Holloway/CNN The graves of dozens of migrants who died trying to illegally cross the border are in Falfurrias, Texas.

But Shawn Moran, vice president of the union that represents border agents, the National Border Patrol Council, says that is not the case.

Rather than spending millions hiring and training 20,000 new agents, it makes more sense to properly fund the existing force to bring the border patrol up to 100% staffing for current agents, he said. That alone would be the equivalent of 5,000 new agents.

Calls for increased technology, from sensors to unmanned aerial vehicles are nice, but they are just tools, Moran said. It takes an agent to make an arrest, he said.

“We appreciate the sentiment, but we think (the immigration bill) has to be tweaked a bit,” he said."

Korea, jihadist groups top U.S. threats","Story highlights Director of national intelligence gave a report to Congress Clapper says the Internet is increasingly being used as a tool by nations and terror groups North Korea's rhetoric is an ""indicator of their attitude'' and ''intent,'' the director says

(CNN) —

Cyberattacks pose more of a threat to the United States than a land-based attack by a terrorist group, while North Korea’s development of a nuclear weapons program poses a “serious threat,” the director of national intelligence told Congress on Tuesday.

The warning by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper came in his annual report to Congress on the threats facing the United States.

“Attacks, which might involve cyber and financial weapons, can be deniable and unattributable,” Clapper said in prepared remarks before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. “Destruction can be invisible, latent and progressive.”

The Internet is increasingly being used as a tool both by nations and terror groups to achieve their objectives, according to Clapper’s report.

However, there is only a “remote chance” of a major cyberattack on the United States that would cause widespread disruptions, such as regional power outages, the report says. Most countries or groups don’t have the capacity to pull it off.

While Clapper emphasized possible cyberthreats, committee members raised questions about the potential nuclear dangers posed by North Korea and Iran, the increasing prevalence of al Qaeda in Syria and the effect of cuts to the U.S. budget on intelligence activities.

President Obama cracks whip on cybercrime

’Belligerent rhetoric’

Angered by U.N. Security Council sanctions over its nuclear test, North Korea threatened for the first time to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the United States and South Korea.

Even by North Korean standards, the threat of a nuclear strike and the scrapping of a 1953 truce that effectively ended the Korean War have been incredibly provocative, Clapper said.

“The rhetoric, while it is propaganda laced, is also an indicator of their attitude and perhaps their intent,” he said, adding he was concerned what, if any, provocative action North Korea would take against its southern neighbor.

Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, quizzed Clapper about what, if any, deterrence, works with North Korea and Iran, who have been slapped with numerous U.N. Security Council sanctions over the development of a nuclear program.

“Mutually assured destruction? Are they responsive to that kind of rational thinking that has guided U.S. policy for 50 years? Are these countries like the (former) Soviet Union, that we can have some confidence that they’re gonna make a rational decision knowing that if they do something crazy they are going to be wiped out?” King asked.

Clapper told the committee he believed that both North Korea and Iran understand that.

North Korea, for whatever reason, believes the United States would use a nuclear weapon against it, Clapper said.

“They certainly respect the capability for our military,” he said.

“They’ve gone to school on what we’ve done starting with Desert Storm. I know that for a fact. So I think deterrence in this broadest context does work and does have impact on decision-making calculus of those these two countries.”

Opinion: Have the courage to deal with cyber war

Al Qaeda’s influence in Syria

Clapper also warned the committee that Syria’s chemical weapons program has the potential to inflict mass causalities.

“It adds to our concern that the increasingly beleaguered regime, having found its escalation of violence through conventional means inadequate, might be prepared to use the chemical weapons against the Syrian people,” he said.

He said the obvious question is how long embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad can hang on to power. Syria has been mired in a civil war for more than two years.

“And our standard answer is his days are numbered. We just don’t know the number,” he told the committee.

“I think our assessment is, he is very committed to hanging in there and sustaining control of the regime.”

Perhaps the bigger concern is the rising influence and strength of the al-Nusra Front, an “al Qaeda in Iraq” offshoot, among the Syrian rebels, he said.

The potential of the core of al Qaeda to “launch a coordinated, massive attack” against the United States, according to Clapper, has diminished, while the global jihadist movement is more decentralized and, therefore, more of a threat.

“Lone wolves, domestic extremists and jihadist-inspired groups remain determined to attack Western interests as they’ve done most recently in Libya and Algeria.”

The threat assessment describes an environment where jihadist terrorists are increasingly decentralized, creating challenges for the prevention of attacks.

Al Qaeda vs. jihadist groups

Many of these groups have gained a foothold in the Arab Spring countries, where a spike in threats to U.S. interests has been recorded, the threat assessment report said.

“The dispersed and decentralized nature of the terrorist networks (that are) active in the region highlights that the threat to U.S. and Western interests overseas is more likely to be unpredictable,” it states.

It cites the Benghazi, Libya, attack that killed four Americans, and an attack on an Algerian oil field as examples of how splinter groups or individuals with jihadist sympathies can act, even without direction from higher in the terrorist chain, Clapper told the committee.

Iran: Haven or prison for al Qaeda?

’Cyberespionage and cyberattacks’

For the first time, the emphasis of Clapper’s report was on cyberthreats, in the form of cyberattacks or cyberespionage.

Already, foreign intelligence and security services have “penetrated numerous computer networks” in the United States belonging to the government and private sector alike, the report says.

Although classified networks have been targeted, the majority of these attacks have involved unclassified networks, it states.

The United States has enjoyed a technological edge over other nations, but advances in information technology and business practices are evening the playing field, according to the report.

“This is almost certainly allowing our adversaries to close the technological gap between our respective militaries, slowly neutralizing one of our key advantages in the international arena,” it said.

However, there is only a “remote chance” of a major cyberattack on the United State that would cause widespread disruptions, such as regional power outages, the report says. Most countries or groups don’t have the capacity to pull it off.

The report names China and Russia as two of the most “advanced cyber actors,” but says they are unlikely to launch an attack.

WASHINGTON (CNN) - Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham continued their all-out verbal assault on the Obama administration's handling of the Syria crisis, disparaging Saturday's U.S.-Russian agreement as ""morally and strategically indefensible.""

""It requires a willful suspension of disbelief to see this agreement as anything other than the start of a diplomatic blind alley,"" the senators said in a joint statement, ""and the Obama administration is being led into it by Bashar Assad and Vladimir Putin.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'][twitter-follow screen_name='jhseher']

Calling the agreement ""meaningless,"" the Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee lambasted the White House's latest attempt to walk the country back from the brink of a military confrontation with the Syrian government.

Russia and the United States announced Saturday that they have reached a groundbreaking deal on a framework to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons.

Syria must submit within one week a comprehensive list of its chemical weapons stockpile, Secretary of State John Kerry said, and international inspectors must be on the ground no later than November.

McCain, of Arizona, and South Carolina’s Graham criticized the pact as the latest use of rhetorical gymnastics by the Oval Office, an evolution that has seen President Barack Obama go from labeling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad a ""menace (that) must be confronted"" to, in the words of McCain and Graham, ""our negotiating partner.""

""This agreement does nothing to resolve the real problem in Syria,"" the two said. ""[Assad] can go on slaughtering innocent civilians and destabilizing the Middle East.""

McCain and Graham have both advocated for a more muscular response to the Syrian government's alleged use of chemical weapons on August 21, recommending the administration provide more weapons to moderate opposition groups.

In the statement, the senators reiterated that ""significantly"" increasing the United States' support to vetted opposition forces inside Syria is the only thing capable of turning the tides of the raging civil war and creating ""real conditions for a negotiated end to the conflict.""

For the longtime senators, Saturday's agreement is more evidence that the Obama administration is unwilling to do what's necessary to stop the al-Assad regime, and now has fully retreated from its previous position of stating the Syrian despot ""must go.""

""Assad will use the months and months afforded to him to delay and deceive the world using every trick in Saddam Hussein's playbook,"" McCain and Graham said.

The senators blasted the proposed accord, which would not explicitly threaten the use of force if the al-Assad regime failed to place its chemical weapons stockpiles under international control, as ""an act of provocative weakness.""

Beyond the agreement's impact for Syria, the Republican duo say the developments underscore the United States' waning influence abroad and the president's poor stewardship of national security interests. McCain and Graham say Obama's reluctance to lead a more robust response will further embolden Syria's neighbor, Iran, to continue flaunting U.S. warnings about its nuclear program.

""We cannot imagine a worse signal to send to Iran as it continues its push for a nuclear weapons,"" the statement read.

While McCain and Graham sharply rejected the framework agreement, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee weighed in favorably on the outcome of the talks between Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, praising the accommodation as ""significant progress.""

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, disagreeing with McCain and Graham's assessment, said the pact is ""enforceable"" and that he believes it will achieve ""an even better outcome than the goals of the authorization approved just a few days ago.""

Levin also backed the administration's handling of the negotiations. Unlike the Republican chorus headlined by McCain, Graham and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, Levin said the accord represents a strategic victory for the United States over their Russian and Syrian counterparts. Levin also insisted that the framework still leaves a military response on the table and that the Obama administration ""remains prepared to act.""

""Russia and Syria sought two things in any agreement: a promise on our part not to use military force, and an end to international support for the Syrian opposition,"" Levin said. ""This agreement includes neither item."""
http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/01/opinion/bergen-obama-risk-taker/index.html,2013-09-01 00:00:00,"['Peter Bergen', 'Cnn National Security Analyst']","Bergen: Obama, realist and risk taker","Story highlights Peter Bergen: Obama's hope had been to end wars in Middle East

By sending issue to Congress, Obama seeks to make war harder to launch, Bergen says

Bergen: Obama lacked international support and legal standing to strike Syria

Obama's move is a risk, as was decision to launch Osama bin Laden raid, Bergen says

Barack Obama came to Washington to end wars. Not to start them.

That much was crystal clear only three months ago when Obama gave a keynote speech on May 23 at the National Defense University in Washington in which he called for an end to the ""boundless war on terror"" and ""perpetual wartime footing"" that has existed in the U.S. since 9/11.

Obama focused part of this speech on the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that Congress passed days after 9/11 and that gave President George W. Bush the authority to go to war in Afghanistan.

No one in Congress who voted for this resolution at the time realized that he or she was in effect authorizing in Afghanistan what would become America's longest war.

Nor did they realize that they were giving a virtual blank check to the president to wage covert U.S. wars in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen where, according to data compiled by the New America Foundation, thousands have been killed in CIA drone strikes with almost no input from Congress.

During his defense speech, Obama vowed to help end the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that set in motion the seemingly endless war the U.S. has been fighting since 2001.

This is some of the context of Obama's decision to go to Congress to seek authorization for a military strike on Syria. Obama has wanted to leave office in 2016 as the president who had made it harder, not easier, for future presidents to go to war unilaterally without the input of Congress.

Peter Bergen

In going to Congress for authorization of any military operation in Syria, we see Obama the former constitutional law professor at work, but we also see Obama the pragmatist.

The Obama administration could have always made the argument in the past few days that it could justify attacking the regime of Bashar al-Assad on humanitarian grounds to prevent further massacres of the Syrian people with chemical weapons despite the fact that there was no international authorization for attacking Syria and no congressional resolution sanctioning such an attack.

But that argument would be a novel one as a matter of international law, and it would not be particularly compelling as a matter of domestic politics when the American public seems, at best, split on whether the U.S. should deploy force in Syria.

Unilateral U.S. military actions are, of course, generally uncontroversial after an attack on American targets by a foreign power or group.

President Bill Clinton didn't seek congressional approval for the cruise missiles he launched at al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan in 1998 after the terrorist group's attacks on two U.S. embassies in Africa.

Nor did President George H.W. Bush go to Congress to sign off on his invasion of Panama in 1989, which he authorized because a U.S, Marine had recently been killed there and tens of thousands of other Americans living in the country were purportedly at risk.

Syria hasn't attacked any U.S. targets or citizens, so the argument that an attack on the Assad regime is designed to protect American interests or lives is moot.

That leaves the Obama administration with the option of extracting some kind of authorization for an attack from international bodies such as the United Nations, NATO or the Arab League.

As is now well-known, there isn't a snowball's chance in hell of getting a U.N. authorization since Russia and China have continuously made clear they would veto such a resolution.

There also seems little possibility, for the moment, that NATO will authorize a ""humanitarian"" mission as it did in Kosovo in 1999 to roll back Serbian aggression there. And even if there was such an authorization, right now a major NATO member, the United Kingdom, couldn't participate because the British Parliament voted against such a mission on Thursday.

Indeed, NATO said Monday it wants a ""firm international response"" in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria, but that it won't take any military action itself.

The Arab League, which signed off on the operation to topple Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, has so far not signaled a readiness to authorize war against Syria. The League said the world community should take action against those responsible for the use of chemical weapons but did not specify if it would endorse military action by the U.S. or other parties. That said, the usually hypercautious Saudis publicly urged war on Sunday.

In going to Congress for the Syria authorization, we see not only the former constitutional law professor and pragmatist in Obama, but also the calculated risk taker.

On matters of considerable importance where the potential payoff is large, Obama has shown he is willing to take risks. Think no further than his decision two years ago to authorize a Navy SEAL raid to capture or kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, a raid he undertook against the advice of Vice President Joe Biden and then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. If that operation had gone poorly, as a number of Obama's top national security officials believed it could, Obama might now be splitting his time between Chicago and Hawaii.

For Obama, a congressional authorization on the use of force in Syria would help him if he needs to authorize additional military actions down the road in Syria. It would also help him if he feels compelled to go to war with Iran. Of course, if he doesn't get such an authorization, he will endure the same kind of humiliation that British Prime Minster David Cameron has just gone through in Parliament.

Obama has, however, no doubt tried to game out how this vote might play out.

He probably calculates that for Republican skeptics in Congress, they will have to explain to the American public why it is that they will not sanction military action on Syria after its large-scale use of chemical weapons while they continue to describe Syria's closest ally, Iran, and its nuclear weapons program -- which still has yet to produce any nuclear weapons-- as a grave threat to the world.

We can be sure that in the next days, the administration will make the argument that if you let Syria take a pass on its large-scale and repeated use of chemical weapons, you can forget any chance of slowing or ending Iran's nuclear program, something that is a matter of great importance for much of the Republican Party.

For those on the left of the Democratic Party in Congress who are generally skeptical of U.S. military actions, Obama can essentially ask, ""If not now, when?"" At what point will self-described liberals intervene to stop the use of weapons so vile that they have been banned by the civilized world for almost a century?"

The decal shows a blonde woman in jeans curled up on the bed of a pickup truck, her hair obscuring her face and her hands and feet tied with rope. It's meant to be slapped on a truck's tailgate, creating an optical illusion of an actual woman lying in distress.

KWTX News 10 in Waco, Texas reported that Hornet Signs put the decal on the back of an employee's truck to show how realistic its signs are. A female employee volunteered to be tied up and photographed for the promotional material.

""I wasn't expecting the reactions that we got, nor was it really anything we certainly condone or anything else,"" Hornet Signs owner Brad Kolb told KWTX. ""But it was just something...we had to put out there to see who notices it.""

Kolb also claimed that since the controversy, he has seen a rise in decal orders.

KWTX said it asked viewers what they thought of Kolb's marketing stunt, and the responses the station received were pretty ""one-sided"" against it. Some viewers said they even called the police when they saw the decal, thinking a woman was truly in trouble.

Julie Gerstein at the Frisky adds, ""The sad thing is, this isn’t even an original idea.

USA TODAY

Just 44 of 533 members of Congress say they will vote yes on a strike on Syria

In 27 states%2C not a single senator or representative has committed to voting for the measure

White House lobbying %27a signal of the urgency and perhaps the growing sense of foreboding%27

WASHINGTON — President Obama faces a daunting and uphill battle to win congressional authorization for a military strike on Syria, a USA TODAY Network survey of senators and representatives finds.

The comprehensive poll of Congress finds that only a small fraction of the 533 lawmakers — 22 senators and 22 House members — are willing to say they will support the use of force in response to the reported use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime. Far more overall — 19 senators and 130 House members — say they will oppose a resolution that would authorize military strikes. There are two vacant seats in the House where lawmakers resigned and have not yet been replaced.

The largest group of lawmakers remains undecided, including a majority of the Senate and the House. That could create an opportunity for the president to persuade them in a string of six interviews with TV network anchors Monday and a televised address to the nation Tuesday. The Senate could vote as early as Wednesday.

""We cannot turn a blind eye to images like the ones we've seen out of Syria,"" Obama said in his weekly radio address Saturday. ""Failing to respond to this outrageous attack would increase the risk that chemical weapons could be used again; that they would fall into the hands of terrorists who might use them against us, and it would send a horrible signal to other nations that there would be no consequences for their use of these weapons. All of which would pose a serious threat to our national security.""

White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough made the rounds of the morning talk shows Sunday, making the administration's case.

Congress isn't convinced. In the survey:

•Democrats haven't fallen in line behind the president, at least not yet. Congressional Democrats are as likely to oppose the measure as support it, although most say they are undecided. At the moment, 28 Democrats support action; 28 oppose it.

•Republicans who have made a decision overwhelmingly oppose Obama, by nearly 8-1. Sixteen Republicans support action; 121 oppose it.

•In a majority of states, not a single member of Congress has gone on record endorsing the president's request for authorization of a military strike. That includes a dozen states that Obama carried in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections: Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, Maine, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

""I think it's an uphill slog from here,"" House Intelligence Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., one of the handful of Republicans who supports the president, said on CBS' Face the Nation Sunday. He said the White House has ""done an awful job"" in explaining the reason for a strike and added, ""It's a confusing mess.""

On Fox News Sunday, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he was horrified by images of the chemical weapons attacks in Syria but warned that the strikes could destabilize the country or even increase the odds that opposition forces obtain chemical weapons. ""I don't think we're going to do anything to Assad,"" he said of the Syrian leader.

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said he has heard overwhelming opposition from his constituents. ""And keep in mind, my district voted 77% for the president,"" he said on CBS. ""I think the president has work to do, but I think he can possibly get the votes. But he's got to come before the Congress and the nation.""

On this issue, Obama hasn't been able to count on the classic partisan divide that has defined the capital's politics through his tenure. Some liberal Democrats have aligned with Republican libertarians to oppose a military strike. Some GOP hawks who typically oppose him (including Arizona Sen. John McCain, whom Obama beat for the White House in 2008) argue for action.

Even African Americans in Congress, who have been among Obama's most reliable supporters on other issues, are resistant. Of 42 black lawmakers, two are committed to voting ""yes.""

""This is truly a momentous occasion in which the outcome is up for grabs,"" says Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. He notes the ""high-wire act"" for Obama as he returned Friday from his European trip. ""The urgency you saw with the president hustling back to the States, the national address he'll give — all that is a signal of the urgency and perhaps the growing sense of foreboding in the White House.""

A separate Washington Post count of congressional support Sunday reported different specific numbers but also found a tough road ahead for the president. In the Senate, the Post found 23 in favor, 17 opposed, 10 leaning no and 50 undecided; in the House, 25 in favor, 111 against, 116 leaning no and 181 undecided.

In the USA TODAY Network survey, journalists from USA TODAY and nearly 40 other Gannett-owned newspapers and television stations across the country reported on the views expressed by every senator and all but four members of the House, who couldn't be reached."

(CNN) – Two of President Barack Obama's White House predecessors offered their views of his impending decision on Syria Friday as global support for strikes in the country faltered.

Former President George W. Bush, in an interview, said Obama has a ""touch choice to make"" on potential U.S. military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is accused of using chemical weapons against civilians.



""If he decides to use our military, he'll have the greatest military ever backing him up,"" Bush said in an appearance on Fox News.

The United States and major allies are currently weighing major military action against Assad, though on Thursday British lawmakers voted against joining a global coalition. U.S. officials said after the vote that taking unilateral action against Syria was a possibility.

That option, former President Jimmy Carter said Friday, would be a grave mistake.

""A punitive military response without a U.N. Security Council mandate or broad support from NATO and the Arab League would be illegal under international law and unlikely to alter the course of the war,"" he wrote in a statement. ""It will only harden existing positions and postpone a sorely needed political process to put an end to the catastrophic violence.""

Carter, in his post-presidency, has engaged in global diplomacy in North Korea and the Middle East, and was a vocal critic of the Iraq War.

In his statement, Carter said the use of chemical weapons in Syria was a ""a grave breach of international law"" but that any U.S. action in the country should wait for ongoing investigations by United Nations inspectors to conclude.

""All should seek to leverage the consensus among the entire international community, including Russia and Iran, condemning the use of chemical weapons in Syria and bringing under U.N. oversight the country's stockpile of such weapons,"" he wrote.

Bush, in the Friday interview, was less forthcoming in his views on Syria. A Republican, he led the United States into two wars during his presidency: in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. Many say those wars, particularly in Iraq, have contributed to nationwide war fatigue. A poll released Friday showed half of Americans oppose potential U.S. military action in Syria, though support increased when possible action was limited to cruise missile strikes.

On Wednesday, Bush's Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Obama had yet to fully justify any military action in Syria. Rumsfeld led the Pentagon during the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq.

""There really hasn't been any indication from the administration as to what our national interest is with respect to this particular situation,"" he said. ""When you think about what's really important in that region – it's Iran's nuclear program and the relationship between Iran and Syria, the Assad regime, with respect to terrorists that go around killing innocent men, women and children, including Americans.""

Bush said Friday he was ""not a fan"" of Assad.

""He's an ally of Iran, he's made mischief,"" he said, declining to speculate any further about the decisions currently looming over the White House.

Bush, who earlier this month underwent a procedure to have a stent placed in his heart, appeared healthy during the interview and said he was feeling ""pretty good."" He was interviewed at the Dallas National Gold Club, where he was helping launch a gold tournament that raises money for veterans.

""I wish I was a teenager so I could be out on my mountain bike today,"" he said. ""But I'm slowly recovering."""

Venezuelan President Maduro said he offered humanitarian asylum

Maduro says he made the offer so Snowden can escape %27persecution from the empire%27

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said he would make the same offer %27if circumstances allow it%27

CARACAS, Venezuela — Presidents Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela said Friday they were willing to grant asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden.

Snowden has asked for asylum in several countries, including Nicaragua and Venezuela.

""We have decided to offer humanitarian asylum to the American Edward Snowden to protect him from the persecution being unleashed by the world's most powerful empire,'' Maduro said at the start of a military parade in the Venezuelan capital celebrating the 202nd anniversary of the South American country's declaration of independence.

Maduro said Snowden's only crime was to tell the truth.

Maduro said Snowden, who is wanted by the U.S. for leaking information about a number of secret U.S. espionage plans, could live in peace in the free country of (founding father Simon) Bolivar and (the late president Hugo) Chavez.''

In Nicaragua, Ortega said he was willing to make the same offer ""if circumstances allow it."" Ortega didn't say what the right circumstances would be when he spoke during a speech in Managua.

He said the Nicaraguan embassy in Moscow received Snowden's application for asylum and that it is studying the request.

""We have the sovereign right to help a person who felt remorse after finding out how the United States was using technology to spy on the whole world, and especially its European allies,"" Ortega said.

Maduro has repeatedly said that the fugitive leakster was being unfairly attacked by the U.S. government. Venezuela under Maduro and Chavez has been one of South America's most strident critics of U.S. policy.

Although the U.S. is the largest supplier of goods to Venezuela and the South American country's largest buyer of its crude, neither country has an ambassador in the other.

The offers came amid the ongoing flap about the rerouting of Bolivian President Evo Morales' plane in Europe earlier this week amid reports that Snowden might have been aboard.

Spain on Friday said it had been warned along with other European countries that Snowden, a former U.S. intelligence worker, was aboard the Bolivian presidential plane, an acknowledgement that the manhunt for the fugitive leaker had something to do with the plane's unexpected diversion to Austria.

It is unclear whether the United States, which has told its European allies that it wants Snowden back, warned Madrid about the Bolivian president's plane. U.S. officials will not detail their conversations with European countries, except to say that they have stated the U.S.'s general position that it wants Snowden back.

President Barack Obama has publicly displayed a relaxed attitude toward Snowden's movements, saying last month that he wouldn't be ""scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker.""

But the drama surrounding the flight of Bolivian President Evo Morales, whose plane was abruptly rerouted to Vienna after apparently being denied permission to fly over France, suggests that pressure is being applied behind the scenes.

Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told Spanish National Television that ""they told us that the information was clear, that he was inside.""

He did not identify who ""they"" were and declined to say whether he had been in contact with the U.S. But he said that European countries' decisions were based on the tip. France has since sent a letter of apology to the Bolivian government.

Meanwhile, secret-spilling website WikiLeaks said that Snowden, who is still believed to be stuck in a Moscow airport's transit area, had put in asylum applications to six new countries.

See more of Robyn Curnow’s exclusive interview with former President George W. Bush and Laura Bush on CNN’s “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer” at 5 p.m. ET.

(CNN) —

Former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, are in Africa this week, where they renovated a cancer screening clinic in Zambia and commemorated the victims of the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombing in Tanzania.

The clinic, which is designed help women fight cervical cancer, builds on the former president’s work fighting AIDS on the continent. While he was in office, Bush set up a plan that dramatically reduced the number of AIDS deaths in Africa.

“I’m really proud of the American people for their generosity,” he told CNN in an exclusive interview. “I wish Americans knew how many lives were saved. Someday, they will.”

Bush also told CNN why he respects Nelson Mandela, what he thinks about Edward Snowden and President Barack Obama, and how he’s not going to be around when his legacy is finally decided.

• On Snowden: “I think he damaged the security of the country.”

• On Mandela: “His legacy will last for a long time.”

• On Obama: “It’s a hard job. He’s got plenty on his agenda.”

Bush talked about Snowden, the computer contractor who leaked details about secret U.S. surveillance programs, to CNN’s Robyn Curnow in Zambia on Sunday.

He said he believes the Obama administration “will deal” with the fallout from the controversy unleashed by Snowden, who is now thought to be holed up in the transit area of a Moscow airport after fleeing there from Hong Kong.

Snowden’s disclosures about the programs carried out by the National Security Agency have shaken the U.S. intelligence community and put the Obama administration on the defensive over accusations of government overreach into citizens’ privacy.

But Bush refrained from criticizing the current president.

“I don’t think it does any good,” he said. “It’s a hard job. He’s got plenty on his agenda. It’s difficult. A former president doesn’t need to make it any harder. Other presidents have taken different decisions; that’s mine.”

The White House has defended the surveillance programs as necessary tools to defuse terrorist threats. Obama has said he welcomes a debate over how to strike a balance between security and privacy.

“I think there needs to be a balance, and as the president explained, there is a proper balance,” Bush said.

Asked about an NSA program that tracks people’s Internet activity, Bush said, “I put that program in place to protect the country. One of the certainties was that civil liberties were guaranteed.”

I made decisions that were the right decisions. History will ultimately judge. George W. Bush

Snowden has said he leaked information to journalists about the surveillance programs in the hope of ending what he called an excessively intrusive system.

The Bushes were at a renovated health clinic in Livingstone, Zambia, scheduled to open Monday as a cervical cancer screening and treatment center. They hope this will save the lives of thousands of women.

In his comments, George Bush touched on the subject of Mandela, who is on life support in a South African hospital.

“Sometimes, there are leaders who come and go. His legacy will last for a long time,” he said of the ailing anti-apartheid icon.

Reminded by Curnow that Mandela had criticized him publicly about the war in Iraq, Bush said he didn’t bear a grudge.

“He wasn’t the only guy,” he said. “It’s OK. I made decisions that were the right decisions. History will ultimately judge. I never held someone’s opinion against him; I didn’t look at him differently because he didn’t agree with me on an issue.”

Bush also initially said he wasn’t bothered about his ratings in opinion polls, even if some of them now put him at a similar level to Obama.

“The only time I really cared was on Election Day,” he said.

Then, drawing laughter from his wife, he checked himself and said, “You know, I guess it’s nice. I mean, let me rephrase that: Thank you for bringing it up.”

In any case, the former president said he doesn’t expect a fair assessment of his legacy in his lifetime.

“I won’t be around, because it will take a while for the objective historians to show up,” he said. “So I’m pretty comfortable with it, I did what I did; I know the spirit in which I did it.”

He Has Contributed To Three Pulitzer Prizes For The Washington Post', 'Most Recently The Pulitzer Prize For Public Service.', 'Aaron Blake Is Senior Political Reporter']",Edward Snowden comes forward as source of NSA leaks,"A 29-year-old man who says he is a former undercover CIA employee said Sunday that he was the principal source of recent disclosures about ­top-secret National Security Agency programs, exposing himself to possible prosecution in an acknowledgment that had little if any precedent in the long history of U.S. intelligence leaks.

Edward Snowden, a tech specialist who has contracted for the NSA and works for the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, unmasked himself as a source after a string of stories in The Washington Post and the Guardian that detailed previously unknown U.S. surveillance programs. He said he disclosed secret documents in response to what he described as the systematic surveillance of innocent citizens.

In an interview Sunday, Snowden said he is willing to face the consequences of exposure.

“I’m not going to hide,” Snowden told The Post from Hong Kong, where he has been staying. “Allowing the U.S. government to intimidate its people with threats of retaliation for revealing wrongdoing is contrary to the public interest.”

Asked whether he believes that his disclosures will change anything, he said: “I think they already have. Everyone everywhere now understands how bad things have gotten — and they’re talking about it. They have the power to decide for themselves whether they are willing to sacrifice their privacy to the surveillance state.”

Snowden said nobody had been aware of his actions, including those closest to him. He said there was no single event that spurred his decision to leak the information, but he said President Obama has failed to live up to his pledges of transparency.

“My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,” he said in a note that accompanied the first document he leaked to The Post.

The Guardian was the first to publicly identify Snowden, at his request.

The White House said late Sunday that it would not have any comment on the matter.

In a brief statement, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the intelligence community is “reviewing the damage” the leaks have done. “Any person who has a security clearance knows that he or she has an obligation to protect classified information and abide by the law,” said the spokesman, Shawn Turner.

Snowden said he is seeking “asylum from any countries that believe in free speech and oppose the victimization of global privacy,” but the law appears to provide for his extradition from Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory of China, to the United States.

Although any extradition proceeding could take months or even years, experts said Snowden has not put himself in a favorable position.

“The fact that he outed himself and basically said, from what I understand he has said, ‘I feel very comfortable with what I have done’ . . . that’s not going to help him in his extradition contest,” said Douglas McNabb, a lawyer and extradition expert.

The Justice Department said it is in the “initial stages of an investigation” into the unauthorized disclosure of classified information but declined to comment further.



A stunning revelation

Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said the revelation of Snowden’s role in the leaks will lead to a sweeping reexamination of security measures at the CIA and the NSA, and they described his decision to come forward as a stunning conclusion to a week of disclosures that rattled the intelligence community.

“This is significant on a number of fronts: the scope, the range. It’s major, it’s major,” said John Rizzo, a former general counsel of the CIA who worked at the agency for decades. “And then to have him out himself . . . I can’t think of any previous leak case involving a CIA officer where the officer raised his hand and said, ‘I’m the guy.’ ”

A half-dozen former intelligence officials, including one who now works at Booz Allen Hamilton, said they did not know Snowden or anything about his background. Several former officials said he easily could have been part of a surge in computer experts and technical hires brought in by the CIA in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as its budget and mission swelled.

“Like a lot of things after 9/11, they just went on a hiring binge, and in the technical arena young, smart nerds were in high demand,” a former U.S. intelligence official said. “There were battalions of them.”

Officials said the CIA and other spy agencies did not relax their screening measures as the workforce expanded. Still, several officials said the CIA will now undoubtedly begin reviewing the process by which Snowden may have been hired, seeking to determine whether there were any missed signs that he might one day betray national secrets.

More broadly, the CIA and the NSA may be forced to reexamine their relationships with contractors, who were employed in roles ranging from technical support to paramilitary operations before concerns about the outsourcing of such sensitive assignments prompted a backlash in Congress and pledges from the agencies to begin thinning their contracting ranks.

Some former CIA officials said they were troubled by aspects of Snowden’s background, at least as he described it to The Post and the Guardian.

For instance, Snowden said he did not have a high school diploma. One former CIA official said that it was extremely unusual for the agency to have hired someone with such thin academic credentials, particularly for a technical job, and that the terms Snowden used to describe his agency positions did not match internal job descriptions.

Snowden’s claim to have been placed under diplomatic cover for a position in Switzerland after an apparently brief stint at the CIA as a systems administrator also raised suspicion. “I just have never heard of anyone being hired with so little academic credentials,” the former CIA official said. The agency does employ technical specialists in overseas stations, the former official said, “but their breadth of experience is huge, and they tend not to start out as systems administrators.”

A former senior U.S. intelligence official cited other puzzling aspects of Snowden’s account, questioning why a contractor for Booz Allen at an NSA facility in Hawaii would have access to something as sensitive as a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

“I don’t know why he would have had access to those . . . orders out in Hawaii,” the former official said.

The Guardian initially reported the existence of a program that collects data on all phone calls made on the Verizon network. Later in the week, the Guardian and The Post reported the existence of a separate program, code-named PRISM, that collects the Internet data of foreigners from major Internet companies.

Snowden expressed hope that the NSA surveillance programs will now be open to legal challenge for the first time. This year, in Amnesty International v. Clapper, the Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit against the mass collection of phone records because the plaintiffs could not prove exactly what the program did or that they were personally subject to surveillance.

“The government can’t reasonably assert the state-secrets privilege for a program it has acknowledged,” Snowden said.

Journalists criticized

Snowden’s name surfaced as top intelligence officials in the Obama administration and Congress pushed back against the journalists responsible for revealing the existence of sensitive surveillance programs and called for an investigation into the leaks.

Clapper, in an interview with NBC that aired Saturday night, condemned the leaker’s actions but also sought to spotlight the journalists who first reported the programs, calling their disclosures irresponsible and full of “hyperbole.” Earlier Saturday, he issued a statement accusing the media of a “rush to publish.”

“For me, it is literally — not figuratively — literally gut-wrenching to see this happen because of the huge, grave damage it does to our intelligence capabilities,” Clapper said.

On Sunday morning, before Snowden’s unmasking, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) had harsh words for the leaker and for the journalist who first reported the NSA’s collection of phone records, the Guardian’s Glenn Greenwald.

Greenwald “doesn’t have a clue how this thing works; neither did the person who released just enough information to literally be dangerous,” Rogers said on ABC’s “This Week,” adding: “I absolutely think [the leaker] should be prosecuted.”

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) agreed that whoever leaked the information should be prosecuted, and she sought to beat back media reports suggesting that the Obama administration overplayed the impact of the programs.

After opponents of the programs questioned their value last week, anonymous administration officials pointed to the thwarting of a bomb plot targeting the New York City subway system in 2009. Soon after, though, reporters noted that public documents suggested that regular police work was responsible for thwarting the attack, rather than a secret government intelligence program.

Feinstein said the programs were valuable in both the New York case and in another involving an American plotting to bomb a hotel in India in 2008. She noted that she could talk about those two cases because they have been declassified, but she suggested that the surveillance programs also assisted in other terrorism-related cases.

A chief critic of the efforts, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), said he is considering filing a lawsuit against the government and called on 10 million Americans to join in.

“I’m going to be asking all the Internet providers and all of the phone companies, ask your customers to join me in a class-action lawsuit,” Paul said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Although no one is suggesting that the groups pose an imminent threat to the United States, the French military intervention in Mali and a terrorist attack against an international gas complex in neighboring Algeria have prompted sharp Obama administration debate over whether the militants present enough of a risk to U.S. allies or interests to warrant a military response.

Some top Pentagon officials and military officers warn that without more aggressive U.S. action, Mali could become a haven for extremists, akin to Afghanistan before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Militants in Mali, “if left unaddressed, ... will obtain capability to match their intent — that being to extend their reach and control and to attack American interests,” Army Gen. Carter Ham, head of the U.S. Africa Command, said in an interview.

But many of Obama’s top aides say it is unclear whether the Mali insurgents, who include members of the group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, threaten the U.S.

Those aides also worry about being drawn into a messy and possibly long-running conflict against an elusive enemy in Mali, a vast landlocked country abutting the Sahara desert, just as U.S. forces are withdrawing from Afghanistan.

“No one here is questioning the threat that AQIM poses regionally,” said an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity when discussing internal deliberations. “The question we all need to ask is, what threat do they pose to the U.S. homeland? The answer so far has been none.”

Another U.S. official, who is regularly briefed on such intelligence, said the groups’ goals were often hard to distinguish.

“AQIM and its allies have opportunistic criminals and smugglers in their midst, but they also have some die-hard terrorists with more grandiose visions,” the official said. “In some cases, the roles may overlap.”

The internal debate is one reason for a delay in U.S. support for the French, who airlifted hundreds of troops into Mali last weekend and launched airstrikes in an effort to halt the militants from pushing out of their northern stronghold toward Bamako, the Malian capital.

The Pentagon is planning to begin ferrying additional French troops and equipment to Mali in coming days aboard U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo jets, according to Air Force Maj. Robert Firman, a Pentagon spokesman.

Military planners are still studying the airport runways in Bamako to determine whether they can handle the huge C-17s. If not, they will land elsewhere and the French troops will be flown into Mali on smaller aircraft. French officials have asked the U.S. to transport an armored infantry battalion of 500 to 600 soldiers, plus vehicles and other equipment.

The U.S. is also providing France with surveillance and other intelligence on the militants.

But the administration has so far balked at a French request for tanker aircraft to provide in-air refueling of French fighter jets because the White House does not yet want to get directly involved in supporting French combat operations, officials said.

U.S. officials have ruled out putting troops on the ground, except in small numbers and only to support the French.

“I think the U.S. ambivalence about moving into Mali is very understandable,” said Richard Barrett, a former British diplomat who serves as United Nations counter-terrorism coordinator. Noting the instances where U.S. forces have been drawn into conflict with Islamic militants, he said, “Why would they want another one, for God’s sake? It’s such a difficult area to operate in.”

After 2001, Washington tried to tamp down Islamic extremism in Mali under a counter-terrorism initiative that combined anti-poverty programs with training for the military. The U.S. aid was halted, however, when military officers overthrew the government last March in a violent coup.

Gen. Ham has warned for months that AQIM was growing stronger and intended to carry out attacks in the region and elsewhere. To combat the threat, some officers favor building closer ties with governments in the region and boosting intelligence-gathering and special operations.

But other administration officials question the need for a bigger U.S. effort.

Johnnie Carson, who heads the Africa bureau at the State Department, told Congress in June that AQIM “has not demonstrated the capability to threaten U.S. interests outside of West or North Africa, and it has not threatened to attack the U.S. homeland.”

The September attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, has provided fodder for both sides: AQIM members participated, U.S. intelligence officials have said, but the U.S. has found no evidence the attack was ordered or planned by AQIM.

A rebellion last year by ethnic Tuareg in northern Mali paved the way for AQIM and allied groups, including the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, known by its French acronym MUJAO, to seize Mali’s northern half.

U.S. officials say the Islamist groups have used the Texas-sized area to establish training camps, recruit fighters from African and European nations, including France, and strengthen ties with other African extremist groups.

A U.S. intelligence official said the militant groups’ “limited people and expertise” require them to focus most of their effort on holding the territory they’ve seized. But over time, the official said, the groups’ growth could threaten other nations in the region.

“They have to train these guys, provide these guys with skills,” the official said, referring to foreign recruits. “At some point down the road, they will probably go back home, and that increases the threat in those home countries.”

The militant groups “all appear to me to be essentially criminal networks based on kidnapping and smuggling … having little to do with Islam or with the remnants of Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan,” said John Campbell, a former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria now at the Council on Foreign Relations.

French officials have depicted their intervention as a stop-gap move until an African military force of 3,300 is ready to train the Malian army and help it recapture territory from the rebels. The United Nations endorsed the mission in December, and the first soldiers arrived in Mali this week, but African officials have said it could take several months or the forces to begin operations.

http://news.yahoo.com/nsa-leaker-39-mission-39-already-accomplished-39-033430455--politics.html,,[],NSA leaker: 'Mission's already accomplished',"WASHINGTON (AP) — After six months when he was rarely heard from except through the documents he leaked, fugitive former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden says his ""mission's already accomplished"" after leaking NSA secrets that have caused a reassessment of U.S. surveillance policies.

Snowden told The Washington Post in an interview published online Monday night that he was satisfied because journalists have been able to tell the story of the government's collection of bulk Internet and phone records, an activity that has grown dramatically in the decade since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

""For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already accomplished,"" he said. ""I already won.""

""As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated,"" Snowden told the Post. ""Because, remember, I didn't want to change society. I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself.""

NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines offered no comment on the interview Tuesday, nor did the State Department. White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said via email Tuesday: ""Mr. Snowden faces felony charges here in the United States and should be returned to the U.S. as soon as possible, where he will be afforded due process and all the protections of our criminal justice system.""

President Barack Obama hinted Friday that he would consider some changes to NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records to address the public's concern about privacy. His comments came in a week in which a federal judge declared the NSA's collection program probably was unconstitutional. A presidential advisory panel has suggested 46 changes to NSA operations.

Snowden was interviewed in Moscow over two days by Post reporter Barton Gellman, who has received numerous leaks from Snowden. The interview was conducted six months after Snowden's revelations first appeared in the Post and Britain's Guardian newspaper.

Story continues

Gellman described Snowden as relaxed and animated over two days of nearly unbroken conversation, fueled by burgers, pasta, ice cream and Russian pastry.

In June, the Justice Department unsealed a criminal complaint charging Snowden, a former NSA contractor, with espionage and felony theft of government property. Russia granted him temporary asylum five months ago.

The effects of Snowden's revelations have been evident in the courts, Congress, Silicon Valley and capitals around the world, where even U.S. allies have reacted angrily to reports of U.S. monitoring of their leaders' cellphone calls. Brazil and members of the European Union are considering ways to better protect their data and U.S. technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Yahoo are looking at ways to block the collection of data by the government.

Snowden, now 30, said he is not being disloyal to the U.S. or to his former employer.

""I am not trying to bring down the NSA, I am working to improve the NSA,"" he said. ""I am still working for the NSA right now. They are the only ones who don't realize it.""

Snowden is scheduled to speak again to the public this week, when he delivers the annual ""Alternative Christmas Message"" on Wednesday for Britain's Channel 4, in a slot typically reserved for provocative or offbeat addresses."

Mr. Kerry made the announcement at a meeting with foreign ministers from Western and Middle Eastern nations that was convened here to decide how to help the opposition in Syria’s bitter civil war, which has killed more than 70,000 people.

A portion of the new American aid, the State Department said, will help provide additional “nonlethal” supplies to the military wing of the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, an umbrella organization formed in November to unite the various rebel groups that have been trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad for two years.

American officials did not specify the items to be sent, saying that will be determined in consultation with the coalition. But the Obama administration has been considering providing military equipment like body armor and night-vision goggles."

Some experts say it has already advanced to the point that it has the technological capability to make a bomb.

Olli Heinonen, the former deputy director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview that Iran had the technical know-how and sufficient quantities of uranium enriched to 20 percent to produce a crude nuclear explosive in two or three months if it made the political decision to become a nuclear weapons state. It would take considerably longer for Iran to develop the means of delivering such an explosive by a ballistic missile, he added, but the nuclear threshold would have been crossed.

At the same time, American lawmakers have reacted to advances in Iran’s program by considering the imposition of even tougher economic sanctions, which Obama administration officials fear might harm the climate for negotiations.

“We’re looking for ways to put additional time on the clock,” said the administration official, who declined to be identified publicly under the administration’s diplomatic protocol for briefing reporters.

American officials would not provide details of the steps they wanted Iran to take to halt its nuclear program. But the administration official said such steps would cover the level of enrichment, Iran’s stockpiles of nuclear material and the capabilities of Iran’s nuclear facilities as well as verification. Just how long the suspension would last also remains to be negotiated, but six months is one time frame that has been discussed."

The group said that Americans and the world will not be able to trust the Obama administration on Syria until it tells the truth about what happened in Benghazi.

Larry Ward, the political director of Special Operations Speaks (SOS), told Breitbart News that Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) was “dead on when he linked action in Syria to the Benghazi Massacre and cover up” when he questioned Secretary of State John Kerry before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday.

“How is anyone supposed to believe anything that comes out of this Administration?” Ward said to Breitbart News. He noted that Americans and world leaders do not trust the Obama administration on foreign policy matters after Obama, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and then-Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice lied over and over about “the YouTube video.” The video depicting Muhammed was initially said to be responsible for the attacks.

Duncan, holding up a photo of former Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, who died in the attacks, told Kerry that Benghazi was vitally germane to the Syria debate.

“Before we commit the lives of American sons and daughters into a civil war half way around the globe, we must be told the whole truth about the Benghazi Massacre,” Ward said.

To uncover that truth, SOS sent an open letter to House Majority Leader John Boehner (R-OH) this week, saying it was “deeply troubling” that Boehner has refused to create a Select Committee on Benghazi. The group urged him to answer the unanswered questions about the Benghazi massacre within a week, form a Select Committee to find the truth, or resign his speakership.

In the letter, the group claimed Boehner would be complicit in the Obama administration’s Benghazi cover-up if he failed to act."

The brigade, known as the Rakkasans, has again and again been at the vanguard of the American war effort in some of the toughest parts of Afghanistan and Iraq over the years, and some of its soldiers and officers have had as many as six combat tours. Most returned home this month to their base at Fort Campbell, Ky. But on this last deployment, they were ordered to ride along while the Afghan forces drive and try to find their own way to take on security responsibilities that will allow a final American withdrawal from the war.

“With regards to our brigade, that’s how this war is going to end,” said Col. R. J. Lillibridge, the Third Brigade’s commander, who has deployed five times since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “It’s not going to be some huge battle. It’s going to end quietly.”

Colonel Lillibridge has adopted a mantra. He uses it to explain why he no longer gives helicopter rides to Afghan officers when they go on leave, why he refuses to give his counterparts fuel when they run out, and why he stands by as their leaders plan and lead missions that appear, at least on the surface, somewhat dubious. “We can’t care more than the Afghans do,” he said.

That philosophy was on display the morning the Americans accompanied the Afghans to search two villages in a remote part of eastern Afghanistan."

“Any day now, Snowden may get an official confirmation from the Federal Migration Service” that his application for temporary asylum is being reviewed, his attorney, Anatoly Kucherena, said in an interview Wednesday with The Times. “With this document, he will be able at last to leave the airport and properly and legally enter Russia.”

Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked classified information about U.S. Internet spying, is believed to have been biding his time for most of the last month in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport -- a notoriously dreary place that most travelers are happy to leave as quickly as possible.

He applied Tuesday for temporary shelter in Russia after President Vladimir Putin made it clear that he would not allow Snowden to be granted permanent political asylum unless the fugitive -- who is wanted by the United States on espionage charges -- stops leaking information that damages the U.S.

Putin reiterated Wednesday that he did not want Snowden’s case to further damage Russia’s already-frosty relations with the United States.

“We warned Mr. Snowden that any activity on his part causing damage to the Russian-U.S. relationship is unacceptable for us,” Putin told reporters in the far eastern Russian city of Chita. “Relations between countries, in my view, are more important than squabbles of special services,” he said, using the Russian euphemism for intelligence agencies.

At the same time, the Russian leader implied again that Russia would not bow to U.S. pressure in the Snowden case. The United States has asked for Snowden’s return, but lacks an extradition treaty with Russia.

“We cannot and we will not behave like many other countries,” Putin said. “We are an independent country and we have an independent foreign policy which we will continue to pursue. I hope our partners will take this calmly and with understanding.”

Putin also reiterated that he expected Snowden to depart in the not-too-distant future. “As far as I can see, Snowden hasn’t set a goal to stay all his life in Russia,” he said.

But Kucherena, Snowden’s Russian lawyer, said that was a possibility.

If Snowden is granted temporary shelter, he will be allowed to stay for one year, “enjoying most rights of a regular Russian citizen, including the right to work,” he said, adding that the law allows him to apply for extensions after that.

“In five years’ time, provided Snowden is still in Russia, he can apply for Russian citizenship, a possibility he doesn’t rule out,” the lawyer said. “In the meantime, Snowden will be able to freely move across Russia and live wherever he pleases in Russia.”

Kucherena said Snowden would not be able to travel abroad without losing his refugee status in Russia.

http://news.yahoo.com/top-us-general-negotiations-done-afghan-deal-135914437.html,,[],Top US general: negotiations done on Afghan deal,"BAGRAM AIR FIELD, Afghanistan (AP) — America's top military officer said the U.S. has no intention to renegotiate a security deal with Afghanistan and that a full withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country at the end of 2014 could reverse gains made by the fledgling Afghan forces in their war against the Taliban.

Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters late Tuesday that although he is not yet planning a so-called ""zero-option"" to remove all U.S. forces at the end of 2014, a failure to sign the deal it could make it an ""unfortunate possibility.""

The U.S. wants it signed by Dec. 31, but Afghan President Hamid Karzai has so far refused to do so. It could keep thousands of U.S. troops here for up to a decade.

The agreement aims to help train and develop the Afghan National Security Forces, and allow for a smaller force to go after stubborn remnants of al-Qaida and other groups that Dempsey said still pose a threat to regional and global security.

Afghan forces were holding their ground, he said, but still need help.

Without a foreign presence, he said ""the development of the security forces will be impeded, will be slowed, and in some parts of the country I suspect could be reversed.""

After a year of negotiation, a deal was struck on the agreement last month and Karzai presented it to a national assembly known as a Loya Jirga for approval. The assembly not only endorsed the deal but demanded that Karzai sign it by the end of this month — which would have complied with an American request to allow time for planning a post-2014 presence.

""What was very clear is that over the course of an exhausting, really, negotiation over many months there was a text that was agreed upon. And that text was considered to be closed, at some point, and presented to the Loya Jirga,"" Dempsey told reporters at this base north of the capital. ""It's not our intention to reopen the text and to renegotiate that which had been already discussed.""

Story continues

Karzai says he wants his successor to sign it after the April 5 elections and has added new conditions since it was brokered. He says will sign only if the U.S. ends airstrikes and raids on Afghan homes and does more to help broker peace with the Taliban.

He has also lashed out at the United States, accusing it of making threats.

In an interview published Tuesday by the French daily Le Monde, Karzai said the U.S. was acting like a colonial power.

""The threats they are making, 'We won't pay salaries, we'll drive you into a civil war.' These are threats,"" Karzai was quoted as saying.

But Dempsey said: ""It's not a threat. I just simply think that in any negotiation you reach a point when you've made the requirements known. And militarily, by the way, those requirements are actually quite clear.""

Dempsey, who was here for a quick visit with U.S. troops ahead of the holidays, said he has not yet started making plans for a full withdrawal of all U.S. troops at the end of 2014, when a NATO mandate ends and all foreign combat forces leave the country.

""First of all I am still not planning for a zero option, although I do consider it to be an unfortunate possibility given the current impasse at achieving the bilateral security agreement,"" Dempsey said.

But he added that ""on the other hand we were encouraged by the vote of confidence from the Loya Jirga, which spoke, at least it was suggested that they spoke, on behalf of the majority of the Afghan people, so we are not planning a zero option although we clearly understand it could be a possibility.""

Allies such as Germany also want the agreement signed to allow NATO to prepare its own agreement for allied forces. Germany and other countries have said they will not stay without the United States. Germany currently has 3,300 forces here and has pledged about 800. The U.S. has 46,000 troops in Afghanistan and its allies have another 26,000.

German Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere, who arrived in Afghanistan Wednesday to meet with his country's troops in Mazar-i-Sharif, said it was important for Karzai to sign as soon as possible to give the international contingent time to prepare, Germany's dpa news agency reported.

""I don't want to give a timeframe at this juncture when we've past the point logistically when it becomes impossible — that wouldn't be tactically smart,"" he said, but waiting until after elections was ""certainly too late.""

Dempsey agreed that delays would affect the coalition.

""I hope it's resonating, that we probably are a little more agile than our NATO partners who have their own political systems, their own dynamics, their own resource-budget cycles, and I think that the real risk in delaying is that we'll begin to affect the coalition,"" he said.

Dempsey described 2015 as a ""significant year of transition"" as Afghanistan stands up on its own with a newly-elected government.

""As in any government it will take time for that government that is elected, the newly elected government to establish itself, to settle itself, to begin to govern, and you know that is a level of uncertainty,"" he said, adding that Afghan forces ""will need a bit of support through that period.""

Story highlights NEW: A State Department official says the plane was approved to clear U.S. airspace Venezuelan officials say the U.S. denied airspace permission to their presidential plane Venezuela's president says the U.S. also denied U.N. delegation visas Maduro calls the move a ""serious offense""

(CNN) —

Venezuela accused the United States on Thursday of denying President Nicolas Maduro’s plane permission to enter U.S. airspace – a claim that a State Department official denied.

Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said U.S. officials have blocked plans for Maduro’s presidential plane to fly through Puerto Rican airspace on the way to China.

He described the move as an aggression and called for an explanation from the U.S. State Department.

A senior State Department official told CNN that Jaua’s claim was untrue, saying that the Venezuelans have, in fact, been approved to clear U.S. airspace.

In remarks broadcast on state television, Maduro called the situation “a serious offense.”

The Venezuelan president vowed to take action, adding that the United States had also denied visas for several members of his country’s delegation scheduled to attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York.

“If I have to take diplomatic measures against the U.S. government, I will take them to the most drastic level if it is necessary, but I am not going to accept any type of aggression,” he said.

The State Department official also called the visa issue untrue, saying the United States had approved them.

Maduro is scheduled to travel to China on Saturday. Jaua said officials were evaluating alternate routes so that the trip could continue as scheduled.

Maduro accused U.S. officials of being nervous about his country’s growing relationship with China.

“The United States government is not going to stop our trip,” Maduro said.

U.S. officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Story highlights NEW: Iran's foreign minister says Iran retains the right to nuclear technology NEW: But it does not retain the right to enrich uranium, Secretary of State John Kerry says The deal includes substantial limitations to prevent the creation of nuclear weapons, Obama says The deal follows marathon talks that stretched into early Sunday morning

(CNN) —

A historic deal was struck early Sunday between Iran and six world powers over Tehran’s nuclear program that slows the country’s nuclear development program in exchange for lifting some sanctions while a more formal agreement is worked out.

The agreement – described as an “initial, six-month” deal – includes “substantial limitations that will help prevent Iran from creating a nuclear weapon,” U.S. President Barack Obama said in a nationally televised address.

The deal, which capped days of marathon talks, addresses Iran’s ability to enrich uranium, what to do about its existing enriched uranium stockpiles, the number and potential of its centrifuges and Tehran’s “ability to produce weapons-grade plutonium using the Arak reactor,” according to a statement released by the White House.

Iran also agreed to provide “increased transparency and intrusive monitoring of its nuclear program,” it said.

There was no immediate reaction from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has consistently asked the West to be wary of any deals with Iran.

However, Israeli Intelligence Minister Yubal Steinitz reiterated the Israeli government stance when he said Sunday morning that the last-second amendments put into the agreement are “far from satisfactory.”

“This agreement is still bad and will make it more difficult than before to achieve an appropriate solution in the future,” he said.

Obama warned that if Tehran violates terms of the deal, “We will turn off the relief and ratchet up the pressure.”

You can be sure that President Obama will speak to Prime Minister Netanyahu” on Sunday about the Iran agreement,

A senior administration official said Obama will speak with Netanyahu sometime Sunday.

“Ultimately, we understand why Israel is particularly skeptical about Iran,” the official said, adding, “This is not simply about trusting the Iranian government. There are strict verification measures.”

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called the deal an opportunity “to avert an unnecessary crisis.”

Zarif said he hopes the nuclear agreement will lead to “concrete steps” to improve relations between Iran and Western powers.

As part of the deal, according to Zarif, Iran retains the right to nuclear technology, including the enriching of uranium under the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons – which requires it not to create nuclear weapons or enable other countries to obtain them.

Iran has agreed to what U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry described as “unprecedented international monitoring” of its nuclear program.

“The first step, let me be clear, does not say that Iran has a right to enrich uranium,” Kerry said, appearing to contradict claims earlier by Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi.

Araghchi – on Twitter feed commonly attributed to him by Iranian media – said that “our enrichment program was recognized.”

In exchange for Iran’s concessions, sanctions on its oil revenues will be eased. But Kerry said the agreement does not roll back the “vast majority of the sanctions that are currently in place.”

The deal was formally announced by Catherine Ashton, the EU’s foreign policy chief, in Geneva where the foreign ministers representing Iran, the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany were meeting.

But closed-door negotiations had been taking place for a while.

A senior administration official told CNN that in the months leading up to the Geneva talks, U.S. and Iranian officials held private, previously unknown discussions to generate ideas for the wider P5+1 negotiations.

The official said talks began after Hassan Rouhani was elected Iran’s president, and that as the discussions were occurring, U.S. officials were briefing the P5+1 partners. The official suggested other partners were meeting with the Iranians and briefing the U.S. about the progress of those discussions.

The Iran nuclear deal is a first step requiring actions by both sides, which have “a strong commitment to negotiate a final comprehensive solution,” Ashton said.

According to a statement released by the White House, the deal halts Tehran’s nuclear program, including halting the development at the Arak reactor and requiring all of the uranium enriched to 20% – close to weapons-grade – to be diluted so it cannot be converted for military purposes.

The Arak heavy water reactor under construction southwest of Tehran had been a sticking point in earlier negotiations.

For years, Iran and Western powers have left negotiating tables in disagreement, frustration and at times open animosity.

But the diplomatic tone changed with the transfer of power after Iran’s election this year, which saw President Hassan Rouhani replace Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Caustic jabs at the United States and bellicose threats toward Israel were a hallmark of Ahmadinejad’s foreign policy rhetoric.

He lambasted the West over the economic sanctions crippling Iran’s economy and at the same time, pushed the advancement of nuclear technology in Iran.

Rouhani has struck up a more conciliatory tone and made the lifting sanctions against his country a priority.

Despite the sanctions, Iran today has 19,000 centrifuges and is building more advanced ones, according to Mark Hibbs, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

The diplomatic gridlock between Iran and the West seemed immovable for decades. But on Sunday, diplomats made history when Iran and six world powers came together on an agreement over Iran’s nuclear program.

Biden Jr. delivered a carefully calibrated show of support for Japan on Tuesday, expressing deep concerns about China’s move to control airspace over islands in the East China Sea, but stopping short of a demand that Beijing reverse itself. Instead, he urged the feuding neighbors to talk to each other.

Mr. Biden’s statement, at the start of an unexpectedly challenging trip to Asia that is next taking him to Beijing, captured the complexities for the United States as it navigates a bitter standoff between Japan and China over the territorial claims — a dispute it wishes neither to mediate nor to see escalate.

China’s air defense identification zone, Mr. Biden said after meeting with Japanese leaders, is an effort to “unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea” that raises “the risk of accidents and miscalculation.” He said he would bring up these concerns in detail when he met with the Chinese leadership.

But with China unlikely to rescind a move so laden with nationalistic overtones, the vice president’s focus appeared to be less on rolling back the defense zone than on neutralizing its impact by persuading the Chinese authorities to stop scrambling fighter jets or otherwise disrupting the busy air corridors between Japan and China."

Follow Him On Twitter']",Five leadership lessons on Syria and military power for Commander-in-Chief Obama,"President Obama's Saturday speech on Syria (where he decided not to decide) offers at least five fine examples of how not to employ military power.

Consulting with Congress is, of course, exactly the right step to take before committing both U.S. armed forces and the American people to ventures overseas. But, how the president got to this point is a lesson in lousy leadership.

Lesson #1: Surprise is Still a Principle of War. If the president's priority was really to punish Assad with shock and awe, he went about it all wrong. The regime has had plenty of time to get ready--disperse assets; marshal its allies; deploy human shields; and decide how it will respond or preempt US action.

Lesson #2. Red Lines Only Work When They Are Red. The whole idea of a red line is prevent bad behavior by declaring if the line is crossed there will be swift and decisive action.

[pullquote]

More On This...

If President Obama was really serious about holding Assad accountable he should have consulted Congress before he issued a red line--not after.

In all likelihood he didn't because there was a good chance they would have said--no--and well they might.

Intervening in civil wars; getting conclusive evidence about what is going on the ground; and defining clear, achievable, realistic military objectives for punitive strikes is really hard--and the White House had no good answers for addressing any of these issues.

What happens to Obama's next red line, if Congress rejects this one?

Or will Congress have to rubber stamp a stupid red line to preserve the president's credibility? Wouldn't that just encourage Obama to make more reckless red lines in the future?

Did the White House think about any of these questions before it stated making declarations?

Lesson #3. A Shot Across the Bow Only Works if the Enemy Thinks You Are Serious About Sinking Their Ship. President Obama has already declared he won't intervene in the civil war, so any strikes will be little more than a nuisance to a regime that plans to fight to the bitter end.

Lesson #4. Victory Has a Thousand Fathers, Defeat is an Orphan. President George W. Bush had a Congressional authorization for a use of force in Iraq, a UN resolution, popular support for military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and support of a broad international coalition. That mattered little when the wars did not go well.

All the legitimacy in the world will mean nothing--if military action does not turn out well. The president doesn't have a solid game plane for Syria, a resolution from Congress is not a ""get out of jail free card.""

Lesson #5. Think Before You Act. In terms of salvaging the president's shattered credibility as a foreign policy leader turning to Congress won't help.

A wise president would have built a coalition of support before the crisis--not waited for the crisis--then tried to build a coalition. And, failing that, then make it seem like military action is all up to Congress--and the president is just a bystander.

From Obama's perspective, turning to Congress now may seem like a brilliant move. If Congress votes no, he has shown he has empathy with the international community--and he is still a good guy. If Congress votes yes--and it all turns out badly--he will say we are all in this together.

But from the standpoint of acting like the world's leader this may be the nadir of American power.

The reality is that every decision on how to employ the armed forces has turned out badly for Obama.

He ran away from Iraq--the violence there is worse now than when he came into office.

He wants to go to ""zero"" in Afghanistan. The Taliban can't wait for that.

He led from behind in Libya and that failure became a front page story after Benghazi.

Moscow mocks him.

Beijing ignores him.

All these acts as president show Obama has not learned his lessons very well. The Saturday speech just makes his shortfalls as commander-in-chief even more glaringly apparent."

Russian media reported that Snowden would be allowed to leave the transit zone where he has been holed up for more than a month following a government decision to consider his request for temporary asylum. But he was turned back at passport control because he did not have all the paperwork he needed, a Russian immigration official told The Times.

“This situation is not standard for Russia. We have come across some bureaucracy,” Snowden’s lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, told reporters after meeting with his client in the transit zone of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo-2 International Airport. “His documents are still being reviewed. Let’s wait for some time and hope that the question will be resolved in the next few days.”

QUIZ: Edward Snowden trivia

The Russian Federal Migration Service issued a certificate Wednesday, in effect stating that the agency was reviewing the application Snowden submitted last week seeking temporary shelter, the RIA-Novosti news agency reported.

The document reportedly allows him to leave the airport transit zone where he arrived June 23 with a revoked U.S. passport, which did not allow him to legally enter Russia or board a flight elsewhere.

The Federal Migration Service would not officially confirm or deny the reports. “We don’t have this information yet,” agency spokeswoman Svetlana Gordeyeva said.

Earlier this week, Kucherena told the Times that the certificate would allow Snowden to cross the Russian border and finally leave the airport transit zone.

“Snowden started passing through passport control, but some important documents were lacking, and he had to stay in the transit zone for at least another day,” said a Federal Migration Service official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Snowden doesn’t have a valid passport, and he needs a whole set of different papers to cross the border into Russia. ”

He said Snowden had to be fingerprinted and fill in a new form.

In the last two weeks, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said more than once that Russia will not extradite Snowden to the United States but has also expressed hope that the former NSA contractor would leave Russia for some other country soon.

It was unclear where Snowden, 30, would stay once he leaves his airport limbo. His lawyer said only that Snowden plans to stay in Russia for some time.

“He wants to study Russian culture,” Kucherena said in an interview with Rossiya-24, a Russian television news network. “But his security remains his priority.”

Several Russian human rights groups have offered to assist Snowden in his efforts to evade a U.S. extradition warrant seeking his return to face espionage and theft charges.

Snowden told Kucherena that he is not a rich man but still has some money. Kucherena said he brought Snowden a new pair of jeans, some T-shirts and a book: Fyodor Dostoevsky’s “Crime and Punishment.”

At a brief news conference Saturday, Hong Kong Police Commissioner Andy Tsang said only that the matter would be handled according to law, and refused to answer a question about whether Snowden was in a police “safe house.” After initially spending time in a Hong Kong hotel, Snowden reportedly moved to a private residence in the territory of 10 million, which has its own legal system apart from the mainland’s.

Hong Kong and the U.S. have a treaty that allows for extraditions; however, there are several scenarios under which Snowden might avoid being returned to the United States. The treaty carries an exception for political offenses; some experts say espionage cases could certainly be regarded as political. Snowden could also file an asylum claim.

PHOTOS: Famous document-leakers in history

According to Simon N.M. Young, director of the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, once Hong Kong receives a formal request for Snowden’s surrender, the territory’s chief executive, C.Y. Leung, must issue what’s known as an authority to proceed.

Hypothetically, Leung could refuse to issue such an authority -- if, for instance, he determines that this would violate Hong Kong law. Hong Kong authorities can’t honor the extradition request unless they have some statute in their own law that corresponds with a violation of U.S. law.

Snowden has been charged with theft of government property and two violations of the Espionage Act: unauthorized communication of national defense information and providing U.S. classified intelligence to an unauthorized person.

Once an authority to proceed is issued by Leung, a magistrate can issue an arrest warrant; in exceptional cases, a provisional arrest warrant may be issued without an authority to proceed.

Were Snowden to be detained, Young said, bail is difficult to obtain. He would then go before a magistrate for “committal proceedings” -- during which the judge essentially assesses whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant Snowden’s trial.

If the magistrate finds there is insufficient cause to surrender Snowden, or determines that doing so would violate Hong Kong law, Snowden could be freed. If the magistrate finds in favor of sending Snowden back to the United States, Snowden could appeal.

Concurrently, Snowden could also file an asylum claim, arguing that he faces political persecution, punishment that would constitute torture, or punishment that is cruel, inhuman or degrading.

“If he goes through the entire process and fights every issue, it certainly could be prolonged,” Young said. “The extent to which he’s willing and able to do that, it’s unclear.”

The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, John Sopko, sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and two top generals this week, requesting more information about the project in Helmand Province.

The 64,000-square foot building was commissioned by the Army in February 2010 to be the Command and Control Facility for Regional Command Southwest during the surge.

But, in May 2010, even before construction began, the Marine commander in the area submitted a request to U.S. Forces Afghanistan to cancel the project.

Despite that request, the following year, in February 2011, the Air Force issued an order to British-based AMEC Earth and Environment Inc. to construct the facility and, in November 2012, the U.S. government took over the facility.

In his letter, dated July 8, Sopko said the military knew the building would not be used for its original purpose well before construction began. He asked Hagel, as well as Gen. Joseph Dunford and Gen. Lloyd Austin, to explain why construction ever began.

Sopko also asked them to find out whether another facility had been built to replace the unused building.

And he questioned whether turning the building over to the Afghan government was possible, given that the Afghans might not have the technical capacity or money to maintain it.

""According to a senior U.S. military official, as the footprint of Camp Leatherneck decreases, the building could be outside the security perimeter, thereby making it unsafe for the U.S. military to occupy it. This leaves the military with two primary options -- demolish the building or give it to the Afghan government,” he said in the letter.

“Due to an ongoing investigation, we cannot comment at this time,” NATO’s International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan replied when asked for comment about the investigation by NBC News.

Pentagon Press Secretary George Little said that the Pentagon was ""viewing the report,"" and had nothing more to add to it.

He was not sure when Hagel would provide a formal response.

Secretary of State says U.S. will defend its allies

Japan%2C South Korea may have to go nuclear%2C experts say

China could end it all%2C says former ambassador to U.N.

Secretary of State John Kerry 's insistence Friday that the United States ""would not accept"" a North Korea with nuclear weapons laid out no new policy on how to stop it from happening.

The long-standing U.S. demand that the North cease its nuclear activity predates the Obama administration and is no closer to being adhered to than it was two decades ago, analysts say.

Actions he did announce, such as President Obama's scaling back of military exercises with U.S. ally South Korea in the face of North Korean threats, are likely to embolden North Korea, says Bruce Klingner, a former director of the CIA's Korea Desk who's at the Heritage Foundation.

""With North Korea taking several steps forward and you take a step back, it only confirms in their mind that the United States will back down,"" Klingner said.

Kerry is on his first stop of a four-day visit to Asia, which is to include stops in China, the North's greatest ally, and Japan. It comes as the North's dictatorial regime led by Kim Jong Un, 30, prepared to celebrate the birthday of his grandfather, Kim Il Song, founder of the North Korean state.

The North has threatened to turn the capital of South Korea into ""a sea of fire"" and to launch nuclear weapons at the USA. The North does have nuclear weapons technology and has fired long-range missiles in tests.

This week, North Korea moved a missile into position that is capable of reaching U.S. forces in Guam. Japan's Kyodo news agency cited a Japanese defense official saying the North Korean Masudan missile launcher was seen in an upright position near the North Korean east coast.

The United States has said the North cannot reach the continental USA but is getting closer to producing an intercontinental missile capable of reaching the U.S. homeland.

Kerry said, ""We will defend our allies,"" South Korea and Japan, ""and we will defend ourselves.""

He said President Obama had ordered several military exercises ""not be undertaken,"" and ""we have lowered our rhetoric significantly"" in an effort to ""find a way for reasonableness to prevail here.""

Klingner says that kind of talk is counterproductive.

""North Korea will look back at its history and see that any time it attacked, the United States and South Korea tended to back down,"" he said. ""In the past, by not responding militarily to North Korean attacks, the United States and South Korea usually tried to get back to negotiations or offered benefits to reduce tensions that North Korea has raised.""

John Bolton, who served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, says the only way to prevent North Korea from getting nuclear weapons it can use to threaten and blackmail the region is for the United States to work with China to bring about the collapse of the North Korean regime and reunification of the two Koreas.

China, which provides North Korea 90% of its fuel and much of its food and is its only ally except for Iran, has viewed North Korea as a useful buffer separating U.S. troops from the Chinese border.

It fears a collapse of the North Korean state would cause a flood of millions of hungry refugees into China. Yet recent articles in Chinese government-controlled media and think-tank publications have raised the idea of cutting off aid to North Korea, Bolton said.

U.S. diplomats should work with China to reassure it on security, promise aid for refugees and encourage civilians to stay in North Korea, Bolton said. It's in China's interests for the North Korean regime to collapse, he said.

""The difference now is a nuclear North Korea really does cause a problem for China,"" he said. ""It's said for years it doesn't want a nuclear North Korea because it causes instability on the peninsula and economic disruption in Northeast Asia. They're right. North Korea is ready to test a missile which the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency thinks is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.""

Klingner said the United States should respond to the threats with a pledge to protect its allies and an expansion of more comprehensive sanctions to further damage and isolate the North Korean regime.

Lawmakers in South Korea and Japan are increasingly expressing an interest in developing their own nuclear defenses.

China does not want that, Bolton said. Once the North has nuclear weapons of its own, China's other neighbors may have no choice but to go nuclear, and the North will probably behave even worse.

North Korea has been ""lashing out,"" without nukes, Bolton said. ""Do you think they'll be better behaved with nuclear weapons?""

In Seoul, Kerry said calming the situation is his first priority.

""The greatest danger here, we all agree, is for a mistake,"" he said. ""The greatest danger is that something happens and there's a response to that something, and then things somehow inadvertently were to get out of control. ""

He called on Kim Jong Un ""to recognize that this is a moment for responsible leadership, and it's a moment to try to reach for the good possibilities, not try to guarantee the bad ones."""

http://news.yahoo.com/ap-sources-intelligence-weapons-no-slam-dunk-070731192.html,,[],AP sources: Intelligence on weapons no 'slam dunk',"WASHINGTON (AP) — The intelligence linking Syrian President Bashar Assad or his inner circle to an alleged chemical weapons attack is no ""slam dunk,"" with questions remaining about who actually controls some of Syria's chemical weapons stores and doubts about whether Assad himself ordered the strike, U.S. intelligence officials say.

President Barack Obama declared unequivocally Wednesday that the Syrian government was responsible, while laying the groundwork for an expected U.S. military strike.

""We have concluded that the Syrian government in fact carried these out,"" Obama said in an interview with ""NewsHour"" on PBS. ""And if that's so, then there need to be international consequences.""

However, multiple U.S. officials used the phrase ""not a slam dunk"" to describe the intelligence picture — a reference to then-CIA Director George Tenet's insistence in 2002 that U.S. intelligence showing Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was a ""slam dunk"" — intelligence that turned out to be wrong.

A report by the Office of the Director for National Intelligence outlining that evidence against Syria includes a few key caveats — including acknowledging that the U.S. intelligence community no longer has the certainty it did six months ago of where the regime's chemical weapons are stored, nor does it have proof Assad ordered chemical weapons use, according to two intelligence officials and two more U.S. officials.

The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders has said an Aug. 21 rocket strike killed 355 people.

A three-page report released Thursday by the British government said there was ""a limited but growing body of intelligence"" blaming the Syrian government for the attacks. And though the British were not sure why Assad would have carried out such an attack, the report said there was ""no credible intelligence"" that the rebels had obtained or used chemical weapons.

Quizzed by lawmakers in Britain's House of Commons, Prime Minister David Cameron gave various descriptions for his level of certainty to Assad's responsibility, ranging from ""beyond doubt"" to being ""as certain as possible.""

Story continues

""We have a regime that has used chemical weapons on 14 occasions, that is most likely responsible for this large-scale attack, that if nothing is done it will conclude that it can use these weapons again and again and on a larger scale and with impunity,"" he said.

Like the British report, the yet-to-be-released U.S. report assesses with ""high confidence"" that the Syrian government was responsible for the attacks that hit suburbs east and west of Damascus, filled with a chemical weapon, according to a senior U.S. official who read the report.

The official conceded there are caveats in the report and there is no proof saying Assad personally ordered the attack. There was no mention in the report of the possibility that a rogue element inside Assad's government or military could have been responsible, the senior official said.

All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the intelligence report publicly.

Relevant congressional committees were to be briefed on that evidence by teleconference call on Thursday, U.S. officials and congressional aides said.

Administration officials said Wednesday that neither the U.N. Security Council, which is deciding whether to weigh in, nor allies' concerns would affect their plans. But the complicated intelligence picture raises questions about the White House's full-steam-ahead approach to the Aug. 21 attack on a rebel-held Damascus suburb, with worries that the attack could be tied to al-Qaida-backed rebels later.

Intelligence officials say they could not pinpoint the exact locations of Assad's supplies of chemical weapons, and Assad could have moved them in recent days as the U.S. rhetoric increased. But that lack of certainty means a possible series of U.S. cruise missile strikes aimed at crippling Assad's military infrastructure could hit newly hidden supplies of chemical weapons, accidentally triggering a deadly chemical attack.

Over the past six months, with shifting front lines in the 2½-year-old civil war and sketchy satellite and human intelligence coming out of Syria, U.S. and allied spies have lost track of who controls some of the country's chemical weapons supplies, according to the two intelligence officials and two other U.S. officials.

U.S. satellites have captured images of Syrian troops moving trucks into weapons storage areas and removing materials, but U.S. analysts have not been able to track what was moved or, in some cases, where it was relocated. They are also not certain that when they saw what looked like Assad's forces moving chemical supplies, those forces were able to remove everything before rebels took over an area where weapons had been stored.

In addition, an intercept of Syrian military officials discussing the strike was among low-level staff, with no direct evidence tying the attack back to an Assad insider or even a senior Syrian commander, the officials said.

So while Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that it was ""undeniable,"" a chemical weapons attack had occurred, and that it was carried out by the Syrian military, U.S. intelligence officials are not so certain that the suspected chemical attack was carried out on Assad's orders. Some have even talked about the possibility that rebels could have carried out the attack in a callous and calculated attempt to draw the West into the war. That suspicion was not included in the official intelligence report, according to the official who described the report.

Ideally, the White House would prefer more clarity on all those points in the intelligence provided to it.

The U.S. has devoted only a few hundred operatives, between intelligence officers and soldiers, to the Syrian mission, with CIA and Pentagon resources already stretched by the counterterrorism missions in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, as well as the continuing missions in Afghanistan and Pakistan, officials said.

The quest for added intelligence to bolster the White House's case for a strike against Assad's military infrastructure was the issue that delayed the release of the U.S. intelligence community's report, which had been expected Tuesday.

The uncertainty calls into question the statements by Kerry and Vice President Joe Biden.

""We know that the Syrian regime maintains custody of these chemical weapons,"" Kerry said. ""We know that the Syrian regime has the capacity to do this with rockets. We know that the regime has been determined to clear the opposition from those very places where the attacks took place.""

The CIA, the Pentagon and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.

Sometimes, the internal dynamics of White House debates on military action are cloaked in mystery, emerging years afterward in the memoirs of participants. Other times, the details surface quickly, if someone leaks a version of events. And in some cases, the pictures tell the tale.

Such is the case with the Obama administration’s anguished deliberations over how to respond to the Syrian civil war, the deadly chemical weapons attack outside Damascus last month and the president’s own wrestling with whether to seek Congressional approval for a military strike."

“I am lifting the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen, so we can review them on a case-by-case basis,” Obama told an audience at the National Defense University during a major counterterrorism policy speech on May 23.

The president is standing by that announcement, even though Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen that U.S. intelligence officials say is now the greatest Al Qaeda threat to the U.S. homeland, was formed in part by several former Guantanamo Bay detainees who were released in 2006.

“A handful of former Gitmo detainees, primarily Saudi citizens, made their way across the border into Yemen and they joined AQ in Yemen,” according to AQAP expert Gregory Johnsen, author of “The Last Refuge: Yemen, Al Qaeda, and America’s War in Arabia.”

“It was that merger between people, former Gitmo detainees from Saudi Arabia and the AQ escapees in Yemen, that really formed AQAP, the group that announced itself in January 2009, and that's the group we know today as AQAP.”

The genesis of AQAP goes back to a prison break in Yemen in February 2006. That's when 23 Al Qaeda suspects, including Nasser Al Wuhayshi – who once served as Usama bin Laden’s secretary and whose communications with Ayman Zawahiri were intercepted by U.S. intelligence -- tunneled out of a maximum security prison in Sana’a, the capital of Yemen.

The prisoners tunneled their way out of their two-room prison cell into a neighboring mosque, where they dusted themselves off, said their morning prayers and walked out the front door to freedom.

Wuhayshi and several prisoners who had been released from Guantanamo Bay, including Said Al Shihri, who was killed by a U.S. drone earlier this year, formed AQAP officially in 2009.

On Aug. 1, just one day before this week's terror warning that led to the closure of the 19 embassies, Obama met Yemen's president at the White House.

Presidential spokesman Jay Carney told reporters then,“I think the lifting of the (detainee transfer) moratorium reflects a changing U.S. policy that reflects a changing Yemen.”

One thing that has not changed in Yemen is the strength of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

The recent spate of prison breaks across the Middle East and North Africa adds to U.S. official concerns, given that such escapes by Al Qaeda often lead to the formation of the next affiliate.

The first coordinated break occurred July 21 in Iraq at Abu Ghraib, where many of the most hardened Al Qaeda prisoners have been held since the U.S. military detained them during the Iraq war.

Attackers armed with rocket-propelled grenades pushed through the prison gates, breaching the exterior walls using car bombs. Some 500 convicts escaped. A second prison north of Baghdad was breached at about the same time.

Six days later, more than 1,000 inmates in Libya escaped from a Benghazi prison in an operation coordinated with gunmen from outside the prison walls. Many had been incarcerated on terrorism charges.

On July 30, Taliban fighters disguised as police and armed with bombs broke 250 prisoners out of a Pakistani jail.

“This is kind of classic Al Qaeda and we've seen this over and over again,” said terrorism expert James Carafano of the Heritage Institute. “When Al Qaeda finds a tactic that works, they go back to it again and again and again until they've perfected it.”"

Brinley Bruton', 'Staff Writer', 'Nbc News']",Snowden hunt: Bolivia complains to UN over 'abduction' of its president,"Bolivia said it would complain to the United Nations Wednesday over the ""abduction"" of its president, Evo Morales, whose plane was grounded amid a false rumor that NSA leaker Edward Snowden was on board.

The country reacted with fury to the enforced diversion of the plane, saying international law had been violated and that it would file a formal complaint to the U.N. Human Rights Commission.

Morales' jet took off from Vienna, Austria, on Wednesday morning almost 14 hours after they say was forced to land there because France, Portugal, Italy and Spain all denied it access to their airspace.

The aircraft was taking Morales home from Russia, where he had met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit for gas exporters. No unauthorized people were found on board.

“We want to tell Bolivians, we want to tell the world, that President Evo Morales, our president, the president of all Bolivians, was kidnapped in Europe today,"" Vice President Alvaro García Linera said late Tuesday in front of the official presidential residence in the capital, La Paz. ""We want to say to the nations of the world that President Evo Morales has been abducted by imperialism and is being held in Europe.”

In a statement from aboard his presidential plane Wednesday, Morales underlined the indignation and fury felt at the highest levels of the Bolivian government, and made a thinly-veiled attack on Western powers.

“I feel this was an excuse to frighten, intimidate and punish me. More than anything, an excuse to try and silence us on the struggle against the politics of plunder, invasion and domination,” president Morales said.

The statement added that Morales’ life was put in grave danger when Portugal and France stopped his plane at the last minute.

“I don’t understand why France, Italia, Portugal and Spain would say ... that they were stopping me because I was taking a certain Edward Snowden,” he said.

Snowden was ""no suitcase that could be taken aboard a plane"" and flown to Bolivia, the statement added.

Cuba echoed his comments, denouncing the international decision to divert Morales' flight as ""inadmissible, unfounded and arbitrary.""

""Cuba calls on the international community to mobilize against these violations of international law and human rights,"" said a foreign ministry statement that was issued late Tuesday and carried by state media on Wednesday, according to Reuters.

Earlier on Wednesday, Morales told journalists in the Vienna airport who asked about the delay that officials were ""surely consulting with their friend, and their friend must be the United States.""

The Morales government already has a strained relationship with the U.S. In September 2008, his administration expelled the U.S. ambassador along with DEA agents and USAID officials.

And in April 2009, Morales said he suspected U.S. intelligence was behind an attempt to assassinate him at a hotel. Police commandos shot dead three men in a hotel room in the eastern city of Santa Cruz, which was said to be the base for plot to stage a coup. The U.S. denies his claims.

Sacha Llorentty Solíz, Bolivia's ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters in Geneva that Austria's move was an act of aggression and a violation of international law.

A tweet posted on the official Twitter page of the Austrian foreign ministry read: ""Rumors claiming that Snowden was on board the plane of President Morales that landed in Vienna are not correct.""

A senior U.S. official said there was no indication Tuesday that Snowden was anywhere but still in the transit area of a Moscow airport. When asked if it was possible Snowden had managed to leave the country on a foreign official's plane, the official said: ""I've heard nothing remotely like that.""

The incident was the latest turn in 30-year-old Snowden's attempt to evade the United States since he spilled details of a secret American government surveillance program called Prism.

Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff on Tuesday called off the high-profile visit that both governments had planned for Oct. 23. A White House spokesman sought to downplay the diplomatic snub by a key ally and trading partner, and described the decision to indefinitely postpone the visit as mutual.

The White House said in a statement that Rousseff and President Obama had agreed that the state visit — an elaborate affair with meetings and a formal dinner with toasts — would be better staged when relations between the two nations were less tense.

Obama “understands and regrets” the concern that disclosures about U.S. spying has generated in Brazil, the statement said. “He is committed to working together with President Rousseff and her government in diplomatic channels to move beyond this issue as a source of tension in our bilateral relationship.”

A statement from the Brazilian president’s office was harsher, citing a “lack of ... explanations and commitment to cease interceptive activities” for the cancellation.

“The illegal interception of communications data belonging to citizens, companies and members of the Brazilian government are a grave matter, an assault on national sovereignty and individual rights, and are incompatible with relations between friendly nations,” the statement said.

Since July, Brazilian news organizations have carried three reports based on classified documents leaked by Snowden, a former systems administrator at an NSA listening post. One indicated that the intelligence agency had intercepted communications between Rousseff and her aides, among other senior officials.

Rousseff quickly denounced the eavesdropping, and aides said she wanted an apology from Obama and was reconsidering her invitation to Washington.

Obama tried to head off the rebuke. At a meeting this month of the Group of 20 nations in St. Petersburg, Russia, he added a meeting with Rousseff to his schedule and offered to address her concerns. National security advisor Susan Rice met with her Brazilian counterpart last week.

But the outreach failed. On Monday, the two leaders spoke by phone and agreed to delay the pomp and circumstance of a state visit so it would “not be overshadowed by a single bilateral issue, no matter how important or challenging the issue may be,” the White House said.

The cancellation marks the second presidential visit scrapped because of diplomatic umbrage related to Snowden and the trove of secret surveillance documents he has leaked to news media.

Obama canceled a planned meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month after Putin offered Snowden temporary asylum. The two leaders met informally days later in St. Petersburg, however, and both governments have endorsed a joint plan to disarm Syria of chemical weapons.

The invitation to Rousseff, the only state visit the White House had planned this year, was widely seen in Brazil as affirmation of its rising status on the international stage. But Rousseff appears to have calculated that reprimanding Washington over spying was more important for her domestic audience than a sit-down in the Oval Office.

“Slapping Obama in the face, standing up to the big neighbor in the North, will be much hyped here and could increase her popularity as she faces elections next year,” said David Fleischer, a political scientist at the University of Brasilia. “It increases Brazil’s standing in the world by saying we can stand up to the U.S. when they did something very nasty to us.”

“The issue of spying would have dominated the Washington visit,” said Peter Hakim, president emeritus at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think tank that focuses on relations with Latin America. “And Rousseff must have been nervous that something more could come out [from Snowden] before then.”

A Brazilian government commission met Tuesday with officials at the Russian Embassy to explore the possibility of a visit to Russia to meet with Snowden. Rousseff also is promoting legislation that would require Google, Facebook and other technology companies to store data collected in Brazil on Brazilian soil and therefore submit it to Brazilian law. Rousseff plans to speak on spying at the United Nations General Assembly next week.

The White House glossed over the downturn in relations, but the delay could have implications for U.S. businesses. Among the likely topics of discussion were a multibillion-dollar contract to sell Boeing aircraft, as well as access to oil fields for U.S. companies, said Carl Meacham, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

“This signals a different kind of environment for the U.S.,” said Meacham.

On Friday, the Guardian published a secret presidential directive calling on national security and intelligence officials to create a list of potential foreign targets for U.S. cyber attacks. The 18-page document, known as Presidential Policy Directive 20, aims ""to put in place tools and a framework to enable government to make decisions"" on cyber actions, a senior administration official told the Guardian.

The directive states that cyber attacks can be launched as part of ""anticipatory action taken against imminent threats,"" but should comply with U.S. and international law and receive approval from the president if they are ""reasonably likely to result in significant consequences,"" according to the Guardian.

The memo is the latest sign that the Obama administration is laying the groundwork to retaliate in a potential cyber conflict. Earlier this year, Gen. Keith Alexander, who runs the Pentagon's Cyber Command, told Congress he is establishing ""an offensive team"" of 13 teams of experts to carry out cyberattacks against foreign countries that target the United States with destructive computer code.

President Barack Obama has directed the United States, along with Israel, to launch a series of cyber attacks known as Stuxnet that damaged Iran's nuclear program, according to The New York Times.

Last year, the Washington Post reported on Plan X, a Pentagon effort to develop new technologies to launch cyber attacks, including a plan to map the entirety of cyberspace and build a system that can launch cyberweapons without human operators typing in the code.

But while the U.S. takes steps to build its offensive cyber muscle, its digital defenses remain weak, officials say. Last month, the deputy inspector for the Department of Homeland Security told a Congressional committee that the nation's critical infrastructure ""are increasingly under attack by a variety of malicious sources,"" and that a majority of the companies in the energy sector had experienced cyber attacks."

The late Ukrainian violinist Mischa Elman is considered one of the greatest of all time, but he has nothing on Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has played the Obama administration better than any musician.

Washington is astounded at what happened over two days on the Syria front.

First, there was a supposed faux pas on Monday in London by Secretary of State John Kerry, who said the only way Syria could avoid a military strike was to give up its chemical weapons.

While the State Department was busy walking back his comment, Putin said it was a great idea and offered to facilitate the handover, a proposal to which Walid al-Moallem, the Syrian foreign minister, quickly agreed.

Then on Tuesday, things accelerated at warp speed. Al-Moallem said Syria was willing to become a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, the international agreement banning the use of chemical weapons, which was the first admission his country possessed them.

While the United Nations was preparing to hold one of its toothless “emergency meetings,” Putin then added a caveat: The United States and its allies (meaning Israel) would have to agree that in exchange they would pledge not to attack Syria.

It was then announced that Secretary Kerry would meet before the end of the week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva to discuss Syria.

Putin seems to have pulled a page from the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev agreed to withdraw missiles it had placed in Cuba if the United States promised not to attack Fidel Castro’s communist island. President Kennedy agreed and potential nuclear war was averted. Cuba is an island. Syria is in a far different and unstable neighborhood.

In his nationally televised address Tuesday night, President Obama said little that was not already known. By my count he used the words “I,” “me” and “my” 30 times in his 15-minute address.

He personalizes everything, but delivers little, except uncertainty in his foreign policy. The world is becoming increasingly dangerous because we have a president who either does not know how to lead, or doesn’t want to lead in foreign affairs.

That House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi would credit the president with a diplomatic triumph because of a pledge from two men whose promises aren’t worth the paper on which they have yet to be written, is funnier than the monologues of late-night comedians.

Shortly after Putin’s “diplomatic triumph,” which might have been expected given Syria’s puppet status with Russia, ABC News Online reported that Putin plans to meet Friday with Iranian President Hassan Rowhani to renew Russia’s offer of S-300 air defense missiles to Iran. Putin knows how to stir the pot to America’s detriment.

Iran, with or without its proxy war in Syria and its arming of Hezbollah, remains the major threat in the region. President Obama, who once said he would consider negotiating with Iran because America had become too “arrogant,” shows that, too, was a meaningless policy proposal.

You can’t negotiate with evil. Evil must be defeated.

By assuming the role of a bad character on the world stage, Russia is a threat to peace.

During last year’s presidential campaign, Mitt Romney said Russia is “our number one geopolitical foe; they fight for every cause for the world’s worst actors.”

Who sounds more presidential: a tentative Barack Obama, who speaks loudly and too often, but carries a small stick, or Mitt Romney, who clearly understood that for threats to be diminished or deterred a president must have credibility?

It certainly isn’t our president."

Able to Foil Basic Safeguards of Privacy on Web,"In recent months, the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden have described the N.S.A.’s reach in scooping up vast amounts of communications around the world. The encryption documents now show, in striking detail, how the agency works to ensure that it is actually able to read the information it collects.

The agency’s success in defeating many of the privacy protections offered by encryption does not change the rules that prohibit the deliberate targeting of Americans’ e-mails or phone calls without a warrant. But it shows that the agency, which was sharply rebuked by a federal judge in 2011 for violating the rules and misleading the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, cannot necessarily be restrained by privacy technology. N.S.A. rules permit the agency to store any encrypted communication, domestic or foreign, for as long as the agency is trying to decrypt it or analyze its technical features.

The N.S.A., which has specialized in code-breaking since its creation in 1952, sees that task as essential to its mission. If it cannot decipher the messages of terrorists, foreign spies and other adversaries, the United States will be at serious risk, agency officials say.

Just in recent weeks, the Obama administration has called on the intelligence agencies for details of communications by leaders of Al Qaeda about a terrorist plot and of Syrian officials’ messages about the chemical weapons attack outside Damascus. If such communications can be hidden by unbreakable encryption, N.S.A. officials say, the agency cannot do its work.

But some experts say the N.S.A.’s campaign to bypass and weaken communications security may have serious unintended consequences. They say the agency is working at cross-purposes with its other major mission, apart from eavesdropping: ensuring the security of American communications.

Some of the agency’s most intensive efforts have focused on the encryption in universal use in the United States, including Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL; virtual private networks, or VPNs; and the protection used on fourth-generation, or 4G, smartphones. Many Americans, often without realizing it, rely on such protection every time they send an e-mail, buy something online, consult with colleagues via their company’s computer network, or use a phone or a tablet on a 4G network.

For at least three years, one document says, GCHQ, almost certainly in collaboration with the N.S.A., has been looking for ways into protected traffic of popular Internet companies: Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Microsoft’s Hotmail. By 2012, GCHQ had developed “new access opportunities” into Google’s systems, according to the document. (Google denied giving any government access and said it had no evidence its systems had been breached)."

http://news.yahoo.com/key-us-decision-cuba-terror-designation-coming-074500998.html,,[],Key US decision on Cuba terror-designation coming,"HAVANA (AP) — A normally routine bit of Washington bureaucracy could have a big impact on U.S. relations with Cuba, either ushering in a long-stalled detente or slamming the door on rapprochement, perhaps until the scheduled end of the Castro era in 2018.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry must decide within a few weeks whether to advocate that President Barack Obama should take Cuba off a list of state sponsors of terrorism, a collection of Washington foes that also includes Iran, Syria and Sudan.

Cuban officials have long seen the terror designation as unjustified and told visiting American delegations privately in recent weeks that they view Kerry's recommendation as a litmus test for improved ties. They also hinted the decision could affect discussions over the release of jailed U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross, whose detention in 2009 torpedoed hopes of a diplomatic thaw.

Inclusion on the list means a ban not only on arms sales to Cuba but also on items that can have dual uses, including some hospital equipment. It also requires that the United States oppose any loans to Cuba by the World Bank or other international lending institutions, among other measures.

U.S. officials agree the recommendation, which Kerry must make before the State Department's annual terror report is published April 30, has become ensnared in the standoff over Gross. The American was sentenced to 15 years in prison after he was caught bringing communications equipment onto the island illegally while working for a USAID-funded democracy-building program.

Cuba has been on the terror list since 1982, and is also the target of a 51-year U.S. economic embargo — the reason why the island of beaches, music and rum is the only country Americans cannot visit as tourists. Removal from the list would not change that.

Critics say Cuba's inclusion on the list has little to do with any real threat posed by the Communist-run Caribbean island, and they say the list has become so politicized it's useless. North Korea was removed in 2008 during nuclear negotiations that ultimately failed, and was never put back on. Pakistan, where Osama bin Laden had been hiding out, is not on the list in large part because of its strategic importance.

Story continues

Longtime Cuba analyst Philip Peters of the Virginia-based think tank the Lexington Institute said removing Cuba from the list ""makes sense ... just because it's been a specious allegation that the United States has repeated for many years ... It would improve the atmosphere.""

Others argue against rewarding Havana unless it releases Gross.

""I have long believed it's in our interest to see an improvement in relations with Cuba,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Gross's home state of Maryland who traveled with a congressional delegation to Havana last month. But ""the first step needs to be resolving Alan Gross's situation.""

Voices calling for a change in the policy are growing louder, however.

Last month, The Boston Globe cited administration sources saying high-level diplomats determined Cuba should be dropped from the list. That prompted State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland to say there were ""no current plans"" to do so, though she did not explicitly rule out the possibility.

Last week, a Los Angeles Times editorial called for Cuba's removal from the list, and other newspapers have voiced similar opinions. The Cuba Study Group, a Washington-based exile organization that advocates engagement to promote democratic change, issued a white paper in February calling for an ""apolitical"" reexamination of the terror designation.

While Kerry can review the designation even after the State Department's report comes out, Cuba's continued inclusion on the list in April would almost certainly rule out its chances of removal in 2013.

A U.S. official involved in deliberations told The Associated Press that Kerry will ultimately decide and nobody under him is in a position to predict what will happen. ""It's very much up in the air,"" he said.

But another administration official said that lifting the terror designation will be a hard sell while Gross remains imprisoned.

""It's very unlikely,"" the second official said. ""There is no consensus. And if you are on (the list), you stay on as long as there is no consensus on taking you off.""

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Ostensibly, Cuba has been designated a terror sponsor because it harbors members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group, the Basque militant organization ETA and a handful of U.S. fugitives, many of whom have lived here since the 1970s.

But much has changed in recent years.

Late last year, peace talks began in Havana between Colombia and the FARC, and even Washington has voiced hope that the negotiations will end Colombia's half-century old conflict.

ETA announced a permanent cease-fire in 2011, and Madrid has not openly called for the return of any Basque fugitives. Cuba has enjoyed improved relations with Spain and Colombia in recent years, and both countries routinely vote at the U.N. against continuing the U.S. embargo.

Under President Raul Castro, Cuba has freed dozens of dissidents and has begun opening its economy and society, though it remains a one-party political system that permits no legal opposition. Castro announced in February that he would step down in 2018 and signaled a likely successor.

The time might also be ripe in terms of U.S. politics.

While in the Senate, Kerry was an outspoken critic of America's policy on Cuba, saying it has ""manifestly failed for nearly 50 years."" He called for travel restrictions to end and held up millions of dollars in funding for the type of programs Gross worked with.

His boss, President Obama, no longer has to worry about reelection or pleasing Cuban-Americans, an all-important voting bloc in the crucial swing state of Florida.

Ann Louise Bardach, a longtime Cuba observer and the author of ""Without Fidel: A Death Foretold in Miami, Havana and Washington,"" said all the political winds would seem to point toward a reboot in relations — except for Havana's decision to hold Gross and try to swap him for five Cuban agents in the U.S.

""In a way they cooked their goose with Alan Gross,"" she said. ""The Cubans thought, 'Gee what a brilliant idea, we'll have a chit to trade.' Little did they know that they would be at this moment where you have considerable momentum to move on in Washington, and politically, because of the Gross mess, Washington can't act.""

Kerry now claims credit for Syria weapons proposal,"Secretary of State John Kerry's seemingly casual proposal for the Assad regime to turn over its chemical weapons has within 24 hours become the de facto policy of the Obama administration, and is now being heralded by Kerry as the ""ideal way"" to defuse the stand-off between the United States and Syria.

But a look at the administration's statements shows that the plan has undergone an incredible evolution.

Just one day ago, Kerry mentioned the idea in response to a question about what Bashar Assad could do to avert an attack

""He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week,"" Kerry said. He then immediately splashed water on the notion: ""But he isn't about to do it, and it can't be done, obviously.""

His aides swiftly set about to walking the remark back, describing Kerry's comment as merely a ""rhetorical argument.""

Yet on Tuesday morning -- after the Russians had co-opted the idea and formally presented it to the Syrian government -- Kerry was claiming full credit for the plan during testimony before the House Armed Services Committee.

""Yesterday, we challenged the regime to turn (its chemical weapons) over to the secure control of the international community so that they can be destroyed,"" Kerry said.

He added, ""Nothing focuses the mind like the prospect of a hanging,"" claiming the ""credible threat"" of military action is what brought the Assad regime to its knees.

Several U.S. officials echoed Kerry on that point, claiming Assad would not be willing to negotiate if it weren't for the imminent threat of a U.S. missile strike.

But the notion that Kerry had deliberately opened the door to the chemical weapons turn-over plan raised doubts.

""We still don't know exactly how this plan came about,"" Fox News contributor Byron York said.

Whatever the origin of the plan, it was taking off on Tuesday even as Kerry and others pressed Congress to continue debating a resolution authorizing military force, and even as President Obama prepared to address the nation Tuesday night.

After the Russian government proposed having the Assad regime turn over its chemical weapons, the Syrian foreign minister said his government would accept the plan.

U.S. officials continue to voice doubts about the idea, but are opening the door to pursuing the ""diplomatic track.""

""We're waiting for that proposal, but we're not waiting for long,"" Kerry said Tuesday.

He said Obama would take a ""hard look"" at the plan.

""It has to be swift. It has to be real. It has to be verifiable,"" Kerry said.

The deliberation comes as Congress considers a resolution to authorize the use of force. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid postponed a test vote originally expected for Wednesday, but Congress could still consider it later in the week.

Kerry urged lawmakers to keep debating, claiming that Washington needs to keep the pressure on Syria while the new proposal is considered."

USA TODAY

National Security Agency leaker Snowden has been in Russia since Sunday

He could be seeking political asylum in Ecuador

U.S. wants Russia to extradite him

MOSCOW — NSA leaker Edward Snowden remained in hiding Wednesday though a hint of his escape plans emerged when the Ecuadorean Embassy asked the United States why it should not grant him political asylum.

Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport was full of media looking for Snowden, the subject of an extradition request by the United States on a charge of espionage.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Snowden has been in the airport since his arrival from Hong Kong on Sunday. He said Snowden is in a transit area of the airport that is not technically Russian soil, so Russia cannot honor the U.S. extradition request.

The government of Ecuador said Wednesday it is considering granting asylum to Snowden and has asked the United States to submit any objections in writing.

Snowden's request will be ""reviewed responsibly,"" said Efrain Baus, the deputy chief of mission at Ecuador's Embassy in Washington. ""The government of Ecuador has requested that the U.S. submit its position regarding this applicant in writing so that it can be taken into consideration as part of our thorough review process.""

Before leaving Hong Kong, Snowden was given ""a refugee document of passage"" by Ecuadorean diplomats, according to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is coordinating assistance for Snowden from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. Assange himself is hiding in the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning on rape accusations against him.

In a statement posted to the embassy website, Baus said Ecuador receives many asylum requests each year and the legal basis for each request ""must be rigorously established"" in accordance with the Ecuadorean constitution, the international legal framework and human rights.

RIA Novosti, a Russian news agency, reported that Snowden had booked two tickets for flights from Moscow to Havana on June 24 and 25 but did not board either flight. If he has not been able to extend his transit visa — assuming he has one and that it is valid for three days — it may be about to expire.

It is not clear what his legal travel status would be if his three-day transit visa granted by Russia expired. The United States has revoked his passport and wants Russia to honor an extradition request.

Former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton said Putin's claim that Snowden did not technically cross into Russia is preposterous. Bolton, who served under President George W. Bush, said Snowden entered Russia as soon as his plane crossed Russian airspace.

""Russia could've pulled him off the plane when he arrived,"" Bolton told Fox News.

He said the only reason Russia is allowing him to remain is so it can gain full access to the computer records Snowden says he stole from his former contractor job for the National Security Agency, records he says detail secret NSA surveillance programs and their targets. Snowden claims he stole the records because the programs are illegal and improper.

The White House says the programs scoured phone calls and websites searching for patterns that would lead to communication among terrorists. It says that the programs are legal and overseen by the courts and Congress and that they have successfully disrupted terrorist plots.

""Cancelling Snowden's passport and bullying intermediary countries may keep Snowden permanently in Russia. Not the brightest bunch at State,"" WikiLeaks said on its Twitter feed late Tuesday.

But as ABC News Chris Good stated, “President Obama’s ‘red line’ on Syria isn’t quite as straightforward as it’s been made out to be.”

The President’s exact words were “We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized, ” …“ That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.” The press along with most interpreted this to mean military action. The President did nothing to dissuade that belief. In fact he sent out John Kerry with an almost definitive statement that leads everyone to believe America was gearing up for a strike. In fact he even sent the navy in a poised position to attack. It was all a Bush-like action.

The Left-Wing blogosphere along with most war weary Americans went berserk. Suddenly, the President changed his stance and decided to have Congress vote on authorizing a strike while still reserving his right to strike irrespective of Congress’ decision.

It seemed as if he was trying to convince Congress to give him the approval in earnest. But even as he tried to convince Congress that this would be a surgical and rather minimal strike, it ‘leaked’ that the strike plans were much more extensive than previously advertised. That would seem like a sabotage of a ‘yes vote’ in Congress domestically, while scaring the hell out of the Russians internationally. After-all, there would be a good chance that the Russians would lose their only naval base in the region.

After the President got back from Russia where the President had some talks with Putin, Secretary of State Kerry had a news conference where he let it ‘slip out’ that Syria could only avoid an attack if they gave up their chemical weapons. Russia gave support to that statement faster than bloggers even noticed it was a statement of consequence.

President Obama never wanted war if it could be avoided. This is the man that said the following in his speech against the Iraq War on Oct 2, 2002.

After Sept. 11, after witnessing the carnage and destruction, the dust and the tears, I supported this administration's pledge to hunt down and root out those who would slaughter innocents in the name of intolerance, and I would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again. I don't oppose all wars. And I know that in this crowd today, there is no shortage of patriots, or of patriotism. What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war. What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt by Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz and other armchair, weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats, irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne. What I am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like Karl Rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured, a rise in the poverty rate, a drop in the median income — to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the Great Depression. That's what I'm opposed to. A dumb war. A rash war. A war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics.

That said, the President needed all sides to believe that he could be as reckless as Bush was. In doing so the Russians were bound to use any opportunity or window to grab on to. Secretary of State Kerry gave them the necessary nugget.

From dire straits to possibility, was this all luck? For those who refuse to acknowledge the accomplishments of this President irrespective of the head winds from an intransigent and irresponsible Republican Congress, the answer is likely yes. Deep thinkers are likely to see this as a chess match and not simply luck in retrospect.

In one chess match the President was able to make the rank and file Republicans seem like doves, the neocons look reckless, the Tea Party wing seem like flip flopping buffoons all while potentially shutting down Syria’s use of chemical weapons without firing a shot or dropping a bomb. The Right Wing would have none of it. They are so filled with that disease, that mental disorder called hate that they would rather praise Putin as he ‘played Obama’.

Here is the reality; the only ones that weren’t played in this whole scheme were the President and his administration. This President is so self-assured that unlike many he is capable of taking a barrage of incoming missiles without responding. He keeps his eye on the ball. That is real leadership. One hopes that as he approaches the twilight months of his presidency, he will use this same technique for middle class centric issues, immigration issues, and other Plutocrat busting issues.

With no good answer, Carney plays to the media crowd and renews the White House attacks on Fox News.

A full five days after the September 11 terror attack in Benghazi, we are apparently supposed to believe Susan Rice was the only person in America who had no idea whatsoever four Americans might have just maybe/probably been the victims of a terror attack:

Henry: You described (Rice) as one of the most qualified, experienced foreign policy experts in America. If that’s the case, how did she get the information on Benghazi so wrong five days after the attack?

Carney: Ed, I would welcome the opportunity to correct the record especially for some news outlets who persist in misrepresenting the facts. You have seen the so-called talking points. You have seen the testimony of the deputy director of the CIA and the documents that demonstrate that the central point that they made was drafted in the first instance and every instance thereafter.

Henry: Then why did various intelligence officers say that they almost immediately knew that this was terror and if she’s so experienced why wouldn’t she see that as they saw it?

Carney: So you are suggesting that a senior member of the national security team should disagree with the assessments of the intelligence community because somebody appeared on Fox News and said something?

A crucial piece of context the media ignores about Susan Rice is that after her appointment to U.N. Ambassador, President Obama turned that position into a cabinet position. This means she was part of security briefings.

Still, a full five days after the attack, when everyone but the White House was admitting what we all knew to be true, Rice claimed there was no evidence of a premeditated terror attack.

That means she is either dumb or dishonest. Either way, she is not qualified to serve fries much less as a top-level adviser to the American president.

Carney, though, can get away with openly mocking Fox News as a defense because the rest of the lapdogs in that room hate Fox News just as much as Obama does. When it comes to Obama, the media focus is always about hammering those who search for the truth.

Fox has been searching for the truth, and that makes them a media target.

(CNN) —

Americans commemorated this week the loss of those who died at the hands of al Qaeda terrorists on September 11, 2001. Their leader chimed in a day later with new threats against the United States.

Ayman al-Zawahiri called on his followers in an audio message posted on the Internet on Thursday to “land a large strike on it, even if it takes years of patience for this.”

9/11 anniversary: ‘Our hearts still ache,’ Obama says

Al-Zawahiri has headed al Qaeda, since a U.S. military operation killed his predecessor and al Qaeda’s founder, Osama bin Laden, in May 2011 in Pakistan.

In his message, he claimed victory against the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan. He called on terrorists to continue the battle on American soil.

Al-Zawahiri named the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15 as an example of such an attack.

He encouraged his followers to provoke the United States into spending more on security, in order to “bleed America economically.”

In August the Obama administration closed 19 embassies and consulates across the Middle East and North Africa after intercepting communications between al Qaeda leaders indicating possible strikes on U.S. interests.

In a message between al-Zawahiri and a top ally in Yemen, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terror chief told the Yemeni commander to “do something,” which U.S. officials inferred to mean an attack.

In his audio message Thursday, Zawahiri also claimed victory over the United States in Yemen.

But extensive drone attacks there allegedly carried out by the United States over the past two years have whittled away at al Qaeda’s infrastructure and killed key leaders, diminishing its ability to carry out attacks."

Their options include offering asylum to the former U.S. contractor, who says he leaked National Security Agency secrets and is expected to face criminal charges; interrogating him; or urging him to leave.

So far, officials in Beijing look to be playing it cool by doing nothing — and that, several experts said Friday, is perhaps the savviest thing they could do.

With some U.S. lawmakers calling Snowden, 29, a traitor and raising questions about whether he has a relationship with a foreign government, any moves by Beijing to contact Snowden could inflame tension with Washington just days after a summit between President Obama and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Given that it’s unclear whether Snowden has information that would be particularly valuable to the Chinese — and whether he’d be willing to share it if he did — it’s a risk Beijing may not yet be ready to take.

At the same time, any immediate effort by Beijing to grant Snowden permanent haven or urge him to depart for another locale could raise hackles in Hong Kong.

Though the former British colony was returned to China in 1997, it retains its own Western-based legal system and enjoys greater civil liberties than the mainland. Many Hong Kong residents see the Snowden affair as a test of whether Beijing will honor its commitment to the “one country, two systems” policy or interfere before any legal process has been given a chance to play out.

Snowden, who revealed himself Sunday as the primary source of unauthorized disclosures of highly classified U.S. telephone and Internet surveillance systems, remains free in Hong Kong, where U.S. visitors are customarily allowed to stay 90 days.

Hong Kong authorities are unlikely to arrest him, experts said, until Washington makes a formal extradition request, or until he overstays his 90-day tourist visa or is found to be in violation of Hong Kong law. At that time, they could detain him — and confiscate any belongings, potentially including his computer files — while they determine his fate.

“This is a win-win for China,” said David Zweig, director of the Center on China’s Transnational Relations at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. “I don’t see them losing at this point, the fact that he’s here, running away from the United States with all this information … whether he goes back or whether he goes free. I don’t see this as bad for China.”

Ideally for officials in Beijing, Zweig said, “if they don’t have to get involved and Hong Kong arrests him, and they get the computer, they win.”

Law Yuk-kai, director of Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, said the Chinese government would be happy to see the case drag on and embarrass the U.S.

“It is a setback for people who want the U.S. to restrain China in its abuse of Internet freedom,” he said.

Snowden’s whereabouts in Hong Kong remained unclear Friday, and there was no indication that he had retained legal counsel.

He told the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper, this week that among the targets of NSA hacking in the territory was Chinese University of Hong Kong, home to the Hong Kong Internet Exchange, a network backbone through which Web traffic in the city passes.

Several legal specialists said they believed Snowden’s continuing disclosures to the media could complicate his case.

Professor Simon N.M. Young, director of the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, said that if Snowden disclosed hacking that was based on information provided in confidence by China or Hong Kong to the U.S. government, he could be in violation of Hong Kong’s Official Secrets Ordinance.

Nevertheless, even if Snowden is detained by Hong Kong police, he will not be obligated to speak with Chinese intelligence authorities, Young said.

“We have a very strong protection to the right to silence in Hong Kong,” Young said. “If there are visitors at the jail, he can just say no.”

Zweig said Snowden would have at least two reasons — one practical, one moral — not to talk to the Chinese: First, it could complicate his case if he was extradited to the U.S., and second, he would be discussing matters with a government that “are not such great guys on this issue.”

“They spy on their people, and not just to get terrorists … [but] just for straight repression,” he said.

Snowden has told local media that he intends to stay in Hong Kong and fight the U.S. in court. His options are unclear. The British government has warned airlines around the world not to let Snowden fly to Britian, the Associated Press reported Friday.

The longer Snowden remains in limbo in Hong Kong, though, the louder calls may grow for officials there and in Beijing to take a more active stance on the case.

The Global Times, a Communist Party-affiliated newspaper, noted in an editorial Friday that “Snowden is a ‘card’ that China never expected” to be dealt and that China is “neither adept at nor used to playing it.”

But the publication urged Beijing authorities not only to “explicitly demand a reasonable explanation from the U.S. government” about the alleged hacking but also to “acquire more solid information from Snowden if he has it, and use it as evidence to negotiate with the U.S.”

Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council said it would meet next week to look into issues raised by Snowden’s disclosures. Lawmakers plan to ask officials how they plan to react to any requests from the U.S. regarding Snowden.

One member of the council, Claudia Mo Man-ching, publicly took Hong Kong’s chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, to task over his reluctance to comment on the Snowden case, telling the South China Morning Post he has “no guts and no backbone” and suggesting he is merely waiting for orders from Beijing on how to handle Snowden.

A coalition of democratic and human rights groups planned to march Saturday on the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong. The rally is not only a show of support for Snowden, organizers said, but also a protest against U.S. surveillance activities and a critique of what they see as the chief executive’s failure to forcefully assert the primacy of Hong Kong’s legal system in handling the case.

(CNN) - Vice President Joe Biden re-emphasized on Monday the United States' commitment to Israel and forcefully admonished any attempts by Iran to develop nuclear weapons.

""Big nations can't bluff. And presidents of the United States cannot and do not bluff and President Barack Obama is not bluffing,"" Biden said at a gathering in Washington for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

The vice president insisted ""we are not looking for war"" but added ""all options, including military force, are on the table.""

Biden's remarks also seemed to preview President Barack Obama's trip to Israel next week, his first trip to the Jewish state since he became president. Biden, however, wouldn't go into too much detail about Obama's itinerary, saying he ""learned that's it's never a good idea to steal the president's thunder.""

""It's never a good idea to say what he's going to say the next day,"" Biden quipped, possibly a veiled reference to his decision to announce support for same-sex marriage last year, shortly before Obama did so.

Biden pledged not to upstage the president, but added Obama plans to address many of the issues associated with the Arab Spring when he travels to the Middle East.

""I am a little jealous that he gets to be the one to say `This year in Jerusalem.' But I am the Vice President. I am not the president,"" Biden said, drawing laughs. ""When I told him that I am not sure he thought I was serious or not but anyway.""

Also on Monday, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, announced that Iran was still not cooperating, rendering it difficult for the IAEA to provide ""credible assurance"" that the country does not possess undeclared nuclear material.

The Islamic Republic still faces sanctions from the United Nations Security Council for violating a U.N. resolution that forbids Iran from enriching uranium. But Iran says since it signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it should be able to enrich uranium for peaceful energy needs.

Of the shared commitments between the U.S. and Israel, Biden focused on one in particular.

""We have a shared strategic commitment. Let me make clear what that commitment is. It is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Period. Period. End of discussion. Period. Prevent not contain. Prevent,"" he said.

Recalling stories from his childhood, Biden said he learned at the dinner table from his ""righteous Christian"" father that the nation of Israel deserved its own statehood and sovereignty. Any threats to their survival, he added, would be met with the United States' ""deep commitment to the security of the state of Israel.""

""That (commitment) has not changed. That will not change as long as I and he are president and vice president of the United States,"" he said.

""We especially understand that if we make a mistake it's not a threat to our existence,"" Biden said. ""But if Israel makes a mistake, it could be a threat to its very existence.""

The main objective, he reiterated, is to obtain peace through diplomatic means. He said the U.S. is in ""constant dialogue"" and sharing information with Israeli military, intelligence and political establishment.

""If God forbid the need to act occurs, it is critically important for the whole world to know we did everything in our power…to avoid any confrontation,"" he said. ""Because God forbid if we have to act, it is important that the rest of the world is with us.""

Brennan’s views on radical Islam may concern hawkish Senators who will scrutinize Obama’s choice for CIA chief.

In May of 2010, Fox News reported Brennan defended Jihad as a “legitimate tenet of Islam.”:

The president’s top counterterrorism adviser on Wednesday called jihad a “legitimate tenet of Islam,” arguing that the term “jihadists” should not be used to describe America’s enemies.

During a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, John Brennan described violent extremists as victims of “political, economic and social forces,” but said that those plotting attacks on the United States should not be described in “religious terms.” He repeated the administration argument that the enemy is not “terrorism,” because terrorism is a “tactic,” and not terror, because terror is a “state of mind” — though Brennan’s title, deputy national security adviser for counterterrorism and homeland security, includes the word “terrorism” in it. But then Brennan said that the word “jihad” should not be applied either. “Nor do we describe our enemy as ‘jihadists’ or ‘Islamists’ because jihad is a holy struggle, a legitimate tenet of Islam, meaning to purify oneself or one’s community, and there is nothing holy or legitimate or Islamic about murdering innocent men, women and children,” Brennan said.

The Washington Times Opinion Page met with Brennan three months later at an editorial board meeting and asked him about his remarks. Brennan asked for the meeting because he objected to an editorial the opinion page had written previously.

Brennan lost his temper relatively quickly during the question and answer time between him and then-TWT deputy editorial page editor (now with USA Today) David Mastio:

Then TWT Senior Editorial Writer Jim Robbins questioned Brennan about the issue of jihad. Brennan lost his patience at one point and decided to leave the TWT offices without answering any more questions:"

He Died On June']",Charles Krauthammer: The fruits of epic incompetence,"The president of the United States takes to the airwaves to urgently persuade the nation to pause before doing something it has no desire to do in the first place.

Strange. And it gets stranger still. That “strike Syria, maybe” speech begins with a heart-rending account of children consigned to a terrible death by a monster dropping poison gas. It proceeds to explain why such behavior must be punished. It culminates with the argument that the proper response — the most effective way to uphold fundamental norms, indeed human decency — is a flea bite: something “limited,” “targeted” or, as so memorably described by Secretary of State John Kerry, “unbelievably small.”

The mind reels, but there’s more. We must respond — but not yet. This “Munich moment” (Kerry again) demands first a pause to find accommodation with that very same toxin-wielding monster, by way of negotiations with his equally cynical, often shirtless, Kremlin patron bearing promises.

The promise is to rid Syria of its chemical weapons. The negotiations are open-ended. Not a word from President Obama about any deadline or ultimatum. And utter passivity: Kerry said hours earlier that he awaited the Russian proposal.

Why? The administration claims (preposterously, but no matter) that Obama has been working on this idea with Putin at previous meetings. Moreover, the idea was first publicly enunciated by Kerry, even though his own State Department immediately walked it back as a slip of the tongue.

Take at face value Obama’s claim of authorship. Then why isn’t he taking ownership? Why isn’t he calling it the “U.S. proposal” and defining it? Why not issue a U.S. plan containing the precise demands, detailed timeline and threat of action should these conditions fail to be met?

Putin doesn’t care one way or the other about chemical weapons. Nor about dead Syrian children. Nor about international norms, parchment treaties and the other niceties of the liberal imagination.

He cares about power and he cares about keeping Bashar al-Assad in power. Assad is the key link in the anti-Western Shiite crescent stretching from Tehran through Damascus and Beirut to the Mediterranean — on which sits Tartus, Russia’s only military base outside the former Soviet Union. This axis frontally challenges the pro-American Sunni Arab Middle East (Jordan, Yemen, the Gulf Arabs, even the North African states), already terrified at the imminent emergence of a nuclear Iran.

At which point the Iran axis and its Russian patron would achieve dominance over the moderate Arab states, allowing Russia to supplant America as regional hegemon for the first time since Egypt switched to our side in the Cold War in 1972.

The hinge of the entire Russian strategy is saving the Assad regime. That’s the very purpose of the “Russian proposal.” Imagine that some supposed arms-control protocol is worked out. The inspectors have to be vetted by Assad, protected by Assad, convoyed by Assad, directed by Assad to every destination. Negotiation, inspection, identification, accounting, transport and safety would require constant cooperation with the regime, and thus acknowledgment of its sovereignty and legitimacy.

So much for Obama’s repeated insistence that Assad must go. Indeed, Putin has openly demandedthat any negotiation be conditioned on a U.S. commitment to forswear the use of force against Assad. On Thursday, Assad repeated that demand, warning that without an American pledge not to attack and not to arm the rebels, his government would agree to nothing.

This would abolish the very possibility of America tilting the order of battle in a Syrian war that Assad is now winning thanks to Russian arms, Iranian advisers and Lebanese Hezbollah shock troops. Putin thus assures the survival of his Syrian client and the continued ascendancy of the anti-Western Iranian bloc.

And what does America get? Obama saves face.

Some deal.

As for the peace process, it has about zero chance of disarming Damascus. We’ve spent nine years disarming an infinitely smaller arsenal in Libya — in conditions of peace — and we’re still finding undeclared stockpiles.

Yet consider what’s happened over the last month. Assad uses poison gas on civilians and is branded, by the United States above all, a war criminal. Putin, covering for the war criminal, is exposed, isolated, courting pariah status.

And now? Assad, far from receiving punishment of any kind, goes from monster to peace partner. Putin bestrides the world stage, playing dealmaker. He’s welcomed by America as a constructive partner. Now a world statesman, he takes to the New York Times to blame American interventionist arrogance — a.k.a. “American exceptionalism” — for inducing small states to acquire WMDs in the first place.

And Obama gets to slink away from a Syrian debacle of his own making. Such are the fruits of a diplomacy of epic incompetence.

http://news.yahoo.com/top-us-officials-meet-discuss-embassy-threat-012212625.html,,[],Top US officials meet to discuss embassy threat,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Top U.S. officials met Saturday to review the threat of a terrorist attack that led to the weekend closure of 21 U.S. embassies and consulates in the Muslim world and a global travel warning to Americans. President Barack Obama was briefed following the session, the White House said.

Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, led the meeting and then joined Lisa Monaco, Obama's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism, in briefing the president, the White House said in a statement.

""The president has received frequent briefings over the last week on all aspects of the potential threat and our preparedness measures,"" according to the statement.

Among those at the meeting Saturday afternoon were the secretaries of state, defense and homeland security and the directors of the FBI, CIA and the National Security Agency, according to the White House. Also attending was Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

In an interview Friday with ABC News, Dempsey said officials had determined there was ""a significant threat stream"" and that the threat was more specific than previous ones. The ""intent is to attack Western, not just U.S. interests,"" he said.

The global travel warning was the first such alert since an announcement before the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

The warning comes less than a year since the deadly September attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, and with the Obama administration and Congress determined to prevent any similar breach of an American embassy or consulate.

The State Department's warning urged U.S. travelers to take extra precautions overseas. It cited potential dangers involved with public transportation systems and other prime sites for tourists, and noted that previous attacks have centered on subway and rail networks as well as airplanes and boats.

Travelers were advised to sign up for State Department alerts and register with U.S. consulates in the countries they visit.

Story continues

The statement said that al-Qaida or its allies might target either U.S. government or private American interests. The alert expires on Aug. 31.

The State Department said the potential for terrorism was particularly acute in the Middle East and North Africa, with a possible attack occurring on or coming from the Arabian Peninsula. The diplomatic facilities affected stretch from Mauritania in northwest Africa to Afghanistan.

U.S. officials pointed specifically to Yemen, the home of al-Qaida's most dangerous affiliate and the network blamed for several notable plots against the United States, from the foiled Christmas Day 2009 effort to bomb an airliner over Detroit to the explosives-laden parcels intercepted the following year aboard cargo flights.

""Current information suggests that al-Qaida and affiliated organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks both in the region and beyond, and that they may focus efforts to conduct attacks in the period between now and the end of August,"" a department statement said.

Yemen's president, Abdo Rabby Mansour Hadi, met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House on Thursday, where both leaders cited strong counterterrorism cooperation. This past week, Yemen's military reported a U.S. drone strike killed six alleged al-Qaida militants in the group's southern strongholds.

Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., the House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, said the embassy threat was linked to al-Qaida and concerned the Middle East and Central Asia.

""In this instance, we can take a step to better protect our personnel and, out of an abundance of caution, we should,"" Royce said. He declined to say if the National Security Agency's much-debated surveillance program helped reveal the threat.

Able to Foil Basic Safeguards of Privacy on Web,"In recent months, the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden have described the N.S.A.’s reach in scooping up vast amounts of communications around the world. The encryption documents now show, in striking detail, how the agency works to ensure that it is actually able to read the information it collects.

The agency’s success in defeating many of the privacy protections offered by encryption does not change the rules that prohibit the deliberate targeting of Americans’ e-mails or phone calls without a warrant. But it shows that the agency, which was sharply rebuked by a federal judge in 2011 for violating the rules and misleading the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, cannot necessarily be restrained by privacy technology. N.S.A. rules permit the agency to store any encrypted communication, domestic or foreign, for as long as the agency is trying to decrypt it or analyze its technical features.

The N.S.A., which has specialized in code-breaking since its creation in 1952, sees that task as essential to its mission. If it cannot decipher the messages of terrorists, foreign spies and other adversaries, the United States will be at serious risk, agency officials say.

Just in recent weeks, the Obama administration has called on the intelligence agencies for details of communications by leaders of Al Qaeda about a terrorist plot and of Syrian officials’ messages about the chemical weapons attack outside Damascus. If such communications can be hidden by unbreakable encryption, N.S.A. officials say, the agency cannot do its work.

But some experts say the N.S.A.’s campaign to bypass and weaken communications security may have serious unintended consequences. They say the agency is working at cross-purposes with its other major mission, apart from eavesdropping: ensuring the security of American communications.

Some of the agency’s most intensive efforts have focused on the encryption in universal use in the United States, including Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL; virtual private networks, or VPNs; and the protection used on fourth-generation, or 4G, smartphones. Many Americans, often without realizing it, rely on such protection every time they send an e-mail, buy something online, consult with colleagues via their company’s computer network, or use a phone or a tablet on a 4G network.

For at least three years, one document says, GCHQ, almost certainly in collaboration with the N.S.A., has been looking for ways into protected traffic of popular Internet companies: Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Microsoft’s Hotmail. By 2012, GCHQ had developed “new access opportunities” into Google’s systems, according to the document. (Google denied giving any government access and said it had no evidence its systems had been breached)."

In a separate case last year, F.B.I. agents asked the White House, the Defense Department and intelligence agencies for phone and e-mail logs showing exchanges with a New York Times reporter writing about computer attacks on Iran. Agents grilled officials about their contacts with him, two people familiar with the investigation said.

And agents tracing the leak of a highly classified C.I.A. report on North Korea to a Fox News reporter pulled electronic archives showing which officials had gained access to the report and had contact with the reporter on the day of the leak.

The emerging details of these and other cases show just how wide a net the Obama administration has cast in its investigations into disclosures of government secrets, querying hundreds of officials across the federal government and even some of their foreign counterparts."

In a letter to Congress on Friday, President Obama said the deployment would “provide support for intelligence collection and will also facilitate intelligence sharing with French forces conducting operations in Mali, and with other partners in the region.”

The last 40 American troops in the deployment arrived in Niger on Feb. 20 with the consent of the government, Obama said.

A senior U.S. officer described the troops as a security unit that will protect crews flying and maintaining U.S. Air Force drones now operating from an airfield near the capital, Niamey. The force includes drone pilots, intelligence liaison officers and aircraft maintenance personnel, the officer said.

“We’re basing drones there to help the French, and this deployment is the security element,” the officer said.

He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss details of the operation publicly.

French forces have been battling to push Islamic militants out of northern Mali in recent weeks in an effort to oust insurgents who seized local control after the civilian government collapsed last year.

Predator drones are already flying over Mali to assist French troops, who intervened in January and have driven back militants and Tuareg rebels, who had taken over three major cities and were threatening Mali’s capital, Bamako.

Advertisement

The drones flying from Niger will be unarmed surveillance aircraft tracking suspected militants operating in the remote parts of northern Mali. The aircraft could also be used over other countries in the region, the officer said.

The Obama administration has not yet decided to establish a permanent drone base in Niger, the senior officer said. For the moment, the operation is considered a temporary mission to assist the French.

Advertisement

But some senior officers in the Pentagon’s Africa Command, which oversees military operations on the continent, favor a permanent base to develop a better picture of the militant threat in West Africa, the officer said.

Among the groups the U.S. is worried about is Boko Haram, an Islamist extremist group in neighboring Nigeria.

Currently, the only permanent base in Africa from which drones operate is in Djibouti, thousands of miles to the east.

In addition to the militants in Mali — some with loose ties to Al Qaeda groups — extremists have taken refuge in the largely ungoverned desert areas of southern Libya and Algeria.

If the Obama administration decides to authorize a permanent base in Niger, it would probably be in Agadez, near northern Mali, the officer said, confirming a report in the New York Times.

Some senior military commanders, in arguing for a permanent base, say the militant threat in the region is growing and could eventually threaten the U.S. and its allies unless more aggressive action is taken.

Advertisement

But some Obama administration officials are skeptical about getting more deeply involved in the region, saying there is no strong evidence that militants there want to target the United States.

Some officials also argue against getting involved in a low-level military operation just as direct U.S. involvement in the war in Afghanistan is nearing an end.

The Obama administration has helped the French operation in Mali with intelligence, transportation for French troops and air refueling of French fighters. But the White House has kept the U.S. role limited.

The U.S. buildup in Niger, though still small in numbers, has unfolded quickly. Last month, the U.S. and Niger signed an agreement outlining legal protections for American troops operating there.

The U.S. also has been operating surveillance drones across the region, including over a natural gas complex last month in eastern Algeria, where militants took hundreds of people prisoner during a four-day siege that killed 37 hostages.

Thousands of citizens, virtually all of them Sunni Muslims, have been gathering in public squares to protest the oppressive Shiite-led government in Baghdad. Sleeping in tents and wielding Twitter feeds and YouTube accounts, the young Sunnis have attempted to take democracy, and a certain sectarian disaffection, into their own hands.

It's not quite the Iraqi Arab Spring -- although that's what it's been tentatively called by some -- but it is a reminder of the stark failure of nearly a decade of American-led warfare in that country.

When President George W. Bush announced the invasion into Iraq in March 2003, the goal was to remove a dangerous dictator and his supposed stocks of weapons of mass destruction. It was also to create a functioning democracy and thereby inspire what Bush called a ""global democracy revolution.""

The effort was supposed to be cheap -- to require few troops and even less time. Instead, it cost the United States $800 billion at least, thousands of lives and nearly nine grueling years (see the graphic below for a further breakdown of various costs).

The toll on the people of Iraq were even greater. A decade of war left chaos and impoverishment, hundreds of thousands of citizens dead and millions more displaced, and a vicious sectarianism that still threatens to rip the country apart at the seams. The government of Nouri al-Maliki, which has reportedly interfered with independent government bureaucracies and ordered the arrest of his Sunni vice president on trumped-up terrorism charges, often rules in a manner more befitting the autocrat the U.S. invaded to remove.

""Here is a country that's being liberated,"" proclaimed Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld a few days into the invasion, even as the first signs of the chaos to come began to stir. ""Here are people that are going from being repressed and held under the thumb of a vicious dictator, and they're free.""

Instead, today in Fallujah, the site of two of the war's largest and most devastating military campaigns, the very best that can be said is that two years late to the party -- not 10 years early -- the Arab Spring has arrived. But the government the people are rising up against is the very one the U.S. installed.

What does it mean to say that the war in Iraq was a wasted effort? Last month, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction filed a final report that found $8 billion of U.S. development aid had been ""wasted outright,"" in the words of Wired magazine.

But nearly eight times as much money -- $60 billion -- was spent rebuilding the country on the whole, with very little to show for it.

And more than 10 times that amount -- $800 billion -- was spent on the mission overall, a boondoggle that left more than 4,000 American service members dead, 32,000 more wounded, and an authoritarian government in place that is little better -- and possibly, owing to its closer ties to Iran, worse -- than the one that was taken out.

Was any of that money wasted? Was any of it not?"

Shouldn’t Congress have been briefed, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) asked James R. Clapper, the director of national intelligence, about a spying operation that would embarrass the U.S. government if exposed?

“Well, sir, there are many things we do in intelligence that, if revealed, would have the potential for all kinds of blowback,” Clapper replied at a House Intelligence Committee hearing in October. “The conduct of intelligence is premised on the notion that we can do it secretly, and we don’t count on it being revealed in the newspaper.”

Not these days.

Clapper and his colleagues now operate in a spy world reshaped by Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who claims responsibility for what officials deem the largest and most damaging compromise of classified information in U.S. history. Among the casualties is the assumption that some of the nation’s most carefully guarded secrets will stay secret.

NSA officials say Snowden downloaded and removed about 1.7 million documents from computer networks at an NSA listening post in Hawaii where he worked until June. The haul included about 2,000 specific requests for NSA surveillance that officials say make up a digital road map of spying successes and gaps in such high-profile targets as Iran, Russia, North Korea and China.

The requests have not been made public. But other leaks from Snowden’s cache have been so illuminating that experts say the disclosures will mark a turning point in U.S. spying, much as revelations of CIA assassinations and NSA domestic spying led to creation of the congressional oversight committees and new laws in the 1970s.

At least some change appears inevitable. In just the last week, events produced “a seismic shift in the movement for real surveillance reform,” said Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a critic of NSA programs.

In Washington, U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon issued a sharp rebuke to the NSA on Monday when he ruled that a major program that Snowden exposed — the secret logging of virtually every American’s telephone calls — was “almost Orwellian” in scope and probably violated the Constitution.

Leon stayed his ruling pending an expected government appeal. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee and has been a staunch Capitol Hill ally for the embattled agency, announced that she would welcome a Supreme Court review to determine whether the bulk collection is legal.

The next day, the leaders of the nation’s largest technology companies sat down with President Obama and complained that the NSA was damaging their reputations and undermining Silicon Valley’s ability to sell computer hardware and cloud services, hurting the U.S. economy. (Privacy advocates have noted that they have been calling on leading technology companies to offer safeguards of their own against the use of personal information they gather.)

Several executives said some foreign customers had begun to reject American-made technology because Snowden’s leaks showed that the NSA had enlisted tech firms and secretly tapped their data-transfer hubs. Some companies are facing lawsuits from shareholders demanding disclosure of any cooperation with NSA data-mining programs.

And on Wednesday, a presidential task force called for sweeping changes in NSA operations at home and abroad, including an end to the NSA’s vast collection of U.S. telephone records. It said telephone companies or other groups, instead of the government, should keep the logs and allow the NSA access only if it obtains a court order.

Some critics say that’s not enough. Rep. Rush D. Holt (D-N.J.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee who has called for new curbs on NSA operations, said the panel’s proposals would leave intact what he called “the surveillance state in America.” Storing telephone data on the servers of a nongovernmental entity, he said, “would simply represent an outsourcing of bulk collection, not an end to it.”

The crosscurrents added pressure on Obama to act more forcefully. On Friday, he said at a news conference that he would make “a pretty definitive statement” in January to outline surveillance reforms, including support for at least some of the task force’s 46 recommendations.

“People are concerned about the prospect, the possibility of abuse,” he said. But he said he was confident that the NSA was “not engaging in domestic surveillance or snooping around” on Americans.

Intelligence officials say some of America’s adversaries, including members of Al Qaeda, have changed how they communicate to avoid the surveillance that Snowden disclosed.

Other costs are also now clear.

In nearly every meeting with foreign leaders or other officials, White House officials face angry complaints about the spying that was revealed in Snowden’s leaks and questions about what might come next, officials said. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the issue involves classified material, said senior White House aides spend far more time grappling with the issue than is publicly understood.

But the administration official said an NSA-led intelligence task force that is investigating the leaks may never determine precisely what information Snowden stole or whether it’s been copied, making it difficult to warn other governments or preempt his disclosures to mitigate the repercussions.

In Brazil, where Snowden leaks revealed that the NSA had monitored phones used by President Dilma Rousseff and her senior advisors, the government has responded by proposing to build fiber-optic lines to Europe so Brazil’s Internet traffic can bypass U.S. data hubs that the NSA was monitoring.

In Europe, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and other major technology and telecommunications companies have been tarnished by their apparent cooperation with the NSA, said Jay Cline, president of Minnesota Privacy Consultants, which advises corporations about privacy issues.

“The Europeans consider privacy as a human right,” he said. “The details of what is being surveilled has raised questions among Europeans whether any of their data can be trusted in the U.S.”

Snowden, who has been charged with espionage and is living in Russia, was hardly the first — and may not be the last — American with a high-level security clearance to leak a huge cache of U.S. secrets.

He has said he was inspired by Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning, formerly known as Pfc. Bradley Manning, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison in August after being convicted of leaking hundreds of thousands of classified military and diplomatic records, cables and videos to the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks in 2010.

Michael Hayden, who headed both the NSA and CIA, said the chance of exposure of an NSA surveillance program “is like zero” under normal circumstances. But the risk calculus changes dramatically when a trusted insider is involved, he said.

“What the Snowden thing has done,” he said, “is show that sometimes the greatest risk to discovery is the self-anointed leaker inside your organization.”

(CNN) —

In one move Wednesday, President Barack Obama managed to reshape his national security team, bring longtime confidante Susan Rice to the White House and annoy Republican critics of the U.N. ambassador.

Obama announced in the White House Rose Garden that Rice, who got caught up in political controversy over the Benghazi, Libya, terrorist attack, will replace the retiring Tom Donilon in the influential foreign policy post of national security adviser.

Donilon will step down in July following this weekend’s meetings between Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The president also said he would nominate Samantha Power of the National Security Council to succeed Rice at the United Nations.

By choosing two women known as advocates for human rights, including the NATO-led intervention in Libya with U.S. support, Obama signaled a potentially more robust foreign policy in his second term.

At the same time, his decision to make Rice the head of his national security team angered Republicans who are demanding further details on what they believe was a politically motivated effort by the administration to downplay the Benghazi attack in the middle of last year’s election campaign.

While Obama made no direct reference to the politics of the announcement, he praised Rice for being “fearless, tough” and a great patriot who champions justice and human dignity.

“I’m absolutely thrilled she’ll be back at my side, leading my national security team for my second term,” Obama said with a smiling Rice at his side.

Rice became the focus of Republican criticism after the terrorist attack last September 11 on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

Five days after the assault that came on the anniversary of the 2001 terror attacks, Rice appeared on Sunday news shows to say it was a spontaneous development during a protest, rather than a terrorist strike.

She had been considered a top contender to succeed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the start of Obama’s second term, but Republican opposition over the erroneous CIA talking points she had delivered forced her to withdraw her name from consideration in December.

Biden on Susan Rice: She speaks for the president

Obama ultimately nominated former U.S. Sen. John Kerry for the post.

As national security adviser, Rice will play a key role in developing and guiding the administration’s foreign policy.

Unlike a Cabinet post, the appointment requires no Senate confirmation, allowing Obama to avoid a showdown with Republicans in giving a new job to one of his most public foreign policy voices during the 2008 presidential campaign.

Rice also has been a deputy secretary of state and was previously considered a possible candidate for the national security adviser job when Obama appointed Donilon.

She said Wednesday that she was “humbled” to serve as Obama’s national security adviser and thanked the president for his confidence in her.

Mindful of the need to work with the various government, law enforcement and military entities involved in national security, she declared her admiration for “the exemplary work done every day by our colleagues at State, Defense, the intelligence community and across the government” to keep the nation safe.

To columnist and CNN Contributor John Avlon, Obama’s choice of Rice and Power showed the freedom he felt now that he won the last election of his career last year.

“Susan Rice is not on the Republicans’ Christmas card list, but this appointment, which doesn’t need Senate confirmation, is being read as a slap in the face,” Avlon said. “President Obama says he doesn’t much care. He is rewarding Susan Rice for her loyalty to his administration and moving her into the White House. She can have more influence now than she ever did on White House policy.”

He called it a “fascinating, decisive move” by a president “who is apparently liberated by a second term, who is not worried about burning bridges with Republicans and Congress who are already his critics.”

Republicans immediately criticized Obama’s choice, with conservative GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah tweeting: “Judgement is key to national security matters. That alone should disqualify Susan Rice from her appointment.”

Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a leading Republican voice on foreign policy, tweeted that he disagreed with Obama’s appointment but added that he would “make every effort to work” with Rice on important issues.

In a statement later Wednesday, McCain expressed support for Power, calling her “well-qualified” for the job as U.N. ambassador and saying he hoped the Senate would act quickly on her nomination.

Power worked for Obama’s campaign in 2008 until she resigned after referring to Clinton – the other leading Democratic contender at the time – as a “monster.”

She is senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights at the National Security Council and a former special assistant to the president. Power also has written extensively on preventing genocide, with criticism of the United Nations for failing to stop attacks in Bosnia and Rwanda.

Avlon called Obama’s move “a coalescing within the Obama administration” by promoting “two women who are in policy terms not that far from their Republican critics. “

“The president is circling the wagons, appointing stronger supporters from his inner circle. That’s what second-term presidents do,” Avlon said, adding “these are actually strong, confident moves in a Democratic foreign policy that believes in humanitarian intervention.”

Now, he said, the roles of Rice and Power raise “real questions about what the administration will do going forward in Syria,” where critics at home and abroad contend the Obama administration has failed to intervene as needed.

Obama called himself “wistful” to be losing Donilon, the former deputy national security adviser who Obama picked to replace retired Marine Gen. Jim Jones in October 2010. Donilon was heavily involved in the raid to kill Osama bin Laden in 2011, as well as the administration’s strategic shift of foreign policy focus to Asia.

Donilon, who also was chief of staff to Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the Clinton administration, is married to Cathy Russell, whom Obama recently nominated to be the State Department’s ambassador at large for global women’s issues.

The president lauded Donilon’s commitment, including in-person briefings almost every day in recent years on a portfolio that covered “literally the entire world.”

“I’m personally grateful for your advice, for your counsel, most of all for your friendship,” Obama said, adding that “a president can’t ask for anything more” than the contributions and service of Donilon.

When he finished, the two men shook hands and embraced.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/17/edward-snowden-spy-chinese_n_3455078.html,2013-06-17 00:00:00,['Ap The Huffington Post'],Edward Snowden: I'm Not A Spy For The Chinese,"WASHINGTON -- NSA leaker Edward Snowden is defending his disclosure of top-secret U.S. spying programs in an online chat Monday with The Guardian, in which he rejected allegations that he is spying for the Chinese and attacked U.S. officials for calling him a traitor.

""No. I have had no contact with the Chinese government. Just like with the Guardian and the Washington Post, I only work with journalists,"" he said in response to a question from The Guardian's Spencer Ackerman.

Responding to a similar query, Snowden painted the spy allegations as an attempt to destroy his character:

This is a predictable smear that I anticipated before going public, as the US media has a knee-jerk ""RED CHINA!"" reaction to anything involving HK or the PRC, and is intended to distract from the issue of US government misconduct. Ask yourself: if I were a Chinese spy, why wouldn't I have flown directly into Beijing? I could be living in a palace petting a phoenix by now.

Snowden also appeared defiant in the face of calls for his prosecution.

""The U.S. government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me. Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped,"" he said. He added the government ""immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home,"" by labeling him a traitor, and indicated he would not return to the U.S. voluntarily.

Congressional leaders have called Snowden a traitor for revealing once-secret surveillance programs two weeks ago in the Guardian and The Washington Post. The National Security Agency programs collect records of millions of Americans' telephone calls and Internet usage as a counterterror tool. The disclosures revealed the scope of the collections, which surprised many Americans and have sparked debate about how much privacy the government can take away in the name of national security.

""It would be foolish to volunteer yourself to"" possible arrest and criminal charges ""if you can do more good outside of prison than in it,"" he said.

The Guardian announced its website was hosting an online chat with Snowden, in hiding in Hong Kong, with reporter Glenn Greenwald receiving and posting his questions. The Associated Press couldn't independently verify that the man answering the questions was indeed Snowden.

Snowden was working as a contractor for NSA at the time he had access to the then-secret programs. He defended his actions and said he considered what to reveal and what not to, saying he did not reveal any U.S. operations against what he called legitimate military targets, but instead showed the NSA is hacking civilian infrastructure like universities and private businesses.

""These nakedly, aggressively criminal acts are wrong no matter the target. Not only that, when NSA makes a technical mistake during an exploitation operation, critical systems crash,"" he said, though he gave no examples of what systems have crashed or in which countries.

""Congress hasn't declared war on the countries – the majority of them are our allies – but without asking for public permission, NSA is running network operations against them that affect millions of innocent people,"" he said. ""And for what? So we can have secret access to a computer in a country we're not even fighting?""

Snowden was referring to PRISM, one of the programs he disclosed. The program sweeps up Internet usage data from all over the world that goes through nine major U.S.-based Internet providers. The NSA can look at foreign usage without any warrants, and says the program doesn't target Americans.

U.S. officials say the data-gathering programs are legal and operated under secret court supervision.

Snowden explained his claim that from his desk, he could ""wiretap"" any phone call or email – a claim top intelligence officials have denied. ""If an NSA, FBI, CIA, DIA, etc. analyst has access to query raw SIGINT (signals intelligence) databases, they can enter and get results for anything they want,"" he wrote in the answer posted on the Guardian site. ""Phone number, email, user id, cell phone handset id (IMEI), and so on – it's all the same.""

The NSA did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. But Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said that the kind of data that can be accessed and who can access it is severely limited.

Snowden said the restrictions on what could be seen by an individual analyst vary according to policy changes, which can happen ""at any time,"" and said that a technical ""filter"" on NSA data gathering meant to filter out U.S. communications is ""weak,"" such that U.S. communications often get ingested.

Snowden defended U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning for his disclosures of documents to Wikileaks, which he called a ""legitimate journalistic outlet,"" which ""carefully redacted all of their releases in accordance with a judgment of public interest."" He said the Wikileaks release of unredacted material was ""due to the failure of a partner journalist to control a passphrase,"" which led to the charge against Manning that he dumped the documents, which Snowden called an attempt to smear Manning.

Manning is currently on trial at Fort Meade – the same Army base where the NSA is headquartered – on charges of aiding the enemy for releasing documents to Wikileaks.

Snowden defended his description of his salary as being $200,000 a year, calling that a ""career high,"" but saying he did take a pay cut to take the job at Booz Allen Hamilton, where he worked as a contractor at an NSA facility in Hawaii. When Booz Allen fired him, they said his salary was $122,000.

Obama’s comments, in an exclusive interview with CNN's ""New Day,"" came amid a flurry of news reports suggesting his administration has stepped up consideration of possible military strikes against the regime of Bashar Assad.

The president did not explicitly confirm charges by the opposition to Assad that the regime in Damascus carried out the worst chemical weapons attack in 25 years, killing more than 1,000 people, but declared: “This is clearly a big event of grave concern.”

“This is something that is going to require America's attention and hopefully the entire international community's attention,” he said.

“There is no doubt that when you start seeing chemical weapons used on a large scale,” he told CNN, “then that starts getting to some core national interests that the United States has, both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as well as needing to protect our allies, our bases in the region.”

Obama defended his decision not to use military force thus far, noting that America is still fighting a war in Afghanistan, arguing that he has to worry about America’s long-term national interests, and suggesting that some of those passionately arguing for intervention forgot the lessons of Iraq.

“Sometimes what we've seen is that folks will call for immediate action, jumping into stuff, that does not turn out well, gets us mired in very difficult situations, can result in us being drawn into very expensive, difficult, costly interventions that actually breed more resentment in the region,” he said.

And “if the U.S. goes in and attacks another country without a U.N. mandate and without clear evidence that can be presented, then there are questions in terms of whether international law supports it, do we have the coalition to make it work, and, you know, those are considerations that we have to take into account,” he said.

Story continues

Arguably Obama's biggest critic on the issue has been Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who issued a blistering statement on Thursday condemning the president's approach and urging a far stronger American response.



""It has been a year since the President said that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would constitute the crossing of a red line. But, because these threats have not been backed up by any real consequences, they have rung hollow,"" McCain said. ""As a result, the killing goes on, Assad remains in power, and his use of chemical weapons against Syrian civilians apparently continues. It is long past time for the United States and our friends and allies to respond to Assad's continuing mass atrocities in Syria with decisive actions, including limited military strikes"" targeting Syria's air force and missile facilities.

""This most recent massacre of innocent men, women, and children should shock our collective conscience — that is, whatever conscience remains after more than 100,000 Syrians have been slaughtered while the United States has largely remained on the sidelines,"" McCain said.

“I am sympathetic to Sen. McCain's passion for helping people work through what is an extraordinarily difficult and heartbreaking situation, both in Syria and in Egypt, and these two countries are in different situations,” Obama told CNN.

“But what I think the American people also expect me to do as president is to think through what we do from the perspective of what is in our long-term national interests,” he added. “We remain the one indispensable nation. ... But that does not mean that we have to get involved with everything immediately.”"

http://news.yahoo.com/despite-hot-issues-lawmakers-meet-public-less-114445257.html,,[],"Despite hot issues, lawmakers meet public less","FORT DODGE, Iowa (AP) — From her front row seat at the Fort Dodge Public Library, pugnacious retiree Betty Nostrom wasted no time grilling the U.S. senator standing before 80 constituents over how he was investigating the deaths of four Americans in Libya last fall.

""Or will that just be swept under the rug?"" Nostrom asked Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, kicking off an hour of polite, though pointed, questioning.

Farmers, nurses and veterans took turns pressing Grassley on gun control, immigration, the deficit and the Internal Revenue Service scandal, and listening to his answers.

Some in the audience applauded. Others scoffed. But all embraced the chance to put their representative to Washington on the spot, face to face, during the town hall style meeting, a staple of American civics that's growing increasingly scarce.

These days, lawmakers generally are holding fewer in-person public gatherings with constituents than they have in past years, evidenced by the smattering of such events last week during the Memorial Day congressional recess. Instead, members of Congress are relying far more on telephone and online forums, according to watchdog groups, political organizations and lawmakers themselves.

""There's a myth out there that legislators aren't listening,"" said Brad Fitch, president of the Congressional Management Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit group that advocates best practices for members of Congress. ""They are, but we're seeing them shift to other forums, and the discussions often aren't as robust.""

Why the shift? For one, angry crowds, sometimes in the thousands, mobbed public question-and-answer meetings in lawmakers' home states during the raucous debate over health care legislation in 2009. Then there was the shooting rampage in 2011 at a public appearance in Tucson by then-Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz.

Such incidents spooked lawmakers, who also were facing constituents deeply down on Washington and frustrated by high unemployment and foreclosure rates.

Story continues

Beyond any security concerns, politicians have practical reasons for changing to a more frequent electronic format. Many say those numerous benefits of outweigh the big drawback: They lose the personal touch, the handshake moment at the end of a robust discussion, that can tighten bonds with their constituents.

Some lawmakers say electronic versions of town halls are more efficient and convenient than the real thing.

Rep. Jim Gerlach, R-Penn., says he can check in with voters at home without having to travel back, often holding constituent conference calls on Mondays or Tuesdays when Congress is in session.

It's not just convenient for a lawmaker to arrange. They pay a service to simultaneously call thousands of numbers and ask them to stay on the line for the event to begin. It's also convenient for constituents to participate. They don't have to take off of work or get in a car, and they can linger and listen as long as they like.

In an era of shrinking congressional office budgets, advocates say electronic forums also are appealing because they reach many times more people and are cheap to advertise via a single email sent to thousands.

About 20 people showed up for Republican Rep. Mick Mulvaney's meeting in Union, S.C., last week. Mulvaney recalled once advertising a meeting by paying for 1,800 first-class mail notices. He said four people showed up.

Lawmakers more conveniently can collect the contact information from participants in the electronic forums than the in-person kind.

In Fort Dodge, a Grassley aide passed around paper cards for the 80 attendees to fill out return after the meeting for staff to record.

Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., said he once held a call that attracted 50,000 listeners, and he uses the conference calls to conduct opinion polls.

""It gives us a real pulse,"" Franks said. ""In my judgment it's just a wonderful way to go.""

At the same time, electronic town hall meetings decrease the risk of ugly confrontations that can be caught on video and posted on YouTube.

Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., said opponents or interest groups sometimes hijack public events and heckle the members. With teleconferences, they are easier to weed out, Boustany said.

The convenience of picking up the phone may make it easier for people to participate in an era when busy schedules and perhaps apathy or disgust with Congress may keep voters from engaging in a nation where fewer than 1 in 5 people approves of the job Congress is doing.

All this means the odds are that most people in the U.S. won't get the chance to interrogate their lawmakers in person during Congress' summer break, despite a series of hot issues on Capitol Hill, including immigration, the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, the IRS' targeting of conservative political groups and the Justice Department's seizure of media outlets' telephone records.

""You have all this and members of Congress have effectively stopped doing town hall meetings,"" says Matt Kibbe, president of the tea-party organizer Freedomworks. ""I find quite remarkable that they are unwilling to meet with their customers.""

Grassley is a big exception.

He's diligently continued holding frequent in-person town hall meetings, annually meeting his promise to visit each of Iowa's 99 counties despite being the target of angry conservatives in 2009 during the health care debate and despite the logistical challenges.

Grassley insisted there's still value in the traditional way, calling the give-and-take with constituents the glue that binds him to them.

""I can read their letters and talk to them on the phone. But you don't fully understand,"" he said last Wednesday. ""Here, I look them in the eye. They look me in the eye. It's more full communication.""

With that, he headed out the Fort Dodge library door, headed to his fourth town hall of the day. And it was only 1 p.m.

Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, outlined five options that he said the U.S. military could carry out if ordered by the White House: stepping up training and advising of the rebels, conducting limited airstrikes, establishing a no-fly zone, setting up a buffer zone inside Syria outside government control and securing Syria’s chemical weapons stockpile.

Dempsey described the options and the risks that each carries in a letter to Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. During a hearing last week on Dempsey’s nomination for a second two-year term, Levin had asked for steps the U.S. could take on Syria.

Dempsey said there were “ongoing deliberations” over the U.S. role in Syria within the Obama administration, which announced two months ago that it was stepping up military aid to the rebels after concluding that President Bashar Assad’s government had used chemical weapons.

The limited U.S. effort to train and equip rebels so far has been handled by the CIA. Bringing in the military to conduct training would take “several hundred to several thousand” U.S. troops in safe areas outside Syria and cost $500 million a year, Dempsey said. It would carry the risk that extremists fighting on the side of the rebels would gain “additional capabilities” and raise the possibility of cross-border attacks by Syrian government forces.

The U.S. could also opt for strikes using aircraft and missiles fired from outside Syria, which could potentially hit “hundreds” of military targets and significantly degrade the government’s strength over time, he said. But doing so would take hundreds of aircraft, ships and submarines. Syria could potentially “withstand limited strikes by dispersing its assets,” he said.

A no-fly zone over Syria would prevent Assad’s government from using its aircraft to bomb rebel-held areas and resupply its troops. But it would require hundreds of aircraft, based at sea and in nearby countries, and cost as much as $1 billion a month, Dempsey said. The U.S. could also lose aircraft as it sought to eliminate the government’s air defense system, and “it may also fail to reduce the violence” because most attacks on rebels are conducted by Syrian ground units, not aircraft, he said.

The creation of buffer zones in Syria near its borders with Jordan or Turkey would allow rebels to train and permit distribution of humanitarian aid, Dempsey said. But setting up such a zone would require a limited no-fly zone as well as thousands of U.S. troops, costing more than $1 billion a month.

Controlling Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles would require air and missile strikes, as well as thousands of special operations troops, Dempsey said. “The impact would be the control of some but not all chemical weapons,” he said.

U.S. intervention would “likely further the narrow military objective of helping the opposition and placing more pressure on the regime,” Dempsey said. But he also warned that intervention would bring unanticipated consequences, echoing the cautious stance of the Obama administration, which has played down the prospect of direct U.S. military involvement in the war.

“Should the regime institutions collapse in the absence of a viable opposition, we could inadvertently empower extremists or unleash the very chemical weapons we seek to control,” Dempsey said.

At a security forum last week, David Shedd, the No. 2 official at the Defense Intelligence Agency, said the Islamist militants among the Syrian opposition were becoming increasingly powerful and dangerous.

“The reality is that, left unchecked, they will become bigger,” Shedd told the Aspen Security Forum, an annual conference on security issues. “Over the last two years they’ve grown in size, they’ve grown in capability and ruthlessly have grown in effectiveness.”

http://news.yahoo.com/congress-split-cutting-off-aid-egypt-162943396.html,,[],Congress split on cutting off aid to Egypt,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of Congress are split over whether the U.S. should cut off military aid to Egypt, highlighting the difficult choices facing the Obama administration amid spiraling violence on the streets of an important Middle East ally.

Democratic leaders have generally supported the president's approach. But on Sunday, Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., said he would end aid to Egypt. Ellison is the first Muslim elected to Congress and is co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

""I would cut off aid but engage in intense diplomacy in Egypt and in the region to try to say, look, we will restore aid when you stop the bloodshed in the street and set up a path towards democracy that you were on before,"" Ellison said. ""In my mind, there's no way to say that this was not a coup. It is. We should say so. And then follow our own law, which says we cannot fund the coup leaders.""

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said funding for Egypt remains under review.

""As we've made clear, all of our assistance to Egypt is currently under review, and we will consider additional steps as we deem necessary,"" Hayden said. ""At this point, no additional decisions have been made regarding assistance. That review process is ongoing.""

Among Republicans, there were growing calls to eliminate military aid to Egypt. But others were more hesitant.

Rep. Pete King, R-N.Y., said curtailing aid could reduce U.S. influence over Egypt's interim government, which controls access to strategic resources, including the Suez Canal.

""We certainly shouldn't cut off all aid,"" said King, who chairs the House panel on counterterrorism and intelligence.

King said there are no good choices in Egypt. Ousted President Mohammed Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, was democratically elected. But, King said, the group has not demonstrated a commitment to democracy.

""The fact is, there's no good guys there,"" King said. ""But of the two, I think there is more opportunity to protect American interests if we work with the military and continue our relationship with the military.""

Story continues

The split among members of the same political party illustrates the uncertainty facing President Barack Obama as he tries to navigate volatile developments in Egypt, where crackdowns last week left more than 600 people dead and thousands more injured.

Obama has denounced the violence, canceled joint military exercises scheduled for September and delayed the delivery of four F-16 fighter jets. But the White House has refused to declare Morsi's removal a coup — a step that would require Obama to suspend $1.3 billion in annual military aid. The president insists that the U.S. stands with Egyptians seeking a democratic government. But he says America cannot determine Egypt's future.

Sen. John McCain of Arizona renewed his call Sunday to stop aid as the Egyptian military continues to crack down on protesters seeking Morsi's return.

""For us to sit by and watch this happen is a violation of everything that we stood for,"" said the senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""We're not sticking with our values.""

The military ousted Morsi July 3 after millions of Egyptians took to the streets to demand he step down, accusing him of giving the Brotherhood undue influence and failing to implement vital reforms or bolster the ailing economy.

But Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said he supports the president's approach.

""These are very, very difficult choices,"" said Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""I'm very unhappy, obviously, with the crackdown. But we essentially have two choices in Egypt. And that's a military government, which hopefully will transition as quickly as possible to civilian government, or the Muslim Brotherhood. I don't think the Muslim Brotherhood is a choice.""

Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said Congress should give the president flexibility in dealing with Egypt.

""I do believe we have to change our aid,"" said Reed, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""I think also we have to have included in the legislation a national security waiver, because we have to give the president not only the responsibility to deal with the government of Egypt but also flexibility.""

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said U.S. aid to Egypt was more likely to ""buy a chateau in Paris"" for an Egyptian military leader than ""bread in Cairo"" for the poor.

""I don't think we're buying any friendship with the Egyptian people,"" Paul said, especially when people see tanks supplied by the U.S. to the Egyptian military on the streets of Cairo.

""We are not winning the hearts and minds of the Egyptian people,"" said Paul, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""The aid has to end.""

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., had resisted calls to cut off aid. But on Sunday, he switched positions.

""I think we need to look at the tiers of our aid,"" said Corker, top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Let's face it, most of the aid has gone out the door this year.""

Corker said he expects Congress to debate next year's aid this fall, after lawmakers return from their summer recess.

""Look, I condemn what's happened with the military, but I also condemn what in essence was a political coup by the Muslim Brotherhood,"" Corker said. ""And we need to move this debate along and this fall, hopefully, again, focus on what is our national interests. And there still are things within Egypt that are very much in our national interest. And we need to keep the lines of communication open.""

McCain spoke on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" King and Paul made their comments on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Reed spoke on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and Engel, Ellison and Corker appeared on ABC's ""This Week.""

http://news.yahoo.com/heres-snowden-could-escape-moscow-exactly-where-could-170054527.html,,[],Here's How Snowden Could Escape from Moscow and Exactly Where He Could Go,"If Edward Snowden wants to leave Russia, here's how he can do so: Leave the terminal, get onto a plane, fly to another country. That's it. Of course, each of those steps presents a different set of challenges, none more than the last one. Prompting the question: Is there anywhere that Snowden can get to without risking being blocked from flying through another country's airspace?

RELATED: The Six Tricky Steps to Edward Snowden's Extradition, Explained

Before we answer that, let's get steps one and two out of the way.

RELATED: These Pundits Have Decided Snowden Deserves to Go to Jail

Step one: Leave the terminal.

Whether or not Snowden can depart Russia depends, first and foremost, on whether or not Russia wants him to leave. The Atlantic Wire spoke with attorney David Leopold of Leopold & Associates who's been practicing immigration law for decades and who is familiar with the vagaries of international travel. The only thing blocking Assange's departure, Leopold told us, were the Russians. ""If the Russian authorities decide that's what they want to do, that's their sovereign territory and they can do it."" Last week, Russian president Vladimir Putin said, ""He came as a transit passenger, he does not need a visa or any other documents. He has the right to buy a ticket and fly wherever he wants."" And on Tuesday, the country suggested it was more than willing to let him leave, particularly if he didn't stop damaging American interests.

RELATED: Snowden Went to Booz Allen to Steal Files, but Didn't He Already Have Some?

Assuming that the CIA isn't waiting outside the terminal doors dressed as baggage attendants, Snowden's path seems clear. There's no violation of international law, Leopold pointed out, nor do Russia and the U.S. have an active extradition treaty. Snowden is probably free to go.

RELATED: Why Hasn't Anyone Else in D.C. Revealed Details on the Breadth of NSA Spying?

Story continues

Step two: Get on a plane.

We're assuming that, if he wants to go, Snowden will avail himself of air travel rather than a lengthy cruise or, say, a cab. In that case, he has two options: commercial or private flights.

RELATED: Germany and France Demand to Know Why They Were Being Spied On

The former, a flight on a commercial aircraft, is probably a non-starter. First of all, it's unlikely that a carrier, regardless of national origin, would be enthusiastic about risking the ire of the United States government by transporting Snowden around the world. Second, Leopold notes that airlines are responsible for ensuring that their passengers have valid travel documents allowing them into their destination country. After having had his U.S. passport revoked, Snowden doesn't have any such valid document. (One issued by Ecuador last week has since been revoked.)

The rule around travel documents is flexible, in a sense. ""At this level and with this kind of attention and the interest of both sides, this is a very delicate diplomatic dance,"" Leopold notes. ""The law says one thing, and the law is there — but you can't look at the law in the abstract."" Any sovereign nation that wants to could welcome Snowden with or without a travel document. But that flexibility likely doesn't extend to commercial flights. (Try going to your local US Airways counter and telling them that China is cool with your showing up without a visa. Let us know in the comments how that goes.)

Which brings us to private aircraft. When Snowden was still in Hong Kong, a WikiLeaks supporter apparently had a plane on standby at that city's airport. There's nothing preventing a private aircraft from landing at Sheremetyevo International Airport, picking up Snowden, and taking off, travel documents or no.

Step three: Fly to another country.

Last night seems to have demonstrated that flying from country to country is not as easy you might think. The private flight of President Evo Morales of Bolivia was apparently barred from flying over some European countries under the (also apparently) mistaken belief that he had Snowden on board. If Snowden boarded a private aircraft and left Moscow — and if the United States or its allies found out about it — it's nearly certain that many countries would similarly bar the flight from entering its airspace.

Which brings us to the key question: Where could Snowden go, without passing through another country's airspace?

First, we need to know how far the plane can fly. If it can't pass through any other countries' air spaces, it also can't land in those countries to refuel. Adam Twidell, founder and CEO of UK-based private charter service PrivateFly, explained to us by email how far these aircraft can go.

""A direct flight on an aircraft is also subject to the head and tailwinds involved for the routing, that would shorten the possible range,"" he noted. But: ""The longest range private jet currently on the market is the Gulfstream G550, with a direct range of 6750 nautical miles."" Other more common aircraft have shorter ranges. The Boeing Business Jet can go 6,141 nautical miles, for example.

Twidell also pointed out that, by law, private aircraft have to land with fuel on board, in case the aircraft needs to divert from its intended destination in an emergency, somewhat shrinking the range under normal conditions. But we'll set that aside for our purposes. (He also noted that commercial aircraft, bigger and carrying more fuel, routinely fly much farther. A regular flight between Newark and Singapore in an Airbus A340 covers 8,200 nautical miles.)

Which brings us to the question of where he can go. We've updated our map showing countries to which he's applied for asylum; it appears below. Black indicates a country that has rejected an asylum claim; yellow, a pending one; green, a country that has indicated some level of support.

Based on this, we narrowed the possibilities down to four: Iceland, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Cuba. Why not China? Snowden has had better opportunities to get to China, but didn't avail himself of them.

Using Google Earth's handy distance calculation tool, we looked at the distances between Snowden's current location and the airports near the capital cities of each country in an effort to figure out how far that private plane would have to fly.

Reykjavik, Iceland: 2,210 nautical miles

In each of the ensuing maps, you'll notice that we assumed the same route: north from Moscow, past the eastern edge of Finland, but outside its territorial control, along the northern edge of Norway. Russia has a lot of coastline, but for travel west, which all of these scenarios require, it's by far the fastest way.

In the case of Iceland, the next stretch of the flight is simple. Snowden's plane could simply continue on to Reykjavik, landing safely well within the plane's operational distance.

Sucre, Bolivia: No can do

Unfortunately for Snowden, Bolivia turns out not to be an option. Completely land-locked, there's no way that his plane could make it to the country without passing through another nation. Not to mention that it's by far the longest flight of all of the options.

Caracas, Venezuela: 6,017 nautical miles

This flight is a little trickier than the one to Iceland. First of all, it's much longer. Second, it requires navigating the small Caribbean islands just off the Venezuelan coast. (That red dot furthest to the west in that image represents that avoidance.) In all, though, manageable.

If Snowden's jet is a Gulfstream G550, this is in range. But not by much. He might want to ensure that there are no storms brewing over the Atlantic before setting a departure date.

Havana, Cuba: 6,068 nautical miles

Trickier still. As with the flight to Venezuela, the flight requires navigating the sovereign territory of the islands to the east of the island, part of why this flight is longer than the one to Caracas. But the big problem is that this requires Snowden traveling awfully close to the United States — almost certainly an unwelcome idea. The president has said he wouldn't scramble jets to intercept Snowden, but if his plane is only 100 miles from Florida, the temptation might be too great.

In other words, it all hinges on Iceland. It's within (safe) range. It's easy to get to. And the country has not yet rejected his overtures about seeking asylum; in fact, they likely haven't been considered. As Johannes Tomasson of Iceland's Ministry of the Interior explained in an email to The Atlantic Wire, ""a person has to be present within or at the borders of Iceland to be able to apply for asylum in Iceland.""

So there you go, Edward. Open the terminal door, get on a private plane, hug the Scandinavian coast, land in Reykjavik, and keep your fingers crossed. It's your best option.

Hare coursing is being streamed live to Chinese gamblers by organised criminals, a senior politician has revealed. Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said rural offending can be ""incredibly profitable"" and result in ""big money"" for those involved. He said one example of this type of crime involves ""highly organised criminals"" hare coursing and streaming the events to China, where they are bet on. The practice involves dogs, usually greyhounds or lurchers, which are trained to chase and overtake a hare that has been flushed out by a line of beaters. Mr Pollard, the MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, said: ""It's incredibly profitable work, and there is big money involved with this hare coursing. For instance, I was hearing about how it's webcast live to betting syndicates in China. ""So we're not talking about some people organising an illicit activity in a barn somewhere – we're talking about highly organised criminals preying on rural communities."" Mr Pollard said he had been told gangs in rural communities knew their crimes would not be reported or, if they were, that they would not get caught. He added: ""We know that rural communities have seen the real brunt of the cut to police numbers since 2010. And we know that it takes a very long time for an emergency response – not because the police aren't working hard enough, simply because there's not enough of them and the geographies they have to cover are so big. ""It's really increased the fear around rural crime. And we know that there are criminal gangs preying on rural communities, not just in terms of county lines but also in terms of the threats to people living in rural communities."" Mr Pollard's comments come after the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales and the Countryside Alliance called on police and crime commissioners to put rural policing at the forefront of their agenda. Tim Bonner, the Countryside Alliance chief executive, said: ""The real danger is rural policing gets locked into a cycle of decline because the perception is the police are not taking it seriously. The theft of a tractor is just as relevant as someone's factory being trashed in a town. These are often serious, organised criminals and they are prepared to commit violent acts."" Mr Pollard said: ""Part of the challenge I think, at the heart of it, is to look at rural life the way it actually is now, not through picture postcards or our romantic views of rural life in the past but what's it like today. There's such pride in our countryside from the people who live there – but there are problems that need addressing."""

(Mohammed Huwais/AFP/Getty Images)

Rattled lawmakers in both parties applauded President Obama’s decision to shutter two dozen U.S. diplomatic posts across the Middle East and North Africa this weekend, calling the threat of a fresh terrorist attack credible, specific and the most alarming in years.

The State Department extended the closure of 19 embassies, consulates and smaller diplomatic posts through Saturday “out of an abundance of caution,” spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a written statement Sunday. Several other posts, including embassies in Kabul and Baghdad, will reopen Monday.

Lawmakers who had received intelligence briefings joined a parade of security experts and administration officials in warning Sunday of the seriousness of the threat, which appears to emanate from a particularly dangerous and active al-Qaeda franchise in Yemen.

Neither the location nor the target of a potential attack is known, “but the intent seems clear,” Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on ABC’s “This Week”: “The intent is to attack Western, not just U.S., interests.”

The Obama administration ordered the posts closed and issued a global travel warning to Americans on Friday, after U.S. intelligence agencies picked up communications among known terrorists discussing “certain dates” and being “specific as to how enormous it was going to be,” Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) said on the same show. King serves on the House intelligence and homeland security committees.

Rep. C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger (Md.), the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said on the show that “operatives” may already be “in place” for what “high-level” al-Qaeda members are calling “a major attack.”

Sen. Saxby Chambliss (Ga.), the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, compared the intercepted “chatter” to data picked up before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

“This is the most serious threat that I’ve seen in the last several years,” Chambliss said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Pressed for details, he added: “What we have heard is some specifics on what’s intended to be done and some individuals who are making plans, such as we saw before 9/11. Whether they are going to be suicide vests that are used, or whether they’re planning on vehicle-borne bombs being carried into an area, we don’t know. But we’re hearing some kind of that same chatter that we heard pre-9/11.”

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, echoed that view, saying, “The administration’s call to close these embassies . . . was actually a very smart call.” That’s particularly true, he said, in light of what Republicans view as the administration’s failure to respond to threats last year to the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya.

“I’m glad to see that in this case they’re taking this very seriously,” McCaul said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

Security forces closed roads, erected extra blast walls and increased patrols Sunday near some of the affected embassies and consulates, according to the Associated Press. They include posts in Yemen and Egypt, which were ordered to remain closed through the coming week. In Washington, analysts at the CIA, the National Counterterrorism Center and other agencies continued to pore over signals, intercepts and other data, searching for clues.

“The intelligence community continues to look for additional information to provide better insight and more specificity with regard to the existing threat,” a senior U.S. intelligence official said.

The State Department has told Americans abroad to take extra precautions throughout the month, warning that terrorists have in the past attacked subways, railways, planes, boats “and other tourist infrastructure.” On Saturday, Interpol, the France-based international police agency, issued a global security alert, saying it suspects al-Qaeda involvement in several recent prison breaks — including in Iraq, Libya and ­Pakistan — “which led to the escape of hundreds of terrorists and other criminals.”

Interpol noted that the heightened security fears coincide with the final days of Ramadan, the Muslim holiday that Chambliss said “is always an interesting time for terrorists.” This week is also the anniversary of the simultaneous 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and in Dar es ­Salaam, Tanzania, which killed more than 200 people. And the Sept. 11 anniversary is just a few weeks away.

In addition, the head of al-Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, recently posted videos on jihadist Web sites saying that now is the time to retaliate for U.S. drone strikes in Yemen and Afghanistan, lawmakers said. The al-Qaeda franchise in Yemen, which has targeted Americans in recent years, is a likely choice to wreak such revenge. The group asserted responsibility for the failed Christmas Day 2009 attempt to blow up an airliner over Detroit.

“Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is probably the biggest threat to the homeland. They’re the al-Qaeda faction that still talks about hitting the West and hitting the homeland. . . . So we are on a high state of alert,” McCaul said, adding that the threat is “very imminent.”

But McCaul, a former federal prosecutor who handled terrorism cases in Dallas, said the good thing about the State Department’s decision to issue alerts is that “you let them know that you know . . . and they oftentimes back down.”

The warnings of a possible terrorist plot come at an opportune time for the National Security Agency, which has recently come under fire after the disclosure of surveillance programs that critics say threaten the privacy of millions of U.S. citizens. Lawmakers confirmed that the NSA was instrumental in teasing out information about the latest threat.

King, a frequent critic of the Obama administration, dismissed suggestions that the White House could be exaggerating the security threat to deflate the NSA’s critics.

“It’s absolutely crazy to say there’s any conspiracy here. . . . The government would have been totally negligent if it had not taken the actions taken,” King said.

“I’m a Republican. I’ve had problems with the administration on different issues,” he said. “But what they are doing now is what has to be done.”

Only an innocent could contemplate a world in which a brutal dictator can deploy such weapons without consequence and feel secure.

Yet only someone who has willfully dismissed the tragic lessons of the last dozen years could countenance the Obama administration unleashing its own lethal weapons against Syria absent the authority of the United Nations Security Council and without the active participation of a multi-national coalition. (And, no, France and Australia do not constitute enough.)

Only those who have forgotten how the United States and its allies wound up in a catastrophic war in Iraq could now charge toward military confrontation with Syria, absent a clear and credible annunciation of the intelligence that supposedly ties Bashar Assad's government to the chemical weapons attack, and without an agreed upon plan for how to handle the potential repercussions.

Yes, the Syria conflict of today and the Iraqi misadventure undertaken a decade ago present two different circumstances, as many experts have already emphasized. Iraq was in no way related to the incident that -- at least publicly -- provoked the American-led war, the attacks of Sept. 11 delivered by Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda partners-in-terrorism. In Syria, Assad has for years been meting out horrific brutality on those who oppose him, with visibly lethal consequences. The crime for which he now stands accused fits a pattern.

Where the case for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was manufactured from the beginning, the likelihood that Assad's government really was responsible for the chemical weapons attack in a Damascus suburb appears far more plausible.

And where the government of George W. Bush was palpably intent on waging a broad and transformational military campaign against longtime enemies in the wake of Sept. 11, President Barack Obama could not be more reluctant to take on the battle before him. He made his name as the man who opposed the Iraq war from inception. He has finally charted a course out of the companion disaster in Afghanistan.

But in one crucial regard, the rush to strike Syria is indeed reminiscent of the ill-fated march into Iraq: It would undermine the very thing it is premised on defending -- international norms and a supposed code of decency.

Put aside the bloviating about spreading freedom and democracy that accompanied the plunge into Iraq and go back to the narrative that sold the campaign -- the bogus intelligence that then-Secretary of State Colin Powell shared with the U.N. in seeking its blessing for the war: Iraq was a threat to the community of nations. Its very existence raised the prospect of mushroom clouds, as Bush's national security adviser at the time Condoleeza Rice famously intoned.

That was nonsense, a fact that needs no rehash here. Iraq's then-President Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction. Even if he had, using them against the U.S. or a regional ally would have amounted to suicide -- the sort of basic common sense understanding that had enabled Saddam to endure for decades.

And now here is Obama, declaring in a television interview with PBS, that part of the reason Americans ought to fear Syria is that ""chemical weapons that can have devastating effects could be directed at us.""

Let us generously assume that this is merely unfortunate rhetoric, the usual fear-mongering employed by a commander in chief needing to prepare a dubious public that a now-inevitable military strike is in the national interest. The realpolitik conversation has it that the strike has two aims: to make clear that American dictates are to be taken seriously -- in this case, Obama's delineation of a red line barring chemical weapons -- and to reinforce an international agreement making such means beyond the pale.

Both of these supposed aims would be ill-served by a strike on Syria absent the active assent and support of other actors around the globe, and not least the U.N.

Making a case for a strike based on the first of these two notions, David Ignatius puts it this way in a column in The Washington Post: ""What does the world look like when people begin to doubt the credibility of U.S. power? Unfortunately, we're finding that out in Syria and other nations where leaders have concluded they can defy a war-weary United States without paying a price.""

But that's an idea that urgently needs updating, a frame that retains greatest currency only in the place of its minting -- Washington.

In much of the world, governments and peoples fundamentally inclined to casting their lot with the U.S. have spent much of the past decade assaulted by realities that challenge those proclivities. And this is hardly of help to the narrow American interest or broader multinational concerns. A self-appointed global cop seen as morally reprobate, hypocritical and dismissive of the laws it is supposed to enforce does no favors to stability or security, let alone loftier aspirations like justice and progress on problems like climate change.

Begin with the ill-conceived, poorly executed post-war occupation of Iraq, and the torture of combatants there in American-run military prisons. Consider the kidnapping of suspected militants by American authorities on streets of multiple cities, and the detention of the people seized in the cells of Guantanamo, a festering sore on the American image as moral authority. Contemplate the drone strikes unleashed by a superpower on villagers stuck in places that constitute venues for a nominal global war on terror.

These are not realities that will simply be forgotten by the intended audience for the military strikes in Syria, those powers who are supposed to deduce that international norms are really operative. You can't run torture prisons one day and the next day all but unilaterally unleash missile strikes as moral curative without being seen as a less-than-honest broker among the very community of nations in whose name you act. You need a coalition, backing from the U.N. And if you don't get those things, taking action may well be worse than no action at all.

Obama must surely understand this as deeply as anyone. At home, his presidency traces its existence to American revulsion over the parochial, faith-based, fact-free reign of his predecessor. Around the world, his embrace as a moral authority -- his Nobel Peace Prize! -- reflects a deep sense of relief that the reckless cowboy who occupied the White House before had been replaced by a thoughtful, sophisticated person with international experience and respect for other cultures and values.

The standard for the legitimacy of a strike on Syria ought to be very high -- high enough to require a clear motive and objective, and a demonstrably shared plan of action among a multitude of global actors. But the U.N is missing. The Arab League is missing. Even Great Britain is now on the sidelines. It is fair to shame and pressure these powers to go along. It may be imperative. But failing to curry such support does not constitute justification for going it almost alone.

If the objective is indeed defending international norms, how can one justify a strike authorized only by the U.S. and two stalwart allies?

If this is about international law, how can one countenance rushing ahead before the U.N. inspectors complete their work and issue a report?

If this is really about justice, is there no place for due process and critical scrutiny of the intelligence before letting loose with lethal power?

And let us not kid ourselves in the face of a concerted rhetoric effort by the Obama administration to downgrade what is really unfolding. We hear of narrow limited strikes, targeted surgical procedures, and it's as if robots will reach into Syria, avoid all the people, and defang the military capabilities of the Assad regime.

But what is being prepared -- by most accounts a two-day bombardment of Syrian installations with cruise missiles fired from American destroyers -- is an act of war. It may well prove to be a justified act of war, provided it is supported by a community of nations and based on credible intelligence. But war is what this is.

War, it ought to go without saying, is a risky, unpredictable pursuit. You fire missiles at another country and people will die. If we have learned anything from the past decade, it's that military campaigns have unintended consequences. We could miss the intended targets or learn that the things we were aiming at had other uses than those we understood. We could provoke a strike on Israel from Iran. We could incite unforeseen violence from the Assad regime. And when one of those things happens and some fresh hell breaks loose, genuine moral leadership capable of speaking for international norms had best be supported by more than a couple of far-flung allies going along on a ride that has not been adequately mapped out.

For Obama, this poorly sold, as-yet ill-defined intervention into another seething conflict in the Middle East presents grave risks: He could wind up representing the sort of American power defined by his predecessor, the shoot first-contemplate later mode of operation that has served no interests beyond the Islamist militants for whom such violence functions as a valuable recruiting aid."

Yet the decision also could provide a potential opening for new arms control talks.

The Obama administration on Friday cited development problems and a lack of money in announcing the cancellation of the interceptors set to be deployed in Poland and possibly Romania early next decade.

Russian officials suspected that the interceptors were a counter to their missiles and had indicated that they would not consider further nuclear arms cuts unless their concerns were resolved.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the cancellation was part of an overall restructuring of missile defense plans aimed at stopping missiles from North Korea and Iran.

He made no reference to Russia's objections to the European plans, but said that other parts of program in Europe would move forward and that the U.S. commitment to missile defense in the region ""remains ironclad.""

The restructuring includes spending $1 billion to add the 14 new interceptors to the 26 that are in underground silos in Alaska.

The shift in U.S. missile defense plans in Europe is the second major change to the program since President Barack Obama has been in the White House. It could cause unease among some U.S. allies, including Poland and Romania, who see the system as a sign of U.S. engagement in the region and a counterweight to Russia.

Missile defense has been a contentious issue since President George W. Bush sought to base long-range interceptors in Central Europe to stop Iranian missiles from reaching the U.S. Russia believed the program was aimed at countering its own missiles and undermining its nuclear deterrent.

Obama reworked the Bush administration's plan soon after taking office in 2009. He canceled an earlier interceptor planned for Poland and radar in the Czech Republic, replacing the high-speed interceptors with slower ones that could stop Iran's medium-range missiles.

Under Obama's plan, the interceptors were to be upgraded gradually over four phases, culminating early next decade with those intended to protect both Europe and the United States.

Russia initially welcomed the changes to the Bush plan, and relations between the two powers improved. That, in turn, paved the way for the New START treaty setting new limits on both countries' nuclear arsenals.

But Moscow has ramped up its criticism of Obama's revisions, which are backed by NATO, and claims the fourth and last planned upgrade of the interceptors would be able to stop its intercontinental missiles launched at the U.S. and undermine Russia's nuclear deterrent.

Whether or not it was intended to, the decision to cancel plans for the long-range interceptors will help the president's arms control goals.

A senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities, said that Poland and Romania were informed of the decision ahead of the announcement, but that Russia was not.

""Canceling Phase 4 opens the door to another round of U.S.-Russian nuclear arms reductions,"" said Tom Collina, research director at the Arms Control Association. ""We give up nothing since Phase 4 was not panning out anyway. This is a win-win for the United States. ""

The issue is particularly sensitive because Obama was overheard whispering in an open microphone last year telling then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at an international summit that he would have more flexibility on resolving their differences over the missile defense program after his re-election in November. The comment suggested that he might change the plans in Europe.

Friday's decision was criticized by Republicans in Congress who have charged that Obama has undermined allies while pursuing his goals to drastically cut nuclear weapons.

""President Obama's reverse course decision will cost the American taxpayer more money and upset our allies,"" said GOP Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, who heads the House Armed Services subcommittee that oversees U.S. missile defense programs.

Hagel said the U.S. remains committed to all the other parts of the plan, including the first three phases. He said the decision was prompted by the need to address faster-than-anticipated progress by North Korea on nuclear weapons and missiles. The changes free up the money to do so, he said.

Hagel cited North Korea's December rocket launch that put a satellite into space and showed mastery of some of the technologies needed to produce a long-range nuclear missile.

He noted that last April, the North Koreans publicly displayed a road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile, the KN-08. Navy Adm. James Winnefeld Jr., vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that missile is believed to be capable of reaching the U.S.

The missile defense system was first fielded by the Bush administration in late 2004. It has a spotty test record and has never been used in actual combat. In addition to the 26 interceptors in Alaska, the system includes four interceptors in California.

Hagel said the 14 additional interceptors should be in place in Alaska by September 2017, but not before they have been tested adequately. The European-based interceptors would not have protected the United States from North Korea.

Hagel also noted that the canceled long-range interceptors in Europe had already faced delays because of congressional budget cuts and that there were technical challenges. A slew of recent reports by congressional and defense analysts suggested the interceptors might not work."

Hof, who last year was tasked by then Sec. of State Hillary Clinton and Obama to lead US negotiations to resolve Syria’s civil war, said Obama’s last-minute switch to seek Congressional approval for a military strike in Syria undermined US authority in the world.

“By not making it clear from the outset of the crisis that he would seek the approval of the Senate and House for a military response to the Assad regime’s chemical atrocity,” Hof wrote, “the president’s jarring change of direction now runs the risk of thoroughly undermining whatever remains of allied confidence in his leadership.”

Hof writes that, “the events of the past ten days suggest that there was no administration forethought to the possibility of a major chemical incident in Syria; there was no plan in place to respond to a major chemical attack by a regime that had already demonstrated its deep and abiding contempt for the president and his red lines.”

Hof argues that Obama’s recent actions would lead many to believe that the decision to seek Congressional approval “is less a bow to American constitutionality than a further attempt to kick the can down the road.”

Obama didn’t seek Congressional approval for the military action he authorized in Libya. That action was directed at toppling the regime of Libyan dictator Gadaffi, a more intense and much broader objective than Obama says he wants in Syria. In his remarks on Saturday, Obama even stated that he believes he has the authority to order a strike on Syria. That he didn’t, Hof argues, nor call Congress immediately back to Washington, undermines US credibility in the world.

Hof is not some outside expert observing the seen from afar. He joined the Obama Administration at the start of the President’s first term as a special advisor of the Middle East. He worked closely with Clinton and Special Envoy George Mitchell on Middle East peace negotiations. He was the lead diplomat for issues related to Syria and Lebanon.

In March, 2012, President Obama elevated him to the rank of Ambassador and gave him responsibility for handling the US response to the deteriorating situation in Syria. He abruptly resigned the position just 6 months later. News of his resignation came just two works after the murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya.

Hof’s critique of the Obama Administration is must reading for anyone trying to understand America’s increasingly feckless response to the events unfolding in Syria. Almost a year ago, President Obama told reporters that Syria’s use of chemical weapons was a “red line” that, if crossed would generate a US military response. It seems inconceivable that no contingency plans were draw up for just such an event. Yet, as Hof argues, that seems to be the case.

Congress doesn’t return to Washington until next week. Even if strong support builds for military intervention, it will likely be several days before Congress approves action. This gives the Assad regime at least two weeks to prepare for any possible US attack. The regime is no doubt, even today, moving its chemical weapons arsenal to unknown locations. The limited engagement Obama claims he wants may be completely ineffective.

As Hof laments, “there will be no ‘do-overs.'”"

A Native Of Rhode Island', 'Irrepressible Red Sox Fan', 'Williams Speaks Russian']",Snowden getting the traitor treatment by U.S. friends and foes,"Whether he is a traitor or not, fugitive Edward Snowden is being treated like one.

None of the 21 countries to which he has appealed for asylum had gotten back to him with an unequivocally positive answer by Tuesday, when speculation about his future had become so overheated that European countries were denying air space entry to planes they feared might be carrying the 30-year-old leaker of U.S. government secrets.

Some states to which Snowden turned for help, like India, Poland and Germany, have said “no” outright. Austria, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Switzerland all require asylum bids to be made in person on national territory – a technical barrier that spares them having to make a decision. Even Ecuador and Venezuela, where officials earlier suggested Snowden should be treated as a human rights hero, have been pulling back the welcome mat as they ponder the potential costs of crossing U.S. national interests.

Snowden’s disclosures about surveillance excesses by the National Security Agency that used to employ him as a contractor have embarrassed the Obama administration and given countries like Russia, China, Venezuela and others with whom Washington has sensitive relations grounds for casting the U.S. government as a hypocritical privacy violator.

But the chance to take political potshots at the White House doesn’t equate to taking in someone who has absconded with troves of national intelligence files and sparked scandals from Hong Kong to Brussels with leaks about U.S. spying on millions of individuals’ personal phone, email and Internet records. What Snowden has done would constitute treason in most, if not all, of the countries to which he is turning, giving officials pause to consider the signal that granting asylum would send to their own peoples.

Snowden applied for asylum in Iceland and Ecuador before arriving in Moscow. In a Tuesday post on its website, WikiLeaks listed 19 more countries to which its legal advisor accompanying Snowden on his globe-trotting odyssey had dispatched asylum applications through a Russian consular officer based at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport. WikiLeaks chaperone Sarah Harrison has been holed up with Snowden for 11 days in the transit area of the cavernous airport, in a diplomatic no man’s land between the arrival gates and the passport control booths.

Snowden arrived on June 23 with a U.S. passport that had been revoked by Washington, leaving him unable to officially cross the airport border into Russian territory.

The choice of Moscow as way station has been a propaganda gift for the Kremlin. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been able to portray Snowden’s disclosures of U.S. surveillance excesses as evidence of a double standard practiced by the United States. Russian officials chafe under U.S. accusations that they violate the human rights of Russian citizens with crackdowns on protests and opposition politicians. Now Putin can point to U.S. snooping against civilians at home and abroad to show that Washington doesn’t practice what it preaches.

Putin has also scored points in the diplomatic tango by posing as a defender of U.S. national security. He said Monday that Snowden would be welcome to stay in Russia, but only if he refrained from leaking more classified information “aimed at inflicting damage to our American partners.”

Putin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said Tuesday that Snowden had withdrawn his request for asylum in Russia, apparently unwilling to respect the Russian leader’s condition that he muzzle himself. That allows Putin to turn a cold shoulder to someone he probably regards as a traitor, while refusing to turn over the fugitive who many rights crusaders consider to have done the world a service by exposing the extent of U.S. surveillance.

Snowden’s best bets for finding refuge from among the remaining countries seemed to narrow to a handful of Latin American states where leftist leaders have gained power by challenging U.S. influence in the region.

Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Ecuador have yet to formally answer Snowden’s asylum appeals. But the countries’ delayed responses have whipped up so much speculation that France and Portugal on Tuesday refused to let a plane carrying Bolivian President Evo Morales cross into their airspace, forcing it to land in Vienna.

Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca told reporters in La Paz that Snowden wasn’t on the plane and denounced Paris and Lisbon for “this injustice.”

Morales, who had been in Moscow for a summit of gas exporters, had told Russia Today network earlier Tuesday that Snowden’s asylum petition would be given consideration.

Neither Cuba nor Nicaragua offered any immediate response to Snowden’s petitions. But both states have seen their long-strained relations with Washington warm slightly in recent years, and are considered unlikely to sacrifice that improvement just to add to the Obama administration’s embarrassment over the Snowden affair.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was also in Moscow for the gas summit and gave conflicting signals on whether Snowden would be welcome in the Bolivarian republic whose prickly relations with Washington defined the 14-year leadership of President Hugo Chavez, who died this year.

Maduro said his government hadn’t received the application yet from Snowden and sidestepped questions about how it would respond once the paperwork made its way to Caracas.

“He did not kill anyone and did not plant a bomb,” Maduro told reporters covering his meeting with Putin. He described Snowden as deserving of international protection, but he brushed off reporters’ questions about whether he would be willing to take Snowden back with him to Caracas after a Wednesday trip to neighboring Belarus.

“What I’m thinking about bringing back are a lot of agreements that we’re going to sign with Russia,” Maduro said in comments carried by Venezuelan state television. “That’s what we’re going to be taking back to Venezuela.”

They were the latest casualties in a 12-year conflict that shows no signs of slowing down despite a drawdown in foreign forces.

The U.S.-led international military coalition says four of its service members were killed in the south, and a military official confirmed all were Americans killed by an ""improvised explosive device.""

Their deaths bring the toll among foreign forces to 132 this year, of which 102 are from the United States. At least 2,146 members of the U.S. military have died in Afghanistan as a result of the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001, according to an Associated Press count. They are part of a total of nearly 3,390 coalition forces that have died during the conflict.

They were killed on the eve of the 12th anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2001 invasion, which led to an insurgency that shows no signs of abatement and a war that has become largely forgotten in the United States and among its coalition allies despite continued casualties suffered by their forces on the ground.

Javed Faisal, a spokesman for the governor of Kandahar, confirmed the four Americans were killed in the province by an IED. He had no further details.

NATO said in a statement that the four were killed during an operation in the south alongside Afghan troops, but did not provide any further details or their nationalities. The NATO official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.

IEDs, which include remotely detonated roadside bombs and improvised landmines, are one of the top killers of Afghan and foreign soldiers as well as civilians.

The attack came as Afghan security forces take over the brunt of the fighting after the coalition handed over security responsibilities for the country earlier this summer. This year, an average of least 100 Afghan soldiers and police have died each week, while foreign forces have stepped back from direct fighting and moved into a train and assist role.

The insurgency has tried to take advantage of the withdrawal of foreign forces to regain territory around the country, especially in their eastern and southern strongholds.

The anniversary also coincides with the registration of candidates for next April's presidential elections, the first independent vote organized by Afghanistan without direct foreign assistance. By Sunday, the deadline for registration, at least a dozen people had submitted their candidacies for the top office.

The 2001 invasion targeted al-Qaida and its Taliban allies shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, which claimed nearly 3,000 lives.

Victory in Afghanistan seemed to come quickly. Kabul fell within weeks, and the hard-line Taliban regime was toppled with few U.S. casualties.

But former President George W. Bush's shift toward war with Iraq left the Western powers with reduced resources on the ground and allowed the Taliban to regroup. By 2006, the Taliban had turned into a serious military threat and President Barack Obama deployed more troops to Afghanistan, and casualties increased sharply.

But the American public grew weary of having its military in a perpetual state of conflict, especially after the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. That war, which began with a U.S.-led invasion in 2003 to oust Saddam Hussein, cost the lives of nearly 4,500 U.S. troops, more than twice as many as have died in Afghanistan so far.

Obama first withdrew the 30,000 U.S. troops he sent to Afghanistan as part of a surge and has begun drawing down the rest, with all foreign combat forces to leave the country by the end of 2014. There are currently less than 100,000 coalition troops in Afghanistan, with about half from the United States. That number is expected to be halved by February, with U.S. numbers going down to about 31,000."

Pollak'],Benghazi 9/11–What Difference It Made,"As Americans pause today to remember the trauma–and heroism–of September 11, 2001, we have a new reason to commemorate the day: the embassy attacks of September 11, 2012. A year later, there have been no arrests and no responses. Those responsible for neglecting embassy security have been restored, while those who raised concerns are still suffering. And the leaders most responsible pretend nothing happened.

The story of how President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have escaped accountability for what happened in Benghazi, Libya and in Cairo, Egypt a year ago today is one of the great political escapes, and one of the great media scandals, of our history. “What difference does it make?” Clinton railed in January. The difference is profound indeed, both for the dead and the nation as a whole.

The political consequences were decisive. What should have happened is that the media should have asked what President Obama was doing that evening, why he was not in touch with his top national security advisers throughout the evening, why he flew to Las Vegas for a fundraiser the next day, why the Secretary denied security to Benghazi, and why her officials were apologetic as crowds stormed the Cairo embassy.

Instead, the media pounced on Mitt Romney’s response late that night, which addressed the Cairo debacle and was issued before the nation knew about the Benghazi deaths. This was to be the latest of Romney’s alleged “gaffes”–none of which were incorrect, and all of which pale in comparison to the incompetence on display a year later in Obama’s response to Syria’s crossing of the chemical weapons “red line.”

Obama and Clinton concocted one of the most audacious lies ever told by an American leader–that the attacks were a reaction to an obscure anti-Islamic video made by a Christian in the U.S. Essentially, he offered fellow Americans to the enemy as scapegoats. When the story unraveled, Obama pretended to have said all along that Benghazi had been a terror attack–another lie, eagerly defended by the media.

Meanwhile, the filmmaker responsible for the video was jailed on an unrelated parole violation–a craven concession to the Muslim Brotherhood–while the terrorists themselves lounged in Libya, secure in the knowledge that Obama was in no rush to pursue them or to deal with the mess that U.S. intervention had left behind.

The collapse of the U.S. deterrent in Syria today began with Egypt and Libya a year ago.

That, ultimately, is the most important difference that Benghazi made. It showed that America is willing to abandon its own citizens to the barbaric, unabashed violence of our enemies. The culpability goes beyond Obama and extends to the Beltway media and political classes–including those Republicans who resist a full inquiry into the events of September 11, 2012, which ignored the warnings and lessons of the first 9/11.

The consequence is that Americans are less safe–as are people around the world who face the violence of tyrants and terrorists alike. Those who, like President Obama, exhort Americans not to turn away from the children of Syria (despite ignoring children killed there by conventional weapons for over two years) should consider what their own indifference to American lives has contributed to our nation’s new impotence."

On Friday, the Guardian published a secret presidential directive calling on national security and intelligence officials to create a list of potential foreign targets for U.S. cyber attacks. The 18-page document, known as Presidential Policy Directive 20, aims ""to put in place tools and a framework to enable government to make decisions"" on cyber actions, a senior administration official told the Guardian.

The directive states that cyber attacks can be launched as part of ""anticipatory action taken against imminent threats,"" but should comply with U.S. and international law and receive approval from the president if they are ""reasonably likely to result in significant consequences,"" according to the Guardian.

The memo is the latest sign that the Obama administration is laying the groundwork to retaliate in a potential cyber conflict. Earlier this year, Gen. Keith Alexander, who runs the Pentagon's Cyber Command, told Congress he is establishing ""an offensive team"" of 13 teams of experts to carry out cyberattacks against foreign countries that target the United States with destructive computer code.

President Barack Obama has directed the United States, along with Israel, to launch a series of cyber attacks known as Stuxnet that damaged Iran's nuclear program, according to The New York Times.

Last year, the Washington Post reported on Plan X, a Pentagon effort to develop new technologies to launch cyber attacks, including a plan to map the entirety of cyberspace and build a system that can launch cyberweapons without human operators typing in the code.

But while the U.S. takes steps to build its offensive cyber muscle, its digital defenses remain weak, officials say. Last month, the deputy inspector for the Department of Homeland Security told a Congressional committee that the nation's critical infrastructure ""are increasingly under attack by a variety of malicious sources,"" and that a majority of the companies in the energy sector had experienced cyber attacks."

She Joined The Paper In']",Kerry warns Russia against selling high-performance missiles to Syria,"Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Thursday cautioned Russia against selling advanced ­surface-to-air missiles to Syrian government forces, as U.S. officials warned that the delivery of the arms would threaten Israel and undercut efforts to reach a political agreement.

“We’ve made it crystal clear that we prefer that Russia would not supply them assistance,” Kerry said during a news conference with Italy’s new top diplomat. “That is on record. That has not changed.”

Kerry declined to directly denounce the reported agreement between Russia and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but his warning to Moscow was unmistakable.

The United States has long said that the proliferation of surface-to-air missiles “is potentially destabilizing with respect to the state of Israel,” Kerry said. “We have made it very clear historically that that is a concern of the United States.”

Russia has long supplied Assad’s forces, but the potential sale of antiaircraft weapons reported Thursday by the Wall Street Journal threatens to undermine the agreement that Kerry won in Moscow this week to press jointly for peace talks between Assad and his U.S.-backed opponents.

Moscow has previously sparred with Western governments over sales of helicopter and tank parts to the embattled Assad regime. But the S-300 missiles, if delivered, would represent a huge leap in Syria’s ability to defend against Israeli airstrikes and any effort to impose a no-fly zone in support of anti-Assad rebels.

The S-300 system, considered one of the most potent air-defense systems in use, can track as many as 100 incoming aircraft or missiles at once, and engage up to a dozen, at long range.

“It would be a game-changer,” a senior Western diplomat said of the reported decision to offer the missiles to Assad. The diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because details of the reported offer remain classified, speculated that Moscow could be seeking leverage ahead of talks on a possible political settlement to the Syrian crisis.

Russia was heavily criticized in 2007 when it signed a deal to sell S-300 batteries to Iran for $800 million. Russian officials eventually terminated the contract, citing new U.N. resolutions banning the export of advanced missile systems to Tehran.

“After discussions with us, they did decide not to provide the missiles to the Iranians,” recalled Dennis Ross, who was a senior Middle East adviser to the Obama administration in 2010, when Russia halted the missile sale to Iran. “If they proceed now, it hardly signals that they are prepared to walk away from Assad.”

Kerry has declined to draw a comparison between the military aid provided by Moscow to the Syrian government and what has, until now, been the U.S. choice to send only humanitarian and nonmilitary assistance to the rebel forces. President Obama is considering whether to reverse that decision and provide arms to the rebels, as some Arab states are doing.

Kerry met earlier Thursday with the foreign minister of Jordan, which is staggering under the weight of more than 500,000 Syrian refugees. Kerry said that about $43 million of a new $100 million U.S. aid package pledged for Syrian refugees will go to Jordan.

“Jordan feels the impact of what is happening more than any other country,” he said.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh said the refugees account for 10 percent of Jordan’s population, and the figure is expected to at least double this year.

Judeh was headed next to Moscow to discuss a potential Syrian transitional government.

“It has to be a transitional period that results in a political solution that includes all the segments of Syrian society, no exclusion whatsoever,” Judeh said, while preserving “Syria’s territorial integrity and unity.”

Jordan is expected to play a key role in marshaling Arab support for Middle East talks. Jordan was the second Arab state to make peace with Israel, after Egypt.

“There have been many failed attempts, false starts, and there were attempts that resulted in limited success, perhaps, and we should build on all that,” Judeh said in Rome, where he and Kerry arranged their second meeting in as many weeks. Kerry met Wednesday with Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, who is her government’s chief peace negotiator.

“This is why it’s important to look at the history and share our thoughts and our ideas and our approaches with each other, so that we can try and bring the parties back to the negotiating table, perhaps in a different way and more effective way this time,” Judeh said.

The Obama administration has set no deadline for Kerry’s effort to draw Israel and the Palestinians to the table and has revealed few details of what he is urging each side to consider once talks begin.

Kerry has said that he wants to move quickly. Events in the tumultuous Middle East, or spoilers on either side, have doomed past negotiations.

“Each day that goes by in the Middle East always brings the ability for someone, somehow, to create events that always threaten the ability of the process to continue smoothly,” Kerry said.

Israel’s detention of an important Muslim leader Wednesday for questioning sparked anger among Palestinians, who accused Israel of human rights violations.

Judeh called on both sides to avoid provocations.

http://news.yahoo.com/nsa-revelations-stir-congressional-concern-200706066.html,,[],New NSA revelations stir congressional concern,"WASHINGTON (AP) — New revelations from leaker Edward Snowden that the National Security Agency has overstepped its authority thousands of times since 2008 are stirring renewed calls on Capitol Hill for serious changes to NSA spy programs, undermining White House hopes that President Barack Obama had quieted the controversy with his assurances of oversight.

An internal audit provided by Snowden to The Washington Post shows the agency has repeatedly broken privacy rules or exceeded its legal authority every year since Congress granted it broad new powers in 2008.

In one of the documents, agency personnel are instructed to remove details and substitute more generic language in reports to the Justice Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence — reports used as the basis for informing Congress.

Obama has repeatedly said that Congress was thoroughly briefed on the programs revealed by Snowden in June, but some senior lawmakers said they had been unaware of the NSA audit until they read the news on Friday. The programs described earlier vacuum up vast amounts of metadata — such as telephone numbers called and called from, the time and duration of calls — from most Americans' phone records, and scoop up global Internet usage data.

White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest said Friday that the NSA documents showed that NSA's Compliance Office established in 2009 ""is monitoring, detecting, addressing and reporting compliance incidents,"" and that ""the majority of the compliance incidents are unintentional."" In a statement from the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, where the president is vacationing, he added that the administration is ""keeping the Congress appropriately informed of compliance issues as they arise.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy announced he would hold hearings into the new disclosures.

""I remain concerned that we are still not getting straightforward answers from the NSA,"" the Vermont Democrat said in a statement.

Story continues

Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein said her committee had been notified of compliance problems — not by seeing the internal audit but through legally required reports to her committee.

""In all such cases, the incidents have been addressed by ending or adapting the activity,"" the California Democrat said in a statement."" She added, ""The committee has never identified an instance in which the NSA has intentionally abused its authority to conduct surveillance for inappropriate purposes.""

But she said that committee would be asking for additional reports in future, and members would start making routine trips to the NSA to oversee its activities.

Her Republican House counterpart, Intelligence chairman Mike Rogers, said human error was inevitable and ""there was no intentional and willful violation of the law.""

But the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, called the new disclosures ""incredibly troubling."" He said he had instructed his staff ""to thoroughly review and evaluate these allegations.""

Another Democratic member of the Intelligence Committee, Rep. Mike Thompson of California, said: ""Reports that the NSA repeatedly overstepped its legal boundaries, broke privacy regulations and attempted to shield required disclosure of violations are outrageous, inappropriate and must be addressed.""

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who generally supports the programs, said in a statement Friday that the new revelations ""are extremely disturbing.""

And two senators who have consistently raised red flags about possible privacy violations stemming from NSA programs indicated there is more to be revealed.

""We believe Americans should know that this confirmation is just the tip of a larger iceberg,"" said Democratic Sens. Mark Udall of Colorado and Ron Wyden of Oregon in a statement. Both declined to provide details, citing Senate rules about discussing classified information.

Proposed legislation to dismantle the programs was narrowly defeated last month in the House. The July legislative effort brought together Libertarian-leaning conservatives and liberal Democrats who pressed for change against congressional leaders and lawmakers focused on security.

A week ago, Obama sought to soothe concerns by promising to consider reforms to NSA surveillance.

""It's not enough for me to have confidence in these programs,"" he said at a White House news conference. ""The American people have to have confidence in them as well.""

He announced changes such as convening an outside advisory panel to review U.S. surveillance powers, although it is unclear how that would differ from the existing U.S. Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, mandated by Congress to monitor surveillance and constitutional concerns. Obama also said the NSA would hire a privacy officer — though the NSA already has a compliance office. None of those measures would seem likely to stop the kind of inadvertent collection of information that was described in the NSA audit.

Most of the infractions revealed late Thursday involve unauthorized surveillance of Americans or foreign intelligence targets in the United States, both of which are restricted by law and executive order, according to the May 3, 2012 audit, and other top-secret documents.

The May audit counted 2,776 incidents in the preceding 12 months of unauthorized collection, storage, access to or distribution of legally protected communications. Most were reported to be unintended, and many involved failures to take sufficient care or violations of standard operating procedure. They ranged from significant violations of law to typographical errors that resulted in unintended interceptions of U.S. emails and telephone calls.

The most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 Americans and green-card holders.

In the typographical error category, the Post cited a 2008 example of the collection of a ""large number"" of phone records from Washington, D.C., when a programming error confused the District of Columbia area code 202 for 20-2, the international dialing code for Cairo, according to a quality assurance review that was not distributed to the NSA's oversight staff.

The NSA also saw a spike in the number of ""roamers,"" or overseas, phone calls wrongly tracked in the first quarter of 2012, when those roamers traveled into U.S. territory, which is outside NSA's authority. The report said the errors may have been due to tracking Chinese who were visiting friends and relatives for the Chinese lunar new year.

In another case, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which has authority over some NSA operations, did not learn about a new collection method until it had been in operation for many months. The court ruled it unconstitutional.

The FISC's chief judge told the Post that the court could rule only on the material it was given.

""The FISC is forced to rely upon the accuracy of the information that is provided to the Court,"" U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said in a written statement to the Post. ""The FISC does not have the capacity to investigate issues of noncompliance, and in that respect the FISC is in the same position as any other court when it comes to enforcing (government) compliance with its orders.""

The Associated Press made a request to Walton for that statement. A court official said the judge had no response.

The White House declined Friday to comment on the latest revelations. It directed questions to the National Security Council, and NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden directed questions to the NSA.

NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said the number of incidents in the first quarter of 2012 was higher than normal, and that the number has ranged from 372 to 1,162 in the past three years, due to factors such as ""implementation of new procedures or guidance with respect to our authorities that prompt a spike that requires 'fine tuning,' changes to the technology or software in the targeted environment for which we had no prior knowledge, unforeseen shortcomings in our systems, new or expanded access, and 'roaming' by foreign targets into the U.S., some of which NSA cannot anticipate in advance but each instance of which is reported as an incident.""

""When NSA makes a mistake in carrying out its foreign intelligence mission, the agency reports the issue internally and to federal overseers — and aggressively gets to the bottom of it,"" Vines said.

When asked why the Post did not publish the story earlier, though the paper said it had the documents for months, spokeswoman Kris Coratti emailed Friday that ""it has taken some time to study them and understand the information they contain.""

The AP filed a Freedom of Information Act request to the NSA on June 17 asking for all copies of ""minimization procedures"" the agency uses to avoid collecting Internet and telephone data from U.S. citizens. That request sought documents that would also detail how the government purges records that may have been accidentally collected. The AP has yet to receive responsive material, though the NSA agreed to fast-track its request.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama--world-must-not-be-%E2%80%98paralyzed%E2%80%99-on-syria-191900175.html,,[],Frustrated Obama: I won't be ‘paralyzed’ on Syria,"President Barack Obama vowed Friday to undertake a “limited, narrow” response to Syria’s alleged chemical weapons attack and warned he would not be “paralyzed” by his desire to rally elusive international support.

Obama’s remarks came after Secretary of State John Kerry laid out the most detailed U.S. case yet that Bashar Assad’s regime massacred more than 1,400 people last week with chemical weapons.

“We are looking at the possibility of a limited, narrow act,” the president said as he hosted Baltic leaders in the Cabinet Room of the White House.

“I have not made any decisions” about Washington’s precise response, he said, but “we’re not considering any open-ended commitment” or sending troops into Syria.

Obama said in a CNN interview last week that ordering military action without a United Nations mandate would raise questions about whether such an operation were legal.

And a growing chorus of lawmakers is saying that the president needs to get explicit congressional authorization before going to war.

The president addressed both issues and left absolutely no doubt that he does not believe he needs either body’s green light.

“We are confident that we can provide Congress all the information they can get, all the input that they need,” he said. “And we can have serious conversations with our allies and our friends around the world about this.”

“But, ultimately, we don’t want the world to be paralyzed,” he said. “A lot of people think something should be done, but nobody wants to do it.""

Russia, backed by China, has blocked every U.S attempt to get the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution that might set the stage for intervention in Syria.

The president acknowledged that he and other Americans are “war-weary” and diagnosed “a certain suspicion of any military action post-Iraq.”

But “it’s important for us to recognize that when over a thousand people are killed, including hundreds of innocent children, through the use of a weapon that 98 or 99 percent of humanity says should not be used even in war, and there is no action, then we’re sending a signal,” he said. “That is a danger to our national security.”

And, Obama said, “The American people understandably want us to be focused on the business of rebuilding our economy here and putting people back to work — and I assure you nobody ends up being more war-weary than me.”

But he stressed that “this kind of attack threatens our national security interests by violating well-established international norms against the use of chemical weapons by further threatening friends and allies of ours in the region, like Israel and Turkey and Jordan, and it increases the risk that chemical weapons will be used in the future and fall into the hands of terrorists who might use them against us.”"

Rand Paul (R-Ky.), one of the few public officials sympathetic toward Edward Snowden, warned the national security leaker on Sunday not to cut deals or cozy up to any government at the risk of losing credibility.

""I do think, for Mr. Snowden, if he cozies up to the Russian government, it will be nothing but bad for his name in history,"" said Paul on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""If he goes to an independent third country like Iceland and if he refuses to talk to any sort of formal government about this, I think there's a chance that he'll be seen as an advocate of privacy. If he cozies up to either the Russian government, the Chinese government, or any of these governments that are perceived still as enemies of ours, I think that will be a real problem for him in history.""

Paul's comments came in the midst of a hectic Sunday morning in which Snowden left Hong Kong despite requests from the U.S. Justice Department that that government turn him over for prosecution. Snowden is being charged under the Espionage Act for leaking details of U.S. intelligence operations to various news outlets, mainly the Guardian.

Hong Kong officials declined to do so, saying that the extradition request did not fully comply with its law. By the time Paul spoke to CNN, Snowden was reportedly on a plane that had just landed in Moscow. CNN was carrying a live stream of the passenger arrival area in the Moscow airport.

Paul has been one of a few public officials to praise Snowden for leaking material on the National Security Agency's surveillance operations. And despite warning Snowden not to work with the Russian or Chinese governments, Paul continued on Sunday to argue that history would judge the leaks kindly.

""I would say that Mr. Snowden hasn't lied to anyone,"" said Paul. ""He did break his oath of office, but part of his oath of office is to the Constitution, and he believes that, when James Clapper came in March, our national director of intelligence came and lied, that he [Snowden] was simply coming forward and telling the truth that your government was lying. This is a big concern of mine, because it makes me doubt the administration and their word to us when they talk to us, because they have now admitted they will lie to us if they think it is in the name of national security."""

None of the 21 countries to which he has appealed for asylum had gotten back to him with an unequivocally positive answer by Tuesday, when speculation about his future had become so overheated that European countries were denying air space entry to planes they feared might be carrying the 30-year-old leaker of U.S. government secrets.

Some states to which Snowden turned for help, like India, Poland and Germany, have said “no” outright. Austria, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Switzerland all require asylum bids to be made in person on national territory – a technical barrier that spares them having to make a decision. Even Ecuador and Venezuela, where officials earlier suggested Snowden should be treated as a human rights hero, have been pulling back the welcome mat as they ponder the potential costs of crossing U.S. national interests.

Snowden’s disclosures about surveillance excesses by the National Security Agency that used to employ him as a contractor have embarrassed the Obama administration and given countries like Russia, China, Venezuela and others with whom Washington has sensitive relations grounds for casting the U.S. government as a hypocritical privacy violator.

But the chance to take political potshots at the White House doesn’t equate to taking in someone who has absconded with troves of national intelligence files and sparked scandals from Hong Kong to Brussels with leaks about U.S. spying on millions of individuals’ personal phone, email and Internet records. What Snowden has done would constitute treason in most, if not all, of the countries to which he is turning, giving officials pause to consider the signal that granting asylum would send to their own peoples.

Snowden applied for asylum in Iceland and Ecuador before arriving in Moscow. In a Tuesday post on its website, WikiLeaks listed 19 more countries to which its legal advisor accompanying Snowden on his globe-trotting odyssey had dispatched asylum applications through a Russian consular officer based at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport. WikiLeaks chaperone Sarah Harrison has been holed up with Snowden for 11 days in the transit area of the cavernous airport, in a diplomatic no man’s land between the arrival gates and the passport control booths.

Snowden arrived on June 23 with a U.S. passport that had been revoked by Washington, leaving him unable to officially cross the airport border into Russian territory.

The choice of Moscow as way station has been a propaganda gift for the Kremlin. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been able to portray Snowden’s disclosures of U.S. surveillance excesses as evidence of a double standard practiced by the United States. Russian officials chafe under U.S. accusations that they violate the human rights of Russian citizens with crackdowns on protests and opposition politicians. Now Putin can point to U.S. snooping against civilians at home and abroad to show that Washington doesn’t practice what it preaches.

Putin has also scored points in the diplomatic tango by posing as a defender of U.S. national security. He said Monday that Snowden would be welcome to stay in Russia, but only if he refrained from leaking more classified information “aimed at inflicting damage to our American partners.”

Putin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said Tuesday that Snowden had withdrawn his request for asylum in Russia, apparently unwilling to respect the Russian leader’s condition that he muzzle himself. That allows Putin to turn a cold shoulder to someone he probably regards as a traitor, while refusing to turn over the fugitive who many rights crusaders consider to have done the world a service by exposing the extent of U.S. surveillance.

Snowden’s best bets for finding refuge from among the remaining countries seemed to narrow to a handful of Latin American states where leftist leaders have gained power by challenging U.S. influence in the region.

Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Ecuador have yet to formally answer Snowden’s asylum appeals. But the countries’ delayed responses have whipped up so much speculation that France and Portugal on Tuesday refused to let a plane carrying Bolivian President Evo Morales cross into their airspace, forcing it to land in Vienna.

Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca told reporters in La Paz that Snowden wasn’t on the plane and denounced Paris and Lisbon for “this injustice.”

Morales, who had been in Moscow for a summit of gas exporters, had told Russia Today network earlier Tuesday that Snowden’s asylum petition would be given consideration.

Neither Cuba nor Nicaragua offered any immediate response to Snowden’s petitions. But both states have seen their long-strained relations with Washington warm slightly in recent years, and are considered unlikely to sacrifice that improvement just to add to the Obama administration’s embarrassment over the Snowden affair.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was also in Moscow for the gas summit and gave conflicting signals on whether Snowden would be welcome in the Bolivarian republic whose prickly relations with Washington defined the 14-year leadership of President Hugo Chavez, who died this year.

Maduro said his government hadn’t received the application yet from Snowden and sidestepped questions about how it would respond once the paperwork made its way to Caracas.

“He did not kill anyone and did not plant a bomb,” Maduro told reporters covering his meeting with Putin. He described Snowden as deserving of international protection, but he brushed off reporters’ questions about whether he would be willing to take Snowden back with him to Caracas after a Wednesday trip to neighboring Belarus.

“What I’m thinking about bringing back are a lot of agreements that we’re going to sign with Russia,” Maduro said in comments carried by Venezuelan state television. “That’s what we’re going to be taking back to Venezuela.”

Snowden, whose U.S. passport was revoked after he began his globe-trotting flight from justice for leaking national security secrets, lamented in a statement posted on the WikiLeaks website that President Obama was obstructing his right to seek asylum by threatening countries willing to grant it.

Snowden has been holed up in a transit area of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport for more than a week and the strain of being trapped in a judicial standoff of his own making was palpable in his accusatory statement.

“One week ago I left Hong Kong after it became clear that my freedom and safety were under threat for revealing the truth,” the former National Security Agency contractor began.

After thanking friends, family and anonymous supporters for helping him retain his “liberty,” he accused Obama of diplomatic strong-arming countries “from which I have requested protection to deny my asylum petitions.

“This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, and neither is the extra-legal penalty of exile,” Snowden wrote. “These are the old, bad tools of political aggression. Their purpose is to frighten, not me, but those who would come after me.”

Snowden remains a U.S. citizen and administration officials have said his return to the United States would be facilitated if he decides to face the espionage charges brought against him.

“The Obama administration has now adopted the strategy of using citizenship as a weapon,” Snowden lamented. “Although I am convicted of nothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person.”

He was issued special travel documents by Ecuadorean diplomats in Moscow last week. However, officials in Ecuador’s capital, Quito, canceled them, saying they were provided without proper authorization.

Ecuadorean officials initially hinted they would give refuge to the 30-year-old American. But the South American country could face serious economic consequences for rejecting any U.S. extradition request as $400 million in trade -- and 40,000 related jobs -- could be lost if Washington refuses to renew a trade pact with Quito that expired Sunday.

The unspoken threat may be behind the foot-dragging and retreat by Ecuador in the Snowden affair, even as the South American government publicly declared it would pull out of the trade deal of its own accord rather than face U.S. “blackmail.” Ecuadorean officials said late last week that any grant of political asylum would take months to decide and would have to take into consideration any negative consequences in its relations with Washington.

Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier Monday said Snowden could stay in Russia but only if he agreed to cease disclosing classified information that was “aimed at damaging our American partners.”

Other Russian officials disclosed to local news media that Snowden had submitted a request for asylum in Russia and 14 other countries, although they did not specify which other states he had approached.

That’s what President Obama thinks the criticism of his zigzag Syria policy amounts to?

As presidential spin, this is insulting. As presidential conviction — if this is what he really believes — it’s scary.

Obama’s dismissive remarks came in response to a question from ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, who asked the president about criticisms of his approach as ad hoc, improvised and unsteady.

“Folks here in Washington like to grade on style,” Obama sniffed. “And so had we rolled out something that was very smooth and disciplined and linear, they would have graded it well, even if it was a disastrous policy. We know that, ’cause that’s exactly how they graded the Iraq war until it ended up blowing [up] in our face.”

Indeed, Obama portrayed capital insiders’ scorn as a badge of honor. “What it says is that I’m less concerned about style points; I’m much more concerned about getting the policy right,” he continued, taking credit for Syria having acknowledged its possession of chemical weapons and agreeing to put them under international control. “That’s my goal,” he said. “And if that goal is achieved, then it sounds to me like we did something right.”

See? All’s well that ends well. Let the judges carp about whether the administration stuck the landing.

Except that this self-serving account omits two important facts. First, we’re a long way from knowing that this episode has ended well. No one can rely on Russian promises and Syrian good will. This may well be a bullet only temporarily dodged, a pause in the crisis rather than a signpost of its solution. Even a successful outcome of a chemical-weapons deal risks the perverse impact of further entrenching a regime that has murdered tens of thousands of its own people.

Second, presidential actions have ripples beyond ripples. Obama may have lucked — or his secretary of state accidentally may have stumbled — into an approach that averted “The Perils of Pauline” moment. But the indecision, the mind-changing, the lurching — and, note, Obama did not dispute such characterizations so much as dismiss them — have consequences.

“Style,” as the president would have it, matters. Adversaries and allies, foreign and domestic, take a measure of the president’s steel. They judge whether he can be trusted, whether he will back down, whether he has what it takes to lead his country and the world. In the past few weeks, I have encountered not a single person outside the White House, Republican or Democrat, who has kind words for Obama’s performance. Scornful may not be too strong a word for the consensus view, though it is scorn leavened, at least among the more thoughtful critics, with appreciation for the no-good-options reality of Syria.

This attitude is especially important because it arrives at such a dangerous moment for the country, with looming deadlines on government funding and the debt ceiling, and because it is amplified by presidential mishandling of other matters.

Obama’s dawdling and eventual capitulation on Larry Summers, his reported first choice for chairman of the Federal Reserve, further reinforce the perception of the president as weak and indecisive. Given the other matters on the presidential agenda, it may not have made sense to launch a fight, this one with his supposed allies, over Summers. But once again, Obama made the situation worse by allowing it to fester for so long, and for the opposition to Summers to build.

So Obama enters yet another treacherous period in a weakened state, with his political allies distrustful and his political opponents caught up in their own dysfunction. Machiavelli advised that it is better to be feared than loved; at the moment, in Congress, Obama is neither.

The fast-approaching deadlines — the government runs out of money Oct. 1, out of borrowing authority Oct. 18 — arrive at a time when would-be responsible Republicans, chief among them House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, cannot control the lunatics in their caucus. This group is so consumed with distrust of government and hatred of Obamacare that it is willing to risk the full faith and credit of the United States.

“The anarchists have taken over,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said last week. “They’ve taken over the House; now they’re here in the Senate.”

Boehner’s angling to avoid a shutdown and instead use the debt ceiling for maximum leverage. Obama, having previously blinked, says he’s done with that: No more negotiating on the debt ceiling. Is it any wonder that there are doubters?

So, the Obama administration has now decided that Syria’s use of chemical weapons crosses a red line and, as a result, the United States will supply the opposition with small arms and ammunition. This strikes me as a risky decision – too little to have a real impact and enough to commit the United States in a complex civil war.

First, let’s be clear. This will not ease the humanitarian nightmare unfolding in Syria. The opposition forces will now have some more arms and will fight back, presumably killing more of the regime’s soldiers and supporters. Levels of violence might well rise not decline.

So what exactly is the objective of this policy shift? Is it the defeat of Bashar al-Assad? If so, can such a small shift in American support for the opposition really do that? The opposition forces are disorganized. Joshua Landis, the Syria scholar, estimates that there are 1,000 militias that make up the rebel forces. Such a decentralized opposition would need a lot more than more small weapons and ammunition to succeed.

If they did succeed, that would be a good outcome. But it will almost certainly mean that the various militias would then begin a massacre of the Alawites, the sect that the al-Assad regime comes from. It is unclear what would happen to the Christians and Kurds, who have tended to stay neutral in this conflict, but they too might feel the wrath of newly empowered Sunni militias. The Alawites, Christians, and Kurds collectively make up about a third of Syrians, so this could become an even-larger, many-cornered struggle. Remember, with 180,000 troops in Iraq, we could not stop massacres, ethnic cleansing and massive human rights violations. We are now planning to achieve lofty ends with almost no means.

The most likely scenario is that this small step up in American assistance will not make much difference. At that point, pressure will build on the Obama administration. Sen. John McCain will make speeches saying that now, America’s credibility is on the line. Having supported the opposition, we have to ensure that they succeed. The administration will face a choice between seeming ineffectual or plunging deeper into a complex and bloody civil war.

It’s possible that the administration can just stand pat and do the little that it is doing. That could be a brutal but effective strategy to bleed America’s enemies. Contrary to much of the media commentary, the fact that Iran and Hezbollah are sending militias, arms, and money into Syria is not a sign of strength. It is a sign that they are worried that the Syrian regime might fall and are desperately seeking to shore it up. Keeping them engaged and pouring resources into Syria weakens them substantially. But can the United States pursue such a cold-blooded strategy of realpolitik?

Former President Bill Clinton recently said that he favored some American intervention because “Sometimes it's just best to get caught trying, as long as you don't overcommit.” That suggests that supporters of interventions see it as some kind of symbolic policy, to show that we care. But it is like trying to get a little bit pregnant. The outcome is rarely what you want."

The intercepts and a subsequent analysis of them by American intelligence agencies prompted the United States to issue an unusual global travel alert to American citizens on Friday, warning of the potential for terrorist attacks by operatives of Al Qaeda and their associates beginning Sunday through the end of August. Intelligence officials said the threat focused on the Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, which has been tied to plots to blow up American-bound cargo and commercial flights.

The bulletin to travelers and expatriates, issued by the State Department, came less than a day after the department announced that it was closing nearly two dozen American diplomatic missions in the Middle East and North Africa, including facilities in Egypt, Iraq, Yemen, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Britain said Friday that it would close its embassy in Yemen on Monday and Tuesday because of “increased security concerns.”

It is unusual for the United States to come across discussions among senior Qaeda operatives about operational planning — through informants, intercepted e-mails or eavesdropping on cellphone calls. So when the high-level intercepts were collected and analyzed this week, senior officials at the C.I.A., State Department and White House immediately seized on their significance. Members of Congress have been provided classified briefings on the matter, officials said Friday."
http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2013/02/19/how-big-is-chinas-cyber-threat/,2013-02-19 00:00:00,[],How big is China's cyber threat?,"A unit of China’s People’s Liberation Army has been tied to a location believed to be the source of “an overwhelming percentage of the attacks on American corporations, organizations and government agencies,” according to a report in the New York Times on Tuesday.

“An unusually detailed 60-page study, to be released Tuesday by Mandiant, an American computer security firm, tracks for the first time individual members of the most sophisticated of the Chinese hacking groups – known to many of its victims in the United States as ‘Comment Crew’ or ‘Shanghai Group’ – to the doorstep of the military unit’s headquarters,” the report says. “The firm was not able to place the hackers inside the 12-story building, but makes a case there is no other plausible explanation for why so many attacks come out of one comparatively small area.”

Over the past year, Global Public Square contributors have looked at a range of cyber issues, from the potential threat posed by Chinese firms to what the U.S. can do to improve its cyber defenses.

“Weak cybersecurity renders America less secure on a global strategic level,” wrote Katrina Timlin, a research assistant at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, on GPS last February. “Around seventy countries are building cyber capabilities for their military or national defense infrastructure. Among the most capable countries are Russia and China, historical competitors with America.”

“Although they are unlikely to launch a spontaneous cyber attack, it is understandable they are probing our vulnerabilities and testing the limits of cyber espionage. America’s competitors have clear incentives to seek economic and military advantage through these ‘illicit’ means, and America’s inability to properly defend its cyber infrastructure is only facilitating this nefarious behavior.”

How should the U.S. respond?

According to A. Greer Meisels and Mihoko Matsubara, the United States and its allies need to coordinate their response to these threats. “As countries pursue interoperability for the sake of military efficiency, they also face an increase in shared vulnerabilities. Washington should take advantage of its pre-existing alliance network and serve as a hub to synchronize such efforts,” the authors wrote in October. “This requires developing robust, actionable intelligence capabilities that can provide real-time information to decision-makers in the United States, to private companies, and to its allies.”

But Jennifer Stisa Granick, director of civil liberties at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society, suggested that in the push to find solutions in the U.S., it’s worth asking whether more legislation is the answer.

“Bringing federal agencies up to par won’t…require new laws. President Obama could implement much of the Cybersecurity Act via executive order,” Granick wrote in August. “Further, government may be able to raise standards for critical infrastructure networks through regulation rather than legislation. In most critical industries, electricity, nuclear power, chemical plants and water safety are already heavily regulated by the government. So why, for example, did NASDAQ get hacked in 2011? When we, or Congress, understand this, we can apply the tool that would improve the situation, whether it’s Securities and Exchange Commission regulation or new laws.”"

But Edward Joseph Snowden found his calling in America’s spy services, using his computer skills to rise from a lowly security position to life as a well-paid private contractor for the National Security Agency. At age 29, he rented a bungalow with his girlfriend north of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and claimed to earn $200,000 a year.

On Monday, hours after he admitted disclosing a trove of intelligence secrets to the media, Snowden checked out of the glitzy Mira Hotel in Hong Kong, where he had holed up for weeks, and dropped out of sight. Whether he has gone into hiding, is seeking asylum with a sympathetic government, or been taken into custody by U.S. or Chinese authorities is unclear.

U.S. intelligence officials scrambled to evaluate the damage and worried about whether Snowden would give away, among other intelligence secrets he claimed to know, the locations of every CIA base overseas and identities of its undercover officers. The FBI is investigating and has begun interviewing his family. House and Senate intelligence committees called urgent closed-door hearings for Tuesday.

Before fleeing, Snowden gave a 12-minute videotaped interview to the Guardian, the British newspaper that broke many of his scoops. In soft-spoken tones, he said he was determined to shine a light on what he called the federal government’s almost unlimited tracking of private citizens’ phone calls and Internet usage.

“I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,” he said to the camera.

Snowden started life in Elizabeth City, a river port along North Carolina’s coast. His family soon moved to a gray clapboard home in Ellicott City, a Baltimore suburb near the NSA’s vast headquarters at Ft. Meade. He told the Guardian that he struggled in high school and eventually dropped out. A neighbor, Joyce Kinsey, recalled him as a quiet boy who often was on his computer.

His parents are divorced. His father, Lonnie Snowden, was an officer in the U.S. Coast Guard, according to public records, and lives in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley, part of the old Rust Belt north of Philadelphia. His mother, Elizabeth Snowden, is chief deputy clerk in charge of administration and information technology at the U.S. District Court in Baltimore.

Two people who identified themselves as FBI agents visited the home of Snowden’s father and stepmother Monday afternoon in Upper Macungie Township near Allentown, Pa. Lonnie Snowden, 52, told ABC News that he last saw his son months ago for dinner and that they parted with a hug.

Susan Gross, a spokeswoman for Anne Arundel Community College in Arnold, Md., said an Edward Joseph Snowden took classes there intermittently from 1999, when Snowden was about 15, through fall 2005. He earned a GED, a high school equivalency credential, but did not get a college degree or certificate.

In May 2004, Snowden enlisted in the Army, hoping to join the Special Forces. He took advantage of an option that allowed recruits to try out directly for the elite force without prior service. He reported to Ft. Benning, Ga., but was discharged four months later, the Army said Monday.

Recruits designated for Special Forces normally go through eight to 10 weeks of basic training, followed by an advanced infantry training course and then Special Forces assessment and selection. Snowden told the Guardian that he left the Army after he broke both legs in a training accident.

An Army spokesman, Lt. Col. S. Justin Platt, confirmed Snowden’s service but said no records indicate he completed even basic training. Platt said he could not comment on Snowden’s claim that he broke his legs in training because it involved medical records.

The next year, Snowden got his start in intelligence by landing a job as a security specialist at the Center for the Advanced Study of Language at the University of Maryland, a spokesman confirmed. The center, run by the NSA, is “dedicated to addressing the language needs of the intelligence community,” according to a university website.

After that, Snowden said, his computer skills helped him get a job with the CIA in information technology.

In 2007, he said, the CIA posted him for two years to Geneva, Switzerland, to maintain security for the agency’s computer network. He lived in an apartment block on the banks of the Rhone River where the U.S. consulate often housed employees, according to Radio Television Suisse.

The CIA considers Geneva an important spying base because it hosts so many foreign diplomats and financial institutions.

Snowden said he began to grow disillusioned with the CIA while in Switzerland. He claimed that CIA officers deliberately got a Swiss banker drunk, and then offered to fix his drunk-driving arrest if he agreed to disclose secret financial information. He didn’t say whether the banker agreed, but the scheme is straight from a CIA playbook.

“I realized that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good,” he said.

Still, Snowden continued to move up the ranks in the intelligence community. His high-level security clearance made him easily employable in the private sector, and in 2009, he said, he left the CIA to work as a contractor at an NSA facility on a military base in Japan.

That’s when he first saw the astonishing breadth of the agency’s surveillance capabilities, he said.

Snowden became a firm proponent of civil liberties, affixing a sticker to his laptop promoting the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for Internet users’ rights.

In 2012, he made two contributions totaling $500 to the presidential campaign of Ron Paul, the libertarian Republican congressman from Texas, according to federal records. Snowden listed his employer as Dell, the Texas-based computer company. A Dell spokeswoman declined to answer questions Monday about Snowden’s employment.

Sometime that year, Snowden moved to Honolulu. Last March, he took a job with Booz Allen Hamilton, a government contractor, as an infrastructure analyst at the NSA’s huge mountaintop facility on Oahu. He rented a single-story blue bungalow in Waipahu, an upscale suburb 10 miles from the NSA facility.

Documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras, who contributed to last week’s stories in both the Guardian and the Washington Post based on documents Snowden said he provided, told Salon on Monday that she was contacted anonymously by email in January this year. She denied that she encouraged Snowden to leak national security secrets.

“Are you kidding?” she said. “I didn’t know where he worked, I didn’t know he was NSA, I didn’t know how — nothing. There was no like, ‘Oh, do you think you …', no nudging. ... There’s no connection here. We were contacted, we didn’t know what he was up to, and at some point he came forward with documents.”

http://news.yahoo.com/us-commandos-hand-over-troubled-area-afghans-085617778.html,,[],US commandos hand over troubled area to Afghans,"KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — U.S. special operations forces handed over their base in a strategic district of eastern Afghanistan to local Afghan special forces on Saturday, senior U.S. commanders said. The withdrawal satisfies a demand by Afghan President Hamid Karzai that U.S. forces leave the area after allegations that the Americans' Afghan counterparts committed human rights abuses there on U.S. orders.

The transfer of authority ends a particularly rocky episode in the strained relations between the U.S. and Karzai. He had insisted that U.S. forces leave Nirkh district in Wardak province over the alleged torture, kidnapping and summary execution of militant suspects there — charges U.S. officials firmly denied.

The incident shows the larger struggle of Karzai's government to assert its authority over security matters, even as its green security forces try to assume control of much of the country from coalition forces on a rushed timeline, ahead of the scheduled withdrawal of most of coalition forces by December 2014.

""As we pledged, our forces have transitioned Nirkh district to Afghan national security forces and they have now assumed full responsibility for security in this key district,"" Gen. Joseph Dunford, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement released Saturday.

""The rest of Wardak will continue to transition over time as Afghan forces continue to grow in capability and capacity,"" he added.

Maj. Gen. Tony Thomas, the top U.S. special operations commander in Afghanistan, told The Associated Press in an interview that the transition of authority took place Saturday. ""What it means is we brought in an Afghan special forces team to take the place of ours,"" Thomas said.

Attaullah Khogyani, spokesman for the governor of Wardak province outside Kabul, confirmed that U.S. special operations forces withdrew and were replaced by a joint Afghan security forces team.

Karzai had originally demanded the U.S. special operations forces pull out from the entire province, a gateway and staging area for Taliban and other militants for attacks on the capital Kabul. But he scaled down his demands to just the single district after negotiations with Dunford and other U.S. officials.

Story continues

""President Karzai was specific, it's only for Nirkh, that was a provocative point,"" Thomas said. ""American special operations forces are integral in the defense of Wardak from now until the foreseeable future.""

U.S. commandos will also continue to visit the Afghan team in Nirkh.

""We're going to support them from a distance,"" Thomas said. ""The reality is there was such a groundswell of support (from locals) in Wardak after the initial allegations that we're keeping several teams down there to work with the Afghan security forces for the future, with an idea that we'll transition over time.""

The American special operations troops are paired with and live alongside locally recruited and trained teams known as Afghan local police. Thomas said most of the local police will be paired with Afghan security forces by the end of the summer, with the Americans making occasional visits as they will do in Nirkh, to assess whether they need logistic or other support.

One Wardak government official expressed relief that the agreement crafted with Karzai did not mean the complete pullout of U.S. forces from the province, saying that local officials were worried their new forces would not yet be able to keep hardcore insurgents out of the area.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because his comments run counter to public statements made by Karzai that the Afghan security forces are ready for complete independence in Wardak.

Meanwhile, Taliban militants attacked a police convoy Saturday morning in Ghazni province in eastern Afghanistan, kicking off a fierce gunbattle, according to deputy provincial police chief Col. Mohammad Hussain.

The police requested a coalition air strike, which hit the militants' position and killed 15 fighters but also wounded nine civilians including a woman and child, Hussain said. He did not report any police casualties.

(Associated Press)

President Obama says the U.S. has agreed to provide Iran with ""modest relief"" from sanctions as part of a deal on the country's nuclear program. (Associated Press)

Iran and six major powers agreed early Sunday on a historic deal that freezes key parts of Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for temporary relief on some economic sanctions.

The agreement, sealed at a 3 a.m. signing ceremony in Geneva’s Palace of Nations, requires Iran to halt or scale back parts of its nuclear infrastructure, the first such pause in more than a decade.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hailed the deal, which was reached after four days of hard bargaining, including an eleventh-hour intervention by Secretary of State John F. Kerry and foreign ministers from Europe, Russia and China.

“It is important that we all of us see the opportunity to end an unnecessary crisis and open new horizons based on respect, based on the rights of the Iranian people and removing any doubts about the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program,” Zarif told reporters in English. “This is a process of attempting to restore confidence.”

The deal, intended as a first step toward a more comprehensive nuclear pact to be completed in six months, freezes or reverses progress at all of Iran’s major nuclear facilities, according to Western officials familiar with the details. It halts the installation of new centrifuges used to enrich uranium and caps the amount and type of enriched uranium that Iran is allowed to produce.

Iran also agreed to halt work on key components of a heavy-water reactor that could someday provide Iran with a source of plutonium. In addition, Iran accepted a dramatic increase in oversight, including daily monitoring by international nuclear inspectors, the officials said.

(Nuclear pact’s fine print: A temporary halt in advances)

The concessions not only halt Iran’s nuclear advances but also make it virtually impossible for Tehran to build a nuclear weapon without being detected, the officials said. In return, Iran will receive modest relief of trade sanctions and access to some of its frozen currency accounts overseas, concessions said to be valued at less than $7 billion over the six-month term of the deal. The sanctions would be reinstated if Iran violates the agreement’s terms.

Not long after the accord was reached, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani said the deal recognizes Tehran’s “right” to maintain an enrichment program.

Rouhani said, “Let anyone make his own reading, but this right is clearly stated in the text of the agreement that Iran can continue its enrichment, and I announce to our people that our enrichment activities will continue as before.”

But Kerry said in response on Sunday that the deal does not recognize a “right to enrich.”

“There is no inherent right to enrich,” Kerry said on ABC’s “This Week.” “And everywhere in this particular agreement it states that they could only do that by mutual agreement, and nothing is agreed on until everything is agreed on.”

In an address from the White House after the deal was announced, President Obama praised the negotiators’ work. “Today, that diplomacy opened up a new path toward a world that is more secure — a future in which we can verify that Iran’s nuclear program is peaceful and that it cannot build a nuclear weapon,” he said. “While today’s announcement is just a first step, it achieves a great deal. For the first time in nearly a decade, we have halted the progress of the Iranian nuclear program, and key parts of the program will be rolled back.”

The agreement is a long-sought victory for the Obama administration, which from its earliest days made the Iranian nuclear program one of its top foreign policy priorities. The administration, helped by its overseas allies as well as Congress, achieved unprecedented success in imposing harsh economic sanctions that cut Iran’s oil exports in half and decimated the country’s currency. It was hoping to quickly finalize an agreement in the face of threats by Congress to impose additional economic sanctions on Iran.

A number of Congress members expressed skepticism about the deal Sunday, including an influential member of the president’s own party, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “In my view, this agreement did not proportionately reduce Iran’s nuclear program for the relief it is receiving,” Menendez said in a statement. “Given Iran’s history of duplicity, it will demand ongoing, on the ground verification.”

But Menendez also suggested that Congress would not impose new sanctions during the six-month interim agreement period.

“I expect that the forthcoming sanctions legislation to be considered by the Senate will provide for a six month window to reach a final agreement before imposing new sanctions on Iran, but will at the same time be immediately available should the talks falter or Iran fail to implement or breach the interim agreement,” his statement sad.

Speaking in the predawn hours after the announcement, Kerry said the goal of the talks was to “require Iran to prove the peaceful nature of its program and ensure that it cannot acquire a nuclear weapon.”

He called the agreement a “serious first step” toward resolving world doubts about Iran’s program. Kerry then addressed Israeli concerns directly. “It will make our partners in the region safer. It will make our ally Israel safer.”

He said it is too soon to tell whether the agreement can help turn the page from more than three decades of animosity and suspicion between the United States and Iran. “This is potentially a significant moment,” he said, “but I’m not going to stand here in some triumphal moment and suggest to you that this is an end unto itself. It is not.”

Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, called the deal “a positive step” and added that it is “vital that we prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon in a peaceful way.”

Still, the agreement is likely to face heavy opposition from key allies — chiefly Israel and Saudi Arabia — as well as congressional skeptics who have demanded much greater concessions from Iran, including the dismantling of its enrichment program.

Obama plans to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday to discuss the agreement, according to a senior administration official. The official also said that the White House had begun calling lawmakers Saturday night and would continue to do so in coming days.

Republican lawmakers characterized the agreement as not going far enough.

“I have serious concerns that this agreement does not meet the standards necessary to protect the United States and our allies,” Rep. Edward R. Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement. “Instead of rolling back Iran’s program, Tehran would be able to keep the key elements of its nuclear weapons-making capability. Yet we are the ones doing the dismantling — relieving Iran of the sanctions pressure built up over years.”

Others, however, hailed the successful conclusion of a deal that eased a crisis that brought the Middle East to the brink of armed conflict.

Clifford Kupchan, a former State Department official and Iran expert, called the deal “a huge win for Obama.”

“You have to give it to these guys: They put in place the most effective sanctions regime in memory and leveraged it into a deal,” Kupchan said.

Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, said diplomacy had “delivered the U.S. and Iran from the brink of a disastrous war and placed the two countries at the beginning of a brighter, more sustainable path forward.”

Among the technical aspects of the deal, Iran agreed to halt enriching uranium to a level above 5 percent purity, a level used for nuclear reactor fuel but not approaching the 90-percent purity needed for nuclear weapons.

While Iran would be allowed to continue some uranium enrichment, it could not install new centrifuges or use thousands of others that it has manufactured but not placed into service. Iran’s total stockpile of enriched uranium would not be allowed to grow during the six-month period.

Iran also agreed to stop producing a type of more highly enriched uranium — up to 20 percent purity — and committed itself to eliminate its stockpile of this material by converting it to metal fuel rods or blending it with natural uranium.

On the key issue of Iran’s partly constructed heavy-water reactor, a potential source of plutonium, Iran agreed to halt production of fuel for the reactor and refrain from installing further reactor components.

Assuring compliance with the agreement, U.N. inspectors would be granted daily access to Iran’s nuclear facilities as well as access to data from remote cameras and sensing equipment.

According to a senior Obama administration official, U.S. officials held a series of bilateral discussions with Iranian officials throughout the fall to develop ideas that could become part of the accord reached by broader negotiations between Iran and the group of six nations.

This week the marathon discussions with Iran were described by Western diplomats as “very difficult” and “intense.” Several officials had sought to lower expectations that a resolution could be reached before Sunday, when Kerry and the other foreign ministers were due to depart.

Negotiations over the deal had remained snarled late into Saturday evening, with the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia, the European Union and the United States huddled in a hotel conference room.

Several of the diplomats met earlier in the day with Iran’s Zarif, who told reporters that the parties remained divided on key details of the six-month deal.

Kerry, Zarif and European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton met late Saturday, but the session ended with no announcement of progress. Instead, Iran’s deputy foreign minister hardened his position on Iran’s right to enrich uranium, a matter of deep national pride.

Although “98 percent” of the deal was done, Iran said it could not accept any agreement that does not recognize enrichment rights, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters.

“Any agreement without recognizing Iran’s right to enrich, practically and verbally, will be unacceptable for Tehran,” Araghchi said, according to Reuters.

Western officials balked at recognizing a legal right to uranium enrichment, hoping instead to craft language that acknowledges the right of all countries to pursue nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Zarif appeared to endorse that approach publicly this month.

Four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens, were killed in the assault by armed militants last September 11 in eastern Libya.

Programming note: Was there a political cover up surrounding the Benghazi attack that killed four Americans? Watch a CNN special investigation — The Truth About Benghazi, Tuesday at 10 p.m. ET.

Sources now tell CNN dozens of people working for the CIA were on the ground that night, and that the agency is going to great lengths to make sure whatever it was doing, remains a secret.

CNN has learned the CIA is involved in what one source calls an unprecedented attempt to keep the spy agency's Benghazi secrets from ever leaking out.



Read: Analysis: CIA role in Benghazi underreported

Since January, some CIA operatives involved in the agency's missions in Libya, have been subjected to frequent, even monthly polygraph examinations, according to a source with deep inside knowledge of the agency's workings.

The goal of the questioning, according to sources, is to find out if anyone is talking to the media or Congress.

It is being described as pure intimidation, with the threat that any unauthorized CIA employee who leaks information could face the end of his or her career.

In exclusive communications obtained by CNN, one insider writes, ""You don't jeopardize yourself, you jeopardize your family as well.""

Another says, ""You have no idea the amount of pressure being brought to bear on anyone with knowledge of this operation.""

""Agency employees typically are polygraphed every three to four years. Never more than that,"" said former CIA operative and CNN analyst Robert Baer.

In other words, the rate of the kind of polygraphs alleged by sources is rare.

""If somebody is being polygraphed every month, or every two months it's called an issue polygraph, and that means that the polygraph division suspects something, or they're looking for something, or they're on a fishing expedition. But it's absolutely not routine at all to be polygraphed monthly, or bi-monthly,"" said Baer.

CIA spokesman Dean Boyd asserted in a statement that the agency has been open with Congress.

""The CIA has worked closely with its oversight committees to provide them with an extraordinary amount of information related to the attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi,"" the statement said.

""CIA employees are always free to speak to Congress if they want,"" the statement continued. ""The CIA enabled all officers involved in Benghazi the opportunity to meet with Congress. We are not aware of any CIA employee who has experienced retaliation, including any non-routine security procedures, or who has been prevented from sharing a concern with Congress about the Benghazi incident.""

Among the many secrets still yet to be told about the Benghazi mission, is just how many Americans were there the night of the attack.

A source now tells CNN that number was 35, with as many as seven wounded, some seriously.

While it is still not known how many of them were CIA, a source tells CNN that 21 Americans were working in the building known as the annex, believed to be run by the agency.

The lack of information and pressure to silence CIA operatives is disturbing to U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, whose district includes CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

""I think it is a form of a cover-up, and I think it's an attempt to push it under the rug, and I think the American people are feeling the same way,"" said the Republican.

""We should have the people who were on the scene come in, testify under oath, do it publicly, and lay it out. And there really isn't any national security issue involved with regards to that,"" he said.

Wolf has repeatedly gone to the House floor, asking for a select committee to be set-up, a Watergate-style probe involving several intelligence committee investigators assigned to get to the bottom of the failures that took place in Benghazi, and find out just what the State Department and CIA were doing there.

More than 150 fellow Republican members of Congress have signed his request, and just this week eight Republicans sent a letter to the new head of the FBI, James Comey, asking that he brief Congress within 30 days.

In the aftermath of the attack, Wolf said he was contacted by people closely tied with CIA operatives and contractors who wanted to talk.

Then suddenly, there was silence.

""Initially they were not afraid to come forward. They wanted the opportunity, and they wanted to be subpoenaed, because if you're subpoenaed, it sort of protects you, you're forced to come before Congress. Now that's all changed,"" said Wolf.

Lawmakers also want to know about the weapons in Libya, and what happened to them.

Speculation on Capitol Hill has included the possibility the U.S. agencies operating in Benghazi were secretly helping to move surface-to-air missiles out of Libya, through Turkey, and into the hands of Syrian rebels.

It is clear that two U.S. agencies were operating in Benghazi, one was the State Department, and the other was the CIA.

The State Department told CNN in an e-mail that it was only helping the new Libyan government destroy weapons deemed ""damaged, aged or too unsafe retain,"" and that it was not involved in any transfer of weapons to other countries.

But the State Department also clearly told CNN, they ""can't speak for any other agencies.""

The CIA would not comment on whether it was involved in the transfer of any weapons.

She Covered The Hillary Clinton Campaign']",U.S. official: Benghazi assault appeared to be ‘terrorist attack from the get-go’,"The deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya during a 2012 attack on a diplomatic outpost in Benghazi told investigators he thought it was a terrorist strike from the beginning, according to interview excerpts released Sunday on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.”

“I thought it was a terrorist attack from the get-go. I think everybody in the mission thought it was a terrorist attack from the beginning,” Gregory Hicks said in an interview with investigators shared with “Face the Nation.” The excerpt was one of several host Bob Schieffer revealed on the program.

Hicks is one of the witnesses called to testify this week before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform about the Sept. 11, 2012, attack that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

Shortly after the attack, U.N. Ambassador Susan E. Rice characterized the assault as a spontaneous attack. The Obama administration later said it was an act of terrorism.

“Clearly, there was a political decision to say something different than what was reasonable to say,” House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said on “Face the Nation.”

According to the excerpts of his interview with investigators, Hicks said that the morning after Rice’s Sunday show appearances he called Acting Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Elizabeth Jones to ask why Rice had said that. Hicks said Jones told him she didn’t know.

This week’s hearing is expected to focus on claims in a Republican committee report that the State Department massaged public statements about the attack to eliminate or play down the likelihood of a terrorist connection.

That long-standing GOP claim may be better supported by documents the committee reviewed in recent months that chart the changes in language over several days following the attack.

Republicans are also focusing on the scope and mandate of an independent review of the attack by a panel appointed by the State Department amid accusations that potential witnesses were excluded from the review.

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said that the review was comprehensive and that decisions about whom to interview were made by the outside review board, not the department."

She Writes About News', 'Politics', 'Culture. Her Columns Appear On Wednesday', 'Sunday. Twitter']",How Edward Snowden managed to outfox everyone,"I hate to say this. Well, maybe I don’t.

It appears that Edward Snowden, the 30-year-old computer analyst hiding in broad daylight, has managed not only to throw a wrench into U.S. foreign policy but also to outfox the very national security apparatus whose overreach he warned against.

It’s pretty astonishing that our government can figure out a way to vacuum up our every phone call, email and text message but can’t get its hands on Snowden, who left Hong Kong for Russia on Sunday, and may be there still, as he figures out how to make his way to what he has (inexplicably) described as a democratic nation for asylum.

Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham put his finger on it when he told Fox News on Sunday that “the freedom trail is not exactly China-Russia-Cuba-Venezuela.” (I guess somewhere along the line, Iceland dropped off Snowden’s list.)

In New Delhi during a three-day visit to India, Secretary of State John Kerry sarcastically called Russia and China “bastions of Internet freedom” and admonished governments that have helped or may help Snowden remain out of the grasp of American authorities.

“There would be, without any question, some effect and impact on the relationship, and consequences,” Kerry said, according to my colleague Henry Chu. “I’d urge them to live within the law. It’s in the interest of everyone.”

Still, one has to wonder why it took the government until Sunday to revoke Snowden’s passport, as the AP reported. It may not have mattered in the long run, but why wait two weeks to take that step?

When Snowden left Hong Kong, according to a detailed New York Times story posted Monday, he was allowed to pass through normal airport checkpoints, despite his annulled passport.

The story also said that Snowden decided to leave Hong Kong after attorneys there advised him that he might not be able to remain free on bail while fighting extradition to the U.S. If he were incarcerated during that time, they said, he would probably not have his computer. Giving up his computer, the attorney said, would be “totally intolerable.” (Forget waterboarding. Confiscate a 30-year-old’s computer and watch him beg for mercy.)

One also wonders why the feds revealed Friday that Snowden had been indicted on three felonies, including two charges under the 1917 Espionage Act, which made it likely, in the view of some foreign policy experts, that countries antagonistic to the United States (i.e., Cuba and Venezuela) would not be inclined to respect the State Department’s notice advising governments that Snowden should not be allowed transit to or through their countries.

In any case, as this amazing story continues, in slow motion, like a global version of the famous white Bronco chase, the Obama administration has itself to blame for this mess.

Forget the unforgivable lapses on the part of national security contractors, like Snowden’s former employer, Booz Allen Hamilton.

The sweeping nature of the spying program that Snowden revealed should never have been secret in the first place. While it’s reassuring when Keith Alexander, head of the National Security Agency, tells Congress that the program is responsible for “connecting dots” and stopping at least 50 terror plots since 9/11, it’s almost mind-boggling that the agency is just now instituting the security equivalent of the “buddy system,” designed to prevent analysts from unilaterally downloading material.

At a party in Los Angeles over the weekend, the murmured consensus among many guests with whom I chatted was “Let ‘em read my email, I have nothing to hide.” But that’s not really the issue. The American public has a right to know the broad outlines of the government’s electronic spying program, and exactly how it keeps us safe. Until Snowden provided proof of these programs’ existence to the Washington Post and the Guardian, the public — and indeed, most of Congress — had no idea of the extent of the surveillance.

Snowden’s “Where’s Waldo?” sideshow is riveting to watch, and may have unpleasant, if fleeting, implications for our relationships with the countries that have shown a willingness to help him out.

I’m not exactly sure I am cheering for his rapid repatriation, as I have mixed feelings about the charges he faces, which could get him up to 30 years in prison.

But the longer he’s out there, the more bumbling the U.S. government looks.

With the planes potentially heading for the trash heap of the Afghanistan war, the chief military watchdog overseeing Afghanistan spending is launching a review into the terminated program.

""I'm very troubled with the fact we may have wasted a half-billion dollars on planes that don't work, will never be flown and will probably be scrapped,"" Special Inspector General John F. Sopko told FoxNews.com in a statement. ""We intend to get to the bottom of this and hold people accountable.""

Sopko wrote to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and other military officials on Dec. 5 informing them of his office's review. Sopko said the planes are ""currently sitting unused"" at the Kabul International Airport and Ramstein Air Base in Germany. He stressed the need to ""ensure that the U.S. government does not repeat the mistakes made throughout this nearly half billion dollar program.""

Sopko has been on the warpath over military resources wasted in Afghanistan, as the U.S. prepares to withdraw most its troops from the country.

He recently reopened an investigation into a $34 million military facility in southwestern Afghanistan that he's described as entirely unnecessary.

The story of the G222 aircraft program bares similar themes.

According to the inspector general's office, the Defense Department in 2008 launched a program to give 20 G222s (C-27A) -- military transport aircraft built in Italy -- to the Afghans. The department contracted with Alenia Aermacchi North America.

But despite spending at least $486 million on the program, officials determined that those in charge did a poor job getting the spare parts needed to keep the planes working.

Further, a Pentagon watchdog reported that the planes flew only 234 of the 4,500 ""required hours"" between January and September of last year, and another $200 million potentially would be needed to buy the outstanding spare parts. Some of those parts were described as ""unavailable.""

In December 2012, the Air Force ended the contract. Several months later, officials ended the program altogether and opted to go with an ""alternate aircraft"" in the long term.

The IG's latest investigation will examine the decision to provide the aircraft to the Afghans as well as what might happen to the 20 planes idling in airfields, including the possibility of ""disposal.""

Lt. Gen. Charles Davis, top acquisition official in the U.S. Air Force, recently told Bloomberg that the planes themselves just weren't right for the environment, and probably will be ""destroyed and moved out of the country.""

Air Force spokesman Ed Gulick, though, said the fate of the planes is contingent on a pending 2014 defense bill which would allow the Pentagon to effectively take over the aircraft from the Afghan security forces.

""With this authority, DoD could undertake final disposition of the equipment, including reuse, sale, transfer, or disposal,"" he told FoxNews.com in an email.

As for the contract, he said the military did not renew the program because Alenia ""struggled to consistently meet contractual obligations.""

But the contractor claimed to Bloomberg that the company was ""proud of its work.""

According to the contractor's website, the aircraft were meant to be the ""backbone"" of the Afghan Air Force, expanding their ability to provide aid and security. The planes are able to carry up to 10 tons of cargo."

Many of the president’s core supporters, especially African-Americans and members of the Democratic Party’s liberal wing who voted repeatedly against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, are expressing the deepest reservations. With rank-and-file House Republicans showing little inclination to back Mr. Obama on an issue on which he has staked his political credibility, scores of Democratic votes will be needed if a resolution authorizing force against Syria is to pass the House.

Democrats say they are being confronted with a difficult choice: Go against the wishes of a president who is popular and well respected in their caucus, or defy voters back home who are overwhelmingly opposed to another United States military intervention overseas.

In the first sign of how splits within the party will loom large over the Syria debate, two Democrats voted no and a third voted present on Wednesday when a divided Senate committee approved a use-of-force resolution with senators from both parties crossing over."

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — President Obama awarded U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Ty Carter the Medal of Honor on Monday for his heroics in a 2009 battle where he and 53 American troops fought back against some 300 Taliban fighters in a valley of the Afghanistan mountains.

Carter became the second soldier to be awarded the highest military commendation for his courageous action in the battle.

Earlier this year, Obama awarded Clinton Romesha, a former Army staff sergeant, the Medal of Honor for leading the defense of the plywood-and-concrete outpost known as Combat Outpost Keating. Eight U.S. soldiers would die in the fight for the outpost.

In honoring Carter and Romesha, it is the first time that two living recipients have received Medals of Honor for their gallantry in the same battle since Vietnam. Carter also became the fifth living U.S. servicemember of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to receive the honor.

""The outpost was being slammed from every direction,"" Obama said in the afternoon ceremony at the White House. ""Machine gun fire, rocket-propelled grenades, mortar, sniper fire, it was chaos. The blizzard of bullets and steel into which Ty ran not once or twice, or even a few times, but perhaps 10 times. In doing so, he displayed the essence of true heroism.""

Carter ran low and fast across an American outpost while overwhelming numbers of Taliban fighters closed in. He sprinted over ground where he could see bullets piercing the dust in front of him, gambling on getting ahead of the shooters' ability to target him.

Carter ran a gauntlet of heavy machine gun and sniper fire — carrying ammo, recovering a field radio, cradling a wounded comrade in his arms — sometimes zigzagging to dodge exploding rocket-propelled grenades or mortar rounds.

When he wasn't moving through enemy fire in the battle in 2009, Carter and another soldier made their stand in an all-but-shredded armored vehicle — a last defensive bastion in a far corner of the fort. Surrounded by dead Americans and running low on ammunition, they shot and killed enemy fighters breaching the walls.

""When good men are dying all around you, you have to decide what your last moments are going to be like,"" Carter told USA TODAY. ""Are you going to die behind something, or are you going to die standing and firing? Are you going to die pushing forward or falling back?""

Obama also thanked Carter for speaking out about his battles with post-traumatic stress, and noted that Carter had urged him to remember another soldier, Ed Faulkner Jr., who fought alongside him that day. Faulker died in September 2010 after a fatal overdose of methadone and Xanax.

""Let me say it as clearly as I can to any of our troops and veterans who are struggling,"" Obama said. ""Look at this man, look at this soldier, look at this warrior. He is as tough as they come and if he can find the courage and strength to not only seek help, but also speak about it … than so can you.""

http://ph.news.yahoo.com/obama-says-us-cant-turn-blind-eye-syria-100826260.html,,[],Obama gears up for all-out push on Syria,"Washington deepened its diplomatic offensive at home and abroad Sunday as President Barack Obama braced for a key week in his push to persuade skeptical Americans to back strikes against the Syrian regime. Lawmakers returning Monday from their summer break are set to begin debate on whether to approve limited US military action in Syria, with a Senate vote possibly coming as early as Wednesday. Obama will blitz US networks on Monday evening before addressing the American people from the Oval Office on Tuesday aiming to lay out the case to deepen US involvement in a two-year-old war that has claimed more than 100,000 lives. President Bashar al-Assad was also to take to the US airwaves to deny he ordered a suspected chemical attack on his people last month, which has shocked the world and galvanized the Obama administration into preparing for its first military foray into the brutal conflict. In a rare interview with a US network, Assad insisted he was not behind the August 21 gas attack on a Damascus suburb, and issued a veiled warning to the American people not to become militarily involved in the rebellion against him that erupted in March 2011. The long-time Syrian leader warned that as his country prepares ""as best we can"" for US military action, there could be a bitter consequences. ""There's no evidence that I used chemical weapons against my own people,"" he reportedly told CBS television, in the interview to be aired Monday. Assad said he ""had a message to the American people that it had not been a good experience for them to get involved in the Middle East in wars and conflicts."" He ""suggested that there would be, among people that are aligned with him, some kind of retaliation if a strike was made,"" veteran CBS correspondent Charlie Rose told CBS. After talks with Arab League leaders in Paris, US Secretary of State John Kerry said: ""All of us agree, not one dissenter, that Assad's deplorable use of chemical weapons... crosses an international global red line."" Kerry, who was dispatched by Obama to shore up support abroad, said a number of Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, were willing to sign a statement agreed by 12 of the G20 countries last week calling for a ""strong"" reaction to the alleged attack. Asked about Assad's denial, Kerry told journalists traveling with him on his next stop in London that ""the evidence speaks for itself."" ""Today we discussed the possible and necessary measures that can be taken,"" he said earlier, adding Saudi Arabia was among those who had signed on. The stakes are high, with Obama far from guaranteed of winning a green light from Congress, amid American fears of being dragged deeper into the conflict and the risk of dangerous repercussions for allies such as Israel, which on Sunday deployed its Iron Dome missile defense system west of Jerusalem. It remains unclear whether Obama, who was partly elected in 2008 on his promises to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, would decide to go it alone if he fails to win congressional approval. While a resolution for a military strike is likely to pass the Senate controlled by Obama's Democrats, according to a Washington Post survey some 224 of the current 433 members of the Republican dominated House were either ""no"" or ""leaning no"" on military action as of Friday. A large number, 184, were undecided, with just 25 backing a strike. A top White House official said Sunday the Obama administration is planning ""for every contingency"" in case of any fallout from US military strikes. ""We have to obviously be very careful and very targeted and very limited in our engagement so we do not get dragged into the middle of this. And then there's obviously risk of reaction and retaliation against our friends,"" White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said on CNN. He urged hesitant lawmakers to watch graphic videos released over the weekend, said to be of the August attack, showing corpses as well as dying people, including children, writhing in pain and apparently foaming at the mouth and vomiting. The Los Angeles Times reported meanwhile that the Pentagon was preparing for three days of attacks on Syria, longer than originally planned. War planners now aim to unleash a heavy barrage of missile strikes to be followed swiftly by additional attacks on targets that may have been missed or remain standing after the initial launch, the newspaper cited officials as saying. A US defense official told AFP the scale and purpose of the operation against Syria has not changed in recent weeks, although US forces would adjust as needed. ""We will continue to review our targeting and targeting options as the Syrian government adapts over time,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javed Zarif on Sunday slammed the potential strikes against Syria as ""illegal,"" saying such military action was barred under the United Nations charter. On the ground, Syrian rebels, including the jihadist Al-Nusra Front, were said to have taken control of the historic Christian town of Maalula, north of Damascus. And an Italian journalist and a Belgian national who had both been kidnapped in early April were released and on a plane flying to Italy, the Italian government said."

“As a transit passenger he is still in the transit hall [of the airport],” Putin said at a news conference in neighboring Finland, where he was on an official visit. “Our special services have never worked with Mr. Snowden and they are not working [with him] today.”

He noted that Russia has no extradition treaty with the United States, and “we can extradite some people only to states with which we have corresponding agreements.”

He added: “On the territory of the Russian Federation, Mr. Snowden has committed no crimes, thank God. Mr. Snowden is a free man and the sooner he chooses his final destination the better both for him and for us.”

Snowden, who is wanted by the United States for leaking classified documents while working as a contractor for the U.S. National Security Agency, flew from Hong Kong to Moscow on Sunday and hasn’t been seen since. He was presumed to have been en route to Ecuador via Cuba, but he was not seen on a flight from Moscow to Havana on Monday.

With speculation running wild about his whereabouts, including a theory that he might have flown to Minsk, Belarus, Putin appeared to have put an end, for the moment, to that part of the international spy mystery.

In addressing the question of whether Russia should hand Snowden over to U.S. authorities, Putin cited the case of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Sweden in a sex case. Assange has been given asylum inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London.

“Assange as well as Snowden consider themselves human rights activists and claim that they are struggling for [free] spreading of information,” said the Russian president, who has exerted ruthless control over information and media in Russia. “I am asking myself a question whether such people should be extradited to be put in prison.

“In any case,” he added, in a typically colorful aphorism, “I would prefer not to deal in these matters because it is like shearing a pig – lots of screeching but little wool.”

Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia has “nothing to do with either Mr. Snowden or his relations with the U.S. justice or his movements around the world.”

Sweeping government efforts to stop attacks are backfiring abroad and infringing on basic rights at home.

CIA drone strikes are killing scores of civilians in Pakistan and Yemen. The National Security Agency is eavesdropping on tens of millions of phone calls worldwide — including those of 35 foreign leaders — in the name of U.S. security.

And the Department of Homeland Security is using algorithms to “prescreen” travelers before they board domestic flights, reviewing government and private databases that include Americans’ tax identification numbers, car registrations and property records.

Will we create a Minority Report-style Department of Precrime next?

Obama administration officials have a duty to protect Americans from terrorism. But out-of-control NSA surveillance, an ever-expanding culture of secrecy and still-classified rules for how and when foreigners and even Americans can be killed by drone strikes are excessive, unnecessary and destructive.

Twelve years after September 11, 2001, the United States’ obsession with al Qaeda is doing more damage to the nation than the terrorist group itself.

Two new reports issued this week by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch detailed dozens of civilian deaths caused by drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen. Classified documents obtained by the Washington Post suggest that CIA officials who carry out the strikes make little effort to track civilian deaths.

“There is a lot more pressure building” on President Barack Obama, Sarah Holewinski, head of the Center for Civilians in Conflict, a group pushing for greater transparency in drone strikes, told me this week. “He’s going to have to look at these legal questions.”

Documents leaked by whistleblower Edward J. Snowden emerged this week, revealing NSA phone monitoring of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, 35 unidentified heads of state, and 70 million calls in France.

The extent of the surveillance is sparking widespread indignation and endangering joint counter-terrorism operations among Germany, France and the United States.

“The perception here is of a United States where security has trumped liberty,” New York Times columnist Roger Cohen wrote from Berlin on Thursday, “intelligence agencies run amok (vacuuming up data of friend and foe alike), and the once-admired ‘checks and balances’ built into American governance and studied by European schoolchildren have become, at best, secret reviews of secret activities where opposing arguments get no hearing.”

There is a serious terrorist threat to the United States. The administration is under enormous pressure to prevent attacks. But there are ways to safeguard the United States without sparking such a serious backlash abroad and at home.

Holewinski called on the Obama administration to implement its promise to move command of drone operations from the CIA to the American military. She said the shift, which Obama announced this spring, is going “very, very slowly.”

Military control is one step toward a key goal: greater transparency in countries where drone strikes are enormously unpopular. Keeping the drone strikes as a covert CIA-run program makes accountability and determining the true number of civilian deaths impossible, she said.

If strikes are commanded by the military and disclosed publicly, reports of civilian casualties could be investigated under military law and compensation paid to victims — as now happens in Afghanistan.

Holewinski also urged the administration to disclose targeting rules that it has refused to make public. How are civilians defined? And how are civilian casualties assessed? What is the legal definition of an individual who can be targeted?

She credited the administration for a decrease in drone strikes since Obama promised one in May. But, she insisted, the targeting process needs to be far more transparent.

Inside the United States, meanwhile, press reports emerged on Monday that the Transportation Security Administration is expanding its prescreening of airline passengers to include government and private databases that contain employment information, property records and physical characteristics.

Khaliah Barnes, a lawyer with the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which opposes this prescreening, said many Americans do not grasp the current scale of domestic government data mining.

“The average person doesn’t understand how much intelligence-driven matching is going on and how this could be accessed for other purposes,” she said. “There’s no meaningful oversight, transparency or accountability.”

One critic called the new TSA program “a ‘pre-crime’ assessment every time you fly.”

A bipartisan proposal to rein in government surveillance unveiled last month by Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Mark Udall (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is a good start. The measure would end the bulk collection of American’s communications records; limit Washington’s ability to obtain information from Google and other online providers, and make the secret court that oversees U.S. surveillance operations far more transparent.

After months of promising change, Obama should back the senators’ proposal. He should also enact Holewinski’s recommendations for making drone strikes more transparent.

Terrorists already know that the United States monitors phone calls and emails worldwide. They already masquerade as civilians in areas where drones operate. Making drone strikes, NSA surveillance and TSA screening more transparent will build trust at home and solidify counter-terrorism cooperation abroad.

If there is one ideal that Obama needs to embrace, it’s transparency. It is a strength, not a weakness.

Among prosecutors and defense lawyers, there’s a name for that kind of hyperbole: overcharging. Whatever his crimes — and he clearly committed some — Mr. Snowden did not commit treason, though the people who have long kept the secrets he revealed are now fulminating with rage.

If Mr. Snowden had really wanted to harm his country, he could have sold the classified documents he stole to a foreign power, say Russia or China or Iran or North Korea. But even that would not constitute treason, which only applies in cases of aiding an enemy with whom the United States is at war.

His harshest critics might argue that by exposing American intelligence practices, he gave aid and comfort to Al Qaeda and its allies, with whom the country remains in a military conflict, thanks to the Authorization for Use of Military Force, which Congress passed after Sept. 11, 2001, and is in force now. It’s unlikely that Qaeda leaders did not already know or suspect surveillance before Mr. Snowden’s disclosures. But treason means more than that, too. In the landmark 1945 case Cramer v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that one had to provide aid and comfort and also “adhere” to an enemy to be guilty of treason."

Gordon'],Criticism of United States’ Mideast Policy Increasingly Comes From Allies,"But the criticism by Saudi officials has been the most vehement, as they have waged a campaign against the United States’ policy in the Middle East in private comments to diplomats and reporters, as well as in public remarks by a former intelligence official.

Saudi officials have made it clear they are frustrated with the Obama administration — not just for its reluctance to do more to aid the rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and not just for its willingness to engage Iran in negotiations, but also for its refusal to endorse the Egyptian military’s ouster of President Mohamed Morsi and the crackdown on Mr. Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood party.

Beyond criticism, the Saudis have been working against American policy in Egypt by providing billions of dollars in assistance to the authorities in Cairo, which has more than made up for aid the United States has withheld after the Egyptian military deposed Mr. Morsi. Mr. Kerry and other American officials have insisted that the United States was right to work with Mr. Morsi after he took office as the duly elected president.

In a speech on Tuesday at the annual Arab-U.S. Policymakers Conference held by the National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations, Saudi Arabia’s former spy chief and ambassador to the United States, Prince Turki al-Faisal, also complained about the White House’s decision to embrace an agreement to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons instead of carrying out a cruise missile strike against Mr. Assad’s forces.

“The current charade of international control over Bashar’s chemical arsenal would be funny if it were not so blatantly perfidious, and designed not only to give Mr. Obama an opportunity to back down but also to help Assad to butcher his people,” said Prince Turki, a member of the Saudi royal family and a former director of Saudi intelligence."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/30/john-kerry-syria-white-house_n_3844202.html,2013-08-30 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']","John Kerry Makes Case For Syria Strike, But Questions Linger","WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday that there was ""no doubt"" the Syrian regime used chemical weapons in a devastating attack last week that killed more than 1,400 people, pointing to a newly released White House intelligence report that leaves unresolved whether President Bashar Assad himself ordered the attack.

Kerry's speech made clear that the United States was preparing for strikes on Assad's government, even as the United Kingdom declined to join in the military effort.

""Its findings are as clear as they are compelling,"" Kerry said of the report. ""I'm not asking you to take my word for it, read for yourself.""

But while the report assessed with ""high confidence"" that the Syrian government had used a nerve agent in the Aug. 21 attack, which U.S. intelligence believes killed at least 1,429 people including 426 children, it stopped short of conclusively demonstrating that Syrian President Bashar Assad himself, as opposed to a more junior officer, had ordered it. Details on what led the intelligence community to its conclusion were slim in the unclassified version of the report released to the public.

""We know that for three days before the attack, the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons personnel were on the ground in the area, making preparations,"" Kerry said.

The preparations included, he said, putting on gas masks.

""This is what Assad did to his own people,"" Kerry said. If the US and world allowed ""a thug and a murderer like Bashar al-Assad"" to get away with gassing his own people, he added, ""there will be no end to the test of our resolve and the dangers that will flow from those others who believe that they can do as they will.""

“We do assess that [Assad] is the decision-maker, and that he's ultimately in charge of deployment,” a senior administration official said in a conference call with reporters on Friday afternoon.

The only question remaining in the aftermath of the chemical attack, Kerry said, was, ""what are we and the world going to do about it?"" Presumably referencing a ""red line"" that President Barack Obama drew last August on the use of chemical weapons in Syria, Kerry also said the United States had to act because its credibility and interests were on the line.

“Our intelligence community has carefully reviewed and re-reviewed the information regarding this attack,” Kerry said on Friday. “It has done so more than mindful of the Iraq experience, and we will not repeat that moment.”

Over the past week, a series of intelligence community leaks have indicated that the evidence behind the chemical attack -- and specifically the question of what role Assad himself played in ordering it -- remains relatively weak.

In an Associated Press report on Thursday, one government official was quoted as saying the data was “no slam dunk.”

""It's unclear where control lies,"" another U.S. intelligence official told Foreign Policy earlier in the week. ""Is there just some sort of general blessing to use these things? Or are there explicit orders for each attack?""

The release by the Obama administration on Friday sought to address those intelligence gaps, although it did not offer specific data on the link between Assad and the attack. Instead, it focused on circumstantial indications: the fact that the chemical-laden rockets were all fired from regime-held areas into rebel-held ones, and an intercepted communication from a senior regime official that apparently confirmed the use of the weapons.

The Syrian government's motivation for launching a massive chemical weapons strike that was sure to cross Obama's ""red line"" remained unclear.

The intelligence assessment said the regime's ""frustration"" with its inability to clear swaths of the Damascus suburbs home to opposition forces ""may have"" contributed to its decision. Independent analysts were puzzled by the Syrian move, with some suggesting it could have been a mistake by a lower-ranking official.

The Obama administration's findings closely mirror those in a similar brief released Thursday by British intelligence just before the U.K. parliament voted down Prime Minister David Cameron's bid to have the country take part in a strike against Syria, by a vote of 285-272.

It was a stunning defeat for Cameron, who acknowledged after the vote that ""the British Parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action"" and said that the government would ""act accordingly.""

The British assessment concluded that it was “highly likely” that the Syrian regime had been behind the attacks, and that there was “no credible intelligence or other evidence” to support allegations that other forces, such as the rebels themselves, might have carried them out. But it also acknowledged having limited insight into the regime's “precise motivation” for using chemical weapons, particularly at a moment when United Nations chemical-weapons inspectors were staying at a hotel just miles away.

The British parliament's rejection of military action in Syria sparked questions on whether the U.S. would ""fly solo"" in its operation, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel also refused her government's assistance for airstrikes in Syria. But French President Francois Hollande expressed his willingness Friday to proceed with plans to strike Syria over its use of chemical weapons.

""The chemical massacre of Damascus cannot and must not remain unpunished,"" Hollande said.

The administration's intelligence brief was designed to assuage the concerns of both the public and a deeply uneasy Congress. Polls indicate that the American public is highly skeptical of launching a strike on Syria without congressional backing.

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have urged the president to hold more consultations with members of Congress and not act unilaterally. Many Republicans, joined by a growing number of Democrats, have demanded a vote in Congress to authorize the use of military force.

While the White House is unlikely to seek congressional approval, the administration stepped up its deliberations with lawmakers Thursday. Obama called House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), whose office followed up with a statement calling on the president to provide a more robust explanation to both members of Congress and the American public.

Top administration officials also held a 90-minute conference call Thursday evening with congressional leaders and the chairs and ranking members of national security committees. During the call, lawmakers were briefed on the administration's approach and rationale for military involvement by Kerry, national security advisor Susan Rice, defense secretary Chuck Hagel, director of national intelligence James Clapper, and Sandy Winnefeld, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said after the call that he would support ""surgical, proportional military strikes,"" but the administration ""would be far better off if they seek [congressional] authorization.""

Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, told The Huffington Post that members of Congress who sit on the relevant intelligence committees have ""been continually supplied with classified info.""

She added that they will receive the classified version of Friday's chemical weapons assessment ""at some point today,"" and that the administration will hold classified briefings for its staff this afternoon.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) issued a statement on the Thursday briefing in which she said Assad had acted ""outside the realm of basic human rights."" But she added that she agreed with Boehner and other members that the administration must engage in further consultation with Congress and provide greater transparency into the decision-making process and timing.

""The case needs to be made to the American people,"" Pelosi said. ""It is clear that the American people are weary of war.""

UPDATE: 2:50 p.m. -- Obama addressed reporters at the White House later on Friday, emphasizing that he had not made any decisions about what actions the U.S. will take against Syria but adding that he is considering a ""limited narrow act.""

""We're not considering any open ended commitment,"" Obama said. ""We're not considering any boots on the ground approach.""

""We are looking at the possibility of a limited, narrow act that would help make sure that not only Syria but others around the world understand that the international community cares about maintaining this chemical weapons ban,"" he said. ""I have not made a final decision about various actions that might be taken to help enforce that norm, but as I've already said, I have had my military and our team look at a wide range of options. We have consulted with allies. We've consulted with Congress.""

The president acknowledged that many people, including himself, are ""war weary.""

""There is a certain weariness, given Afghanistan. There is a certain suspicion of any military action post-Iraq,"" Obama said, adding that he appreciated the skepticism. ""It’s important for us to recognize that when over a thousand people are killed, including hundreds of innocent children, through the use of a weapon that 98 or 99 percent of humanity says should not be used even in war, and there is no action, then we’re sending a signal … that is a danger to our national security.""

U.S. intelligence has been tracking a growing threat against American and Western targets from al Qaeda’s affiliate organization in Yemen for the last several weeks.

But in recent days, there has been additional intelligence about a potential attack in Yemen, as well as threats against U.S. interests in the Middle East and North Africa, leading to the Obama administration’s decision to shut down U.S. embassies and warn publicly of the threat, U.S. officials tell CNN.

Based on the intelligence, officials say, there is particular concern about the U.S. Embassy in Yemen between Saturday and Tuesday. Sunday, one of the holiest days in Islam, marks the end of Ramadan, and officials say they are concerned about attacks on that day.

The threat against the U.S. Embassy in Yemen was a primary concern, but it was ambiguous and could indicate threats against other U.S. and other Western targets in the Mideast and North Africa, another U.S. official told CNN.

The officials say the threat is linked to al Qaeda, rather than emanating directly from al Qaeda’s traditional stronghold in Pakistan.

“This is a higher-than-normal threat stream,” one official told CNN. Officials declined to say whether the information came from telephone intercepts, website postings or agents on the ground. “But it all leads us to believe something could happen in the near future,” the official said.

A senior U.S. official said there was “more than the usual chatter” about potential terror threats.

Separately a second official acknowledged there are differences within the administration about what the intelligence shows about the credibility and specificity of the threats and the potential timing of any attacks. But, as a third official said, “How often do you see so many embassies shut down? That tells you something about how serious it is.”

Vice President Joe Biden, along senior State Department officials in Washington, briefed congressional leadership and key committee chairs and ranking members about the new threat, a source who attended the meeting said. The briefing, earlier this week, was scheduled to discuss embassy security after the Benghazi attack, but included a discussion on this new concern.

This source said there was a lot of concern about increased chatter and about embassies being a potential target, though Biden did not mention in the briefing that the embassies would be closed.

Another source with knowledge of the government concerns and the meeting with the vice president said this is not something in the margins.

A U.S. law enforcement official says the threat information is ""nonspecific and not corroborated,"" but it was important enough that U.S. national security officials issued an alert. Some of the reaction by the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and other agencies that helped issue the alert can be explained by the Benghazi attack, another official said. Before that attack, this type of information may or may not have resulted in such an alert. But certainly, in light of the Benghazi attack, the alert was issued out of ""abundance of caution,” the official said.

State Department officials insist the wording of the worldwide caution issued Friday is not ""boilerplate."" They point to the first line, which is specific: ""The Department of State alerts U.S. citizens to the continued potential for terrorist attacks, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, and possibly occurring in or emanating from the Arabian Peninsula."" The State Department does use some of the same language in alerts and warnings, but that is for consistency's sake.

State Department officials say they are taking this threat ""very seriously."" They issue worldwide cautions periodically, but this one is specific and applies to a large number of embassies. One official could not remember when the last time as many embassies were ordered closed. There have been previous major warnings, and the official recalled the one for Europe in 2010.

The embassies and consulates affected will be closed to the public. One reason is to avoid having long visa lines outside, which could turn into a target for attacks. Even when the embassies are closed, however, there are personnel working inside, and they can provide emergency services such as emergency passports.

The State Department has a 24-hour operations center that monitors threats all the time."

Obama suggested this proves there was no cover-up and no effort to downplay terrorism. But the president's re-telling of events last September appeared to clash with the actual timeline of administration statements.

Though Obama referred to ""acts of terror"" on Sept. 12, he and other top officials repeatedly declined to call it terrorism on subsequent occasions.

And even after National Counterterrorism Center Director Matt Olsen testified on Sept. 19 that the attack was terrorism -- which is the testimony Obama pointed to in his remarks Monday -- Obama himself declined to use the term the next day. ""I don't want to speak to something until we have all the information,"" Obama said on Sept. 20.

Republicans were quick to pillory the president's comments Monday.

More On This... Obama calls Benghazi controversy a ‘sideshow’

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., called it ""revisionist history."" John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., called it ""flatly untrue.""

""This definitely is a creative rewriting of history,"" Bolton told Fox News.

The president made two central claims Monday as he battled new reports that depicted an effort to water down the administration's early talking points on the attack in order to downplay terrorism.

First, Obama said: ""The day after it happened I acknowledged that this was an act of terrorism.""

The president has made this argument before, most forcefully during the presidential race against Mitt Romney. He is mainly referring to remarks in the Rose Garden Sept. 12 where he referred to ""acts of terror"" as he condemned the attack.

But for days afterward, he and other top officials would not use that term.

Later that day on Sept. 12, Obama told CBS News, when asked whether he thought the strike was a terrorist attack: ""Well, it's too early to tell exactly how this came about."" Obama only would call it ""an attack on Americans.""

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also denied reports on Sept. 14 that it was a pre-planned attack.

And after U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice made her controversial Sept. 16 comments calling the attack the result of a protest, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland was again asked if the attack was terrorism. ""I don't think we know enough,"" she said.

Administration officials began to start publicly changing the narrative the week of Sept. 17.

Obama made a new claim on Monday as he tried to put that week in context.

The president suggested that, three days after Rice tied the attack to protests over an anti-Islam film, Olsen was dispatched to Capitol Hill to clear things up.

He was referring to Olsen's testimony on Capitol Hill Sept. 19 in which he called the attack terrorism.

""If this was some effort on our part to try to downplay what had happened or tamp it down, that would be a pretty odd thing that three days later we end up putting out all the information,"" Obama said. ""Who executes some sort of cover-up or effort to tamp things down for three days? So the whole thing defies logic.""

The comment suggested Olsen was sent to the Hill to announce the administration's conclusion that the attack was terrorism.

Yet Olsen's comment only came under questioning by a Senate committee. And at the time, his testimony was considered major news because it ran contrary to other accounts out of the administration.

Congressional sources also told Fox News last year that Olsen was reprimanded by the White House after he testified -- though the White House denied the allegation.

Further, while Olsen became the first administration official to publicly call it a ""terrorist attack,"" other officials were not quite on board with that description at the time.

Neither Nuland nor Carney used the term that day.

The next day, while speaking to Univision, Obama declined to use the label, saying: ""I don't want to speak to something until we have all the information.""

However, Carney said Sept. 20 that it was ""self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack.""

After that point, other top officials began using the term."

That is incorrect: Snowden traveled using his U.S. passport. This version has been corrected.

Edward Snowden seems to be stranded.

Three weeks after Snowden revealed himself as the source of leaked top-secret documents on U.S. intelligence gathering, the former intelligence contractor is stuck in legal limbo in Russia. Although he has not been seen publicly in days, he is thought to be inside a transit area of a Moscow airport.

On Sunday, two of his strongest supporters — Julian Assange of WikiLeaks and President Rafael Correa of Ecuador — said it was unlikely that Snowden would leave there anytime soon.

“The United States, by canceling his passport, has left him for the moment marooned in Russia,” said Assange, whose anti-

secrecy organization has aided Snowden in his flight.

The United States canceled Snowden’s passport a week ago, after he was charged with espionage. Assange criticized that decision on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos”: “To take a passport from a young man in a difficult situation like that is a disgrace,” he said.

And in Ecuador on Sunday, Correa seemed to play down the chances that his country could offer Snowden a way out. For now, Correa told the Associated Press, Snowden was “under the care of the Russian authorities.”

“This is the decision of Russian authorities. He doesn’t have a passport. I don’t know the Russian laws. I don’t know if he can leave the airport, but I understand that he can’t,” Correa said. He said the case was out of Ecuador’s hands. “If [Snowden] arrives at an Ecuadoran embassy, we’ll analyze his request for asylum.”

Snowden’s escape plan was never a simple one. After first making himself one of the most wanted men in the world, he was attempting to hopscotch 11,000 miles from Hong Kong to Russia to Ecuador — perhaps with a stopover in Cuba.

To do it, he would have to stay ahead of U.S. law enforcement and a pack of news media — and to count on the caprices of three (or four) foreign governments.

Snowden made it one stop. He flew from Hong Kong to Moscow a week ago, apparently on his U.S. passport. It had already been revoked, but Hong Kong authorities said they had not received the official request from the U.S. government.

Now, Snowden’s flight has brought him to the transit area of Sheremetyevo International Airport. And to a dwindling set of options.

One is simply staying in the airport. If Snowden is not being detained by Russian authorities — and Russian officials have said that he is not — he could remain in an area reserved for international travelers making connections. As long as he does not go through passport control, Russian officials say, he would not legally cross into Russian territory.

If he wants to leave, however, Snowden would need travel documents to replace his canceled passport.

Earlier, it appeared that Ecuadoran officials might be willing to help him with this. On June 22, the Ecuadoran Embassy in London issued a safe-conduct pass in his name. (Assange himself is holed up at the same embassy, avoiding extradition to Sweden for questioning over allegations of sexual abuse).

But it seems unlikely that Ecuador would provide the same kind of help again.

On Sunday, Correa told the Associated Press that the Ecuadoran official who issued the pass had committed “a serious error” by not consulting officials back home. Correa said the consul would be punished, though he didn’t specify how.

Correa’s tone seemed to have shifted after a conversation with Vice President Biden on Friday. Where Correa had earlier been defiant, he now voiced respect for U.S. legal procedures.

“If he really could have broken North American laws, I am very respectful of other countries and their laws, and I believe that someone who breaks the law must assume his responsibilities,” Correa said, according to AP.

Snowden might be able to obtain travel documents from another country — one willing to showily defy the U.S. government. In Venezuela, for instance, President Nicolás Maduro recently praised Snowden for revealing the extent of U.S. surveillance.

“No one has up to this point formally asked us to give political asylum to this young person, Snowden,” said Maduro, who was scheduled to arrive in Russia on Monday for a trade mission. “If they asked us for it, we’d think about it, think about it. And it’s almost certain that we’d give it to him. Why? Because asylum is an international humanitarian right to protect those who are being pursued for noble causes.”

Snowden might also seek asylum from Russia itself.

On Sunday, a spokesman for Russian President Vladi­mir Putin said Snowden is not the Kremlin’s concern. But he also noted that “public opinion on the subject is very rich,” and he pointed out that politicians and human rights defenders had spoken in support of offering Snowden asylum. “We are aware of that and take it into account.”

That could perhaps be a nod toward the possibility of asylum. Or not.

For now, only one country seems to be offering Snowden a certain way out of his airport limbo. It’s the one he doesn’t want to go back to.

“Mr. Snowden is hardly ‘marooned’ since he is still a United States citizen and his country is willing to take him back,” said Nanda Chitre, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department. “The U.S. government is prepared to issue individuals wanted on felony charges a one-entry travel document to return home.”

U.S. authorities charged Snowden last month with theft, “unauthorized communication of national defense information” and “willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person.”

The charges were filed in federal court in Alexandria, whose jurisdiction includes the headquarters of contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, Snowden’s former employer. On Sunday, Assange argued that Snowden could not expect justice in that court.

“The jury pool is made up of the CIA, Pentagon, etc.,” Assange said. “There’s a . . . 99.97 percent chance that if you’re a target of the grand jury, you’ll be indicted. And a 99 percent chance that if you’re indicted by a grand jury, you will be convicted.”

Asked whether those statistics were correct, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney in that district declined to comment Sunday.

Assange was asked by Stephanopoulos whether WikiLeaks was in possession of other secrets that Snowden took with him.

“Look, there is no stopping the publishing process at this stage,” Assange said. “Great care has been taken to make sure that Mr. Snowden can’t be pressured by any state to stop the publication process.”

(CNN) —

If North Korea continues with its controversial missile and nuclear tests, it “will move closer” to its objective of reaching the United States with nuclear weapons, according to a Pentagon report.

During recent heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, Pyongyang repeatedly threatened the possibility of nuclear attacks against the United States and South Korea, prompting questions on the progress of its weapons program.

North Korea’s secretiveness has made it hard for Western intelligence agencies to gauge exactly what is going on inside its research facilities.

Many clues have come from the regime’s large-scale tests such as the long-range rocket launch in December and the underground nuclear detonation in February.

The Pentagon’s annual report to Congress on Thursday provided an overview of the military threat posed by North Korea, but it didn’t say how long it believed it would take the isolated, Stalinist state to develop a fully operational nuclear missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.

It described North Korea’s ballistic missile program as “ambitious” and said that “the pace of its progress will depend, in part, on how many resources it can dedicate to these efforts and how often it conducts tests.”

Doubts over North’s capabilities

A sign of differing views on North Korea’s nuclear missile capabilities among U.S. intelligence agencies emerged last month.

Addressing the House Armed Services Committee, a congressman read out an excerpt from a report by the Pentagon’s intelligence arm that said it believed with “moderate confidence” that the North had nuclear weapons that could be delivered by ballistic missiles, albeit with low “reliability.”

But after the disclosure of that assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), top U.S. officials including President Barack Obama said the U.S. government didn’t think North Korea was yet able to fit a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile.

The Pentagon report Thursday included no reference to the DIA excerpt, which didn’t specify the range of the ballistic missiles that it was talking about.

The report said that the type of long-range rocket that North Korea launched in December to put a satellite in orbit “could reach parts of the United States if configured as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of carrying a nuclear payload.”

But it noted that “a space launch does not test a re-entry vehicle (RV), without which North Korea cannot deliver a weapon to target from an ICBM.”

The December launch and the display in April 2012 of an untested but road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile help underscore “the threat to regional stability and U.S. national security posed by North Korea,” according to the report.

Like father, like son

Its authors said they didn’t expect much change under North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, from the strategy shaped by his father, Kim Jong Il, who died in December 2011.

The focus of that approach, they said, includes “coercive diplomacy to compel acceptance of its diplomatic, economic and security interests; development of strategic military capabilities to deter external attack;” and challenges to South Korea and the U.S.-South Korean alliance.

Under Kim Jong Un, North Korea has so far continued the pursuit of more advanced nuclear and missile technologies, which according to the report, the regime sees as “essential to its goals of survival, sovereignty and relevance.”

The long-range rocket launch in December and underground nuclear test in February prompted international condemnation and tougher U.N. sanctions. Those measures were followed by intensified threats from Pyongyang, during which the United States said it would deploy additional missile defenses on its West Coast.

The Pentagon report also highlighted the murkiness of the North’s decision-making processes – a particular concern during periods of heightened tensions like the past few months.

“Although North Korea is unlikely to attack on a scale that it assesses would risk the survival of its government by inviting overwhelming counterattacks by the ROK or the United States, we do not know how North Korea calculates this threshold of behavior,” the report said, using the abbreviated form of South Korea’s official name, the Republic of Korea.

“North Korea’s use of smallscale attacks and provocative acts leaves much room for miscalculation that could spiral into a larger conflict,” it said.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-slams-gop-focus-benghazi-politics-195951415.html,,[],Obama slams GOP focus on Benghazi as politics,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans pushed ahead Monday with their investigation of the deadly assault on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, last year as President Barack Obama asserted that GOP charges of a cover-up are baseless.

The latest Republican focus is the independent review that slammed the State Department for inadequate security at the installation before the twin nighttime attacks that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans on Sept. 11, 2012.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, asked the two authors of the investigation — veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering and retired Adm. Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — to meet privately with committee staff to answer questions about their review. Democrats countered that if Congress wants to talk to them, Issa should hold a full open hearing.

Republicans insist that the Obama administration misled Congress and the American people in the immediate aftermath of the attack, trying to play down an act of terrorism that would reflect poorly on Obama weeks before the 2012 presidential election.

Emails disclosed Friday showed that State Department and other senior administration officials pushed for references to prior warnings and al-Qaida to be deleted from the talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice five days after the attack. One email suggested that Congress could use those issues as ammunition against the State Department.

At a White House news conference, Obama dismissed the GOP focus on the talking points as a politically driven ""sideshow,"" pointing out that he said ""act of terror"" on Sept. 12 and the talking points assessment was similar to the daily presidential briefing he had received.

He also noted that Matt Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told Congress that Benghazi was a terrorist attack with potential links to al-Qaida three days after Rice's appearance on five Sunday talk shows.

Story continues

""So if this was some effort on our part to try to downplay what had happened or tamp it down, that would be a pretty odd thing that three days later we end up putting out all the information that in fact has now served as the basis for everybody recognizing that this was a terrorist attack and that it may have included elements that were planned by extremists inside of Libya,"" the president said. ""Who executes some sort of cover-up or effort to tamp things down for three days?""

While Obama did refer to Benghazi as an act of terror, the president also cited protests over an anti-Islamic video in several interviews days after the attack, as did Rice on several Sunday news shows. He said Monday that ""nobody understood exactly what was taking place during the course of those first few days.""

The emails comprising the inter-agency discussion on how to best describe the events in Benghazi were shared with Congress as a condition for allowing the nomination of John Brennan for CIA director to move forward.

The general counsel for the office of the Director of National Intelligence briefed members and staff from the Senate Intelligence panel and leadership on the emails on Feb. 15 at a session in which staff could take notes. A similar briefing took place on March 19 for the House Intelligence panel and leadership staff, according to a senior administration official.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the individual was not allow to publicly discuss the process.

New details on the emails emerged last week. Obama argued that lawmakers had reviewed them several months ago but suddenly they were treated as fresh revelations.

""There's no 'there' there,"" the president said.

At the State Department, spokeswoman Jen Psaki said her agency didn't review the talking points until the night of Friday, Sept. 14 — ""after the reference to al-Qaida had actually been removed.""

The succession of revisions to the talking points only partly backs up that statement. A sentence ascribing some of the blame for the attacks to al-Qaida was stricken at 4:42 p.m. on Sept. 14, according to documents published by ABC News. But a reference to previous attacks in the region by al-Qaida-linked extremists remained in the talking points at 6:52 p.m.

Former State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland then complained at 7:39 p.m. and the paragraph was eliminated in the next revision at 8:59 p.m.

Although the talking points were heavily edited, Rice still referred to al-Qaida and extremists when she appeared on the Sunday shows.

""It's clear that there were extremist elements that joined and escalated the violence; whether they were al-Qaida affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al-Qaida itself, I think, is one of the things we'll have to determine,"" she said.

Issa has argued that Congress needs to get the facts. He wants to hear from Pickering and Mullen about their investigation and he asked that they turn over documents, communications, lists of witnesses, notes and other material by Friday.

He pointed to the testimony of three State Department witnesses last week who criticized the Accountability Review Board's work as incomplete and flawed.

""The White House and the State Department have touted the ARB's report as the definitive account of how and why the Benghazi attacks occurred,"" Issa said in separate letters to Pickering and Mullen. ""It is necessary for the committee to understand whether the criticisms of the ARB's work that we heard from witnesses on May 8, 2013 are valid.""

But the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, told Issa that he should bypass private depositions from the two men and go directly to an open hearing on May 22. Issa said to Pickering and Mullen that they would work out a hearing for their public testimony at a later date.

Their blistering report found that ""systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels"" of the State Department meant that security was ""inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place."" They absolved former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, faulting lower level State Department officials.

Four State Department officials were reassigned or resigned in the wake of the Pickering-Mullen report.

""We knew where the responsibility rested,"" Pickering, a career Foreign Service officer who has worked for Republican and Democratic administrations, said Sunday.

For all the Washington furor, a Pew Research Center survey out Monday found the public paid limited attention to last week's House hearing in which a State Department official who was in Tripoli described his helplessness and frustration as the assault unfolded in Benghazi.

The survey found that 44 percent of Americans said they were following the hearings very or fairly closely, about the same percentage as in late January when Clinton testified on Capitol Hill. The number is down from the 61 percent who said they were following the initial stages of the investigation in October.

The survey of 1,000 adults found a split over whether the Obama administration is being honest about the attack and how Republicans are handling the issue, with partisanship affecting opinions. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.

The Arab Spring contributed by creating power vacuums for militant anti-Western jihadists to exploit. But myopic decision-making in Washington clearly played a huge role — and while I hope we’re getting smarter, I have my doubts.

President Obama’s decision to order the closure of U.S. outposts in much of the Muslim world drew rare bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committees underscoring the perceived gravity of the threat. Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) called it “the most serious threat that I’ve seen in the last several years.” Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.) said that “the administration’s call to close these embassies . . . was actually a very smart call.”

It’s hard to argue with prudent caution. At the same time, though, it’s hard to understand just how worried we should be. Osama bin Laden lies in a watery grave. His organization, once based in Afghanistan, is decimated. Regularly we hear news of someone described as an al-Qaeda lieutenant being blasted to his reward by a drone-fired missile. There is a disconnect between these successes and the need to close so many U.S. facilities — while issuing a general warning to travelers — in fear of another attack.

The truth is that U.S. foreign policy helped to create the decentralized al-Qaeda, a branch of which is believed to be trying to launch some kind of strike.

The most fateful choice, and the biggest strategic error, was the decision to invade Iraq. George W. Bush’s epic misadventure diverted resources and attention from the war in Afghanistan, giving a reprieve to the Taliban. The Iraq war also provided new focal points for jihadist grievance — Abu Ghraib, for example — and gave new oxygen to the simmering intra-Muslim conflict between Sunni and Shiite.

Al-Qaeda put down roots in chaotic Iraq. It did the same in lawless Yemen — home to the al-Qaeda “branch” or “affiliate” responsible for the current alert. While the original al-Qaeda may be moribund, its surviving leaders hiding in Afghanistan or Pakistan, terrorist groups bearing the name are trying their best to continue the fight.

First Bush and then Obama discovered the expediency of remotely piloted drone aircraft as instruments of war. Obama has waged what amounts to a campaign of targeted assassination, decimating the ranks of the various al-Qaeda branches. This strategy has the obvious merit of not putting American lives at risk. But the inevitable collateral damage — deaths of civilians, destruction of infrastructure — helps recruit new al-Qaeda conscripts.

The Arab Spring created opportunity for jihadists throughout the region. There is now an active al-Qaeda branch in Libya, where militants attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi in 2012. There is a branch that briefly occupied northern Mali before being pushed out by a French intervention. There is a branch fighting against the regime of Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war.

And if Egypt’s military rulers follow through with their crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood, it would not be surprising to see something like an al-Qaeda affiliate begin to emerge in the Arab world’s most populous nation, perhaps establishing a refuge in the largely ungoverned tribal lands of the Sinai Peninsula.

With a few exceptions — Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia — the Obama administration has tried to support popular movements and push hard for democracy. For his trouble, Obama is learning that no good deed goes unpunished. In Egypt, for example, the two sides agree on hardly anything except that they both feel betrayed by the United States.

My argument with Obama’s policies is not that the president has tried too hard to end the “war on terror,” as hawks allege. It’s that he hasn’t tried hard enough to leave behind the “war” metaphor as ill-suited to a struggle that is fundamentally ideological.

(CNN) —

Weeks after getting asylum in Russia, Edward Snowden now has a job there, one of his lawyers says.

Snowden, the U.S. national security contractor turned leaker, will start a job Friday with a major Russian website, his attorney Anatoly Kucherena told CNN Thursday.

Kucherena declined to name the employer for security reasons. He told Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti that Snowden would perform maintenance for the site.

Europe falls out of love with Obama over NSA spying claims

Snowden, a 30-year-old former government information technology contractor, collected information on spy programs – in which the National Security Agency mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the United States – and exposed the programs to the media.

Anticipating legal consequences, he fled to Hong Kong in late May and flew on June 23 to Moscow, where he holed up at the airport for more than five weeks.

U.S. authorities have charged him with espionage and theft of government property.

After Russia granted him an asylum term of one year on August 1, he left the airport.

As Snowden got ready to start his new job, he was also meeting Thursday with a German lawmaker who visited him in Russia.

Hans-Christian Stroebele, a well-known leftist legislator in Germany, met with Snowden in Moscow to invite him to testify before the German parliament.

According to Stroebele’s website, during their meeting, Snowden gave him a letter addressed to the German parliament and to the country’s attorney general.

Stroebele, a member of the Green party, tweeted a picture of himself with Snowden and said he would hold a news conference Friday to provide details about the letter’s contents.

The meeting comes amid outrage among many German leaders over claims that an NSA surveillance operation targeted German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone.

Germany’s Der Spiegel news magazine first reported the alleged operation, citing documents leaked by Snowden.

Stroebele sits on a parliamentary committee that monitors intelligence agencies.

So it made a certain amount of sense for Edward J. Snowden to announce over the weekend that he was the one who blew the whistle on the National Security Agency’s classified and extraordinarily broad surveillance program.

I mean, why spend sleepless nights worrying about being discovered when it’s just a matter of time? Might as well drop the veil and get on with the fight to stay out of jail.

Snowden has relocated to Hong Kong, hoping to avoid facing the music in the United States. He’s almost certain to be indicted for something; the documents he released to the Guardian newspaper in London and the Washington Post include a classified court order and two top secret PowerPoint decks. The Obama administration has already referred the case to the Justice Department, and a spokesman for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said, ominously, that “the intelligence community is currently reviewing the damage that has been done by these recent disclosures.”

Reaction has been predictably mixed and extreme, with Fox News analyst Ralph Peters calling for Snowden to be executed and previous national security whistle-blowers, Ellsberg included, practically calling for a statue to be erected in his honor. Some cyber civil libertarians argue that the revelations should cause heads to roll within the administration because they appear to have lied to Congress about the surveillance; the Electronic Frontier Federation wants Congress to appoint a blue-ribbon panel to “conduct a full, public investigation into the domestic surveillance of Americans by the intelligence communities ... [and] make changes in the law to stop the spying and ensure that it does not happen again.”

One interesting question, though, is whether Snowden is entitled to protection as a whistle-blower. The administration argues that its data-gathering efforts on phone networks and online have all fallen within the bounds of the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. In fact, the hoovering of data from phone companies has been done under the auspices of regular orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. If that’s true -- and granted, that’s a sizable “if” -- Snowden has disclosed things that the government has been doing legally.

On the other hand, it’s impossible to have a real discussion of the pros and cons of government data-mining if it’s all done in secret. President Obama has said we should have a national conversation about how to balance privacy and security, but the issue wouldn’t be on the table if not for Snowden.

“I am lifting the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen, so we can review them on a case-by-case basis,” Obama told an audience at the National Defense University during a major counterterrorism policy speech on May 23.

The president is standing by that announcement, even though Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen that U.S. intelligence officials say is now the greatest Al Qaeda threat to the U.S. homeland, was formed in part by several former Guantanamo Bay detainees who were released in 2006.

“A handful of former Gitmo detainees, primarily Saudi citizens, made their way across the border into Yemen and they joined AQ in Yemen,” according to AQAP expert Gregory Johnsen, author of “The Last Refuge: Yemen, Al Qaeda, and America’s War in Arabia.”

“It was that merger between people, former Gitmo detainees from Saudi Arabia and the AQ escapees in Yemen, that really formed AQAP, the group that announced itself in January 2009, and that's the group we know today as AQAP.”

The genesis of AQAP goes back to a prison break in Yemen in February 2006. That's when 23 Al Qaeda suspects, including Nasser Al Wuhayshi – who once served as Usama bin Laden’s secretary and whose communications with Ayman Zawahiri were intercepted by U.S. intelligence -- tunneled out of a maximum security prison in Sana’a, the capital of Yemen.

The prisoners tunneled their way out of their two-room prison cell into a neighboring mosque, where they dusted themselves off, said their morning prayers and walked out the front door to freedom.

Wuhayshi and several prisoners who had been released from Guantanamo Bay, including Said Al Shihri, who was killed by a U.S. drone earlier this year, formed AQAP officially in 2009.

On Aug. 1, just one day before this week's terror warning that led to the closure of the 19 embassies, Obama met Yemen's president at the White House.

Presidential spokesman Jay Carney told reporters then,“I think the lifting of the (detainee transfer) moratorium reflects a changing U.S. policy that reflects a changing Yemen.”

One thing that has not changed in Yemen is the strength of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

The recent spate of prison breaks across the Middle East and North Africa adds to U.S. official concerns, given that such escapes by Al Qaeda often lead to the formation of the next affiliate.

The first coordinated break occurred July 21 in Iraq at Abu Ghraib, where many of the most hardened Al Qaeda prisoners have been held since the U.S. military detained them during the Iraq war.

Attackers armed with rocket-propelled grenades pushed through the prison gates, breaching the exterior walls using car bombs. Some 500 convicts escaped. A second prison north of Baghdad was breached at about the same time.

Six days later, more than 1,000 inmates in Libya escaped from a Benghazi prison in an operation coordinated with gunmen from outside the prison walls. Many had been incarcerated on terrorism charges.

On July 30, Taliban fighters disguised as police and armed with bombs broke 250 prisoners out of a Pakistani jail.

“This is kind of classic Al Qaeda and we've seen this over and over again,” said terrorism expert James Carafano of the Heritage Institute. “When Al Qaeda finds a tactic that works, they go back to it again and again and again until they've perfected it.”"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/us/us-acknowledges-killing-4-americans-in-drone-strikes.html,2013-05-23 00:00:00,"['Charlie Savage', 'Peter Baker']",U.S. Acknowledges Killing 4 Americans in Drone Strikes,"Yet even as he moves the counterterrorism effort to a next stage, Mr. Obama plans to offer a robust defense of a continued role for targeted killings, a policy he has generally addressed only in passing or in interviews rather than in a comprehensive speech. A White House official said he “will discuss why the use of drone strikes is necessary, legal and just, while addressing the various issues raised by our use of targeted action.”

While Mr. Obama may not explicitly announce the shift in drones from the Central Intelligence Agency in his speech, since the agency’s operations remain formally classified, the change underscores a desire by the president and his advisers to balance them with other legal and diplomatic tools. The C.I.A., which has overseen the drone war in the tribal areas of Pakistan and elsewhere, will generally cede its role to the military after a six-month transition period as forces draw down in Afghanistan, officials said.

Drone strikes have already been decreasing in the past few years as targets have been killed and opposition has grown. John O. Brennan, the new C.I.A. director, has been eager to shift the agency more toward espionage, intelligence gathering and analysis and away from the paramilitary mission it has adopted since Sept. 11.

Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said that after more than a decade of war it was time to “rebalance” the missions of the Pentagon and C.I.A. “The policy is intended to refocus the activities of the intelligence community to collection, which is crucial,” he said.

But Mr. Obama’s moves may provoke criticism from some Republicans who say a law enforcement approach underestimates the continuing threat from terrorism. An aide to Representative Howard P. McKeon of California, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said his boss would insist on “concrete answers” about what Mr. Obama planned to do with “terrorists who are too dangerous to be released” from Guantánamo.

In his letter to Congressional leaders, Mr. Holder confirmed that the administration had deliberately killed Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical Muslim cleric who died in a drone strike in September 2011 in Yemen. Mr. Holder also wrote that United States forces had killed three other Americans who “were not specifically targeted.”

The American involvement in Mr. Awlaki’s death has been widely reported, but the administration until now had refused to confirm it. Likewise, Mr. Holder confirmed the government’s role in the deaths of Samir Khan, who was killed in the same strike, and Mr. Awlaki’s son, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, who died in another strike. The letter disclosed the death of a fourth American named Jude Kenan Mohammad but gave no further details."

Hicks also reported that SOCAFRICA commander Lt. Col. Gibson and his team were prepared to board a C130 from Tripoli before the attack on the Benghazi annex. Gibson received a call saying “you can’t go now, you don’t have the authority to go now.’ And so they missed the flight … They were told not to board the flight, so they missed it.”

If a force had left Tripoli to head to Benghazi, Hicks said it might have saved the the lives of Ty Woods and Glen Doherty. Instead the attacks went unchallenged. He went on to surmise that the Libyans “would have split. They would have been scared to death that we would have gotten a laser on them and killed them.”

Below is an excerpt of the Hicks’ testimony released from the House Oversight Committee:

Q: But do you think, you know, if an F-15, if the military had allowed a jet to go fly over, that it might have prevented [the second attack]?

A: Yeah, and if we had gotten clearance from the Libyan military for an American plane to fly over Libyan airspace. The Libyans that I talked to and the Libyans and other Americans who were involved in the war have told me also that Libyan revolutionaries were very cognizant of the impact that American and NATO airpower had with respect to their victory. They are under no illusions that American and NATO airpower won that war for them. And so, in my personal opinion, a fast-mover flying over Benghazi at some point, you know, as soon as possible might very well have prevented some of the bad things that happened that night.

Q : The theory being, the folks on the ground that are doing these — committing these terrorist attacks look up, see a heavy duty airplane above, and decide to hightail it?

A: I believe that if — I believe if we had been able to scramble a fighter or aircraft or two over Benghazi as quickly as possible after the attack commenced, I believe there would not have been a mortar attack on the annex in the morning because I believe the Libyans would have split. They would have been scared to death that we would have gotten a laser on them and killed them.

Q: I just wanted to ask, you mentioned permission from the Libyans. Why is that important? What did you mean by that?

A: Well, it’s their country. And for an American military aircraft to fly over their country, we have to have permission from them to do so.

Q: So what would have been the risk of — do you think it would have been risky for us to send someone, do you think it would have been counterproductive for us to send a fighter pilot plane over Benghazi without that permission?

A: We would have certainly wanted to obtain that permission. I believe we would have gotten it if we had asked. I believe that the Libyans were hoping that we were going to come bail them out of this mess. And, you know, they were as surprised as we were that American — the military forces that did arrive only arrived on the evening of September 12. Yeah.

Q: So, at this point [at approximately 10:00 pm in Tripoli], you are talking to Washington, you are talking to your RSO Martinec, you are talking to RAO. Are you talking to the Defense Attache?

A: The Defense Attache is there, and he is immediately on the phone to Ministry of Defense and to chief of staff of the Libyan Armed Forces. He also notifies Joint Staff and AFRICOM. Our SOCAFRICA lead, Lieutenant Colonel Gibson, connects with SOCAFRICA in Stuttgart, as well. And, obviously, RAO is also connected back home.

Q: Was there ever any thought at that time of the night to have an F-16, you know, fly over?

A: I called — when we knew that — I talked with the Defense Attache, Lt. Col. Keith Phillips, and I asked him, “Is there anything coming?” And he said that the nearest fighter planes were Aviano, that he had been told that it would take two to three hours to get them airborne, but that there were no tanker assets near enough to support a flight from Aviano.

A: And for the second time that night [Before 5:15 AM attack], I asked the Defense Attache, is there anything coming, is there anything out there to help our people from, you know, big military? And the answer, again, was the same as before.

Q: And what was that answer?

A: The answer was, it’s too far away, there are no tankers, there is nothing, there is nothing that could respond.

Q: So you had mentioned that the first team from Tripoli to Benghazi arrived at 1:15?

A: Right.

Q: And was there a second team that was organized? Could you tell us about the second team?

A: Right. The second team — the Defense Attache worked assiduously all night long to try to get the Libyan military to respond in some way. Early in the morning — sorry, after we were formally notified by the Prime Minister, who called me, that Chris had passed, the Libyan military agreed to fly their C-130 to Benghazi and carry additional personnel to Benghazi as reinforcements. Because we at that time — at that time, the third attack, the mortar attack at 5:15, had not yet occurred, if I remember correctly.

Q: So what time did the second rescue team ??

A: Well, again, they flew — I think that flight took off sometime between 6:00 and 6:30 a.m.

Q: At that point, you are the Chief of Mission?

A: Yeah, I’m Chief of Mission effective 3:00 a.m.

Q: Now, did any of the Special Forces folks, were they planning at any time to travel on that second aircraft?

A: On the second, on the C-130? Yes. We fully intended for those guys to go, because we had already essentially stripped ourselves of our security presence, or our security capability to the bare minimum …

A: So Lieutenant Colonel Gibson, who is the SOCAFRICA commander, his team, you know, they were on their way to the vehicles to go to the airport to get on the C-130 when he got a phone call from SOCAFRICA which said, you can’t go now, you don’t have authority to go now. And so they missed the flight. And, of course, this meant that one of the …

Q : They didn’t miss the flight. They were told not to board the flight.

A: They were told not to board the flight, so they missed it. So, anyway, and yeah. I still remember Colonel Gibson, he said, “I have never been so embarrassed in my life that a State Department officer has bigger balls than somebody in the military.” A nice compliment.

Q: Now, at this point, are you having communications with Washington?

A: I was in communications with Washington all night long. I was reporting all night long what was happening to Washington by telephone.

Q: When these Special Forces folks were told essentially to stand down, what was your next move? Did you have a recourse? Were you able to call Washington? Were you able to call anyone at this point to get that decision reversed?

A: No, because the flight was — the flight was leaving. And, you know, if they missed — you know, if the vehicles didn’t leave when they leave, they would miss the flight time at the airport. And the airport — you know, we were going all the way to Mitiga. The C-130 is at Mitiga, which is all the way on the other side of Tripoli.

Q: What was the rationale that you were given that they couldn’t go, ultimately?

A: I guess they just didn’t have the right authority from the right."

USA TODAY

Federal authorities filed the extradition request for Snowden on June 14

Snowden is charged with leaking classified information under the Espionage Act

A one-page criminal complaint against Snowden was unsealed Friday

The U.S. government has contacted authorities in Hong Kong to seek the extradition of Edward Snowden, the former government contractor accused of espionage for leaking classified information about two secret surveillance programs run by the National Security Agency.

A Justice Department official, who is not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed that the U.S. will seek to bring Snowden to the U.S., where he faces charges of theft and espionage. A criminal complaint was filed in the Eastern District of Virginia on June 14 and was unsealed Friday.

A senior administration official also not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY that the United States is asking Hong Kong to act quickly on the request or risk complicating relations between the two for failing to hand Snowden over as required by international law.

Snowden, who turned 30 on Friday, has been the focus of a criminal investigation since he acknowledged earlier this month that he was the source of materials detailing surveillance programs that collected telephone records for millions of Americans and a separate operation that targeted the Internet communications of non-citizens abroad who were suspected of terrorist connections.

Snowden, who was employed by Booz Allen Hamilton as an NSA systems analyst in Hawaii, fled to the Chinese territory of Hong Kong last month with top-secret documents and court orders on government surveillance operations.

A formal extradition request to bring Snowden to the United States from Hong Kong could drag through appeal courts for years and would pit Beijing against Washington at a time China is trying to deflect U.S. accusations that it carries out extensive surveillance on American government and commercial operations.

A one-page criminal complaint against Snowden was unsealed Friday in federal court in Alexandria, Va., part of the Eastern District of Virginia where his former employer, government contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, is headquartered, in McLean. He is charged with unauthorized communication of national defense information, willful communication of classified communications intelligence information and theft of government property. The first two are under the Espionage Act and each of the three crimes carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison on conviction.

The complaint is dated June 14, five days after Snowden's name first surfaced as the person who had leaked to the news media that the NSA, in two highly classified surveillance programs, gathered telephone and Internet records to ferret out terror plots.

Snowden told the South China Morning Post in an interview published Saturday on its website that he hoped to stay in the autonomous region of China because he has faith in ""the courts and people of Hong Kong to decide my fate.""

A prominent former politician in Hong Kong, Martin Lee, the founding chairman of the Democratic Party, said he doubted whether Beijing would intervene yet.

""Beijing would only intervene according to my understanding at the last stage. If the magistrate said there is enough to extradite, then Mr. Snowden can then appeal,"" he said.

Lee said Beijing could then decide at the end of the appeal process if it wanted Snowden extradited or not.

If formal extradition is pursued, Snowden could contest it on grounds of political persecution.

Hong Kong lawyer Mark Sutherland said that the filing of a refugee, torture or inhuman punishment claim acts as an automatic bar on any extradition proceedings until those claims can be assessed.

""Some asylum seekers came to Hong Kong 10 years ago and still haven't had their protection claims assessed,"" Sutherland said.

Hong Kong lawmakers said that the Chinese government should make the final decision on whether Snowden should be extradited to the United States.

Four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens, were killed in the assault by armed militants last September 11 in eastern Libya.

Programming note: Was there a political cover up surrounding the Benghazi attack that killed four Americans? Watch a CNN special investigation — The Truth About Benghazi, Tuesday at 10 p.m. ET.

Sources now tell CNN dozens of people working for the CIA were on the ground that night, and that the agency is going to great lengths to make sure whatever it was doing, remains a secret.

CNN has learned the CIA is involved in what one source calls an unprecedented attempt to keep the spy agency's Benghazi secrets from ever leaking out.



Read: Analysis: CIA role in Benghazi underreported

Since January, some CIA operatives involved in the agency's missions in Libya, have been subjected to frequent, even monthly polygraph examinations, according to a source with deep inside knowledge of the agency's workings.

The goal of the questioning, according to sources, is to find out if anyone is talking to the media or Congress.

It is being described as pure intimidation, with the threat that any unauthorized CIA employee who leaks information could face the end of his or her career.

In exclusive communications obtained by CNN, one insider writes, ""You don't jeopardize yourself, you jeopardize your family as well.""

Another says, ""You have no idea the amount of pressure being brought to bear on anyone with knowledge of this operation.""

""Agency employees typically are polygraphed every three to four years. Never more than that,"" said former CIA operative and CNN analyst Robert Baer.

In other words, the rate of the kind of polygraphs alleged by sources is rare.

""If somebody is being polygraphed every month, or every two months it's called an issue polygraph, and that means that the polygraph division suspects something, or they're looking for something, or they're on a fishing expedition. But it's absolutely not routine at all to be polygraphed monthly, or bi-monthly,"" said Baer.

CIA spokesman Dean Boyd asserted in a statement that the agency has been open with Congress.

""The CIA has worked closely with its oversight committees to provide them with an extraordinary amount of information related to the attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi,"" the statement said.

""CIA employees are always free to speak to Congress if they want,"" the statement continued. ""The CIA enabled all officers involved in Benghazi the opportunity to meet with Congress. We are not aware of any CIA employee who has experienced retaliation, including any non-routine security procedures, or who has been prevented from sharing a concern with Congress about the Benghazi incident.""

Among the many secrets still yet to be told about the Benghazi mission, is just how many Americans were there the night of the attack.

A source now tells CNN that number was 35, with as many as seven wounded, some seriously.

While it is still not known how many of them were CIA, a source tells CNN that 21 Americans were working in the building known as the annex, believed to be run by the agency.

The lack of information and pressure to silence CIA operatives is disturbing to U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, whose district includes CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

""I think it is a form of a cover-up, and I think it's an attempt to push it under the rug, and I think the American people are feeling the same way,"" said the Republican.

""We should have the people who were on the scene come in, testify under oath, do it publicly, and lay it out. And there really isn't any national security issue involved with regards to that,"" he said.

Wolf has repeatedly gone to the House floor, asking for a select committee to be set-up, a Watergate-style probe involving several intelligence committee investigators assigned to get to the bottom of the failures that took place in Benghazi, and find out just what the State Department and CIA were doing there.

More than 150 fellow Republican members of Congress have signed his request, and just this week eight Republicans sent a letter to the new head of the FBI, James Comey, asking that he brief Congress within 30 days.

Read: White House releases 100 pages of Benghazi e-mails

In the aftermath of the attack, Wolf said he was contacted by people closely tied with CIA operatives and contractors who wanted to talk.

Then suddenly, there was silence.

""Initially they were not afraid to come forward. They wanted the opportunity, and they wanted to be subpoenaed, because if you're subpoenaed, it sort of protects you, you're forced to come before Congress. Now that's all changed,"" said Wolf.

Lawmakers also want to know about the weapons in Libya, and what happened to them.

Speculation on Capitol Hill has included the possibility the U.S. agencies operating in Benghazi were secretly helping to move surface-to-air missiles out of Libya, through Turkey, and into the hands of Syrian rebels.

It is clear that two U.S. agencies were operating in Benghazi, one was the State Department, and the other was the CIA.

The State Department told CNN in an e-mail that it was only helping the new Libyan government destroy weapons deemed ""damaged, aged or too unsafe retain,"" and that it was not involved in any transfer of weapons to other countries.

But the State Department also clearly told CNN, they ""can't speak for any other agencies.""

The CIA would not comment on whether it was involved in the transfer of any weapons.

http://news.yahoo.com/obamas-syria-caution-shows-washington-uncertainty-170637867.html,,[],Obama's Syria caution shows Washington uncertainty,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama said Friday that any use of chemical weapons by Syria would be a ""game changer,"" but he cautioned that the United States needs more evidence that President Bashar Assad has used the deadly agents against his people.

""We cannot stand by and permit the systematic use of weapons like chemical weapons on civilian populations,"" Obama said in his first comments since the White House disclosed that U.S. intelligence indicates Syria probably has used chemical weapons.

However, the president said more evidence of such use was still needed, including when and how the deadly agents might have been used. He said the U.S., along with the United Nations, would seek to ""gather evidence on the ground"" in Syria to solidify intelligence assessments.

""This adds increased urgency to what already is a significant security and humanitarian problem in the region,"" he said from the Oval Office, where he was meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II.

The White House said on Thursday that the Syrian government probably had used chemical weapons, most likely the agent sarin, in the two-year civil war that has killed more than 70,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands more.

Obama's cautious response reflects a lack of agreement in Washington over aggressive military intervention. However, lawmakers in both parties also have expressed concern that inaction could embolden not only Assad but such countries as North Korea and Iran as well.

Obama has declared that the Assad government's use of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line"" for a major military response.

""For the Syrian government to utilize chemical weapons on its people crosses a line that will change my calculus and how the United States approaches these issues,"" the president said.

Emerging from a closed-door briefing with Secretary of State John Kerry on Capitol Hill, House Republicans and Democrats expressed uncertainty about the appropriate next step as the Obama administration considers limited military options.

Story continues

No lawmaker pressed for military invasion by the U.S., after more than 10 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.

""It is such a muddled picture,"" said Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. ""I think probably we should be asking the U.N. to be involved. I think perhaps that's in the making.""

Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, was among many lawmakers who called for a cautious approach to Syria even as they acknowledged the seriousness of the situation.

""We want to do everything we can to avoid putting boots on the ground,"" he told reporters. The U.S. should work with other countries to stabilize Syria and ensure its chemical weapons are kept out of the hands of terrorist groups, he said.

""I don't think that we, just as the United States, want to go in to another war,"" Ruppersberger said.

Obama's vow that Syria's use of chemical weapons would elicit a strong response and the administration's latest caution could raise questions about Obama's definition of a ""red line."" The U.S. credibility and international authority are on the line in the administration's handling of Syria, and the message it sends to Assad and other nations.

""There's no question that when the United States takes a position that this crosses a line that our failure to respond has implications,"" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""I think the president was saying the use of chemical weapons is a game changer. I think most people agree with that. So that if we in fact determine that chemical weapons were used, I think the expectation is that we and the coalition and others take some action.""

Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., wondered whether the red line is ""turning into a pink line.""

In Syria, officials rejected the U.S. intelligence assessment and denied that it had used chemical weapons.

Pressed on the response, State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said: ""If the regime has nothing to hide they should let the U.N. investigators in immediately so we can get to the bottom of this.""

The White House faces a limited choice of military options to help the rebels oust Assad.

Arming the rebels would run into several problems. For one, a military group fighting alongside them has pledged allegiance to al-Qaida. Also, establishing a no-fly zone poses a significant challenge, as Syria possesses an air defense system far more robust than the U.S. and its allies overwhelmed in Libya two years ago.

The next move on Syria was high on the agenda for Obama's meeting Friday with King Abdullah, as the U.S. ally has struggled with the influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees escaping the Syrian violence.

""I think it's important for the administration to look for ways to up the military pressure on Assad,"" said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Armed Services Committee.

One of the most powerful of the rebel groups in Syria is Jabhat al-Nusra, which recently declared its affiliation with al-Qaida. Last December, the State Department designated the group a terrorist organization, and the administration's opposition to directly arming the Syrian opposition stems from concerns about the weapons ending up in the hands of Islamic extremists.

Arming the rebels, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is a ""lot harder that it was before.""

""We've gotten to the point now where the opposition has been affected by the radicals,"" Graham said in an interview. ""Right weapons in right hands is the goal. The second war is coming. I think we can arm the right people with the right weapons. There's a risk there, but the risk of letting this go and chemical weapons falling into radical Islamists' hands is the greatest risk.""

Several lawmakers, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have called for the U.S. to create a narrow, safe zone inside Syria, along its border with Turkey.

Either a safe zone or a no-fly zone would require neutralizing Syria's air defenses. According to a report by the Institute for the Study of War, Syria's largely Soviet-era air defense system includes as many as 300 mobile surface-to-air missile systems and defense systems, and more than 600 static missile launchers and sites.

The U.S. has taken only minimal military steps so far, limiting U.S. assistance to nonlethal aid, including military-style equipment such as body armor and night vision goggles.

The U.S. has deployed about 200 troops to Jordan to assist that country's military, and participated in NATO's placement of Patriot missile batteries in Turkey near the border to protect against an attack from Syria.

U.S., Russia reach agreement on seizure of Syrian chemical weapons arsenal

GENEVA — The United States and Russia agreed Saturday on an outline for the identification and seizure of Syrian chemical weapons and said Syria must turn over an accounting of its arsenal within a week.

The agreement will be backed by a U.N. Security Council resolution that could allow for sanctions or other consequences if Syria fails to comply, Secretary of State John F. Kerry said.

Kerry said that the first international inspection of Syrian chemical weapons will take place by November, with destruction to begin next year.

Senior administration officials had said Friday the Obama administration would not press for U.N. authorization to use force against Syria if it reneges on any agreement to give up its chemical weapons.

The Russians had made clear in talks here between Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Kerry that the negotiations could not proceed under the threat of a U.N. resolution authorizing a military strike. Russia also wanted assurances that a resolution would not refer Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to the International Criminal Court for possible war-crimes prosecution.

President Obama has said that the unilateral U.S. use of force against Syria for a chemical attack last month remains on the table. But consideration of that action, already under challenge by a skeptical Congress, has been put on hold pending the outcome of the Geneva talks.

The discussions here began this week following a Russian proposal Monday, quickly agreed to by Assad, to place Syria’s chemical arsenal under international control and eventually destroy it.

Kerry and Lavrov, negotiating behind closed doors with teams of disarmament experts, have said little about the talks that began Thursday. But administration officials in Washington provided some details on the condition that they not be identified or quoted directly.

The officials insisted that any agreement must be verifiable and include consequences for non-compliance. Short of a threatened use of force, it is not clear what those consequences would be.

The question of U.N. authorization for using force in Syria came up less than 24 hours after the Russians first made their proposal. France quickly drafted a resolution that threatened to consider “further necessary measures” — code words for military force — if Syria makes a deal and then breaks it. The draft, negotiated with the United States and Britain, was met with public statements from Lavrov and Russian President Vladi­mir Putin that they would not negotiate under threat.

Washington and London have now backed off the use-of-force provision, and a revised French draft being circulated at the U.N. Security Council has weakened it. Instead, the draft calls for continuous review of “Syria’s compliance . . . and, if Syria does not comply fully, to impose further measures” that are unspecified.

The draft still includes a provision to refer Syrian authorities to the International Criminal Court, but that provision could also be removed in subsequent reworkings as the Geneva negotiations continue.

The senior officials said they expected a U.N. resolution in some form to pass within weeks of a Geneva agreement.

One possible course of action, they said, is the internationally verified transfer of Syria’s chemical stockpiles to Russia, where they eventually would be destroyed.

The Kerry-Lavrov discussions hit snags Friday over ways to ensure all chemical stockpiles are identified, an official familiar with the talks said, but a second official said the two sides were “coming closer to agreement.”

Meeting in Washington with Kuwaiti Emir Sabah Ahmed al-Sabah, Obama said he had told the visiting leader that he hopes the U.S.-Russian discussions “bear fruit.”

“But I repeated what I've said publicly, which is that any agreement needs to be verifiable and enforceable,” Obama said.

Both Kerry and Lavrov called the talks productive, and they will continue Saturday. And they agreed to meet in about two weeks when both will attend the U.N. General Assembly’s annual gathering in New York.

“Now that the Assad government has joined the Chemical Weapons Convention, we have to engage our professionals together” with U.N. officials, Lavrov said Friday, “to design a road which would make sure that this issue is resolved quickly, professionally, as soon as practical.”

Assad sent a letter Thursday to U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon saying that on Monday he will sign the international accord banning chemical weapons.

The Geneva talks are aimed at creating a blueprint for identifying and seizing chemical weapons that the United States claims the ruling Syrian government used to gas to death more than 1,400 people last month.

Kerry and Lavrov said successful diplomacy on chemical weapons could help revive negotiations they jointly proposed months ago between the Syrian government and the opposition fighting to unseat Assad.

A possible follow-up peace conference “will obviously depend on the capacity to have success here,” Kerry said after he and Lavrov met Friday morning with Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N. and Arab League envoy to Syria.

Syria, which is not a party to the Geneva talks, denied until this week that it had chemical weapons. Under Russian pressure, Assad agreed to acknowledge the stockpiles and join the international weapons ban. Both Syria and Russia have said that the Aug. 21 attack, in the eastern suburbs of Damascus, was carried out by rebels, not the government.

The site of the attack was visited last month by U.N. investigators who are due to brief Ban on their findings Sunday. Ban told a gathering of women’s groups Friday that the inspectors have obtained “overwhelming” evidence that the attack took place, according to a U.N.-based diplomat.

“I believe that the report will be an overwhelming report that chemical weapons were used, even though I cannot say it publicly at this time,” Ban said in comments he apparently thought were confidential but that were captured on an internal television feed.

Ban did not say who was responsible for using chemical weapons or what nerve agent was used.

But the diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the unreleased results, said that “the report will clearly say it is sarin” gas and that “it clearly hints that the regime is the perpetrator.”

Ban is scheduled to present the findings to the Security Council on Monday.

Even supporters of military action say debate in Congress will be tough

White House has already begun campaign%2C briefing lawmakers Sunday

Secretary of State Kerry says he does not believe Congress will vote %27no%27

WASHINGTON — Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday he does not believe Congress will reject military action against Syria, but lawmakers are making it clear that the vote will not be easy and the outcome is not assured.

President Obama announced Saturday that he believes the United States should launch a military attack on Syria in response to an alleged Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus. But he said he would first seek approval from Congress for use of military force.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press that he thinks the Senate ""will rubber-stamp what (Obama) wants, but I think the House will be a much closer vote."" Paul said he believes ""it's at least 50-50 whether the House will vote down involvement in the Syrian war.""

Paul, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said it's not clear whether American interests are at stake in Syria, or whether opponents of the Assad regime would be any more friendly to the United States.

Paul recalled that Kerry said during the Vietnam War, ""How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?""

""I would ask, 'How do you ask a man to be the first to die for a mistake?'"" Paul said. ""I'm not sending my son, your son or anybody else's son to fight for a stalemate.""

Paul said he was ""proud"" of Obama for following the Constitution and asking for congressional support. But he said the president made a ""grave mistake"" in setting a ""red line."" Obama's push for military action, he said, is an effort to ""save face and add bad policy to bad policy.""

Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the president may have trouble winning the backing of Congress.

King, appearing on Fox News Sunday, said, ""I think it is going to be difficult,"" noting that there is an ""isolationist"" tendency in the Republican Party.

Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said he believes ""at the end of the day, Congress will rise to the occasion,"" but he also said, ""it's going to take that healthy debate to get there.""

But Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., told Fox News Sunday that he didn't think Congress would approve a war resolution. He said budget cuts have rendered U.S. forces ""degraded and unready.""

Several lawmakers raised objections to military action in the hours after Obama announced he will ask Congress to approve the use of force.

Rep. Chris Gibson, R-N.Y., an Army veteran with multiple foreign deployments, said Saturday, ""I hope my colleagues will fully think through the weightiness of this decision and reject military action. The situation on the ground in Syria is tragic and deeply saddening, but escalating the conflict and Americanizing the Syrian civil war will not resolve the matter.""

Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said, ""The apparent chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime is an appalling, unconscionable act by a bloodthirsty tyrant. The 'limited' military response supported by President Obama, however, shows no clear goal, strategy, or any coherence whatsoever, and is supported neither by myself nor the American people.""

Opposition to the use of force is not limited to the Republican Party. Democrat Betty McCollum, D-Minn., said in a statement: ""Unilateral U.S. military action against the Syrian regime at this time would do nothing to advance American interests, but would certainly fuel extremist groups on both sides of the conflict that are determined to expand the bloodshed beyond Syria's borders.""

While Congress remains on recess, the White House has begun its campaign to sway opinions, holding a classified briefing for lawmakers Sunday to show them evidence against the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad.

""We're not going to lose this vote,"" Kerry said Sunday on ABC's This Week With George Stephanopoulos.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Fox News on Sunday that he had “never been more worried about national security” and called the president “tone deaf” on the issue.

“I see a big difference between the president saying the war’s at an end and whether or not you’ve won the war,” said Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.). “We have still tremendous threats out there, that are building — not declining, building — and to not recognize that, I think, is dangerous in the long run and dangerous for the world.”

Democrats such as Sen. Charles Schumer of New York defended the President’s anti-terrorism policy, contending that the revised approach would address concerns about the lack of transparency in the deployment of drones without sacrificing security.

“There are new types of threats that we have to be vigilant about. But he said, under this long-term war on terror, where small groups of individuals can hurt us, we need some rules,” Schumer said. “We need some rules, we need some transparency, so American citizens and the citizens of the world know we’re not just going willy-nilly. Having transparency, having rules and engaging other activities other than military to help curb the war on terror — diplomacy, economic sanctions and things like that — is going to be useful as well.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has bucked his party’s support of wide-ranging drone strikes, in March leading a filibuster in the Senate over concerns that the government could kill U.S. citizens with drone strikes without giving them due process.

On ABC’s “This Week,” Paul said that the president’s pivot on drone strikes did not satisfy his qualms. “Due process to most of us is a court of law. It’s a trial by a jury,” Paul said. “And right now their process is him looking at some flashcards and a PowerPoint presentation on ‘Terror Tuesdays’ in the White House. For a lot of us, that’s not really due process.”

Guests on the Sunday talk shows spoke of the various scandals that buffeted the Obama administration this week, including the Internal Revenue Service’s greater scrutiny of conservative nonprofits and the Justice Department’s wiretapping of journalists to whom administration officials had leaked national security information. The only issue that seemed to escape partisanship on the Sunday shows was sexual assault in the military, after disturbing news in recent weeks from all branches of the armed forces. Guests on the talk shows from both parties commended Obama for bringing up the issue at the Naval Academy graduation last week and agreed that strong steps needed to be taken against offenders."

(CNN) —

Among the most enduring urban legends about high-level policy-making in the U.S. government is the proverbial memo with three options: 1. do nothing; 2. do everything; 3. find a middle ground and muddle through.

And yet in truth, Barack Obama really does have only three options in Syria. It appears that the president, rightly the avoider-in-chief when it comes to Syria, has chosen option three, the least bad alternative. And here’s why.

Do nothing

Courtesy Aaron Miller Aaron David Miller

This isn’t really an option. Forget the fact that the president a year ago drew his own red line against Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons. Disregard the reality that this is reportedly the largest single deployment of chemical weapons since Saddam Hussein used them against the Kurds in 1988; dismiss the fact that 100,000 Syrians have died in this civil conflict; and the president is accused of fiddling, Nero-like, while Syria burns.

Just focus on the events of the past five days in Washington. What has been emanating from administration officials both on and off the record is the most well-advertised and telegraphed military action in the history of modern warfare. Rarely do we get this kind of preview of the operation, its size and character.

Combine that with the Secretary of State John Kerry’s brief but powerful statement of moral outrage the other day and the president’s PBS interview, and you get as authoritative a commitment to strike as is humanly imaginable.

Indeed, forceful statements and actions of the past few days have now constituted their own red line. And if the president doesn’t enforce it, he will be truly damaged goods when it comes to foreign policy for the remainder of his term.

Neither his regional allies (Israel and the Saudis) nor his adversaries (Iran, Hezbollah, Russia) will find him credible or believable. As it is now, everyone says no to the U.S. without much cost or consequence.

Do everything

From the beginning, Sens. John McCain and Lindsay Graham and a whole host of liberal interventionists and neoconservatives outside the government have repeatedly called for a more robust policy on Syria, even suggesting that the president, by not acting sooner, enabled all of this misery to unfold. Syria, the president’s critics maintain, is a major threat to U.S. interests – and to our allies in the region – and only a takedown of the al-Assad regime through supporting the opposition and direct application of U.S. military power will begin to address the problem.

The argument has not called for boots on the ground but for extensive use of no-fly zones, the use of U.S. air and missile power to degrade the regime and military support for the opposition.

President Obama has wisely and willfully avoided this approach. And he continues to avoid it now. The reason has to do with the general problem of an open-ended military commitment and the lack of correlation between the use of U.S. military power and its relation to the end state.

Syria is in the throes of a brutal civil war. The opposition is composed of more than 1,000 disparate rebel groups, the most effective allied with al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists. A victory of the latter would be a blow to U.S. interests. Ousting al-Assad won’t be cheap or easy. It took eight months to get rid of Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi, and he had no weapons of mass destruction, no serious air defenses or military capacity and no credible allies. And look at the end result: a post-Gadhafi environment in which there are too many guns, grievances and regional rivalries and no credible central authority.

And Libya pales in comparison with Syria’s complexities. Devising a serious military strategy to get rid of al-Assad – serious weapons for the rebels; no-fly or -drive zones; and sustained air/missile strikes against Syrian military units, infrastructure and leadership targets – also means U.S. responsibility for what follows. Barack Obama has avoided this option because he rightly doesn’t want America getting stuck with the check for Syria.

Muddle through

The option the U.S. is likely to undertake – focused more narrowly on trying to deter the Syrians from using chemical weapons again and degrading al-Assad’s military capacity in the process – is far from ideal. Although I think the administration’s military actions will be far more devastating than the limited strikes being talked about, it is unlikely to change the arc of the battlefield balance.

There are other downsides, too. Once the glass ceiling against the use of force is broken, the expectations and pressures to use it again will grow. There’s always the danger too of a response by Hezbollah or Syria against Israel, however unlikely. And sooner or later, al-Assad will commit some other horror that will require another U.S. response. This kind of episodic intervention without a real strategy can undermine American credibility, too.

To be sure, there are real risks in acting on option three, and Obama most assuredly is a reluctant warrior. Indeed, in view of the parliamentary opposition to British Prime Minister David Cameron’s willingness to join the U.S., he may be a lonely warrior, too. But he’s going to war with Syria nonetheless. Al-Assad’s apparent use of chemical weapons, the president’s own words and those of others in his administration leave him no other choice.

President announced the withdrawal in his State of the Union speech

It will reduce the American military presence in Afghanistan by about half

Reductions will continue through the end of 2014 as Afghans take responsibility for their own security

WASHINGTON -- President Obama's decision to reduce troop levels in Afghanistan by 34,000 by this time next year still gives the coalition enough muscle to support Afghan security forces as they battle through another fighting season this summer while staying on track to wrap up the combat mission in two years, military officials and analysts say.

Obama announced his plan Tuesday night during his State of the Union speech before a joint session of Congress.

""Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan,"" Obama said. ""This drawdown will continue. And by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over.""

The plan allows for leaving about 50,000 U.S. troops through November, said Mark Jacobson, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund and former deputy NATO civilian representative in Afghanistan. Jacobson attended a briefing Tuesday with senior White House officials. Steeper declines will come after that, leaving about 32,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan next February.

""This is not a dramatic decrease,"" Jacobson said.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in a statement the troop withdrawal plan was based on a recommendation from Marine Gen. John Allen, who just relinquished command of coalition forces in Afghanistan.

The 34,000-troop withdrawal is the latest phase in a transition plan that the United States, Afghanistan and allies developed at recent NATO summits in Lisbon, Portugal, and Chicago.

The number of U.S. troops has already declined from a high of about 100,000 in 2010 to 66,000 now.

This year's fighting season is expected to be a critical test for Afghan security forces, who are leading most combat operations now.

""Mullah Omar has decreed that he wants to make 2013 an intense year,"" said Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, referring to a statement from the Taliban leader.

This year is different in that the intensity will be aimed at Afghan security forces, Dempsey said over the weekend. Afghan forces are now leading 90% of the operations and taking the bulk of the casualties.

""What really hangs in the balance now is the confidence level of the Afghan security forces and its people in them,"" Dempsey said on his way to Afghanistan to attend the change of command ceremony where Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford assumed command from Allen.

The challenge for the United States is to withdraw U.S. forces without appearing to abandon Afghanistan.

The withdrawal of troops from the Soviet Union in 1989 led to the collapse of Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government by 1992, an event that casts a dark shadow over recent Afghan history.

The United States and its allies have pledged to support Afghanistan's economy and help fund its security forces after most combat forces withdraw.

The president did not provide numbers for any kind of residual force after 2014, a topic that remains subject to negotiations with Afghanistan.

But officials said America will stay engaged. The United States ""will maintain a long-term commitment to Afghanistan ­ including through the continued training and equipping of Afghan forces and counter-terrorism operations against al Qaeda and their affiliates,"" Panetta said in the statement.

The Pentagon has said the functions of U.S. forces after 2014 will center on a counter-terrorism mission focused on al-Qaeda and other global threats and advising and supporting Afghan security forces."

Russia opposes Obama decision to arm Syrian rebels

Vladimir Putin meets with Obama at summit

Russian President Vladimir Putin told President Barack Obama in a meeting of top nations Monday that he does not agree with his decision to provide military aid to Syrian rebels but supports negotiations to end Syria's civil war.

Speaking after talks with Putin, Obama acknowledged in a bilateral meeting with Putin in Northern Ireland that they have a ""different perspective"" on Syria but he said that both leaders wanted to address the fierce fighting and also wanted to secure chemical weapons in the country.

Obama and Putin met on Syria while attending the G-8 summit of industrialized nations in Northern Ireland. Obama said both sides would work to develop talks in Geneva aimed at ending the country's bloody civil war.

""We do have differing perspectives on the problem but we share an interest in reducing the violence, securing chemical weapons and ensuring that they're neither used nor are they subject to proliferation,"" Obama said. ""We want to try to resolve the issue through political means if possible.""

Putin said ""of course our opinions do not coincide, but all of us have the intention to stop the violence in Syria and to stop the growth of victims and to solve the situation peacefully, including by bringing the parties to the negotiations table in Geneva.""

Russia is backing Syrian dictator Bashar Assad with arms and heavy weaponry that have been used to crush rebel advances. Obama announced last week he would assist the rebels because of Assad's use of chemical weapons against them.

Analysts say a major breakthrough on what action to take in the civil-war torn country is unlikely.

""I don't expect a major breakthrough on Syria, even though both camps will likely stress their common interests, their preference for a political solution ... and the need for a peace conference,"" said Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Centre at the London School of Economics.

Seven of the G-8 nations support the rebels and say Assad must go. Putin accused British Prime Minister David Cameron on Sunday of betraying humanitarian values by supporting Syrian rebels with ""blood on their hands.""

Russia and the West have long been at odds over Syria. As the violence continues to escalate in the region, Putin expressed anger at the U.S. commitment to supply small arms and ammunition to rebels as a result of the U.S. saying there was proof Assad's regime had used chemical weapons on its citizens.

Putin described Assad's government as ""the legitimate government of Syria in full conformity with the norms of international law.""

Moscow continues to stick to the principle of non-interference in what it calls Syria's ""internal affairs,"" a position it has held since the beginning of the uprising, said Anna Borshchevskaya, a fellow at the European Foundation for Democracy.

""Russia has too much vested in the current Syrian regime to let it go. Moscow still views Assad as perhaps its closest Arab ally in the Middle East, with deep cultural, historical, and business connections between the two,"" she said.

The United States vowed at the outbreak of the conflict in March 2011 that it would not intervene in Syria as it had in Libya, but made a statement in August of last year that if the regime used chemical weapons, it would cross a ""red line"" that could force the U.S. to change its position.

News of chemical weapons attacks carried out by Assad's regime surfaced in April, with France and Israel saying reports of dozens being killed appeared to be credible. The Syrian government's armed forces have launched 13 such attacks targeting Homs, Aleppo, Damascus and Idlib and killing 57 people, according to a report published June 15 by the Syrian Network for Human rights.

The Free Syrian Army (FSA) welcomed the U.S. decision to provide more military aid but said it needed larger weapons.

""The weapons we require above all are anti-aircraft and anti-shield weapons, so that we can stop the air force and stop the regime and Hezbollah from advancing,"" said Fahed Al-Masri, media officer for the FSA's joint command in Paris.

The FSA also called for western powers to create a no-fly-zone.

""We encourage the American administration and the European Union to decide on a no-fly-zone to protect defenseless civilians from the regime's daily bombings with rockets and aircraft,"" Louai Mikdad, spokesman for FSA general staff in Turkey, told USA TODAY.

In an interview with the German daily newspaper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, published online on Monday, Assad said the Syrian army is fighting terrorists and Europe will pay the price if it decides to deliver weapons to these terrorists.

""If the Europeans deliver weapons, Europe's own back yard will have terrorism and Europe will pay the price for this … The second consequence is that it would deliver terrorism to Europe,"" he said. ""Terrorists will gain battle experience and will come back with extremist ideologies. For Europe, there is no alternative but to cooperate with the Syrian state, even if it doesn't like this.""

As well as Syria, economic issues are also expected to be discussed at the two-day summit, which includes leaders from France, Germany and the U.K.

Early Monday, Obama called peace in Northern Ireland a ""blueprint"" for those living amid conflict around the world, while acknowledging that the calm between Catholics and Protestants will face further tests. Summoning young people to take responsibility for their country's future, Obama warned there is ""more to lose now than there's ever been.""

""The terms of peace may be negotiated by political leaders, but the fate of peace is up to each of us,"" Obama said Monday during remarks at Belfast's Waterfront Hall to 1,800 students and adults. The glass-fronted building would never have been built during the city's long era of car bombs.

Significant progress has been made in the 15 years since the U.S.-brokered Good Friday Accords, including a Catholic-Protestant government and the disarmament of the IRA and outlawed Protestant groups responsible for most of the 3,700 death toll. But tearing down Belfast's nearly 100 ""peace lines"" — barricades of brick, steel and barbed wire that divide neighborhoods, roads and even one Belfast playground — is still seen by many as too dangerous.

First lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha, who also made the trip from Washington, were to spend Monday and Tuesday in Dublin while the president attended the G-8 summit. Later Tuesday, the first family departs for Germany, where the president will meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel and speak at the Brandenburg Gate.

She Joined The Paper In']",Kerry steadfast on Iran talks despite Khamenei’s harsh words for Israel,"The Obama administration brushed off harsh criticism of Israel from Iran’s supreme leader Wednesday and insisted a proposed deal to curb Iran’s disputed nuclear program is not the trap Israel fears.

“We have the best chance we’ve had in a decade, we believe, to halt progress and roll back Iran’s program,” Secretary of State John F. Kerry said in Washington as U.S. and other negotiators began a new round of talks meant to clinch an interim agreement with Iran.

“We will not allow this agreement, should it be reached — and I say should it be reached — to buy time” for Iran or fall short of “our core fundamental concerns,” Kerry said.

He spoke hours after Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, referred to Israel as the warmongering “rabid dog” of the Middle East during a speech to military commanders in Tehran.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has waged a public lobbying effort against the draft deal, calling it a sham that rewards Iran without preventing it from producing a nuclear weapon.

Unable to persuade Washington to delay the latest round of talks, Netanyahu went to Russia on Wednesday seeking stronger limits on Iran.

Talks in Geneva convened with a senior U.S. negotiator telling reporters it will be difficult but not impossible to reach a deal.

“Whether we will, we will have to see, because it is hard,” the official said. “If it was easy to do, it would have been done a long time ago.”

Western governments suspect Iran has pursued a covert goal of enriching enough uranium to produce weapons on demand. Iran denies any weapons ambitions and claims it must continue to enrich uranium for peaceful energy uses.

A deal to satisfy international doubts about Iran’s program will turn largely on whether it can limit Iranian uranium enrichment to levels far below those used to make weapons. Negotiators are also seeking new controls on an Iranian plutonium reactor.

In return, world powers would first loosen and eventually lift some economic sanctions imposed over the decade Iran has defied international demands to roll back its program and provide more information.

Although Iran has long insisted on its right to enrich uranium on its own soil, the proposed deal is expected to fudge that point while stressing Iran’s right to peaceful nuclear energy.

“Whatever a country decides or doesn’t decide to do or is allowed to do and permitted under the rules depends on a negotiation,” Kerry said at a news conference with Australian officials.

“I’m not going to predetermine its outcome except to say to you that no right is recognized or granted within anything that I’ve seen in the early discussions,” he said.

The United States and other world powers had hoped to seal a deal earlier this month. Those talks broke up after disagreement first among the powers talking to Iran and then with Iran accusing France of torpedoing the deal.

Khamenei criticized France on Wednesday and vowed that Iran will not give up what he called its nuclear rights. He said he had set ""red lines” for his negotiators and blamed Israel for stoking animosity around the talks.

“The real threats to the world are evil powers including the Zionist regime and its supporters,” Khamenei said.

“The Zionist regime is doomed to destruction, because this despicable regime was formed by power and imposed on the world, and nothing which is imposed will last,” he said.

The strong anti-Israel language may have been chiefly intended to reassure hard-liners at home, but it contrasts with the friendlier face presented by President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as they sought direct negotiations and a rollback of stringent international economic sanctions.

The president nominated former Sen. Chuck Hagel for defense secretary and White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan for CIA director. The president touted the credentials and years of service each would bring to their respective posts.

On Hagel, Obama said the troops would ""see one of their own"" at the helm of the Pentagon. Hagel is a Vietnam combat veteran, and the president stressed that Hagel would be the first Vietnam vet to lead the department if confirmed.

""Chuck Hagel is the leader that our troops deserve. He is an American patriot,"" the president said.

Yet each nominee is poised to attract tough bipartisan criticism -- and perhaps opposition -- during the confirmation process. While Obama went the relatively safe route with his pick for secretary of state, tapping Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, his choices for his national security team could cause a ruckus on Capitol Hill.

More On This... A look at former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel as nominee to become the next defense secretary

On Sunday, several Republican senators suggested they would have problems with Hagel, while Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he is reserving judgment. Republicans question Hagel's commitment to Israel and his toughness when it comes to Iran. But Hagel also has come under fire from gay rights groups for saying in 1998 that a nominee for an ambassador post was ""openly, aggressively gay.""

He has since apologized for those comments. Gay rights group GetEQUAL, though, panned the apology as ""hollow"" and ""politically expedient.""

Texas Sen. John Cornyn had the most strident remarks, saying Obama nominating Hagel sends ""the worst possible message"" to Israel and other U.S. allies in the Middle East, citing in part Hagel's views on Israel and his opposition to Iranian sanctions. He did not say whether he would try to block Hagel's potential nomination during a Senate confirmation hearing.

Hagel would replace Pentagon chief Leon Panetta in Obama's second-term Cabinet.

Newly-elected Texas Sen. Ted Cruz also told ""Fox News Sunday"" that ""it is very difficult to imagine the circumstance in which I could support his confirmation.""

Other lawmakers and groups, though, described Hagel as a solid pick. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., described him as a ""strong advocate for the men and women of our military.""

Veterans of Foreign Wars, without recommending whether he should be confirmed, called him ""uniquely qualified.""

Hagel, a 66-year-old moderate Nebraska Republican, has criticized discussion of a military strike by either the U.S. or Israel against Iran. He also irritated some Israel backers with his reference to the ""Jewish lobby"" in the United States. And he has backed efforts to bring Iran to the table for future peace talks in Afghanistan.

McConnell told ABC's ""This Week"" that Hagel has ""certainly been outspoken in foreign policy and defense over the years. The question we will be answering, if he's the nominee, is do his views make sense for that particular job?""

""This is a controversial pick,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told CNN. ""He is an antagonistic figure when it comes to the state of Israel. It's a signal you're sending to Iran at the worst possible time and to our allies.""

Officials close to the White House have talked up Hagel as a patriot who served in the military with distinction during Vietnam and someone who shares the president's skepticism about potential conflict with Iran and a large U.S. footprint in Afghanistan.

Brennan, meanwhile, is a 25-year CIA veteran who, during the George W. Bush administration, served as director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Despite his credentials, Brennan has faced criticism from both sides of the aisle, as well.

In 2008, he removed his name from consideration for the CIA's top job amid concerns on the left about his connection to enhanced interrogation techniques.

In a letter to Obama at the time, Brennan said he was ""a strong opponent of many of the policies of the Bush administration, such as the preemptive war in Iraq and coercive interrogation tactics, to include waterboarding."" White House officials say they don't expect Brennan to face similar trouble this time around given his four years of service in the Obama administration.

""The issue has been removed from the debate because the president and John Brennan, as his top counterterrorism adviser, brought those techniques to an end,"" Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said.

Brennan, though, also has defended the legality of the U.S. drone program, another issue that could come up during confirmation. And following the 2009 Christmas Day bombing attempt, Brennan agitated Republican lawmakers by defending the decision to read the bombing suspect his Miranda rights.

If confirmed, Brennan will succeed David Petraeus, who resigned in November after admitting to an affair with his biographer.

The Obama administration defends Brennan as a candidate with deep knowledge of the CIA's inner workings, and notes he has been on the front lines for more than a decade in the fight against Al Qaeda -- including involvement in the decision to launch the raid against Usama bin Laden.

Story highlights Aaron Miller says President Obama seems to be leaning to the least bad option in Syria He says limited strike may be risky but less so than doing nothing or trying for regime change Miller: If Obama doesn't act after large chemical weapons attack, he'll be written off as ineffective

(CNN) —

Among the most enduring urban legends about high-level policy-making in the U.S. government is the proverbial memo with three options: 1. do nothing; 2. do everything; 3. find a middle ground and muddle through.

And yet in truth, Barack Obama really does have only three options in Syria. It appears that the president, rightly the avoider-in-chief when it comes to Syria, has chosen option three, the least bad alternative. And here’s why.

Do nothing

Courtesy Aaron Miller Aaron David Miller

This isn’t really an option. Forget the fact that the president a year ago drew his own red line against Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons. Disregard the reality that this is reportedly the largest single deployment of chemical weapons since Saddam Hussein used them against the Kurds in 1988; dismiss the fact that 100,000 Syrians have died in this civil conflict; and the president is accused of fiddling, Nero-like, while Syria burns.

Just focus on the events of the past five days in Washington. What has been emanating from administration officials both on and off the record is the most well-advertised and telegraphed military action in the history of modern warfare. Rarely do we get this kind of preview of the operation, its size and character.

Combine that with the Secretary of State John Kerry’s brief but powerful statement of moral outrage the other day and the president’s PBS interview, and you get as authoritative a commitment to strike as is humanly imaginable.

Indeed, forceful statements and actions of the past few days have now constituted their own red line. And if the president doesn’t enforce it, he will be truly damaged goods when it comes to foreign policy for the remainder of his term.

Neither his regional allies (Israel and the Saudis) nor his adversaries (Iran, Hezbollah, Russia) will find him credible or believable. As it is now, everyone says no to the U.S. without much cost or consequence.

Do everything

From the beginning, Sens. John McCain and Lindsay Graham and a whole host of liberal interventionists and neoconservatives outside the government have repeatedly called for a more robust policy on Syria, even suggesting that the president, by not acting sooner, enabled all of this misery to unfold. Syria, the president’s critics maintain, is a major threat to U.S. interests – and to our allies in the region – and only a takedown of the al-Assad regime through supporting the opposition and direct application of U.S. military power will begin to address the problem.

The argument has not called for boots on the ground but for extensive use of no-fly zones, the use of U.S. air and missile power to degrade the regime and military support for the opposition.

President Obama has wisely and willfully avoided this approach. And he continues to avoid it now. The reason has to do with the general problem of an open-ended military commitment and the lack of correlation between the use of U.S. military power and its relation to the end state.

Syria is in the throes of a brutal civil war. The opposition is composed of more than 1,000 disparate rebel groups, the most effective allied with al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists. A victory of the latter would be a blow to U.S. interests. Ousting al-Assad won’t be cheap or easy. It took eight months to get rid of Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi, and he had no weapons of mass destruction, no serious air defenses or military capacity and no credible allies. And look at the end result: a post-Gadhafi environment in which there are too many guns, grievances and regional rivalries and no credible central authority.

And Libya pales in comparison with Syria’s complexities. Devising a serious military strategy to get rid of al-Assad – serious weapons for the rebels; no-fly or -drive zones; and sustained air/missile strikes against Syrian military units, infrastructure and leadership targets – also means U.S. responsibility for what follows. Barack Obama has avoided this option because he rightly doesn’t want America getting stuck with the check for Syria.

Muddle through

The option the U.S. is likely to undertake – focused more narrowly on trying to deter the Syrians from using chemical weapons again and degrading al-Assad’s military capacity in the process – is far from ideal. Although I think the administration’s military actions will be far more devastating than the limited strikes being talked about, it is unlikely to change the arc of the battlefield balance.

There are other downsides, too. Once the glass ceiling against the use of force is broken, the expectations and pressures to use it again will grow. There’s always the danger too of a response by Hezbollah or Syria against Israel, however unlikely. And sooner or later, al-Assad will commit some other horror that will require another U.S. response. This kind of episodic intervention without a real strategy can undermine American credibility, too.

To be sure, there are real risks in acting on option three, and Obama most assuredly is a reluctant warrior. Indeed, in view of the parliamentary opposition to British Prime Minister David Cameron’s willingness to join the U.S., he may be a lonely warrior, too. But he’s going to war with Syria nonetheless. Al-Assad’s apparent use of chemical weapons, the president’s own words and those of others in his administration leave him no other choice.

Top administration officials including National Security Advisor Susan Rice, Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel led the nearly 90-minute conference call, an unclassified session that included intelligence on the alleged use of chemical weapons by Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces in rebel-held areas of his country.

The two dozen congressional leaders were sought out “to brief them on the administration’s thinking and seek their input,” the administration said in a statement.

The conference call resulted in mixed reactions as President Obama considers the U.S. response to the alleged chemical attack in Syria last week that reportedly killed hundreds of people, many of them civilians.

“Tonight the administration failed to explain how they intend to effectively respond to the situation in Syria,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) in a statement afterward.

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard “Buck” McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) said he was “disappointed” the president didn’t personally address the congressional leaders.

“If the president intends to connect this directly to Assad, he needs to make that public case -- personally,” a McKeon aide said, relaying the chairman’s remarks after the session.

Several lawmakers quizzed the administration officials about the potential costs of the military campaign, an issue that House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has also raised in his communications this week with Obama. The lawmakers were told the administration would likely seek additional funds from Congress, the McKeon aide said.

The conference call came after a difficult day for the Obama administration as key U.S. allies distanced themselves from military action against the Syrian government. The call participants also included James R. Clapper, director of national intelligence, and Adm. James Winnefeld, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

“The United States cannot be the lone sheriff of the whole world,” C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. “The United States must be careful in how it proceeds and must act together with a coalition of countries.”

Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the nation’s security interests demand action.

“The use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime requires a decisive response. Our national security interests, those of our allies, and regional stability are at risk as Syria is disintegrating into a failed state,” Menendez said in a statement. “This is not a moment to look the other way.”

The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Elliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), said, “The president’s national security team said that he is still weighing his options.”

Obama spoke earlier in the day to both Boehner and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate minority leader, who did not join the call.

The Democratic congressional leaders have also been in contact with the president. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has been “briefed constantly,” an aide said, including in talks with Obama, but he did not participate in Thursday’s briefing.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), the minority leader, who noted that Americans were “weary of war,” said during the call that she agreed with Boehner that there should be more consultation with Congress and transparency from the administration, and “that the case needs to be made to the American people.”

Even before the evening session began, lawmakers grumbled that it was insufficient.

Lawmakers have become increasingly vocal on the need for congressional authorization of military action, and more than 160 House lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have signed letters demanding a vote in Congress.

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the administration needed to present the classified information to a wider group of lawmakers, “to get buy-in to the program, to go over the evidence.”

“I do think that when people see the evidence in a classified way, they’ll be convinced, like I was convinced,” Rogers said earlier Thursday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports.”

He Died On June']",Charles Krauthammer: The fruits of epic incompetence,"The president of the United States takes to the airwaves to urgently persuade the nation to pause before doing something it has no desire to do in the first place.

Strange. And it gets stranger still. That “strike Syria, maybe” speech begins with a heart-rending account of children consigned to a terrible death by a monster dropping poison gas. It proceeds to explain why such behavior must be punished. It culminates with the argument that the proper response — the most effective way to uphold fundamental norms, indeed human decency — is a flea bite: something “limited,” “targeted” or, as so memorably described by Secretary of State John Kerry, “unbelievably small.”

The mind reels, but there’s more. We must respond — but not yet. This “Munich moment” (Kerry again) demands first a pause to find accommodation with that very same toxin-wielding monster, by way of negotiations with his equally cynical, often shirtless, Kremlin patron bearing promises.

The promise is to rid Syria of its chemical weapons. The negotiations are open-ended. Not a word from President Obama about any deadline or ultimatum. And utter passivity: Kerry said hours earlier that he awaited the Russian proposal.

Why? The administration claims (preposterously, but no matter) that Obama has been working on this idea with Putin at previous meetings. Moreover, the idea was first publicly enunciated by Kerry, even though his own State Department immediately walked it back as a slip of the tongue.

Take at face value Obama’s claim of authorship. Then why isn’t he taking ownership? Why isn’t he calling it the “U.S. proposal” and defining it? Why not issue a U.S. plan containing the precise demands, detailed timeline and threat of action should these conditions fail to be met?

Putin doesn’t care one way or the other about chemical weapons. Nor about dead Syrian children. Nor about international norms, parchment treaties and the other niceties of the liberal imagination.

He cares about power and he cares about keeping Bashar al-Assad in power. Assad is the key link in the anti-Western Shiite crescent stretching from Tehran through Damascus and Beirut to the Mediterranean — on which sits Tartus, Russia’s only military base outside the former Soviet Union. This axis frontally challenges the pro-American Sunni Arab Middle East (Jordan, Yemen, the Gulf Arabs, even the North African states), already terrified at the imminent emergence of a nuclear Iran.

At which point the Iran axis and its Russian patron would achieve dominance over the moderate Arab states, allowing Russia to supplant America as regional hegemon for the first time since Egypt switched to our side in the Cold War in 1972.

The hinge of the entire Russian strategy is saving the Assad regime. That’s the very purpose of the “Russian proposal.” Imagine that some supposed arms-control protocol is worked out. The inspectors have to be vetted by Assad, protected by Assad, convoyed by Assad, directed by Assad to every destination. Negotiation, inspection, identification, accounting, transport and safety would require constant cooperation with the regime, and thus acknowledgment of its sovereignty and legitimacy.

So much for Obama’s repeated insistence that Assad must go. Indeed, Putin has openly demandedthat any negotiation be conditioned on a U.S. commitment to forswear the use of force against Assad. On Thursday, Assad repeated that demand, warning that without an American pledge not to attack and not to arm the rebels, his government would agree to nothing.

This would abolish the very possibility of America tilting the order of battle in a Syrian war that Assad is now winning thanks to Russian arms, Iranian advisers and Lebanese Hezbollah shock troops. Putin thus assures the survival of his Syrian client and the continued ascendancy of the anti-Western Iranian bloc.

And what does America get? Obama saves face.

Some deal.

As for the peace process, it has about zero chance of disarming Damascus. We’ve spent nine years disarming an infinitely smaller arsenal in Libya — in conditions of peace — and we’re still finding undeclared stockpiles.

Yet consider what’s happened over the last month. Assad uses poison gas on civilians and is branded, by the United States above all, a war criminal. Putin, covering for the war criminal, is exposed, isolated, courting pariah status.

And now? Assad, far from receiving punishment of any kind, goes from monster to peace partner. Putin bestrides the world stage, playing dealmaker. He’s welcomed by America as a constructive partner. Now a world statesman, he takes to the New York Times to blame American interventionist arrogance — a.k.a. “American exceptionalism” — for inducing small states to acquire WMDs in the first place.

And Obama gets to slink away from a Syrian debacle of his own making. Such are the fruits of a diplomacy of epic incompetence.

Unbeknown to the many users of the system, a different government arm, the National Security Agency, secretly inserted a “back door” into the system that allowed federal spies to crack open any data that was encoded using its technology.

Documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, make clear that the agency has never met an encryption system that it has not tried to penetrate. And it frequently tries to take the easy way out. Because modern cryptography can be so hard to break, even using the brute force of the agency’s powerful supercomputers, the agency prefers to collaborate with big software companies and cipher authors, getting hidden access built right into their systems.

The New York Times, The Guardian and ProPublica recently reported that the agency now has access to the codes that protect commerce and banking systems, trade secrets and medical records, and everyone’s e-mail and Internet chat messages, including virtual private networks. In some cases, the agency pressured companies to give it access; as The Guardian reported earlier this year, Microsoft provided access to Hotmail, Outlook.com, SkyDrive and Skype. According to some of the Snowden documents given to Der Spiegel, the N.S.A. also has access to the encryption protecting data on iPhones, Android and BlackBerry phones.

These back doors and special access routes are a terrible idea, another example of the intelligence community’s overreach. Companies and individuals are increasingly putting their most confidential data on cloud storage services, and need to rely on assurances their data will be secure. Knowing that encryption has been deliberately weakened will undermine confidence in these systems and interfere with commerce."

You know, right after Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping are meeting about the state of, among other things, a cyberwar going on underneath their noses.

The new report from Xinhua news agency adds that the drill, taking place on a large military training field and not some underground hack-a-thon bunker, ""will be the first time a PLA exercise has focused on combat forces including digitalized units, special operations forces, army aviation and electronic counter forces."" The terms ""digitalized unit"" and ""electronic counter forces"" don't make it at all clear what China's military has planned, but then again, no country is ever going to reveal its full cyberwarfare capabilities in detail — and it's not like it's the first time the Chinese have tested the military reaches of their digital warfare capabilities. Indeed, the U.S. was game to play along on more than one occasion. Last year it was reported that the U.S. and China had secretly engaged in at least two cyber war games in 2011, ""designed to help prevent a sudden military escalation between the two superpowers if either felt they were being targeted,"" as ZDNet's Emil Potralinski reported. ""In the first, both sides had to describe what they would do if they were attacked by a sophisticated computer virus, such as Stuxnet. In the second, they had to describe their reaction if the attack was known to have been launched from the other side."" The first went better than the second, apparently, but neither appears to have taken place on a training base in Mongolia, as this new test will be when it's conducted by two army corps and eight military academies in ""late June."" Obama and Xi are set to meet at an estate in California on June 7-8. Cybersecurity is on the list of talking points, the White House confirmed Tuesday as National Security Advisor Tom Donilon visited Beijing ahead of the summit. Defense Secretary's Chuck Hagel is visiting Southeast Asia this week, and it's on his agenda, too.

That article followed a Pentagon report earlier this month claiming that the Chinese government was directly connected to attacks on U.S. computer systems, which followed the cybersecurity firm Mandiant's report in February alleging that the PLA was connected to a number of cyberattacks on U.S. companies and infrastructure, and a 2012 assertion from national security veteran Richard Clarke that China has hacked every major U.S. company.

Out of all the places Edward Snowden could have chosen to hide, he selected this city, with its towering buildings, glittering nightscape and reputation for protecting free speech.

But some in Hong Kong aren’t sure what the man who has admitted leaking information about a top-secret U.S. surveillance program is doing in this semi-autonomous jurisdiction, which has a strong extradition treaty with the United States.

“Hong Kong is definitely not a safe harbor for him,” said Regina Ip, a current legislator and chair of the New People’s Party.

The U.S Department of Justice has said it is in the first stages of investigating the unauthorized disclosure of classified information about the surveillance programs, and some U.S. lawmakers are calling for Snowden, the self-declared source of the leak, to be prosecuted.

If Snowden, 29, remains in Hong Kong and the U.S. government seeks to arrest or question him about the leak, the former NSA contractor’s fate would depend on a 16-year-old treaty that guarantees extraditions between the United States and Hong Kong except under rare circumstances.

The treaty says that Hong Kong can refuse to transfer a suspected criminal to the United States if the person is a People’s Republic of China national and giving up that person “implicates” the “defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy” of the PRC.

Experts said because Snowden doesn’t fall into that category, if the United States wanted to charge him with breaking espionage laws, Hong Kong was likely to transfer him to U.S. custody.

“This agreement has been enforced for at least 10 years,” said Ip, who said Hong Kong has also benefited from the U.S. government’s assistance with fugitives over the years.

The treaty with Hong Kong says that any request to extradite must originate from the U.S. Department of Justice, and would be channeled through the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong. A spokesperson for the consulate declined to comment, deferring questions to the Justice Department in Washington.

Snowden has not revealed to reporters exactly where in Hong Kong he was staying, although he told The Washington Post he was holed up at a hotel near the CIA base at the consulate, which is located in the heart of Hong Kong island.

A receptionist at the Mira Hotel, in a neighborhood just across the harbor from the main island, said a guest named Edward Snowden had been staying there, but checked out Monday. Citing guest privacy rules, the receptionist declined to say how long Snowden had stayed in the hotel in the Tsim Sha Tsui neighborhood, which is known for a popular promenade overlooking the harbor and offering gorgeous night views.

In an e-mail to a Washington Post reporter on May 24, he said he would consider applying for asylum in Iceland or some other country “with strong internet and press freedoms,” although “the strength of the reaction” to the leaked information “will determine how choosy I can be.”

Hong Kong has its own legislative and legal systems but ultimately answers to Beijing, under the so-called “one country, two systems” arrangement, established when oversight of Hong Kong was transferred from the British to the Chinese in 1997. The extradition treaty between Hong Kong and the United States was established at the time of the British-Chinese handover, since the treaty also needed the blessing of Hong Kong’s new sovereign rulers, the Chinese government.

Given the touchy nature of China’s relationship with both the United States and Hong Kong, however, experts said the Chinese government was likely to stay in the background with Snowden’s case.

“I don’t think the central government will deal with this incident directly,” said Jin Canrong, professor and associate dean of the School of International Studies at Renmin University of China. Jin said the government would probably let Hong Kong handle Snowden, although he said the Chinese might still have the final say, given its power over the semiautonomous city.

The situation is tricky since Hong Kong residents easily chafe at any perception that Beijing is encroaching on their rights. Every year, thousands of residents hold a candlelight vigil on June 4 to mark the date of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. At this year’s event, gatherers called for Chinese President Xi Jinping to expand democracy.

Given this legacy, a few in Hong Kong cheered Snowden’s selection of Hong Kong, saying it was flattering to the city.

“I’m not surprised because Hong Kong is famous for our freedom of expression and our defense of press freedom,” said Alan Leung, a legislator who heads Hong Kong’s Civic Party. “We should take [Snowden’s arrival] as complimentary.”

In a statement posted on its website, WikiLeaks denounced the Obama administration for its “bellicose response” to the American fugitive’s search for refuge from U.S. prosecution for disclosing top-secret NSA data surveillance operations.

“Over the past eight weeks we have seen the Obama administration show no respect for international or domestic law, but in the end the law is winning,” Snowden is quoted as saying after finally escaping more than a month of diplomatic limbo at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport. “I thank the Russian Federation for granting me asylum in accordance with its laws and international obligations.”

Snowden’s father, Lon, also expressed his gratitude to Russian President Vladimir Putin for protecting his son from the legal consequences of having violated his NSA confidentiality obligations.

In an interview broadcast Wednesday by Rossiya-24 television, the elder Snowden praised Putin and his government for having “the strength and resolve and convictions to protect my son.” Lon Snowden was in the process of arranging a visit to Moscow to see his son, the fugitive’s lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, told journalists after his client left the airport for an undisclosed location.

“Despite the ongoing pressure from the United States, which has been trying to interfere with this sovereign [asylum] process in violation of the U.N. Protocol on the Rights of Refugees, Russia has done the right thing and granted Mr. Snowden temporary asylum,” the unsigned WikiLeaks statement declared.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, from his own tentative refuge at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, pronounced Snowden’s grant of asylum in Russia a triumph in the global battle to protect those who expose what they consider illegal government behavior.

“This is another victory in the fight against Obama’s war on whistle-blowers. This battle has been won, but the war continues,” Assange said. “The United States can no longer continue the surveillance of world citizens and its digital colonization of sovereign nations.”

Russian human rights advocates were quick to point out, though, that Snowden has taken shelter in a country with a deplorable track record in defense of free speech and tolerance of dissent.

Lyudmila Alexeyeva, head of the human rights advocates of the Moscow Helsinki Group, said it was good that Snowden had finally escaped his protracted ordeal in the transit area of the capital’s main airport but noted that he now finds himself in a country with little regard for the ideals of freedom he professes.

“Having fought for the freedom and rights, Snowden has ended up in a country that cracks down on them,” Alexeyeva was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

Human Rights Watch analysts also took note of the irony of the Kremlin coming to the defense of a self-styled champion of privacy and free speech rights.

“He cannot but be aware of the unprecedented crackdown on human rights that the government has unleashed in the past 15 months,” Rachel Denber, the rights group’s expert on Russia and other former Soviet states told the Associated Press by email.

Another Human Rights Watch commentator, Deputy Executive Director Carroll Bogert, advised Snowden in a tongue-in-cheek post on CNN’s news blog that he get familiar with certain expressions in the Russian language, such as “khuliganstvo” -- hooliganism, which might cover anything from getting in a fistfight to performance of a protest song denouncing Putin.

Snowden revealed his identity in a Guardian piece published on Sunday. After approaching the media with bombshell revelations about the NSA's secret programs, he left the United States for Hong Kong and holed himself up in a hotel room for three weeks.

The Washington Post reported that a guest by the name of Edward Snowden had been staying at the Mira Hotel, but checked out Monday. It is unclear whether Snowden is still in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong-based correspondents have been trying to hunt him down, staking out a number of hotels that matched the description Snowden gave to the Guardian. The Guardian's Ewen MacAskill reported that ""media scrums"" were forming at hotels in the city, while USA Today described the search as a ""media manhunt.""

Snowden told the Guardian that he chose Hong Kong as a refuge for its ""spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent."" In an interview with the Associated Press, The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald said that Snowden fled to Hong Kong because he ""doesn't really trust the judicial system in the United States to give him a fair trial."" The revelation, however, has sparked speculation about whether his choice was a wise one.

The current treaty between Hong Kong and the U.S. guarantees extradition unless China believes that doing so would hurt ""defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy"" — an exception that some experts say is rare. The New York Times reported Monday that the government is ""seen as likely to extradite"" Snowden if the U.S. requests it to do so, while New York magazine's Joe Coscarelli predicted that China will do what is necessary to avoid a ""diplomatic crisis.""

The New Yorker's Evan Osnos also questioned Snowden's choice, writing that ""going to Hong Kong out of devotion to free speech is a bit like going to Tibet out of a devotion to Buddhism; the people love it, though they live under authorities who intervene when they choose.""

Other experts imagined some scenarios where Snowden might be granted asylum. The Global Post's Benjamin Carlson also reported that Hong Kong is currently changing its procedure for reviewing applications for asylum, which might work in Snowden's favor if asylum seekers are allowed to stay in the city until a new procedure is put in place.

Ironically, a full-page ad in Monday's New York Times touted ""the Hong Kong advantage"" when it comes to business opportunities in the city. ABC News editor Jon Williams tweeted a picture, writing, ""Ed Snowden hoping so."""

Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. downplayed the effects of Karzai’s directive, even though Afghanistan’s fledgling security forces rely entirely on U.S. and NATO warplanes for air power against Taliban-led insurgents.

“We can continue to support the Afghan National Security Forces and meet the president’s intent,” Dunford said.

A day earlier, in a speech at the Afghan National Military Academy, Karzai railed against a joint Afghan-NATO attack last week that local officials said killed 10 civilians, including women and children, in addition to four Taliban commanders in eastern Kunar province. The Afghan leader said he would issue a decree that “no Afghan military and security forces in any circumstances can ask for the foreigners’ planes for carrying out operations in Afghanistan’s homes and villages.”

The remarks represented the latest broadside by Karzai against the coalition that has trained, equipped and financed the force of 350,000 soldiers and police who are due to take responsibility for Afghanistan’s security later this year.

Civilian casualties have long been a point of contention between Karzai and the coalition, reaching a crisis point last june when NATO launched an airstrike against insurgents who had taken shelter in a wedding party. Eighteen civilians were among the dead, and in the wake of the incident NATO implemented rules limiting airstrikes in populated areas. U.S. officials say that civilian casualties in coalition operations fell by 49% from 2011 to 2012 and that the number of children killed or wounded in air operations fell by nearly 40%.

“We have constraints and restraints on each operation” to minimize civilian casualties, Dunford said.

Last week, Karzai summoned Dunford to explain the Kunar attack. The coalition has declined to discuss the incident, saying only that it was investigating the reports of civilian deaths.

Military analysts said that Karzai’s decree, if issued, could hamstring Afghan security units, very few of which are capable of operating without coalition support. This spring, say U.S. officials, Afghan security forces will take the lead in security operations nationwide, setting up a crucial test for the young force as insurgent operations usually pick up in the warm-weather months.

“It could provide ground for the insurgency to increase their areas of operations,” said Jawed Kohistani, an independent military analyst in Kabul. “We have the summer coming and insurgent activities may increase, which puts more pressure on Afghan forces.

“I hope that the Afghan security forces and their leadership convince the president that there is need for NATO air support.”

The response to Karzai’s comments from Afghan military officials wasn’t immediately clear, but Dunford, who took over as coalition commander last week, was due to meet later Sunday with Sher Mohammad Karimi, the Afghan army chief of staff.

“We’re going to work through the details [of Karzai’s order] in the coming days,” Dunford said.

If airstrikes are limited, “there are other ways we can support the Afghan forces besides aviation,” Dunford added, without elaborating. Experts say that could signal an expanded role for U.S. and Afghan special forces or ground-based artillery systems, which carry the risk of inaccuracies.

Leaks to the press, like hillside rain tugged seaward by gravity, gather momentum only if the flow is steadily replenished.

After a major leak to the Guardian‘s Glenn Greenwald resulted in a scoop Wednesday about the National Security Agency’s harvesting of phone records, reporters instantly mined their back pages for leads and rang up their sources to amplify and extend his story, and went looking for leakers of their own. In other words, the press pack prayed for rain.

But before that scoop had run its course, Greenwald (and Ewen MacAskill) went to press with another revelation about the NSA’s Prism program, which collects email, chat, VOIP conversations, file transfers, photos, videos and more from Web users. A similar Washington Post piece by Barton Gellman and documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras beat the Guardian duo by a few minutes, a downpour in a very short time. The Guardian-Post overlap was so pronounced that it’s likely the two publications were nurtured by the same source, identified in the Post as “a career intelligence officer.”

Friday afternoon, Greenwald and MacAskill dropped another bombshell about Obama’s cyberattack plans in the Guardian. These aren’t leaks. This is a flood.

Faster than you can say evaporation-condensation-precipitation, I expect this week’s exposés to produce additional investigations that will produce more leaks and further scoops about our digital records. This will now fuel new cycles of reporting, leaks and scoops — and another, and another — as new sources are cultivated and reportorial scraps gathering mold in journalists’ notebooks gain new relevance and help break stories.

Greenwald’s storm will continue to rage because, I suspect, the story won’t be limited to just phone records or Web data. Ultimately, it will be about the government’s pursuit of all the digital breadcrumbs we produce as necessary byproducts of day-to-day life — and phone records and Web data are just a small part.

Bank records, credit history, travel records, credit card records, EZPass data, GPS phone data, license-plate reader databases, Social Security and Internal Revenue Service records, facial-recognition databases at the Department of Motor Vehicles and elsewhere, even 7-Eleven surveillance videos comprise information lodes that are of equal or greater value to the national security establishment than phone and Web files. It doesn’t sound paranoid to conclude that the government has reused, or will reuse, the interpretation of the Patriot Act it presented to the secret FISA court in its phone record and Prism data requests to grab these other data troves.

Lest I sound like a Fourth Amendment hysteric, I understand there’s nothing automatically sacrosanct about any of the digital trails we leave behind. Lawful subpoenas can liberate all sorts records about you, electronic or otherwise.

What’s breathtaking about these two government surveillance programs that the Guardian and the Washington Post have revealed is that they’re vast collections of data about hundreds of millions of people suspected of no wrongdoing and not part of any civil action. Defending the phone-record cull, National Intelligence Director James R. Clapper explained this week that smaller sets of information aren’t very useful in screening for and identifying “terrorism-related communications,” hence all must collected.

Besides, as the government and its supporters insist, phone-record metadata does not include the names of individuals or organizations connected to the phone numbers (and government eavesdropping isn’t part of the operation).

I won’t belabor the point made better in scores of venues this week about how massive phone-record sets can be manipulated to produce revelatory information about individuals. Not even a saint could resist the siren call to combine data sets and use them in impermissible ways for “the good of the people.”

Even before governments start to combine data, it knows too much about you. Once it gets started, it can know practically everything worth knowing. A former NSA employee captured the grand scheme succinctly last year when he told Wired magazine, “We are, like, that far from a turnkey totalitarian state.”

Daniel J. Solove, who has been beavering away at privacy issues for some time, addresses what he calls the “exclusion” problem posed by the government’s massing of personal data. He writes:

“Many government national-security measures involve maintaining a huge database of information that individuals cannot access. Indeed, because they involve national security, the very existence of these programs is often kept secret. This kind of information processing, which blocks subjects’ knowledge and involvement, is a kind of due-process problem. It is a structural problem, involving the way people are treated by government institutions and creating a power imbalance between people and the government. To what extent should government officials have such a significant power over citizens? This issue isn’t about what information people want to hide but about the power and the structure of government.”

Journalists love nothing more than to learn and share secrets, which, with the Guardian and the Washington Post as our guides, appear to be in ample supply.

If anything, journalists are fully vested in maintaining their constitutional rights to ask questions, associate freely, and speak and write their minds. If journalists react strongly to government intrusions — even well-meaning intrusions intended to protect us from acts of terrorism — it’s because we’re too intimate with the misuse of power and regard most government secrets as measures designed to displace freedom in favor of security.

Or as a character in David Hare’s film Page Eight put it disparagingly, “We can’t be free because we have to be safe.”

The only thing that beats leakers is a long, hard freeze. In my experience, fire beats ice every time.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-iran-more-getting-bomb-084042446--politics.html,,[],Obama: Iran 'year or more' from getting bomb,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama says U.S. intelligence agencies believe Iran is still ""a year or more"" away from producing a nuclear weapon, an assessment he acknowledged was at odds with Israel.

""Our estimate is probably more conservative than the estimates of Israeli intelligence services,"" Obama said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press.

The president spoke to the AP on Friday, four days into the partial shutdown of the federal government. He reiterated his opposition to negotiating with House Republicans to end the shutdown or raise the nation's debt ceiling.

""There are enough votes in the House of Representatives to make sure that the government reopens today,"" he said. ""And I'm pretty willing to bet that there are enough votes in the House of Representatives right now to make sure that the United States doesn't end up being a deadbeat.""

The start of the shutdown coincided with the opening of sign-ups for the insurance exchanges at the heart of Obama's health care law. Some House Republicans are seeking changes to the law in exchange for reopening the government.

The rollout of the insurance exchanges has been shaky, with government-run websites plagued by glitches. Despite the problems, Obama told frustrated Americans they ""definitely shouldn't give up.""

""Folks are working around the clock and have been systematically reducing the wait times,"" he said.

Obama blamed the error messages and long wait times on public interest that exceeded the government's expectations. However, he said he didn't know how many people had so far managed to sign up for insurance.

Administration officials have said they do not plan to release real-time data on the number of people enrolling, though some states running their own exchange websites are doing so.

The federal gateway website was taken down for repairs over the weekend, again hindering people from signing up for insurance.

On other points, Obama:

—Contrasted his tenure as a senator with the current crop of first-term Republican senators, saying he ""didn't go around courting the media"" or ""trying to shut down the government"" while he was in the Senate.

Story continues

—Said he's considering keeping some American forces in Afghanistan after the war formally ends in late 2014, if an agreement can be reached with the Afghan government. He tried to do the same in Iraq but was unable to reach an agreement with its government.

—Suggested that the owner of the Washington Redskins football team consider changing its name because, the president said, the current name offends ""a sizable group of people.""

Obama's comments on Iran came amid signs that long-standing tensions between the U.S. and Tehran might be easing. In late September, Obama spoke by phone with President Hassan Rouhani, Iran's new, more-moderate sounding leader. The 15-minute call marked the first direct exchange between U.S. and Iranian leaders in more than 30 years.

""Rouhani has staked his position on the idea that he can improve relations with the rest of the world,"" Obama said. ""And so far he's been saying a lot of the right things. And the question now is, can he follow through?""

But Obama said Rouhani is not Iran's only ""decision-maker. He's not even the ultimate decision-maker,"" a reference to the control wielded by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Given the supreme leader's broad influence, some countries, most notably Israel, have questioned whether Rouhani actually represents real change in Iran or just new packaging of old policies.

Khamenei said Saturday that he supported Rouhani's outreach to the West, but at the same time called the U.S. government ""untrustworthy, arrogant, illogical and a promise-breaker,"" according to comment summarized on his website.

Obama also put distance between U.S. and Israeli assessments of when Iran might have the capacity to build a nuclear weapon. Israeli officials have said Iran is just months away from having the capacity and knowledge to build a bomb, while Obama said Tehran was a year or more away.

Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni played down the differences.

'The question isn't the timetable the question is how we get that result,"" Livni told Israel's Channel 10 TV.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif disputed Obama's comments, repeating Iran's claims that it is not seeking a nuclear weapon.

The U.S. and Israel contend that Iran's nuclear program is aimed at building a bomb, while Tehran says it is enriching uranium for peaceful purposes.

On domestic issues, Obama said he would be willing to negotiate with Republicans on health care, deficit reduction and spending — but only if House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, holds votes to reopen the government and increase the nation's borrowing limit.

The Treasury Department says the nation will hit its borrowing limit around Oct. 17. Obama didn't specifically rule out taking action on his own if Congress fails to increase the debt ceiling, but said he doesn't expect to get to that point.

Obama, who successfully ran for president as a first-term senator, also spoke critically about first-term Republican senators, such as Ted Cruz of Texas, who have been leading efforts to shut the government if Republicans can't extract concessions from the White House.

The president said that when he was in the Senate, he ""didn't go around courting the media. And I certainly didn't go around trying to shut down the government.""

""I recognize that in today's media age, being controversial, taking controversial positions, rallying the most extreme parts of your base, whether it's left or right, is a lot of times the fastest way to get attention and raise money,"" he said. ""But it's not good for government.""

On the 12-year war in Afghanistan, Obama said he would consider keeping some American forces on the ground after the conflict formally ends next year, but acknowledged that doing so would require an agreement from the Afghan government. He suggested that if no agreement can be reached, he would be comfortable with a full pullout of U.S. troops.

""If in fact we can get an agreement that makes sure that U.S. troops are protected, makes sure that we can operate in a way that is good for our national security, then I'll certainly consider that,"" he said. ""If we can't, we will continue to make sure that all the gains we've made in going after al-Qaida we accomplish, even if we don't have any U.S. military on Afghan soil.""

All U.S. forces left Iraq at the end of 2011 after no deal could be reached to keep some there longer.

Obama, an avid sports fan, also weighed in on the controversy surrounding the Redskins as the name of Washington's NFL football team. The name has faced a new barrage of criticism for being offensive to Native Americans.

The president said he doesn't think Redskins' fans mean any offense by using the name. But he added: ""If I were the owner of the team and I knew that the name of my team, even if they've had a storied history, that was offending a sizable group of people, I'd think about changing it.""

Spokesmen for the White House and Pentagon declined to comment.

Within the Obama administration, the way the United States extricates itself from Afghanistan has been a source of tension between civilian and military officials since Mr. Obama took office. American commanders in Afghanistan have generally pushed to keep as many American troops in the country as long as possible, creating friction with White House officials urging a speedier military withdrawal.

But with frustrations mounting over the glacial pace of initiating peace talks with the Taliban, and with American relations with the Karzai government continuing to deteriorate, it is unclear whether the Pentagon and American commanders in Afghanistan would vigorously resist if the White House pushed for a full-scale pullout months ahead of schedule.

As it stands, the number of American troops in Afghanistan — around 63,000 — is scheduled to go down to 34,000 by February 2014. The White House has said the vast majority of troops would be out of Afghanistan by the end of that year, although it now appears that the schedule could accelerate to bring the bulk of the troops — if not all of them — home by next summer, as the annual fighting season winds down.

Talks between the United States and Afghanistan over a long-term security deal have faltered in recent months over the Afghan government’s insistence that the United States guarantee Afghanistan’s security and, in essence, commit to declaring Pakistan the main obstacle in the fight against militancy in the region.

The guarantees sought by Afghanistan, if implemented, could possibly compel the United States to attack Taliban havens in Pakistan long after 2014, when the Obama administration has said it hoped to dial back the C.I.A.’s covert drone war there."

Delivers Cash to Afghan Leader’s Office,"It is not clear that the United States is getting what it pays for. Mr. Karzai’s willingness to defy the United States — and the Iranians, for that matter — on an array of issues seems to have only grown as the cash has piled up. Instead of securing his good graces, the payments may well illustrate the opposite: Mr. Karzai is seemingly unable to be bought.

Over Iran’s objections, he signed a strategic partnership deal with the United States last year, directly leading the Iranians to halt their payments, two senior Afghan officials said. Now, Mr. Karzai is seeking control over the Afghan militias raised by the C.I.A. to target operatives of Al Qaeda and insurgent commanders, potentially upending a critical part of the Obama administration’s plans for fighting militants as conventional military forces pull back this year.

But the C.I.A. has continued to pay, believing it needs Mr. Karzai’s ear to run its clandestine war against Al Qaeda and its allies, according to American and Afghan officials.

Like the Iranian cash, much of the C.I.A.’s money goes to paying off warlords and politicians, many of whom have ties to the drug trade and, in some cases, the Taliban. The result, American and Afghan officials said, is that the agency has greased the wheels of the same patronage networks that American diplomats and law enforcement agents have struggled unsuccessfully to dismantle, leaving the government in the grips of what are basically organized crime syndicates.

The cash does not appear to be subject to the oversight and restrictions placed on official American aid to the country or even the C.I.A.’s formal assistance programs, like financing Afghan intelligence agencies. And while there is no evidence that Mr. Karzai has personally taken any of the money — Afghan officials say the cash is handled by his National Security Council — the payments do in some cases work directly at odds with the aims of other parts of the American government in Afghanistan, even if they do not appear to violate American law.

Handing out cash has been standard procedure for the C.I.A. in Afghanistan since the start of the war. During the 2001 invasion, agency cash bought the services of numerous warlords, including Muhammad Qasim Fahim, the current first vice president."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/opinion/sunday/dowd-barrys-war-within.html,2013-09-08 00:00:00,['Maureen Dowd'],Barry’s War Within - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON — THE winner of the Nobel Peace Prize had been up late pleading for war.

The president looked exhausted as he met the press in St. Petersburg on Friday. The man elected because of his magical powers of persuasion had failed to persuade other world leaders at dinner the night before about a strike on Syria.

He said he had told his fellow leaders, “I was elected to end wars and not start them.”

But in life, and especially in Washington, people sometimes end up becoming what they start out scorning.

It is uncomfortable to watch the president struggle to reconcile his two conflicting identities as he weighs what he calls the unappetizing choices on Syria, and as he is weighed down by the malignant choices on the Middle East made by his predecessor.

In his head, is Barry at war with the commander in chief?

One side of him is Barry, the smooth consensus builder and community organizer, the former constitutional professor and the drive-by senator who must stand by the argument he made when he ran for president excoriating W.’s and Dick Cheney’s highhandedness: checks and balances must be observed. As he told Charlie Savage, then reporting for The Boston Globe, in 2007, “The president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.”"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/world/asia/biden-peers-into-north-korea-at-tense-border.html,2013-12-08 00:00:00,['Mark Landler'],Biden Looks Into North Korea at Border,"According to American officials, the Iranian nuclear deal, negotiated with major-power partners that included China, has made Mr. Xi somewhat open to the argument that pressure, combined with an offer of dialogue, can be a recipe for new diplomacy with North Korea.

The Chinese did not release details about the meeting.

There have been signs that China is losing patience with North Korea, which under Mr. Kim has often been dismissive of China’s warnings about provocations that could destabilize the region. In September, China announced that it planned to strengthen export controls on materials and equipment for the country’s nuclear programs. Mr. Xi, officials said, is also more assertive about pressing North Korea than was his predecessor, Hu Jintao.

But significant gaps remain. China continues to invest in North Korea and has resisted some past efforts to impose punishing sanctions. Chinese officials also continue to call for the United States to return to multilateral talks with North Korea, which the Obama administration has resisted until the North takes concrete steps to dismantle the country’s nuclear programs.

Iran, the American official cautioned, is not a “strict template” for North Korea because the North already possesses nuclear weapons, while Iran, which says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, is still short of that threshold.

In the case of Iran, the six major powers negotiating with it have been unified on the use of escalating oil and financial sanctions to drag it to the bargaining table; Iran’s leaders recently agreed to freeze elements of its nuclear program temporarily while both sides search for a comprehensive agreement. In the case of the so-called six-party talks with North Korea, however, China remains an outlier. The other parties involved are Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States.

American officials said China had watched the recent reports of a purge in North Korea with concern, especially since the relative who is said to have lost his state and party positions is a man with whom Chinese leaders have built a relationship.

American officials would not discuss what the Chinese told Mr. Biden about reports that Mr. Kim relieved his powerful uncle, Jang Song-thaek, of his posts and executed two of his aides. Mr. Jang is married to the sister of Mr. Kim’s deceased father, Kim Jong-il."

Among more than two dozen major weapons systems whose designs were breached were programs critical to U.S. missile defenses and combat aircraft and ships, according to a previously undisclosed section of a confidential report prepared for Pentagon leaders by the Defense Science Board.

Experts warn that the electronic intrusions gave China access to advanced technology that could accelerate the development of its weapons systems and weaken the U.S. military advantage in a future conflict.

The Defense Science Board, a senior advisory group made up of government and civilian experts, did not accuse the Chinese of stealing the designs. But senior military and industry officials with knowledge of the breaches said the vast majority were part of a widening Chinese campaign of espionage against U.S. defense contractors and government agencies.

The significance and extent of the targets help explain why the Obama administration has escalated its warnings to the Chinese government to stop what Washington sees as rampant cyber­theft.

In January, the advisory panel warned in the public version of its report that the Pentagon is unprepared to counter a full-scale cyber-conflict. The list of compromised weapons designs is contained in a confidential version, and it was provided to The Washington Post.

Some of the weapons form the backbone of the Pentagon’s regional missile defense for Asia, Europe and the Persian Gulf. The designs included those for the advanced Patriot missile system, known as PAC-3; an Army system for shooting down ballistic missiles, known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD; and the Navy’s Aegis ballistic-missile defense system.

Also identified in the report are vital combat aircraft and ships, including the F/A-18 fighter jet, the V-22 Osprey, the Black Hawk helicopter and the Navy’s new Littoral Combat Ship, which is designed to patrol waters close to shore.

Also on the list is the most expensive weapons system ever built — the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which is on track to cost about $1.4 trillion. The 2007 hack of that project was reported previously.

China, which is pursuing a comprehensive long-term strategy to modernize its military, is investing in ways to overcome the U.S. military advantage — and cyber-espionage is seen as a key tool in that effort, the Pentagon noted this month in a report to Congress on China. For the first time, the Pentagon specifically named the Chinese government and military as the culprit behind intrusions into government and other computer systems.

As the threat from Chinese cyber-espionage has grown, the administration has become more public with its concerns. In a speech in March, Thomas Donilon, the national security adviser to President Obama, urged China to control its cyber-activity. In its public criticism, the administration has avoided identifying the specific targets of hacking.

But U.S. officials said several examples were raised privately with senior Chinese government representatives in a four-hour meeting a year ago. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a closed meeting, said senior U.S. defense and diplomatic officials presented the Chinese with case studies detailing the evidence of major intrusions into U.S. companies, including defense contractors.

In addition, a recent classified National Intelligence Estimate on economic cyber-espionage concluded that China was by far the most active country in stealing intellectual property from U.S. companies.

The Chinese government insists that it does not conduct ­cyber-

espionage on U.S. agencies or companies, and government spokesmen often complain that Beijing is a victim of U.S. cyberattacks.

Obama is expected to raise the issue when he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping next month in California.

A spokesman for the Pentagon declined to discuss the list from the science board’s report. But the spokesman, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said in an e-mail, “The Department of Defense has growing concerns about the global threat to economic and national security from persistent cyber-intrusions aimed at the theft of intellectual property, trade secrets and commercial data, which threatens the competitive edge of U.S. businesses like those in the Defense Industrial Base.”

The confidential list of compromised weapons system designs and technologies represents the clearest look at what the Chinese are suspected of targeting. When the list was read to independent defense experts, they said they were shocked by the extent of the cyber-espionage and the potential for compromising U.S. defenses.

“That’s staggering,” said Mark Stokes, executive director of the Project 2049 Institute, a think tank that focuses on Asia security issues. “These are all very critical weapons systems, critical to our national security. When I hear this in totality, it’s breathtaking.”

The experts said the cybertheft creates three major problems. First, access to advanced U.S. designs gives China an immediate operational edge that could be exploited in a conflict. Second, it accelerates China’s acquisition of advanced military technology and saves billions in development costs. And third, the U.S. designs can be used to benefit China’s own defense industry. There are long-standing suspicions that China’s theft of designs for the F-35 fighter allowed Beijing to develop its version much faster.

“You’ve seen significant improvements in Chinese military capabilities through their willingness to spend, their acquisitions of advanced Russian weapons, and from their cyber-espionage campaign,” said James A. Lewis, a cyber-policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Ten years ago, I used to call the PLA [People’s Liberation Army] the world’s largest open-air military museum. I can’t say that now.”

The public version of the science board report noted that such cyber-espionage and cyber-sabotage could impose “severe consequences for U.S. forces engaged in combat.” Those consequences could include severed communication links critical to the operation of U.S. forces. Data corruption could misdirect U.S. operations. Weapons could fail to operate as intended. Planes, satellites or drones could crash, the report said.

In other words, Stokes said, “if they have a better sense of a THAAD design or PAC-3 design, then that increases the potential of their ballistic missiles being able to penetrate our or our allies’ missile defenses.”

Winslow T. Wheeler, director of the Straus Military Reform Project at the Project on Government Oversight, made a similar point. “If they got into the combat systems, it enables them to understand it to be able to jam it or otherwise disable it,” he said. “If they’ve got into the basic algorithms for the missile and how they behave, somebody better get out a clean piece of paper and start to design all over again.”

The list did not describe the extent or timing of the penetrations. Nor did it say whether the theft occurred through the computer networks of the U.S. government, defense contractors or subcontractors.

Privately, U.S. officials say that senior Pentagon officials are frustrated by the scale of cybertheft from defense contractors, who routinely handle sensitive classified data. The officials said concerns have been expressed by Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr., the vice chairman, as well as Gen. Keith Alexander, director of the National Security Agency.

“In many cases, they don’t know they’ve been hacked until the FBI comes knocking on their door,” said a senior military official who was not authorized to speak on the record. “This is billions of dollars of combat advantage for China. They’ve just saved themselves 25 years of research and development. It’s nuts.”

In an attempt to combat the problem, the Pentagon launched a pilot program two years ago to help the defense industry shore up its computer defenses, allowing the companies to use classified threat data from the National Security Agency to screen their networks for malware. The Chinese began to focus on subcontractors, and now the government is in the process of expanding the sharing of threat data to more defense contractors and other industries.

An effort to change defense contracting rules to require companies to secure their networks or risk losing Pentagon business stalled last year. But the 2013 Defense Authorization Act has a provision that requires defense contractors holding classified clearances to report intrusions into their networks and allow access to government investigators to analyze the breach.

The systems on the science board’s list are built by a variety of top defense contractors, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. None of the companies would comment about whether their systems have been breached.

But Northrop Grumman spokes­man Randy Belote acknowledged the company “is experiencing greater numbers of attempts to penetrate its computer networks” and said the firm is “vigilant” about protecting its networks.

A Lockheed Martin official said the firm is “spending more time helping deal with attacks on the supply chain” of partners, subcontractors and suppliers than dealing with attacks directly against the company. “For now, our defenses are strong enough to counter the threat, and many attackers know that, so they go after suppliers. But of course they are always trying to develop new ways to attack.”

The Defense Science Board report also listed broad technologies that have been compromised, such as drone video systems, nanotechnology, tactical data links and electronic warfare systems — all areas where the Pentagon and Chinese military are investing heavily.

“Put all that together — the design compromises and the technology theft — and it’s pretty significant,” Stokes said."

Hillary Clinton answered her critics. North Korea threatened theirs.

As the week comes to an end, here’s a look back at these stories and other international news that developed, including a surprising election in Israel and a growing humanitarian crisis in Syria.

Clinton in Benghazi hot seat



At times angry and choked with emotion, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appeared before two congressional committees Wednesday and answered questions about her department’s handling of the attack that killed four Americans, including a U.S. ambassador, in Benghazi, Libya, last year.

While Clinton was mostly calm and composed during the two hearings, which lasted more than five hours in all, she became visibly frustrated when Sen. Ron Johnson, a tea-party backed Wisconsin Republican, said the American public was deliberately misled.

“With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,” Clinton said, banging her hand on the table. “Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they’d go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening.”

What did we learn from Wednesday’s testimony? Here are five of the key themes, including what Clinton did on the day of the attack.

Clinton also warned of a growing security threat in North Africa, saying there was “no doubt” that weapons from Libya were used in last week’s attack on an Algerian natural gas plant.

Which leads to …

The future of terrorism?



There are still outstanding questions over the Algerian standoff, which resulted in the deaths of at least 37 hostages.

Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the North African branch of al Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for the attack. Algeria said the attack was retaliation for letting France use its airspace in its offensive against Islamist militants in Mali.

The question now is whether this was an isolated act of revenge or, as Clinton alluded to, an ominous sign of things to come in the region, where Islamist militants are quickly gaining traction.

One expert believes we might be seeing the future of terrorism.

“Europe has become a difficult environment to conduct large-scale terrorist incidents, and America even more so,” said Raffaello Pantucci, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a British-based think tank that specializes in defense and security issues. “But at the same time, groups desire to attack Western targets both for ideological reasons and to attract attention to their cause has not diminished. The net result is that they will aim to target Westerners where they can find and reach them.”

North Korea’s defiant threat



The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution Tuesday condemning North Korea’s recent rocket launch and expanding sanctions against the country.

Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images North Korea has vowed action against the United States, which it calls ""the sworn enemy of the Korean people.""

But North Korea remains defiant, saying it plans to carry out more long-range rocket launches and another nuclear test. It also vowed an “upcoming all-out action” to target the United States, which it called “the sworn enemy of the Korean people.” By Friday, South Korea had been threatened as well.

The U.S. envoy to North Korea responded by saying the U.S. would ultimately judge North Korea by its actions, not by its words. Some experts say the U.S. should give up on negotiation altogether and take a tougher stance.

North Korea has conducted two previous nuclear tests – one in 2006 and one in 2009 – but analysts say it does not have the technology to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile.

Israel’s surprising election



As many expected, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing party received the most votes in Tuesday’s national elections.

AHMAD GHARABLI/AFP/Getty Images Yair Lapid's centrist party finished second in Israel's election. Will he join the prime minister or lead the political opposition?

But the surprising second-place finish of the centrist Yesh Atid party – led by Israeli TV personality Yair Lapid – might convince Netanyahu to form a more moderate government coalition rather than a hard-right bloc. (In Israel’s Knesset, coalitions must be built because no single party ever wins a majority of seats.)

“The pundits did not understand what Israeli society was thinking and feeling,” said Marcus Sheff, executive director of the Israel Project, an advocacy group. “Instead of the far right, they went to the center. … They were saying, ‘Let’s go to those values, the values Israel was established on, liberal Israel, secular Israel, moderate Israel – an Israel where peace with our neighbors is important but security is also important.’ “

The high voter turnout also confounded critics as the Israeli public “turned out to be far more engaged than many had imagined,” wrote Josh Block, CEO and president of the nonpartisan Israel Project.

Syria’s humanitarian crisis



As many as 20,000 Syrian refugees flooded Jordan this week, according to the nation’s foreign minister and refugee officials.

Daniel Lippman Children stand outside a building housing Syrian refugees in Hacipasa, Turkey.

There are now nearly 700,000 people who have fled Syria for neighboring countries, straining resources in places like Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.

CNN’s Ivan Watson visited a refugee camp in Turkey where a U.S. delegation arrived Thursday. He had an exclusive interview with the U.S. ambassador to Syria, who described how the U.S. has given $210 million in humanitarian aid and $35 million to help the Syrian political opposition.

“The assistance is going in,” Ambassador Robert Ford said. “It’s things like tents, it’s things like blankets, it’s things like medical equipment, but it doesn’t come in big boxes with an American flag on it because we don’t want the people who are delivering it to be targeted by the Syrian regime.”

Ford said the needs are gigantic and that much more aid is needed, but he stressed that even with help from the U.S. and other countries, “it has to be Syrians who find their way forward.”

Other notable stories from this past week:



– Britain’s Prince Harry reveals that he killed Taliban militants during his tour in Afghanistan. He also spoke out for the first time about his notorious Las Vegas trip and the nude photographs that surfaced.

– People from northern Mali share harrowing stories about the cruel punishments now being inflicted by Islamist militants there.

Assange's conference call with reporters offered the clearest indication yet that Snowden's fate is bound up with the assistance he receives from WikiLeaks, the noted transparency organization that came to its greatest fame three years ago when it released a massive cache of documents from Army Pfc. Bradley Manning.

Assange said that WikiLeaks paid for Snowden's flight from Hong Kong to Russia on Sunday and that ""there was no advanced communication with Russian officials prior to his departure from Hong Kong.""

Claims that Snowden has been debriefed by Russian intelligence agencies are false, Assange said.

In general, Assange struck a mysterious tone that left open many questions about when Snowden and WikiLeaks first made contact and what Snowden's status might be now.

""In relation to the travel out of Hong Kong, that is a fascinating story that I'm sure will one day be told -- but today is not the day,"" Assange said.

According to WikiLeaks, Snowden has applied for asylum in both Iceland and Ecuador, and possibly other countries. Assange himself has been holed up for the past year in the London embassy of Ecuador, which has offered him asylum; he is wanted for questioning on allegations of sexual assault in Sweden and has said he also fears extradition to the U.S. in relation to the ongoing Manning case. Snowden appears to be attempting a somewhat similar maneuver to avoid U.S. prosecution, with stops along the way in Hong Kong, which is a part of China, and Russia. Assange said Snowden traveled from Hong Kong with a refugee document provided by the Ecuadorian government.

Asked if there was any disconnect between the human rights records of countries like China and Russia and the transparency for which Snowden has said he is fighting, Assange said no.

""I simply don't see the irony,"" Assange said. ""Mr. Snowden has revealed information about mass, unlawful spying which has affected every single one of us. The U.S. administration has issued a series of bellicose, unilateral threats against him and against others who are attempting to support his rights. That is a very serious situation, and any country which assists in upholding his rights must be applauded for doing so."""

USA TODAY

When President Obama calls a foreign leader, the White House and the other country often release readouts of the conversation -- and sometimes they are very different.

Take Monday's call between Obama and French President Francois Hollande about news reports that the National Security Agency has conducted intelligence gathering in France.

The Hollande readout was much more critical.

Olivier Knox of Yahoo News, who translated the French statement, pointed out some of the differences in tone.

For example, the White House readout says: ""The United States and France are allies and friends, and share a close working relationship on a wide range of issues, including security and intelligence.""

The French readout: ""The Head of State shared his deep disapproval regarding these practices, which are unacceptable between allies and friends, because they violate the privacy of French citizens.""

A French newspaper said the NSA gathered more than 70 million French phone records during a recent 30-day period.

Also from the two readouts:

The United States said that Obama and Hollande ""discussed recent disclosures in the press -- some of which have distorted our activities and some of which raise legitimate questions for our friends and allies about how these capabilities are employed.""

The French said Hollande asked Obama for ""a full accounting (of the reported spying) as well as all of the information that former NSA contractor Edward Snowden might have in his possession.""

From Yahoo News:

""It's not unusual for world leaders to stress different aspects of a telephone conversation, but even by those standards the conversation prompted by Snowden's latest leaks is remarkable.

""Shocked, shocked France is hardly a stranger to spying — experts say Paris developed its sizeable nuclear arsenal by stealing U.S. atomic secrets. And its networks across Africa and the Middle East share valuable information with their American counterparts, U.S. officials say. ...

""But diplomats complain that Obama has done next to nothing to help elected officials in allied countries tamp down anger among their voters at American spying. They say the U.S. president's total lack of even feigned contrition in effect forces other leaders to take a tougher public line."""

Russia opposes Obama decision to arm Syrian rebels

Vladimir Putin meets with Obama at summit

Russian President Vladimir Putin told President Barack Obama in a meeting of top nations Monday that he does not agree with his decision to provide military aid to Syrian rebels but supports negotiations to end Syria's civil war.

Speaking after talks with Putin, Obama acknowledged in a bilateral meeting with Putin in Northern Ireland that they have a ""different perspective"" on Syria but he said that both leaders wanted to address the fierce fighting and also wanted to secure chemical weapons in the country.

Obama and Putin met on Syria while attending the G-8 summit of industrialized nations in Northern Ireland. Obama said both sides would work to develop talks in Geneva aimed at ending the country's bloody civil war.

""We do have differing perspectives on the problem but we share an interest in reducing the violence, securing chemical weapons and ensuring that they're neither used nor are they subject to proliferation,"" Obama said. ""We want to try to resolve the issue through political means if possible.""

Putin said ""of course our opinions do not coincide, but all of us have the intention to stop the violence in Syria and to stop the growth of victims and to solve the situation peacefully, including by bringing the parties to the negotiations table in Geneva.""

Russia is backing Syrian dictator Bashar Assad with arms and heavy weaponry that have been used to crush rebel advances. Obama announced last week he would assist the rebels because of Assad's use of chemical weapons against them.

Analysts say a major breakthrough on what action to take in the civil-war torn country is unlikely.

""I don't expect a major breakthrough on Syria, even though both camps will likely stress their common interests, their preference for a political solution ... and the need for a peace conference,"" said Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Centre at the London School of Economics.

Seven of the G-8 nations support the rebels and say Assad must go. Putin accused British Prime Minister David Cameron on Sunday of betraying humanitarian values by supporting Syrian rebels with ""blood on their hands.""

Russia and the West have long been at odds over Syria. As the violence continues to escalate in the region, Putin expressed anger at the U.S. commitment to supply small arms and ammunition to rebels as a result of the U.S. saying there was proof Assad's regime had used chemical weapons on its citizens.

Putin described Assad's government as ""the legitimate government of Syria in full conformity with the norms of international law.""

Moscow continues to stick to the principle of non-interference in what it calls Syria's ""internal affairs,"" a position it has held since the beginning of the uprising, said Anna Borshchevskaya, a fellow at the European Foundation for Democracy.

""Russia has too much vested in the current Syrian regime to let it go. Moscow still views Assad as perhaps its closest Arab ally in the Middle East, with deep cultural, historical, and business connections between the two,"" she said.

The United States vowed at the outbreak of the conflict in March 2011 that it would not intervene in Syria as it had in Libya, but made a statement in August of last year that if the regime used chemical weapons, it would cross a ""red line"" that could force the U.S. to change its position.

News of chemical weapons attacks carried out by Assad's regime surfaced in April, with France and Israel saying reports of dozens being killed appeared to be credible. The Syrian government's armed forces have launched 13 such attacks targeting Homs, Aleppo, Damascus and Idlib and killing 57 people, according to a report published June 15 by the Syrian Network for Human rights.

The Free Syrian Army (FSA) welcomed the U.S. decision to provide more military aid but said it needed larger weapons.

""The weapons we require above all are anti-aircraft and anti-shield weapons, so that we can stop the air force and stop the regime and Hezbollah from advancing,"" said Fahed Al-Masri, media officer for the FSA's joint command in Paris.

The FSA also called for western powers to create a no-fly-zone.

""We encourage the American administration and the European Union to decide on a no-fly-zone to protect defenseless civilians from the regime's daily bombings with rockets and aircraft,"" Louai Mikdad, spokesman for FSA general staff in Turkey, told USA TODAY.

In an interview with the German daily newspaper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, published online on Monday, Assad said the Syrian army is fighting terrorists and Europe will pay the price if it decides to deliver weapons to these terrorists.

""If the Europeans deliver weapons, Europe's own back yard will have terrorism and Europe will pay the price for this … The second consequence is that it would deliver terrorism to Europe,"" he said. ""Terrorists will gain battle experience and will come back with extremist ideologies. For Europe, there is no alternative but to cooperate with the Syrian state, even if it doesn't like this.""

As well as Syria, economic issues are also expected to be discussed at the two-day summit, which includes leaders from France, Germany and the U.K.

Early Monday, Obama called peace in Northern Ireland a ""blueprint"" for those living amid conflict around the world, while acknowledging that the calm between Catholics and Protestants will face further tests. Summoning young people to take responsibility for their country's future, Obama warned there is ""more to lose now than there's ever been.""

""The terms of peace may be negotiated by political leaders, but the fate of peace is up to each of us,"" Obama said Monday during remarks at Belfast's Waterfront Hall to 1,800 students and adults. The glass-fronted building would never have been built during the city's long era of car bombs.

Significant progress has been made in the 15 years since the U.S.-brokered Good Friday Accords, including a Catholic-Protestant government and the disarmament of the IRA and outlawed Protestant groups responsible for most of the 3,700 death toll. But tearing down Belfast's nearly 100 ""peace lines"" — barricades of brick, steel and barbed wire that divide neighborhoods, roads and even one Belfast playground — is still seen by many as too dangerous.

First lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha, who also made the trip from Washington, were to spend Monday and Tuesday in Dublin while the president attended the G-8 summit. Later Tuesday, the first family departs for Germany, where the president will meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel and speak at the Brandenburg Gate.

(CNN) —

The United States and its allies aren’t “blind” or “stupid” when it comes to negotiations with Iran, Washington’s top diplomat said Sunday after nuclear talks with the Islamic republic broke up without an agreement.

“We are absolutely determined that this would be a good deal, or there’ll be no deal,” Secretary of State John Kerry told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

“This is a new overture, and it has to be put to the test very, very carefully,” he added.

But Israel’s prime minister cheered the failure of the talks, saying the agreement reportedly on the table would have been a “jackpot” for Iran. Iran’s president, meanwhile, tried to reassure his parliament that he won’t trade away Tehran’s ability to produce nuclear fuel in any agreement to lift international sanctions.

After two days of foreign minister-level talks, negotiations between Iran and the five U.N. Security Council members plus Germany ended in Geneva, Switzerland, early Sunday. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, told reporters, “A lot of concrete progress has been achieved, but some differences remain.”

Negotiations are set to resume November 20, with Ashton and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif attending.

“I think we are all on the same wavelength, and that’s important,” Zarif said. “And that gives us the impetus to go forward.”

Iran insists its aims are peaceful

Iran has refused U.N. Security Council demands to halt its production of enriched uranium, which can be used to power nuclear reactors or in extremely high concentrations, to make an atomic bomb.

It insists it wants to build civilian power plants, but Western powers and Israel accuse it of harboring ambitions for a nuclear weapon. U.N. inspectors reported in 2011 that they could no longer verify the Iranian program was strictly peaceful.

Iran’s refusal to stop enriching uranium has led to sanctions that have crippled its economy, slashing its crude oil exports and triggering widespread inflation at home. But President Hassan Rouhani, whose overtures to the West since taking office in August raised hopes of a deal, said Sunday that Tehran has its own “red lines” that his government won’t cross.

“The rights of the Iranian nation and national interests are our red lines, and those rights include nuclear rights within the framework of international law, as well as enrichment on Iranian soil,” Rouhani told lawmakers, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.

But nonproliferation expert Joseph Cirincione told CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS” that the outlines of a deal appear clear, and he expected one would be clinched “very soon.”

“We’ve seen some remarkable developments over the last couple days, including the normalization of U.S and Iranian dialogue,” Cirincione said. “We now take it for granted that the secretary of state should talk to Iran’s foreign minister, but that hadn’t happened in 34 years until last September.”

What’s on the table in talks

Two senior U.S. administration officials said that in the proposal on the table, Iran would agree to stop enriching uranium to a concentration of 20% – well above the level needed to fuel a nuclear power plant, though still far below what’s needed to produce a nuclear weapon. Tehran would render most of its existing stockpile of 20% enriched uranium unusable under the proposal.

In addition, it would agree not to use its advanced IR-2 centrifuges, which can operate five times faster than older models used in its enrichment plants. And it wouldn’t activate a heavy-water reactor at Arak, which can be used to produce plutonium. That’s a demand that France in particular insisted upon, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said.

Iran’s nuclear capabilities

The officials said that in return, the P5+1 powers of the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany would unfreeze some Iranian assets held in banks overseas and consider easing sanctions banning trade in gold, precious metals and petrochemicals. Other sweeteners were also under consideration, they said.

One of the officials said the deal was designed to delay the point at which Iran could develop a nuclear weapon while providing temporary, reversible sanctions relief. But Fabius told radio station France Inter on Saturday that while Paris wanted a deal, it wouldn’t agree to a “fool’s game” – and that the proposal on the table at that time was unsatisfactory.

“Thank God for France,” U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a leading Republican who is pushing for another round of sanctions on Iran, told CNN’s “State of the Union.” The Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, told ABC’s “This Week” that the United States “can’t want the deal more than Iranians.”

Graham: New sanctions on Iran needed

And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had criticized the negotiations last week, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that Iran should have to dismantle its existing centrifuges and the Arak reactor as part of any agreement.

“Iran gives practically nothing, and it gets a hell of a lot. That’s not a good deal,” Netanyahu said. He said other Arab states shared his opinion.

“And you know, when you have the Arabs and Israelis speaking in one voice – it doesn’t happen very often – I think it’s worth paying attention to.”

Kerry: We know what we’re doing

Kerry told NBC that critics are underestimating the negotiators.

“Some of the most serious and capable, expert people in our government, who have spent a lifetime dealing both with Iran as well as with nuclear weapon and nuclear armament and proliferation, are engaged in our negotiation. We are not blind, and I don’t think we’re stupid,” Kerry said.

“I think we have a pretty strong sense of how to measure whether or not we are acting in the interests of our country and of the globe, and particularly of our allies like Israel and Gulf states and others in the region.”

The State Department dispatched a top Kerry deputy, Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman, to Jerusalem to discuss the Geneva talks with Israeli officials, a senior State Department official told reporters on condition of anonymity.

For years, international leaders have been fearful of the instability a nuclear-armed Iran could bring to the Middle East. Those fears, for example, include the possibility of a pre-emptive Israeli strike that could spark a broader conflict. In the past, Iran has threatened Israel with military attack.

They also include concerns that an Iranian bomb could spur other countries in the region to seek nuclear weapons of their own, leading to a spiraling arms race in the region.

Israel is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons, though it has never declared itself to be a nuclear power.

http://news.yahoo.com/wikileaks-snowden-going-ecuador-seek-asylum-170935684.html,,[],WikiLeaks: Snowden going to Ecuador to seek asylum,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Admitted leaker Edward Snowden took flight Sunday in evasion of U.S. authorities, seeking asylum in Ecuador and leaving the Obama administration scrambling to determine its next step in what became a game of diplomatic cat-and-mouse.

The former National Security Agency contractor and CIA technician fled Hong Kong and arrived at the Moscow airport, where he planned to spend the night before boarding an Aeroflot flight to Cuba. Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said his government received an asylum request from Snowden, and the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks said it would help him.

""He goes to the very countries that have, at best, very tense relationships with the United States,"" said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., adding that she feared Snowden would trade more U.S. secrets for asylum. ""This is not going to play out well for the national security interests of the United States.""

The move left the U.S. with limited options as Snowden's itinerary took him on a tour of what many see as anti-American capitals. Ecuador in particular has rejected the United States' previous efforts at cooperation, and has been helping WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, avoid prosecution by allowing him to stay at its embassy in London.

Snowden gave The Guardian and The Washington Post documents disclosing U.S. surveillance programs that collect vast amounts of phone records and online data in the name of foreign intelligence, but often sweep up information on American citizens. Officials have the ability to collect phone and Internet information broadly but need a warrant to examine specific cases where they believe terrorism is involved.

Snowden had been in hiding for several weeks in Hong Kong, a former British colony with a high degree of autonomy from mainland China. The United States formally sought Snowden's extradition from Hong Kong but was rebuffed; Hong Kong officials said the U.S. request did not fully comply with their laws.

Story continues

The Justice Department rejected that claim, saying its request met all of the requirements of the extradition treaty between the U.S. and Hong Kong.

During conversations last week, including a phone call Wednesday between Attorney General Eric Holder and Hong Kong Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen, Hong Kong officials never raised any issues regarding sufficiency of the U.S. request, a Justice spokesperson said.

A State Department official said the United States was in touch through diplomatic and law enforcement channels with countries that Snowden could travel through or to, reminding them that Snowden is wanted on criminal charges and reiterating Washington's position that Snowden should only be permitted to travel back to the U.S.

Those officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the case.

The Justice Department said it would ""pursue relevant law enforcement cooperation with other countries where Mr. Snowden may be attempting to travel.""

Russia's state ITAR-Tass news agency and Interfax cited an unnamed Aeroflot airline official as saying Snowden was on the plane that landed Sunday afternoon in Moscow.

Upon his arrival, Snowden did not leave Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. One explanation could be that he wasn't allowed; a U.S. official said Snowden's passport had been revoked, and special permission from Russian authorities would have been needed.

Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House's National Security Council, said, ""Given our intensified cooperation after the Boston marathon bombings and our history of working with Russia on law enforcement matters — including returning numerous high-level criminals back to Russia at the request of the Russian government — we expect the Russian government to look at all options available to expel Mr. Snowden back to the U.S. to face justice for the crimes with which he is charged.""

The Russian media report said Snowden intended to fly to Cuba on Monday and then on to Caracas, Venezuela.

U.S. lawmakers scoffed. ""The freedom trail is not exactly China-Russia-Cuba-Venezuela, so I hope we'll chase him to the ends of the earth, bring him to justice and let the Russians know there'll be consequences if they harbor this guy,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

With each suspected flight, efforts to secure Snowden's return to the United States appeared more complicated if not impossible. The United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, but does with Cuba, Venezuela and Ecuador. Even with an extradition agreement though, any country could give Snowden a political exemption.

The likelihood that any of these countries would stop Snowden from traveling on to Ecuador seemed remote. While diplomatic tensions have thawed in recent years, Cuba and the United States are hardly allies after a half century of distrust.

Venezuela, too, could prove difficult. Former President Hugo Chavez was a sworn enemy of the United States and his successor, Nicolas Maduro, earlier this year called Obama ""grand chief of devils."" The two countries do not exchange ambassadors.

U.S. pressure on Caracas also might be problematic given its energy exports. The U.S. Energy Information Agency reports Venezuela sent the United States 900,000 barrels of crude oil each day in 2012, making it the fourth-largest foreign source of U.S. oil.

""I think 10 percent of Snowden's issues are now legal, and 90 percent political,"" said Douglas McNabb, an expert in international extradition and a senior principal at international criminal defense firm McNabb Associates.

Assange's lawyer, Michael Ratner, said Snowden's options aren't numerous.

""You have to have a country that's going to stand up to the United States,"" Ratner said. ""You're not talking about a huge range of countries here.""

That is perhaps why Snowden first stopped in Russia, a nation with complicated relations with Washington.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""aiding and abetting Snowden's escape,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

""Allies are supposed to treat each other in decent ways, and Putin always seems almost eager to put a finger in the eye of the United States,"" Schumer said. ""That's not how allies should treat one another, and I think it will have serious consequences for the United States-Russia relationship.""

It also wasn't clear Snowden was finished with disclosing highly classified information.

""I am very worried about what else he has,"" said Rep. Loretta Sanchez, a California Democrat who sits on the House Homeland Security Committee.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she had been told Snowden had perhaps more than 200 sensitive documents.

Ros-Lehtinen spoke with CNN. Graham spoke to ""Fox News Sunday."" Schumer was on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Sanchez appeared on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Feinstein was on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

Editor’s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of “Jimmy Carter” and “Governing America.”

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama will speak to the nation Tuesday, trying to build public support for a military strike against Syria.

His request to Congress to endorse action reaches the House and Senate at an extraordinarily difficult moment. Vote counts suggest that the president might not win the support he is seeking.

Democrats and Republicans are uncertain about backing the president. The public remains skeptical as well. According to one NBC poll, only 42% of the public endorsed using military force against Syria. After Afghanistan and Iraq, the nation is weary of war. The bar has been raised for further intervention.

Larry Levanti Julian Zelizer

Although presidential speeches rarely are able to fundamentally reshape public opinion, Obama must give his strongest effort if he does not want to end up in an embarrassing situation for his administration and one that could undercut the military effort that he is proposing.

If Obama is going to deliver a speech that matters, he must answer some basic questions about the Syrian intervention:

Why are we entering this conflict?

For many Americans, the arguments behind American intervention in Syria remain murky. This is not just about Syria being a confusing and complex situation, but also has to do with a general uncertainty about the objectives of American foreign policy in 2013.

In each era of foreign policy, policymakers have put forth strong ideological arguments that framed public policy about war and peace. Each period had substantial numbers of dissenters, but at least there was something concrete to argue about. During the 1930s and early 1940s, the fight against fascism was the driving force behind decisions about intervention. “Yesterday, December 7, 1941 – a date which will live in infamy – the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan,” President Franklin D. Roosevelt explained the next day, when asking Congress for a declaration of war.

From the mid-1940s through the late 1980s, the fight against communism was the focal point of policy. Since that time, the objectives of American foreign policy have been less clear. When President Truman asked for congressional support to use military power in Korea in July 1950, he said that the conflict in Korea “has made it clear, beyond all doubt, that the international Communist movement is willing to use armed invasion, to conquer independent nations.”

In the early 1990s, policymakers turned their attention to rogue states such as Iraq that were said to pose dangers to the stability of key regions. After 9/11, attention turned to international terrorist networks like al Qaeda.

On September 20, 2001, President Bush told the nation, “The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends. It is not our many Arab friends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them.”

The larger framework surrounding the Syrian intervention is less clear. The administration has offered a number of arguments as to why the United States needs to intervene, from the message it would send to Iran about nuclear weapons, to the urgency of responding to gross violations of human rights. The president must offer a compelling reason why a situation such as this deserves national resources. If humanitarian interventions are to become a new norm, the president should make the case and offer a set of coherent principles for future conflicts.

What is the justification for this intervention and is it based on sound intelligence?

One of the main sources of public cynicism about American foreign policy comes from the fact that presidents have often used incorrect information or purposely flawed data to justify military operations that result in huge human and financial costs. American history is filled with such examples.

The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964, which provided President Lyndon Johnson the blanket authority he needed to expand America’s presence in Vietnam and the region, was based on spurious data about alleged attacks on U.S. Navy destroyers by the North Vietnamese. Congress gave Johnson wide-ranging authority to conduct military operations. It was “like grandma’s nightshirt, it covered everything,” he later said.

President George W. Bush’s request to Congress for the authorization to use force in Iraq in 2003 was justified through incorrect intelligence about the presence of weapons of mass destruction and untrue reports of connections between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden.

Obama, who ran his 2008 campaign based on criticism of all the problems with Bush’s war, needs to demonstrate to the public that he has made a decision based on the soundest of evidence.

The revelations about the National Security Agency have already raised public skepticism about the discrepancy between what Obama says in public and what he does behind the scenes. Without revealing sensitive information to the public, it is important that the president make a convincing case that the intelligence behind this decision is sound, that it has been examined and cross-examined, that the Syrian government did use chemical weapons and that the Syrians do pose a substantial threat to the region.

He needs to explain why chemical weapons pose a threat that deserves a military strike as opposed to other weapons or mechanisms of mass destruction. Why act here, but not with regard to other atrocities or risks? The nation cannot afford another war based on false premises.

What is the mission?

Presidents have gone into many wars without a clear sense of what they hope to achieve. Once troops are sent into a war or even after the Air Force is sent in to strike targets, conflicts can take unpredictable turns and escalate quickly. If the administration doesn’t articulate a clear sense of what it hopes to accomplish at the outset, it allows for open-ended possibilities for escalation.

When President George H.W. Bush went to war with Iraq in 1990, the confusion over the objectives led to great frustration when Americans saw that Hussein remained in power after the celebrations of U.S. victory had taken place. Bush’s son’s war in Iraq proved even more frustrating, as there was growing awareness that the administration was entering into a much broader mission of nation-building than many Americans had anticipated.

When the new government that emerged from the rubble in Iraq remained unstable and the U.S. seemed to be pouring endless resources into the country, many Americans were left with a sense that the operation had not been worthwhile.

Obama can’t afford to make the the mistake of leaving his objectives ill-defined. It is possible that quick and targeted airstrikes will destroy the chemical weapons capacity of the Syrians, though that would still leave in place a dictator whom the president has characterized as inhumane and brutal. It is also possible that airstrikes would result in retaliation that would trigger a bigger conflict, which would in turn create greater pressure for regime change.

The president did the right thing by engaging Congress in this decision rather than trying to circumvent the legislative branch. But in this case, with the memories of Iraq looming large, he won’t have luck just asking for blind support.

In his speech, the president must answer these questions in simple and direct terms. This would do a great deal to build confidence in the operation, and to build a foundation for longer term support of this intervention should it be needed.

Sanger', 'Nicole Perlroth']",Chinese Hackers Resume Attacks on U.S. Targets,"Mandiant said that the Chinese hackers had stopped their attacks after they were exposed in February and removed their spying tools from the organizations they had infiltrated. But over the past two months, they have gradually begun attacking the same victims from new servers and have reinserted many of the tools that enable them to seek out data without detection. They are now operating at 60 percent to 70 percent of the level they were working at before, according to a study by Mandiant requested by The New York Times.

The Times hired Mandiant to investigate an attack that originated in China on its news operations last fall. Mandiant is not currently working for The New York Times Company.

Mandiant’s findings match those of Crowdstrike, another security company that has also been tracking the group. Adam Meyers, director of intelligence at Crowdstrike, said that apart from a few minor changes in tactics, it was “business as usual” for the Chinese hackers.

The subject of Chinese attacks is expected to be a central issue in an upcoming visit to China by President Obama’s national security adviser, Thomas Donilon, who has said that dealing with China’s actions in cyberspace is now moving to the center of the complex security and economic relationship between the two countries.

But hopes for progress on the issue are limited. When the Pentagon released its report this month officially identifying the Chinese military as the source of years of attacks, the Chinese Foreign Ministry denied the accusation, and People’s Daily, which reflects the views of the Communist Party, called the United States “the real ‘hacking empire,’ ” saying it “has continued to strengthen its network tools for political subversion against other countries.” Other Chinese organizations and scholars cited American and Israeli cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities as evidence of American hypocrisy.

At the White House, Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said Sunday that “what we have been seeking from China is for it to investigate our concerns and to start a dialogue with us on cyberissues.” She noted that China “agreed last month to start a new working group,” and that the administration hoped to win “longer-term changes in China’s behavior, including by working together to establish norms against the theft of trade secrets and confidential business information.”

In a report to be issued Wednesday, a private task force led by Mr. Obama’s former director of national intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, and his former ambassador to China, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., lays out a series of proposed executive actions and Congressional legislation intended to raise the stakes for China."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/world/asia/us-confronts-cyber-cold-war-with-china.html,2013-02-25 00:00:00,['David E. Sanger'],U.S. Confronts Cyber-Cold War With China,"WASHINGTON — When the Obama administration circulated to the nation’s Internet providers last week a lengthy confidential list of computer addresses linked to a hacking group that has stolen terabytes of data from American corporations, it left out one crucial fact: that nearly every one of the digital addresses could be traced to the neighborhood in Shanghai that is headquarters to the Chinese military’s cybercommand.

That deliberate omission underscored the heightened sensitivities inside the Obama administration over just how directly to confront China’s untested new leadership over the hacking issue, as the administration escalates demands that China halt the state-sponsored attacks that Beijing insists it is not mounting.

The issue illustrates how different the worsening cyber-cold war between the world’s two largest economies is from the more familiar superpower conflicts of past decades — in some ways less dangerous, in others more complex and pernicious.

Administration officials say they are now more willing than before to call out the Chinese directly — as Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. did last week in announcing a new strategy to combat theft of intellectual property. But President Obama avoided mentioning China by name — or Russia or Iran, the other two countries the president worries most about — when he declared in his State of the Union address that “we know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets.” He added: “Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions and our air traffic control systems.”"
http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/technolog/cyber-threats-build-ceos-ask-light-touch-1C8855074,2013-03-14 00:00:00+00:00,"['Susan Heavey', 'Alina Selyukh']","As cyber threats build, CEOs ask for 'light touch'","WASHINGTON — Corporate leaders from the defense, technology, energy and banking industries told President Barack Obama on Wednesday they agreed cyber attacks were a top security threat but that they were looking for a ""light touch"" from the government in response to the risk.

Obama and his top security advisers met with chief executives from 13 companies in the White House Situation Room to talk about how the government and private sector could improve cyber security, including the need for legislation.

The White House has elevated the issue after efforts to improve U.S. cyber defenses through new laws failed in Congress last year.

""I think we all agreed — and that included the administration and the president — that we want as light a government touch on this as possible,"" Honeywell International's David Cote told CNBC after the meeting.

""Flexibility is important, because this is the kind of threat that changes very quickly,"" he said.

The meeting came a day after U.S. intelligence leaders said for the first time that cyber attacks and cyber espionage had supplanted terrorism as the top security threat facing the United States.

Obama signed an executive order last month to encourage information-sharing, which most business leaders welcome, and voluntary security standards, which have been a point of contention.

But the executive action is not as strong as law and Obama has urged Congress to try again on legislation. ""There are ways that we can harden our critical infrastructure, our financial sector,"" Obama said in an interview with ABC earlier on Wednesday. ""They need to get this done.""

Obama took the unusual step of meeting with corporate executives in the Situation Room, the secure site in the West Wing basement where the president meets with national security advisers during crises.

The meeting included Randall Stephenson of AT&T, Wes Bush of Northrop Grumman, Rex Tillerson of Exxon Mobil, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, and Nicholas Akins of American Electric Power Co..

""The threat is real ... there is a consistent, persistent threat here that we need to be concerned about as a country,"" Cote told reporters after the meeting.

This week, U.S. authorities said they were investigating reports that Obama's own family had been hit by hacking.

The president said in the ABC interview that he did not know whether reports were true that hackers had posted financial and personal information online about his wife, Michelle, along with other high-profile Americans.

""It would not shock me if some information ... among people who presumably have pretty good safeguards against it, still gets out,"" he said.

Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told ""Fox News Sunday"" that he thinks the president will respond soon with military action.

However, he suggested waiting until Congress returns next week to seek its authorization and that the United States respond “in a surgical way.”

“I hope the president will … do something in a very surgical and proportional way, something that gets their attention,” he said. “At the same time, I hope it's the kind of action that doesn't move us away from the policy we have right now where we want to see the Syrian opposition group taking the lead on the ground.”

Corker’s comments followed a top Obama administration official saying there is ""very little doubt"" Syrian President Bashar Assad and his forces used a chemical weapon on civilians Wednesday near Damascus, killing at least 100 people.

The announcement came as the Syrian government appeared close to allowing United Nations inspectors to visit the site of the reported attack and a U.N. spokesperson saying an inspection team is preparing to conduct an on-site fact-finding mission Monday.

Corker was joined on the show by New York Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who called the alleged civilian attacks last week “horrific"" and urged the U.S. to respond with its NATO allies.

“But we have to move, and we have to move now,” Engel said.

Their comments come after almost a year of lawmakers pressing Obama to make good on his statement about Syria “crossing a red line” by using chemical weapons.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel suggested Friday that the Pentagon might move naval forces closer to Syria in preparation for a possible decision by Obama to order military strikes.

However, U.S. defense officials have said the Navy has already sent a fourth warship armed with ballistic missiles into the eastern Mediterranean Sea, with lawmakers saying the best strategy now might by using Cruise missiles fired from off shore.

Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, a member of the chamber’s Armed Services Committee, told CBS’ “Face the Nation” the United States cannot let itself get into a situation in Syria “where this becomes a springboard for a general military option.""

""We have to verify (the chemical attack) was directed by the Assad regime because that will allow us to build an international coalition, which is absolutely necessary to take any more steps in Syria,” he added.

Syrian allies on Sunday also reportedly warned the United States about taking military action. Russia’s foreign ministry warned the U.S. about repeating the “mistakes of the past” and said unilateral military action against Syria will have a “devastating impact” on Middle East stability.

Massoud Jazayeri, Iran’s deputy chief of staff for armed forces, warns the U.S. about crossing a ""red line"" on Syria, saying such action would have ""severe consequences,"" according to Reuters.

The reports of thousands killed or stricken by chemical weapons last week is the latest allegation about such tactics in the Middle East country’s roughly 2-year-long civil war.

The White House has been reluctant to take direct military actions, instead supplying rebel forces with non-lethal aid, weighing military options and trying to garner international support.

The administration official said Sunday that the U.S. intelligence community made the assessment about likely chemical use based on ""the reported number of victims, reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured and witness accounts.""

The official said the White House also thinks Assad and his forces originally denied United Nations investigators immediate access to the site of the reported attack to give the evidence time to degrade. In addition, the White House thinks any inspection now will be too late, the official said.

The administration statement follows a meeting Saturday between President Obama and his National Security Council that concluded with the White House saying the administration was still “gathering facts.”

The official spoke Sunday on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly.

The reports of thousands killed or stricken by chemical weapons last week is the latest allegation about such tactics in the Middle East country’s roughly 2-year-long civil war.

The White House meeting was attended by at least 15 members of the president’s security council, including Hagel, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry, but it was unclear who was in the Oval Office. In addition to the president holding the meeting, he spoke this weekend about the international crisis with British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Francois Hollande.

Syrian state media accused rebels of using chemical arms against government troops in clashes Saturday near Damascus, while Doctors Without Borders said it has tallied 355 deaths from the purported chemical weapons attack on Wednesday.

The international aid group said three hospitals it supports in the eastern Damascus region reported receiving roughly 3,600 patients with ""neurotoxic symptoms"" over less than three hours on Wednesday morning when the attack in the eastern Ghouta area took place. Of those, 355 died.

U.S. confirmation took more than four months after rebels similarly reported chemical attacks in February, though in this instance a U.N. chemical weapons team is already on the ground in Syria. Assad's government, then as now, has denied the claims as baseless.

Sokolski']",Let’s Be Honest About Israel’s Nukes - The New York Times,"Mr. Obama, like his predecessors, pretends that he doesn’t know anything about them. This taboo impedes discussions within Washington and internationally. It has kept America from pressing Egypt and Syria to ratify the chemical and biological weapons conventions. Doing so would have brought immediate objections about American acceptance of Israel’s nuclear weapons.

What sustains this pretense is the myth that America is locked into covering up Israeli nuclear bombs because of a 1969 agreement between President Richard M. Nixon and Israel’s prime minister, Golda Meir. For Mr. Nixon, it was mainly about gaining Israeli support in the cold war. He and Mrs. Meir understood the need to discourage the Soviets from providing their Arab allies with nuclear weapons. A declared Israeli nuclear arsenal would have led to pressure for Moscow to do so. But such cold war reasons for America to stay mum evaporated decades ago. Everyone knows the Israelis have nuclear bombs. Today, the main effect of the ambiguity is to prevent serious regional arms-control negotiations.

All other countries in the region are members of the nonproliferation treaty, but there are still unresolved issues. Syria was caught building an illicit nuclear reactor in 2007, which Israel swiftly bombed. Mr. Assad still has not allowed international inspectors to fully investigate that obliterated reactor site. And Syria’s ally Iran is suspected of trying to assemble its own weapons program to challenge Israel’s nuclear monopoly. Indeed, many analysts believed that Mr. Obama’s decision to issue a “red line” barring the use of chemical weapons in Syria was in fact driven by the perceived need to demonstrate that he was prepared to use force against Iran if it moved further toward nuclear weapons.

This witches’ brew was supposed to become the subject of an international conference, mandated in 2010 by the unanimous vote of the members of the nonproliferation treaty, including the United States. But that conference hasn’t happened, in part because of White House ambivalence about how it might affect Israel.

In April, the American assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation, Thomas M. Countryman, expressed hope that the conference would be held by this fall. And earlier this month, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, urged all parties to set a conference date “as quickly as possible.” He also argued that it should include Israel and Iran. Russia attempted to include the conference in last week’s agreement, but Secretary of State John Kerry resisted. It is not going to go away."

Granting of temporary asylum latest in a string of slights

MOSCOW — Russia's granting of temporary asylum for NSA leaker Edward Snowden is the latest in a string of slights against President Obama by Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose actions have brought U.S.-Russian relations to their lowest point in decades, experts say.

""His presence here creates additional problems in Russia-U.S. relations,"" said Alexander Konovalov, president of the Moscow-based Institute of Strategic Studies and Analysis.

""As long as Snowden is here, we won't be able to achieve agreement on any bilateral issues,"" Konovalov said.

The Snowden affair has become so toxic that the White House is considering canceling a planned meeting between Putin and President Obama in September.

""It's pretty bad,"" says Ariel Cohen, a Russia expert at the Heritage Foundation. ""U.S.-Russia relations are at their nadir, rock bottom since the end of the Cold War.""

Despite demands in the U.S. Congress for actions against Russia, the Kremlin portrayed Snowden's stay as a small affair.

""This issue is not important enough to affect political relations,"" RIA Novosti quoted Putin's aide, Yury Ushakov, as saying Thursday.

Russia's hospitality to a man wanted by the United States on charges of espionage is only one of several instances in which Russia has emerged as an adversary, frustrating U.S. aims globally.

Since Obama has been president, Russia has used its veto power in the U.N. Security Council to frustrate U.S.-backed measures against Iran's nuclear program. Putin has also supplied weapons to Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, a dictator whom Obama has said he wants removed from power.

And for more than a year Putin has been executing a campaign to repress and jail political opponents who have appealed to the West for help.

All this comes after Obama's vow early in office to hit a ""reset"" button in U.S.-Russian relations by listening more to Russian concerns. Obama suspended longtime efforts to deploy a defensive missile shield in Eastern Europe at Russia's request, and then backed its permanent membership in the World Trade Organization.

Obama also acquiesced to Putin's position of nuclear arms reductions, and famously told former prime minister Dmitri Medvedev in 2012 that he would have ""more flexibility"" on U.S-Russia issues if elected to a second term.

Putin's foreign relations appear focused on his oft-stated goal of returning his nation to the superpower status it held before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Putin says he is arming Assad because he is concerned a Sunni Islamist victory there will spill over into Russia's Caucasus region, where Russia has fought a decades-long war against an Islamist insurgency, Cohen said.

He opposed the Western-backed military alliance that helped to topple dictator Moammar Gadhafi, claiming the onetime Soviet client state of Libya should not be meddled with.

In other differences with the United States, he accuses the U.S. of fomenting rebellion in his country when it stands up for the democratic rights of his political opponents. Russia under Putin has banned U.S. organizations that promote political participation and free speech overseas.

Russian ""policy is to blame the United States for everything that is going on in the world and in Russia and attempt to consolidate popular support of the regime by manufacturing an external threat,"" Cohen said. ""Communist Russia used to do the same thing.""

The freeze has enormous consequences in the Middle East. Islamist terror movements have yet to be defeated there and revolutionary forces threaten to turn out U.S. allies in Jordan, Bahrain and Yemen.

Russia can be a force for cooperation or agitation, Russia analysts say.

""The question is what kind of relationship can we have with the Putin government the way it's behaving (now),"" says Andrew Weiss, a Russia expert in the Clinton White House who's now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""The answer is not much.""

The last time Putin and Obama met, at the G-8 summit in Northern Ireland, they disagreed over Syria and both appeared unhappy in each other's presence. Other high-level meetings between U.S. and Russian diplomats and ministers in Moscow and Washington have pushed the two sides even further apart, Weiss says.

Relations between the two countries were worse during the 2008 Russian invasion of the Republic of Georgia, which caused a breakdown of senior-level contacts between U.S. and Russian leaders, prompting Obama to seek to ""reset"" the relationship, Weiss says. But lately, ""the Russians are stonewalling (U.S. efforts) every step of the way.""

The White House has signaled that it may skip a planned two-day visit to Moscow before the planned St. Petersburg G-20 summit of the world's wealthiest nations in September.

""Putin has never been responsive to efforts to get him engaged in U.S.-Russian relations, going back to January 2009,"" Weiss says. ""His current motivation for wanting to host Obama is to show the Russian people that he's one of the big boys, that Obama is just one more of a parade of international visitors seeking an audience with him, and that no one questions his legitimacy.""

Rather than ""chase after Putin"" and hope the Russians have a change of heart, Weiss says it would be better to cool it with the Russians and ""have a period of disengagement for the next few months.""

John Bolton, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, says Russian anti-American policies show the failure of Obama's ""appeasement policy"" toward Russia.

As long as U.S. policy is conciliatory toward Russia, the more concessions Russian leaders will push to deny the U.S. national missile defense capability, to expand Russian influence in nations of the former Soviet Union and to counter U.S. intent in the Middle East and Iran, Bolton says.

""They're advancing their interests at our expense,"" Bolton says. ""We're pressing the reset button and they're pressing us.""

Konovalov says that Snowden is a liability to Russia and that Putin will likely use his influence to have him taken by one of the Latin American countries, such as Venezuela or Ecuador, that have said they may be willing to take him in.

""Political asylum, with a chance for citizenship, that's a bad scenario,"" he said.

Russian rights activists said Snowden may regret his decision to remain in Russia.

""I can say that I certainly have sympathy for him because he has performed a deed for the sake of the freedom of information,"" Lyudmila Alexeyeva, head of the Moscow Helsinki Group, said. ""But because of this deed, he got out of the United States into Russia, where freedom of information is being infringed upon to an immeasurably greater extent than in America.""

USA TODAY

Six world powers reached an agreement with Iran on its disputed nuclear program

Iran agreed to limit nuclear activities in return for relief of up to %247 billion in sanctions

Kerry promoted the interim Iran agreement on Sunday talk shows

A final nuclear deal with Iran is ""not a question of trust,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday, but of verification that the Iranians are giving up on the prospect of nuclear weapons.

Kerry spoke as the negotiators who crafted a six-month deal with Iran over the weekend exulted while Israel, Persian Gulf states and members of Congress criticized the accord for giving Iran too much.

Kerry hit Sunday morning talk shows across the dial Sunday, telling audiences that without verification, there can be no real deal. Appearing on CNN's State of the Union, Kerry said, ""Verification is the key,"" adding that the United States enters into more negotiations with Iran ""with eyes absolutely wide open. We have no illusions.""

Said Kerry: ""We're trying to set up a process by which we can verify, know what we're doing, restraining the program while we negotiate the comprehensive deal.""

Six world powers reached an interim agreement late Saturday night with Iran on its disputed nuclear program after four days of talks in Geneva.

In the six-month interim deal, Iran agreed to limit nuclear activities in return for relief of up to $7 billion in sanctions that have hurt its economy.

""Israel and the United States absolutely share the same goal here,"" Kerry said on ABC's This Week. ""There is no daylight between us with respect to what we want to achieve, at this point. We both want to make it certain Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And Iran cannot be in a place where they can break out and suddenly get that nuclear weapon.""

In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the agreement, calling it ""a historic mistake.""

""Today the world became a much more dangerous place because the most dangerous regime in the world made a significant step in obtaining the most dangerous weapons in the world,"" Netanyahu said.

President Obama called Netanyahu Sunday afternoon and reassured him the United States would keep Israel up to date with developments. ""Consistent with our commitment to consult closely with our Israeli friends, the President told the Prime Minister that he wants the United States and Israel to begin consultations immediately regarding our efforts to negotiate a comprehensive solution,"" a White House announcement on the call said.

Both Kerry and Obama have called on Congress to forgo additional sanctions on Iran, saying they could kill the interim agreement — but some lawmakers have indicated they will push forward anyway, expressing skepticism about Iran's trustworthiness.

One prominent Democrat — Sen. Charles Schumer of New York — said the deal ""does not seem proportional"" because ""Iran simply freezes its nuclear capabilities while we reduce the sanctions.""

The ""disproportionality"" of the deal ""makes it more likely that Democrats and Republicans will join together and pass additional sanctions when we return in December,"" Schumer said.

Obama, however, can veto any additional sanctions if they pass Congress.

Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have also criticized the agreement.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said the agreement should be given a chance to work, saying that ""the initial six-month framework gives us a chance to test Iranian intentions before reaching a more comprehensive agreement to prevent a nuclear Iran.""

Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., issued a brief statement: ""It is a choice between a pause or imminent war. I choose a verifiable pause.""

Over in the House, Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the interim agreement should have forced Iran to give up nuclear enrichment now. He called the agreement ""disappointing"" during an appearance on CNN.

""I do think sanctions should always be hanging there, because that's what brought Iran to the table in the first place,"" Engel said. ""And I don't think you make them bargain a good faith by going squishy.""

Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., the committee chairman, denounced the agreement, telling CNN's State of the Union that Iran is ""a state sponsor of terrorism trying to get a bomb.""

Iran says its enrichment program is designed to generate energy for peaceful domestic purposes."

John McCain said Thursday that he will place a hold on the renomination of the nation's top military officer, after he and Army Gen. Martin Dempsey got into a heated exchange on the Hill over the administration's handling of the Syrian civil war.

McCain clashed with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as he suggested Dempsey was partly responsible for a lackluster response to the Assad regime's aggression.

After the exchange, the Arizona Republican told reporters he would place a hold on Dempsey's nomination for a second term. A ""hold"" refers to the Senate practice in which a lawmaker can stall a nomination in order to extract information or assurances out of a nominee -- in this case, McCain suggested Dempsey was not being forthcoming at the hearing about his views on Syria and other subjects.

[pullquote]

Dempsey told the Senate Armed Services Committee, which is considering his nomination for a second term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that he has provided President Obama with options for the use of force in Syria, where a civil war entering its third year has killed almost 93,000 people.

Dempsey said the issue is “under deliberation inside our agencies of government,” but did not provide additional details. He used the term “kinetic strikes,” but said the decision is ultimately one for elected officials.

“I must tell both the witnesses at the onset I'm very concerned about the role you've played over the last two years,” McCain said of Dempsey and Navy Adm. James Winnefeld while beginning his line of questioning. “General Dempsey and Admiral Winnefeld, do you believe the continued cost and risk of our inaction in Syria are now worse for our national security interest than the cost and risk associated with limited military action?”

“Senator, as we've discussed ...” Dempsey replied.

“I'd like to know an answer rather than a filibuster,” McCain shot back. “I have six minutes and 10 seconds.”

Dempsey then said the United States is at “greater risk” due to the emergence of violent extremist organizations in Syria, as is Iraq.

“You're not answering the question, General,” McCain said, before asking his original question again.

“With all due respect, Senator, you're asking me to agree that we've been inactive, and we have not been inactive,” Dempsey replied.

“We have not been inactive,” McCain said, to which Dempsey affirmed.

“This again gives validity to my concern,” McCain said. “Because, obviously, we may have — not been — inactive, but any observer knows that Bashar Assad is prevailing on the battlefield. One hundred thousand people have been killed. Hezbollah is there … And the situation is — much more dire than it was two years ago when you and Admiral Winnefeld came to office. And so, your answer is that we haven't been inactive.”

McCain then asked the question a third time, prompting Dempsey to testify he’s in favor of building a “moderate opposition” and then supporting it. The question to support that with “kinetic strike” is ultimately up for elected officials to make and not for the senior military leader of the nation, Dempsey said.

“This goes back to my concern about your role as chairman of the Joint Chiefs,” McCain replied. “The chairman of the Joint Chiefs is supposed to provide the best advice he can as far as our national security is concerned. That's why you are the sole military adviser.”

McCain then noted that Dempsey testified in February that he advised Obama to arm vetted units of the Syrian opposition. Then, in April, Dempsey no longer supported the opposition, McCain said.

“Now we read in published reports that the administration has decided to arm the Syrian opposition units,” McCain said. “How do we account for those pirouettes?”

Dempsey wouldn’t accept the term “pirouette,” he said.

“I would accept the term that we have adopted our approach based on what we know of the opposition,” he testified. “And if you recall, in the beginning of the year, there was a period where it was pretty evident that the extremist groups were prevailing inside the opposition. So I have not been wavering.”

In response to McCain's warning about putting the nomination on hold, Dempsey spokesman Col. Ed Thomas later put out this statement: ""The Chairman respects the confirmation process and, if confirmed for another two-year term, will be honored to serve at the pleasure of the President and with the consent of Congress.""

Other fireworks during the hearing included Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asking Dempsey directly whether Syria's embattled president, Bashar Assad, is winning the fight in the war-torn country.

“Currently the tide is shifting in his favor,” Dempsey testified.

Winnefeld, meanwhile, said if pressed, he would say Assad’s regime is winning.

“But not by much,” he testified.

He Previously Covered South Asia Mumbai', 'India', 'National Security The Washington Bureau.']",U.S. general willing to curb airstrikes in Afghan villages,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- The commander of the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan said Sunday that his forces were prepared to comply with President Hamid Karzai’s demand that Afghan forces stop requesting international airstrikes in residential areas.

Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. downplayed the effects of Karzai’s directive, even though Afghanistan’s fledgling security forces rely entirely on U.S. and NATO warplanes for air power against Taliban-led insurgents.

“We can continue to support the Afghan National Security Forces and meet the president’s intent,” Dunford said.

A day earlier, in a speech at the Afghan National Military Academy, Karzai railed against a joint Afghan-NATO attack last week that local officials said killed 10 civilians, including women and children, in addition to four Taliban commanders in eastern Kunar province. The Afghan leader said he would issue a decree that “no Afghan military and security forces in any circumstances can ask for the foreigners’ planes for carrying out operations in Afghanistan’s homes and villages.”

The remarks represented the latest broadside by Karzai against the coalition that has trained, equipped and financed the force of 350,000 soldiers and police who are due to take responsibility for Afghanistan’s security later this year.

Civilian casualties have long been a point of contention between Karzai and the coalition, reaching a crisis point last june when NATO launched an airstrike against insurgents who had taken shelter in a wedding party. Eighteen civilians were among the dead, and in the wake of the incident NATO implemented rules limiting airstrikes in populated areas. U.S. officials say that civilian casualties in coalition operations fell by 49% from 2011 to 2012 and that the number of children killed or wounded in air operations fell by nearly 40%.

“We have constraints and restraints on each operation” to minimize civilian casualties, Dunford said.

Last week, Karzai summoned Dunford to explain the Kunar attack. The coalition has declined to discuss the incident, saying only that it was investigating the reports of civilian deaths.

Military analysts said that Karzai’s decree, if issued, could hamstring Afghan security units, very few of which are capable of operating without coalition support. This spring, say U.S. officials, Afghan security forces will take the lead in security operations nationwide, setting up a crucial test for the young force as insurgent operations usually pick up in the warm-weather months.

“It could provide ground for the insurgency to increase their areas of operations,” said Jawed Kohistani, an independent military analyst in Kabul. “We have the summer coming and insurgent activities may increase, which puts more pressure on Afghan forces.

“I hope that the Afghan security forces and their leadership convince the president that there is need for NATO air support.”

The response to Karzai’s comments from Afghan military officials wasn’t immediately clear, but Dunford, who took over as coalition commander last week, was due to meet later Sunday with Sher Mohammad Karimi, the Afghan army chief of staff.

“We’re going to work through the details [of Karzai’s order] in the coming days,” Dunford said.

If airstrikes are limited, “there are other ways we can support the Afghan forces besides aviation,” Dunford added, without elaborating. Experts say that could signal an expanded role for U.S. and Afghan special forces or ground-based artillery systems, which carry the risk of inaccuracies.

http://news.yahoo.com/pentagon-sees-39-significant-interest-39-f-35-000106620--finance.html,,[],Pentagon sees 'significant interest' in F-35 from Gulf,"By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Strong demand from Gulf countries for Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jet has prompted Washington to grapple with the thorny question about releasing the jet to the region sooner than expected, a senior U.S. defense official said. Washington has already approved sales of the new stealth fighter to a range of allies, including Turkey, South Korea, Japan and Israel, but sales to the Gulf require a deeper review given U.S. policy guidelines that call for Israel to maintain a qualitative military edge in the Middle East. Talk about selling the plane to the United Arab Emirates and other U.S. allies in the Gulf came into the open during the Dubai air show last month, with potential buyers weighing whether to buy existing planes or wait for the U.S. government to release the new radar-evading F-35. Government officials and industry experts have said they do not expect Washington to allow the sale of the F-35 to Gulf countries until around 2020, just short of five years after Israel receives its first F-35 fighters in 2016. The senior U.S. official said the depth of interest in the new fighter - the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program - from Gulf countries came as a surprise to some in the U.S. government. ""We in the Defense Department now recognize that there is significant interest there,"" said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ""We knew eventually we were going to have to face that question, but it's come upon us a little sooner than we thought and we're going to have to deal with it."" Decisions about releasing sensitive technologies for sale to foreign countries are made by the State Department in consultation with the Pentagon and other government agencies. ""Eventually we're going to have to make a decision. We have a very structured process in place for doing that. And it takes a little bit of time,"" said the official. ""But we are going to have to make decisions on a tighter timeline than we thought."" U.S. government officials and weapons makers have put a bigger focus on foreign arms sales in recent years as a way to offset declines in projected U.S. military spending, and buttress the Obama administration's drive to build partnerships and help U.S. allies beef up their own military capacities. The United States is particularly concerned about reassuring Gulf nations that Washington remains committed to Middle East security despite differences over Iran and Syria. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel traveled to Bahrain this week and is expected to deliver that message during a meeting with regional defense officials on Saturday. Lockheed is building three F-35 models for the U.S. military and eight countries that helped fund its development: Britain, Canada, Australia, Italy, Norway, Turkey, Denmark and the Netherlands. Israel and Japan have also ordered the jet, and South Korea signaled last month that it also expected to order the F-35. ""The interest in the airplane is coming about simply because it's getting more mature and people are finally realizing that it's really going to happen,"" said the official. The $392 billion F-35 program has seen repeated delays and a 70 percent increase in costs over initial estimates, but U.S. officials say the program is making good progress now. Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan told a defense conference on Wednesday that the program had a ""tragic past,"" but the cost of the plane was coming down, flight testing was continuing, and most technical issues had been addressed.

MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — A United States military strike hit a vehicle carrying senior members of an al-Qaeda-linked militant group in Somalia on Monday, killing at least two people including the group's top explosives expert, a militant and a government intelligence official said.

A senior United States military official says there was a U.S. counterterrorism strike against a terrorist target in Somalia Monday but would give no further details. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no authorization to discuss the strike publicly.

An al-Shabab member who gave his name as Abu Mohamed said one of those killed was al-Shabab's top explosives expert, known as Anta. He said a drone fired at the car in Somalia's Middle Juba region. It was not clear how Mohamed would know it was a drone strike, except that he said no attack helicopters were seen.

A Somali intelligence official in Mogadishu said the attack occurred as al-Shabab members went to intervene in a clan dispute. The official insisted on anonymity because he is not authorized to share intelligence.

Earlier this month, United States Navy SEALs raided a coastal Somali town to take down a Kenyan al-Shabab member. The SEALs withdrew before capturing or killing their target. The target of that attack — Abdulkadir Mohamed Abdulkadir, known as Ikrima — was identified as the lead planner of a plot by al-Shabab to attack Kenya's parliament building and the United Nations office in Nairobi in 2011 and 2012.

If a drone strike in southern Somalia is confirmed, it will add evidence of the increasing importance Western powers view the counterterrorism operations in the Horn of Africa, particularly in Somalia. The East African nation has seen several military attacks — often reported as drone strikes — in recent years.

Al-Shabab militants attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, in neighboring Kenya, on Sept. 21 with guns and grenades, killing at least 67 people. Al-Shabab promised more attacks on Kenyan soil unless Kenya withdraws its troops from Somalia."
