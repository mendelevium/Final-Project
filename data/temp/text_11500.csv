Now the runoff between Garcetti and Wendy Greuel is well into the home stretch, and the candidates have been able to focus a bit more on their plans and programs, and on their critiques of each other. Garcetti remains our choice.

That’s based in large part on the records both candidates have compiled in city government over more than a decade, and less on the statements, charges, claims, counterclaims, missteps, outrageous mailers, misleading ads, high-profile endorsements and spending reports that have emerged in the course of the campaign. In theory, political campaigns can boil down candidates to their essences and put voters in a better position to distinguish among them and to make their choices, but it rarely turns out that way. In this race, as in so many others, the campaigns have produced more heat than light, more diversion than focus.

Does the independent expenditure campaign underwritten by the union representing Department of Water and Power workers really mean that Greuel is “bought and paid for,” as Garcetti charges? Does Garcetti’s $1.25 per year in royalties from a petroleum lease at Beverly Hills High School really make him an oil tycoon who profits at the expense of children’s health? Did Greuel really propose an irresponsible police hiring binge that the city simply can’t afford? Was Garcetti, as council president, any more responsible than was Greuel, as city controller, for the rising unemployment rate in Los Angeles during the mortgage crisis and recession? Is Greuel a political climber who covered up her Republican past to be viable in an overwhelmingly Democratic town, and Garcetti a trust fund baby who has latched on to liberal causes for their cachet?

Oh, please. Enough already.

Cast aside the campaigns and look closely at their records, and both candidates emerge as earnest, ambitious and talented politicians, each of whom has made some good moves and some bad ones over the course of their careers, each of whom could have done a better job crafting city policy and safeguarding city resources.

WATCH: Garcetti video interview | Greuel video interview

But Greuel disappointed as city controller. It’s not that she didn’t do her job; she did, performing audits, unmasking some problems on her own, responding to others as they emerged, offering appropriately conservative estimates of revenue and careful critiques of spending. As a city employee, she earned a grade of “meets expectations.”

But she didn’t earn a promotion. Controller is a poorly named and loosely defined job in city government that nevertheless allows the woman or man holding the office to propose far-reaching revamps of policies and processes. In a government without political parties, the controller could and should be the loyal opposition, the gadfly in chief, the public advocate. Greuel always seemed to grasp the political value of purporting to find waste, fraud and abuse in City Hall but never was able to outline for Angelenos the larger narrative of what was going wrong or how things could be better. She found a contract that she believed should be renegotiated or a program that should be better supervised, but she didn’t tell the city, in essence, “Here is why building inspectors are being indicted, this is the reason the Housing Authority gets away with wasting money, here is how the mayor is mismanaging city departments and how the council members are failing in their oversight duties, and here’s what can be done about it.”

Garcetti, as council president, had a different role, but he did a better job with it. He was late to deal with the budget crisis, but he got there and, importantly, he then got his reluctant colleagues there as well, overseeing difficult budget cuts and taking the first tentative steps toward resolving the city’s pension problem. At the same time, he remade his district with innovative programs to deter gang crime, erase graffiti, house the homeless and provide shelter for the addicted and those in need of mental health services. He guided Hollywood to a renaissance and helped make it, once again, a geographic destination rather than merely the description of an industry headquartered across the city limits in Burbank.

Perhaps most important, Garcetti has demonstrated the capacity to grow, learn and improve his performance. He admits mistakes, such as his vote in favor of a settlement allowing, for a time, virtually unregulated digital billboards. Neither candidate has the executive experience one would like to see in a mayoral candidate. Greuel’s response, tellingly, is to cite her role helping to manage a small family construction business and to assert, and perhaps to believe, that it is sufficient.

Selecting a mayor may sometimes seem just as random as (and a lot less fun than) picking a winner on “American Idol,” but in the end it’s a hiring decision. Of the applicants, who is best suited to the job? Neither candidate is ready, but Greuel seems like a completed project that falls short of what’s needed, while Garcetti comes off as a creative work in progress with potential to meet the challenge. That makes the choice easy. It’s Garcetti."

http://news.yahoo.com/booker-wins-nj-senate-seat-says-hes-scrapper-121828212--election.html,,[],"Booker wins NJ Senate seat, says he's 'a scrapper'","NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — U.S. senator-elect Cory Booker said Thursday he's ready to go to Washington and is not afraid if he ""breaks dishes"" trying to serve his constituents in New Jersey.

Booker, 44, the Democratic mayor of Newark, made the rounds on the morning talk shows a day after defeating Republican Steve Lonegan. His win came after an aggressive two-month race to finish the term of Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who died in office in June at age 89.

Booker said he wants to channel Americans' frustration with Congress into energy for change.

""I think everybody feels there's fatigue and frustration with how things are, which creates a great climate for change,"" Booker said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ''Often before you have great victory, you have to have great frustration.""

The mayor of New Jersey's largest city takes to Washington a national profile — boosted by a strong social media presence, frequent television appearances and his status as a surrogate for Barack Obama during the president's 2012 re-election campaign — just as the federal government begins functioning again after a 16-day shutdown.

He hasn't even started his job as senator, but he is already being asked if he wants to run for president.

""I would rule it out,"" he said on WNYW's ""Good Day New York."" ''I'm going into the Senate. If I break dishes on the way to try to serve the people of New Jersey, so be it.""

Booker called himself a ""scrapper"" and said he was able to change Newark despite people claiming its problems were intractable, which is what he said people are now saying about Congress.

""I find it eerily familiar with what people are saying to me now, because it was said 15 years ago in Newark,"" he said. ""The problems are too big.""

Booker had 55 percent of the vote to Lonegan's 44 percent. He brushed off criticism that the race was closer than many anticipated. Lonegan was backed by the tea party in a Democratic-leaning state.

""We did not worry. We put our plan in place and we worked our plan,"" Booker said. ""I feel very lifted by the people of the state of New Jersey.""

Story continues

Booker said he will likely be sworn in ""the next week, two weeks max."" The timing, he said, depends on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Vice President Joe Biden, who will likely swear Booker in.

Booker will be the first black senator from New Jersey and will arrive in Washington with an unusual political resume.

He was raised in suburban Harington Park as the son of two of the first black IBM executives, graduated from Stanford and law school at Yale with a stint in between as a Rhodes Scholar before moving to one of Newark's toughest neighborhoods with the intent of doing good.

He's been an unconventional politician, a vegetarian with a Twitter following of 1.4 million — or five times the population of the city he governs. With state funding dwindling, he has used private fundraising, including a $100 million pledge from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, to run programs in Newark, a strategy that has brought him both fame and criticism.

Former state Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa had been appointed by Christie to temporarily replace Lautenberg. The governor scheduled the special election for just 20 days before Christie himself is on the ballot seeking re-election. Democrats said Christie was afraid of appearing on the same ballot as the popular Booker, but courts upheld the election schedule.

Before Lautenberg died, Booker passed up a chance to run against Christie this year, saying he was eyeing Lautenberg's seat in 2014, in part so he could complete a full term as mayor — something he won't do now.

Chris Christie will reshape New Jersey’s political landscape, have poured tens of millions of dollars into a record-breaking outside spending campaign that has transformed the state’s election season.

The effort, designed to preserve Democrats’ dominance of the State Legislature and complicate Mr. Christie’s plans to build a record of legislative achievement as he considers a presidential bid in 2016, has inundated some legislative districts with millions of dollars in negative ads on a scale never before seen in New Jersey.

As of last Thursday, according to the state’s election law enforcement board, outside spending for candidates had topped $35 million, twice the amount spent when Mr. Christie, a Republican, was elected in 2009 and the highest recorded by any state except California.

The surge of spending is likely to be replicated around the country next year, as outside groups from both parties signal increasing interest in influencing state-level contests."

Fletcher', 'May', 'Michael A. Fletcher Is A Senior Writer For Espn.']","In North Carolina, unimpeded GOP drives state hard to the right","Backed by throngs of chanting supporters, dozens of liberal demonstrators are subjecting themselves to arrest each Monday at the state legislature here to protest a flurry of bills that could transform North Carolina into a model of conservative governance.

The state’s hard turn to the right comes less than five years after people took to the streets here to celebrate the 2008 victory of Barack Obama, the first Democratic presidential candidate to capture the state since Jimmy Carter in 1976. The win prompted Obama’s supporters to crow about the growing influence of progressive and minority voters not only in North Carolina but across the South.

But that euphoria is now a distant memory. Since the recession hit, North Carolina has been saddled with one of the nation’s highest unemployment rates. The bad times helped prepare the way for a carefully executed strategy, with big financial support from a major conservative activist, that helped the GOP win control of both chambers of the state General Assembly in 2010.

Those victories were capped last year when Republican Pat McCrory was elected governor, giving the party control of all levers of state government for the first time since 1870.

The victories were aided by the strong financial support of Art Pope, a multimillionaire who spent heavily in support of the state’s GOP candidates. The Institute for Southern Studies, a North Carolina-based research organization, said Pope’s advocacy network spent $2.2 million on 22 legislative races, winning 18. Overall, conservative organizations largely supported by Pope accounted for three-fourths of the outside money spent in North Carolina legislative races in 2010, according to the institute.

One of McCrory’s first acts after being elected governor was to install Pope, a former legislator, as the state budget chief. (The governor’s office declined to make Pope available for an interview.) And now, GOP lawmakers are moving swiftly to enact a long list of legislation they say is largely aimed at limiting government debt and snapping the state’s economy out of a years-long malaise.

Legislators have slashed jobless benefits. They have also repealed a tax credit that supplemented the wages of low-income people, while moving to eliminate the estate tax. They have voted against expanding Medicaid to comply with the 2010 federal health-care law. The expansion would have added 500,000 poor North Carolinians to the Medicaid rolls.

“Before considering Medicaid expansion, we must reform the current system to make sure people currently enrolled receive the services they need and more taxpayer dollars are not put at risk,” McCrory said in a written statement after signing a bill blocking the expansion.

Lawmakers are also considering proposals to reduce and flatten income tax rates while expanding the sales tax, perhaps to even include groceries and prescription drugs — which some advocates see as a first step toward eliminating the state income tax.

“North Carolina is a high-income-tax state, and we’re suffering the consequences,” said Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger (R). “Our unemployment rate is the fifth worst in the country, and our high tax rates are hindering economic growth and pushing jobs to our neighbors.”

There are also measures pending to require drug testing for low-income people applying for job training and welfare benefits.

Other GOP-controlled legislatures have passed or considered similar measures in the wake of the recession. Florida, Missouri and Michigan are among the states that have slashed jobless benefits. Texas, Louisiana and Wisconsin are among at least 15 states not participating in the Medicaid expansion called for in the Affordable Care Act. And West Virginia, Kansas and Texas are among the states where legislators have proposed bills requiring drug testing for welfare recipients.

The North Carolina House has passed a law requiring voters to have a government-issued identification card, and legislators are considering bills to roll back the state’s law allowing same-day voter registration and to sharply limit early voting — measures that supporters of the current law say were integral to the high turnout of minority voters in the past several elections.

“I don’t know that there is a state that has as many regressive policies on tap,” said Penda Hair, co-director of Advancement Project, a Washington-based civil rights group that is considering a lawsuit challenging changes to the state’s voting laws.

Liberals may be up in arms, but North Carolina conservatives are applauding the new direction of the General Assembly. After the state Senate unveiled its tax reform plan this month, the state chapter of Americans for Prosperity released a poll that it said showed widespread support across the state. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said the state tax code is in need of reform, and nearly half backed moving to totally eliminate the personal income tax within four years.

“The poll results show a clear desire for bold tax relief and reform that gets North Carolina back in the game for jobs and business,” said Dallas Woodhouse, state director of Americans for Prosperity in North Carolina.

The legislative effort has mobilized liberals who see North Carolina as a laboratory for conservative ideas propelled nationwide by the money of a handful of key patrons. They note that many of the initiatives being pursued by legislators here have long been championed by a network of conservative organizations supported by Pope and billionaire activists Charles and David Koch, including Americans for Prosperity and the American Legislative Exchange Council.

“Most of the laws that take us backwards do not come out of Congress but out of state legislatures,” said the Rev. William J. Barber II, head of the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP. “Conservative forces here have gone all out to implement these policies and to lock in their power by changing the voting laws.”

In an effort that resurrects some of the tactics of the civil rights movement, Barber has led a growing, multiracial campaign of civil disobedience intended to draw attention to the changes being pursued by legislators.

This past week, more than 600 demonstrators, some waving placards and singing freedom songs, gathered outside the North Carolina Legislative Building for the fourth “Moral Mondays” protest.

With the crowd behind them, 57 protesters walked inside the building and stood in front of the large brass doors leading to the Senate chamber. The demonstrators — pastors, students, college professors and senior citizens among them — were arrested and led away in plastic handcuffs. They joined a group of more than 100 North Carolina residents who had been arrested and jailed in three previous protests.

“This leadership wants to make our state a place of deeper stratification and inequality,” Barber said.

In the coming weeks, Barber plans to move the protests from the doorstep of the legislature to the home districts of the lawmakers through a series of 25 town meetings.

But, as it stands, there is very little opponents can do to alter the will of the governing majority — something many of the protesters acknowledge.

“My hope is two-pronged,” said Derick Smith, an instructor at North Carolina A&T University who was arrested several weeks ago during a protest. “You want to bring attention to what’s happening. And you’ve got to hope that the governor will listen and back away from some of the more divisive provisions.”"

Washington (CNN) - Hillary Clinton vs. Chris Christie.

It's an intriguing 2016 presidential showdown.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

And according to a new national poll, Clinton would come out on top in such a hypothetical matchup.

That's one of the findings from a survey released Thursday from Quinnipiac University, which asked American voters about nine possible general election matchups in the next race for the White House.

According to the poll, the former first lady, Democratic senator from New York and secretary of state, leads the Republican New Jersey governor 45%-37%. The survey also indicates Clinton would top Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida 50%-34% and would beat Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the House budget committee chairman and last year's GOP vice presidential nominee, 50%-38%.

""Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would start a 2016 presidential campaign with enormous advantages,"" says Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. ""She obviously is by far the best known and her more than 20 years in the public spotlight allows her to create a very favorable impression on the American people. But it is worth noting that she had very good poll numbers in 2006 looking toward the 2008 election, before she faced a relative unknown in Barack Obama.""

If Vice President Joe Biden became the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, the poll suggests closer general election contests.

Biden would trail Christie 43%-40% and would top Ryan 45%-42%. The three point margins in both matchups are within the survey's sampling error. According to the poll, the vice president would lead Rubio 45%-38%.

According to the poll, Christie would lead New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo 45%-28%, with Ryan ahead of Cuomo 42%-37% and Cuomo and Rubio deadlocked at 37%.

""Although some Republicans don't think New Jersey Gov. Christopher Christie is conservative enough for their taste, he runs best of the three Republicans tested and would defeat two of the top Democrats,"" adds Brown.

One caveat with such polling is that the next presidential election is still three and a half years away, and surveys this early in a campaign cycle are often heavily influenced by name recognition.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted February 27-March 4, with 1,944 registered voters nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.

“In 2008, I was an early supporter of then-Senator Obama’s campaign,” Ms. McCaskill said in a statement on the Ready for Hillary Web site. “I worked my heart out to elect him president. Now as I look at 2016 and think about who is best to lead this country forward, I’m proud to announce that I am Ready for Hillary.”

The unusual declaration was not as much a presidential endorsement of Mrs. Clinton — she had expressed that support earlier this year — but an endorsement of a “super PAC” encouraging her to run. It was the first endorsement of the Ready for Hillary PAC by a sitting member of Congress, the group said.

Even as she was lending her name to the group’s fund-raising efforts, Ms. McCaskill played down the significance of her action."

Now they pay the price.

Republicans gave us the Cheneys. Now they pay the price.

Rep. Cynthia Lummis, a two-term Republican lawmaker, called Cheney “the shiny new pony” in Wyoming politics, but slammed Cheney for a lack of etiquette in making her intentions known to her opponent, Sen. Mike Enzi. “I don’t think she’s going about it the right way,” Lummis, R-Wyo., told a scrum of reporters in the Speaker’s Lobby during votes on Tuesday night. [...] “There’s a great history of intraparty decorum in Wyoming, especially when it comes to these higher-profile offices, and certainly that decorum has been broken here,” she added. “I think it’s problematic. I think it’s bad form.”

This sort of stuff is what makes Liz Cheney's decision to move from Virginia to Wyoming in order to run for U.S. Senate against Mike Enzi so much fun:Of course Lummis is also annoyed because until Cheney entered the scene, she was the heir apparent to Enzi. In fact, if Enzi does bow out (which is still possible), she'll run in his place.

Like Lummis, Enzi himself (not surprisingly) is also whining about Cheney's entrance:



“She said that if I ran she wasn’t going to run, but obviously that wasn’t correct,” Enzi said, speaking to reporters as he left the Senate floor. “I thought we were friends. [...] It’s kind of interesting that about 30 minutes after I put out a release saying that I intend to run, she put out one saying she was running,” Enzi told reporters. “She’s watching pretty closely what I’m doing. This is different than what she was saying before — that if I didn’t run, she would run.”

Enzi sounds like he's offended by Cheney's decision to run, but he shouldn't be taking this personally. There are two reasons why she's running, and neither of them have anything to do with him.

First, Liz Cheney thinks she's entitled to whatever she wants because she's Dick Cheney's daughter.

Second, Wyoming has about ten thousand times as many tumbleweeds as it does actual people, so Cheney doesn't think victory will be hard.

In Wyoming, winning the Republican primary is pretty much a guarantee that you'll win the general—and it doesn't take much to win the primary. In 2010, which was the highest turnout Republican primary in recent years, just 110,000 people turned out to vote. In other words, Cheney realizes that even if 2014 is also a high-turnout primary, she only needs to win about 55,000 votes to become a U.S. Senator.

So while Liz Cheney running isn't good news for Mike Enzi and isn't good news for Republicans who want to avoid intraparty fights, it wouldn't take much for her to win. And that's good news for Liz Cheney—and for those of us who are easily amused by the sight of Republicans eating their own."

Washington (CNN) - Hillary Clinton has the early edge in a key battleground state, should she choose to run for president in 2016.

Iowa voters picked her as their choice for commander in chief above top potential Republican contenders including Senators Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, in a new survey released Friday.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

The Quinnipiac University poll showed Clinton would defeat Rubio by 11 percentage points, 48% to 37%, if the election were held today and would beat Paul by four percentage points, 46% to 42%. She was helped by her strong support among women.

The speculation over a Clinton presidential run is never ending, helped by her consistently high approval ratings, the perpetual campaign cycle and speculation from political operatives and journalists.

While top Democrats, including her husband former President Bill Clinton and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, have encouraged her to run for president again, Clinton herself has consistently said she's focused on enjoying her life after years in the public eye and traveling the world.

Vice President Joe Biden has not been as careful and often jokes about another run at the White House.

But Biden did not fare as well in the same poll. He fell behind Rubio by one percentage point, 39% to 40%, and trailed Paul by five percentage points, 39% to 44%, among Hawkeye State voters. He was hurt by his lack of support among independent voters.

President Barack Obama's win over Clinton and Biden in the 2008 Iowa caucuses helped catapult his White House bid. He went on to win the swing state in the 2008 and 2012 general elections. But Bill Clinton was victorious in the state during both of his presidential elections, in 1992 and 1996.

The poll, conducted between May 15 and May 21, surveyed 1,411 registered voters by telephone and had a sampling error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/25/Republican-Establishment-Signals-Primary-War-Against-Utah-Tea-Party-Senator-Mike-Lee,2013-10-25 00:00:00,['Michael Patrick Leahy'],GOP Establishment Signals Primary Fight Against Tea Party Favorite Mike Lee,"On Tuesday, 79-year old Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), now serving his seventh term in the Senate, signaled that he and other members of the Republican establishment are likely to encourage a primary challenge to first term Senator Mike Lee (R-UT).

Lee upset former Senator Robert Bennett (R-UT) in the 2010 Utah Republican primary convention in the Tea Party’s first major primary win over a Republican establishment politician.

Hatch told the Deseret News and KSL NewsRadio that “[i]t’s time now… for Lee and other tea party Republicans to be ‘rehabilitated’ for refusing to pass a budget bill needed to keep the government operating unless money for the act better known as Obamacare was removed.”

Hatch pointedly refused to endorse Lee for re-election to the Senate in 2016. “I’m not going to get into endorsements at this point in any way,” he said.

Hatch also criticized Lee’s tactics in the Senate. “The tactics were not the right tactics. It takes experience sometimes to make sure you can use the right tactics,” he stated.

Former Utah Governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman has also joined the establishment crowd attacking Lee. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that Huntsman “said Lee has bucked a trend of senators who work to grow this small state in a way that makes people proud.” According to Huntsman, in Utah “[y]ou don’t have ideological wack-jobs… For all of its labeling as a red state, underneath it all Utah is a pretty pragmatic Western state, a just-get-it-done ethos.”

Spencer Zwick, a Utah resident who was a key member of Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign’s leadership team, also criticized Lee. “Business leaders that I talk to, many of whom supported him, would never support his reelection and in fact will work against him, myself included,” Zwick told the Post. According to Zwick, Lee is just a “showhorse.”

Zions Bank President A. Scott Anderson, a major Republican donor in Utah, said, “I think people admire him for sticking to his guns and principles, but I think there are growing frustrations… If things are to happen, you can’t just stick to your principles. You have to make things work… You’ve got to be practical.”

The Post reported that a potential Republican establishment challenger to Lee has already surfaced in “Thomas Wright, who stepped down this spring as chairman of the Utah Republican Party.” According to the Post, “Wright said he is considering running against Lee in 2016 because he has grown ‘exasperated’ with the junior senator’s governing style.”

Touching on an often used Republican establishment theme, Wright said, “I want to work with people to get things done. I want to go be a leader and build bridges, not burn them down.”

If early signs from Utah are any indication, the entire Republican establishment is looking to burn down every bridge to the Tea Party movement around the country in the 2014 primaries."

This bundle of energy is Mark Rosenthal, who for the last 15 years, was a union boss in New York City, a position he earned by eating Jimmy Hoffa. (audience laughter) He lost his job this week after these photos of him sleeping on the job appeared in the papers, including of one where he was holding Princess Leia on a leash.

(audience laughter)

Now I must say, I feel a little bad for this guy because he had to take pain meds that put him out after lunch because of a bad back. And I believe him when he says he has a bad back, 'cause as you can see, he's a huge fat fuck! And that's mostly on him.

But if we're down on him because he's unconscious on the job, why did we reward it in this guy?

Or this guy?

Or this guy?

That's Michigan's 87-year-old Congressman John Dingell. And last week, he set a new record for the most time in Congress — 57 years. And everyone applauded. Why?

There's a difference between public service and hoarding. (audience applause) This guy has had 30 terms! He was first elected in 1955, six years before Obama was even born in Kenya! (audience laughter)

Congressman Ralph Hall of Texas is 90, and he's running for re-election. Which would be cool if he was one of those spry old guys who does the crossword and plays tennis every morning, but he's not that guy. He said recently he doesn't believe in climate change, and that ""I'm really more fearful of freezing"". Yes, 'cause you're 90! (audience laughter and applause)

New Jersey's Senator Frank Lautenberg — my first Senate vote — died this month in office at 89. And when Cory Booker, the Superman mayor of Newark said last year that he was thinking of running for his seat, Lautenberg's top aide called it ""disrespectful"". (BruinKid note: Actually, it was Lautenberg himself who said that, not an aide.)

Really? Really?? The guy who runs into burning buildings shouldn't take over for the other guy who can't blow on a piece of paper and make it move across the table? (audience laughter)

And let me emphasize, this is not about age. This is about Congressmen who suck at their jobs because their jobs are never at stake. There are only three ways a Congressman goes out: they die in office, they cash in as a lobbyist, or they mistakenly tweet a picture of their dick. (audience laughter and applause) Three ways.

The approval rating for Congress is 10%. And yet in 2012, over 90% won re-election. And that's because we've created a system where it's almost impossible to beat an incumbent. The districts are too gerrymandered, the ads are too expensive. So every few years, we're treated to the sight of some crypt-keeper who hasn't shown up at work for years being wheeled out by a staff member so he can raise his skeleton hand to vote ""Aye"".

A couple of years ago, for the health care bill, it was 92-year-old Robert Byrd.

In 2002, it was 101-year-old Strom Thurmond,

a man who raped the family maid the same year Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby. (shocked audience laughter) True. (BruinKid note: Yep, it's true. Both occurred in 1925.) But who was still voting in 2001 on issues like stem cell research, even though he once referred to a microphone as ""the machine"". (shocked audience laughter)

When did we become this Weekend at Bernie's government... (audience laughter and applause) where Senators are coaxed into key votes by someone whispering in their ear, ""Who wants pudding?"" (audience laughter)

George Washington was the greatest American because he set the precedent of WALKING AWAY! Two terms, I'm out! If anyone in our history was indispensable, it was him. And he still said, no thanks, from now on I just want to watch SportsCenter in my underwear."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/09/03/New-Political-Media-Establishment-Thinks-More-Conservatives-Not-Needed-for-Better-Campaign-Coverage,2013-09-03 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],Media/Political Establishment: More Conservatives Not Needed in Reporting,"Journalists and professional political tacticians in Washington’s permanent political class ecosystem apparently do not believe the mainstream media would be better served if they had more reporters who were familiar with conservative politics and voters.

After the 2012 presidential election, CNN reporter Peter Hamby interviewed over 70 “journalists and political tacticians” that make up a “who’s who” of the Washington permanent political class for ideas on new election beats and how presidential elections may better be covered. He published his findings in a paper for Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, titled, “Did Twitter Kill the Boys on the Bus? Searching for a better way to cover a campaign.”

The paper, by primarily examining Mitt Romney’s failed 2012 presidential campaign and the media coverage of it, extensively examines and lays out the new terrain on which modern political battles are contested. It looks at how the the “digital firehouse of information,” especially Twitter, “is being channeled by a new generation of campaign journalists, and how political decision makers are adjusting their tactics, because there is no turning back.”

On Monday, Politico’s Playbook picked out some of the reporters and tacticians quoted in Hamby’s paper and listed them in its morning e-mail, which has been likened to a camp newsletter:

David Axelrod, Stuart Stevens, Matt Rhoades, Eric Fehrnstrom, Adam Nagourney, John Harris, Dick Stevenson, Marcus Brauchli, Dan Balz, Jeff Zeleny, Jonathan Martin, Mo Elleithee, Phil Rucker, Garrett Haake, Tommy Vietor, Ben LaBolt, Lis Smith, Stephanie Cutter, Chuck Todd, Karen Hughes, Joe Klein, David Carr, Jon Ward, Tim Miller, Scott Conroy, Maggie Haberman, Reid Epstein, Nancy Gibbs, Sasha Issenberg, John Dickerson, Jim Acosta, John Berman, Rachel Streitfeld, Mike Murphy, Kevin Madden, Rick Gorka, Peter Alexander, Sarah Boxer, Will Ritter, Maeve Reston, Michael Feldman, Tim Pearson, Rob Lockwood, Ashley Parker, Kasie Hunt, Ryan Williams, Paul West, Michael Calderone, Zeke Miller, Ben Smith, Dave Weigel, Matt Viser, Chris Rowland, Liz Sidoti, Sam Youngman, Shushannah Walshe, Jeff Smith, Carl Cameron, Jake Suski, Robert Costa, Jackie Kucinich, Sara Murray, Jim Heath

As Hamby reported in his groundbreaking examination of Twitter’s importance in campaigns, Romney and Obama campaign officials during the 2012 race were in amazement that younger mainstream media reporters who were fluent in the medium were hardly so in politics. Obama and Romney officials told Hamby they were incredulous that reporters on the campaign could not recognize Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson.

Many of those Hamby interviewed for his research (listed above) would surely be familiar with Reed and Robertson, for they too are institutional figures. But they may be less familiar with shows conservatives watch like Duck Dynasty; churches they attend; politicians that influence them like Sarah Palin; the guns they like to shoot and need for self-protection; the books (Liberty and Tyranny, The Liberty Amendments) and websites they like to read; and the talk radio hosts (Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin) to whom they listen.

Hamby’s reporting about Reed and Robertson also underscores a broader problem with the mainstream media and those allowed into their ranks. Though the mainstream media often bemoan the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in America’s institutions–even though studies have shown they are guilty of the same–not much is said about the lack the ideological diversity in mainstream media organizations. Such diversity is needed to more critically report on politics and challenge and correct insular assumptions and stereotypes about conservatives.

While those reporters in question may not have known who Reed and Robertson were, it is safe to assume that there is a greater chance they would have known Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards and Jesse Jackson.

In February of 2013, Gallup found that conservatives make up a plurality of the country. Other surveys by Gallup and Pew in recent years have found the Republican party has gotten more conservative and Republicans want it to be even more so, something the mainstream press should consider as they attempt to fairly cover the 2016 GOP presidential primary. In the 2016 primary, Republicans may be pulled to the right as Democrats were pulled to the left during a 2008 primary in which the liberal base was as antagonistically opposed to President George W. Bush and his war in Iraq as conservatives are to Obama and his policies.

Some of the suggestions for better campaign coverage that were offered to Hamby are worth noting for serious consideration:

“voter contact”–studying how campaigns actually reach out to voters and the emerging science behind it.

“media tactics”– “As campaigns increasingly seek ways to make end-runs around the Washington media filter, reporters should track their activities in niche media platforms, on radio, on the web or in social networks,” Hamby writes. “Where, how and why? Is a campaign pushing their message in a popular video game, on Pandora radio, on the Big Ten Network? In the pages of Us Weekly or the Spanish-speaking press? What local TV stations are top targets for campaign advertising?”

“Downballot races”: Hamby suggests finding “a few contests in swing-y House or Senate districts on the state level– races that are barely covered anymore, even by local media, despite the colorful characters involved–and check in every few weeks.”

“Political science”: Hamby writes that reporters should pay attention to the academics that “are publishing smart, counterintuitive work or documenting trends that often go unnoticed in the press” instead of political scientists who seek to get quoted in every publication and mistake quantity for quality.

Others solutions included: “The money trail and the political industry,” which would study where the massive amount of money that is raised is actually spent and some of the shadier ways political influence is purchased; a focus on better reporting and interpreting polling; and a focus on “Political movements, new and old.” Hamby also suggested sending reporters to cover states–instead of specific candidates–to play “zone defense” like CNN did in 2008 in states like South Carolina, or hiring local reporters or bloggers in key primary states who know the terrain well.

Perhaps Hamby, who gained respect for being one of the few mainstream reporters who has covered Sarah Palin fairly, had a blind spot to some suggestions that were not being offered or assumed his fellow denizens in Washington’s political ecosystem understand and give conservatives a fair shake.

Consider what former Washington Post editor Marcus Brauchli told Hamby, though. Brauchli said that he did not think “the media did a terrific job of explaining Obama and his presidency”–and perhaps that was so because the same reporters that have difficulties understanding conservatives also are unable to critically report on Obama.

Ultimately, the suggestions Hamby puts forth for better campaign coverage may not be worth that much in the long run without reporters, producers, and editors who have the knowledge and life experiences to cover an electorate that greatly influences one party’s primary and makes up a plurality of the nation. The closest anyone came to touching upon this in the study was Sasha Issenberg of Slate, who observed that the New York Times did not have a gun-culture beat reporter.

At the very least, reporters should have a genuine curiosity that enables them to learn and challenge their assumptions about an electorate and parts of the country with which they may not be familiar–that is a trait the late David Broder, who is mentioned with reverence in Hamby’s report, had in spades."

Ashley Judd hasn't uttered a public peep about running for the Senate in Kentucky, but she is already starring in two political ads put up by her potential opponents that mock the idea of the Democratic actress unseating longtime Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader.

A highlight reel of celebrities in politics shows Republicans may have reason to be nervous rather than amused. Actors do pretty well when they decide to go out on the stump.

Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Minnesota Sen. Al Franken and California Rep. Sonny Bono didn't exactly play Abraham Lincoln onscreen, but they got elected regardless. So did TV stars Fred Grandy of TheLove Boat and Ben Jones of Dukes of Hazzard, who both served in Congress. President Reagan needs no mention. It's harder to think of actors who've lost — like Nancy Kulp, who starred in the Beverly Hillbillies but lost a bid for Congress in central Pennsylvania in 1984.

Actors and athletes who have run and won say Judd's celebrity has a political payoff: She'll have no problem with name recognition, she'll be able to raise a lot of money, and voters won't suspect her of going into politics for personal gain. Then again, as Judd already knows, actor-candidates likely have a video trail that can be sliced and diced for attack ads. And their well-established persona may be at odds with what voters want.

""The advantage of being well-known was that when I started to run, it meant that very few people hated me, even if they couldn't support me,"" says Bill Bradley, who became a basketball star on the 1964 gold medal Olympic team and played 10 years with the New York Knicks before he ran for the Senate from New Jersey in 1978. ""If I was going somewhere to speak, 100 people would show up as opposed to 25. Which only means that it gave me a chance to succeed or fail to four times as many people.""

Money and the megaphone of fame can help overcome a bad image or a perceived lack of gravitas from years playing a goofy cruise ship purser named Gopher.

Grandy was still acting in The Love Boat when he started running in Iowa's 1986 congressional election, reading the Farm Bureau Spokesman newspaper in his trailer on the set.

Winning required closing ""the Gopher gap"" with voters, he says. While his celebrity ""pulled people into the tent, what got them to vote for me was 18 months of absolutely grinding retail politics, (going) to every bean feed and pork princess festival and nut fry that would have me.""

In California, opinion surveys initially showed that voters saw action star Schwarzenegger as ""a thug in a leather jacket,"" says George Gorton, a political consultant who worked on Schwarzenegger's campaign for governor in 2003. ""Even though (they thought) he was a likable thug, we had to undertake a pretty massive effort to change that image. ... (Voters) loved Arnold, but they just weren't going to vote for him for the longest time.""

The good, the bad, the ugly

Celebrities and athletes have to clear a ""take-me-seriously threshold,"" says Darrell West of the Brookings Institution, co-author of the 2002 book Celebrity Politics. ""But it's not that high. Voters don't know that much about public policy — so you have to be conversant with the major policy issues, but you don't have to be a brain surgeon to persuade voters that you're a serious candidate.""

Schwarzenegger, a Republican, was the lead campaigner for Proposition 49, a successful 2002 ballot measure which funded after-school programs. As such, he gained support from crucial groups in law enforcement and education and developed a public policy profile before he entered the recall election for governor against Gray Davis the following year.

Franken, the former Saturday Night Live cast member, had to overcome not just his self-absorbed characters on Saturday Night Live, but a salacious 2000 Playboy article called ""Porn-O-Rama"" that his campaign said was satire. Franken squeaked into office after a seven-month recount process.

Sometimes it takes more than one election to clear the bar. Singer and comedian Sonny Bono ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1992 before he won a seat in Congress two years later. For Bono, his celebrity was a mixed blessing — by the time he ran for office he had spent years being the butt of jokes by his then-wife, Cher, on their TV show.

His widow, former congresswoman Mary Bono Mack, who won his congressional seat after his death in 1998, says that had an impact at the start of his political career. ""Sonny being in comedy or the straight man was harder than had he played Moses parting the Red Sea,"" she says.

Judd, however, ""is always playing great strong female characters,"" Bono Mack says. ""She's schooled herself on what she's going to be in for and is known for being very bright — and I think Sen. McConnell could have a fight on his hands.""

Judd's past comments — opposing certain types of coal mining, in favor of starting a family through adoption rather than procreation, and critical of the patriarchal aspects of Christianity — have already been unearthed and criticized by conservative online media. There will likely be comments about Double Jeopardy, her 1999 hit film, Tooth Fairy, a 2010 box office success, or Missing, the now-canceled TV show for which she was nominated for an Emmy in 2012. Judd is also part of a famous family — mother Naomi and sister Wynonna are legendary country music performers.

Bono Mack points out that because of the Internet it's not only actors who have a searchable history. ""In the era of super PACs, whether you said something foolish as a celebrity or something foolish as the guy next door, it will be exposed,"" she says. ""And it can backfire, as we all know. You can hit that funny bone that constituents have of sympathy if you play it. More so if they like the (actor's) character to begin with.""

A Bluegrass battle looms

Kentucky has already elected a crossover politician: Republican Sen. Jim Bunning, the Hall of Fame pitcher, retired in 2010 after 14 years in Congress. On the other hand, Nick Clooney, father of movie star George and brother of singer Rosemary, failed in a 2004 race for Congress that his opponent, Geoff Davis, called ""Hollywood vs. the heartland.""

Judd has not made a decision on whether to run or even decided when she will make a decision, her spokeswoman Cara Tripicchio says. On Friday, Judd avoided the question when she spoke on public health at George Washington University in Washington. But she has been consulting state and national Democratic leaders in private.

Judd, who announced in December she is divorcing race car driver Dario Franchitti, was raised in Kentucky but lives in Nashville — though she continues to be a high-profile sports fan of the University of Kentucky, her alma mater. (A 1998 calendar photo of Judd in a UK hockey jersey and little else would probably pop up during a campaign, too.) She has met with prominent state Democrats to discuss the race, and is seeking to talk to more: the speaker of the Kentucky House said last week that Judd had called him for a meeting.

One of her biggest boosters is the state's sole Democratic congressman, John Yarmuth. ""She will get millions and millions of dollars' worth of earned media. She will be able to draw a crowd wherever she goes,"" Yarmuth says. ""She has the ability to galvanize most of the energy that is out there to unseat McConnell, and there is a lot of it.""

But McConnell's opponent will need to be a good fundraiser, as former Pittsburgh Steelers star Lynn Swann learned when he went up against an incumbent in the 2006 Pennsylvania governor's race. Swann got out-raised $10 million to $30 million and walloped at the polls, by Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell.

McConnell already has more than $7 million on hand, and American Crossroads, the Karl Rove-founded PAC that ran an online ad against Judd, appears willing to spend money on his behalf as well. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has also targeted the race.

""My expectation is Kentucky per capita will probably be the top state as far as spending by super PACs on both sides,"" says state Democratic chairman Dan Logsdon.

The end of 'celebrity'

Those who've been there say that if Judd makes it to Capitol Hill, she'll be in demand as a fundraiser again — this time for colleagues. Franken, for instance, has raised more than $32 million since 2008; through his Midwest Values PAC, he gave $1.6 million to other Democrats in the 2012 election.

Grandy, in the pre-PAC era, appeared at candidate fundraisers ""almost every weekend for the first couple of terms that I was a member,"" he says. ""And to be perfectly honest with you, I had an ulterior motive in mind, which was to get on the Ways and Means Committee."" He succeeded.

Otherwise, celebrities have made sure to keep their heads down both with the public — Franken stays out of the media except for Minnesota news organizations — and their colleagues.

""Being a freshman is a great equalizer,"" Bono Mack says.

Bradley says he waited five months before making a speech on the Senate floor. ""I made sure I didn't talk about basketball for the first three years,"" he says. ""(If) somebody asked me a question, I answered it. I wasn't reminiscing about the old days, even though I knew people were interested. I waited for them to initiate it.""

Winning an election is the beginning of the end for stardom. After the first success, you're a politician, not a celebrity. Bradley's presidential campaign did not last beyond the early primaries. Grandy lost a governor's race. Tom Osborne, the winningest football coach in University of Nebraska history, easily won election to Congress in 2000. But six years later, he lost a GOP primary challenge to incumbent Gov. Dave Heineman after Osborne said he would support a bill offering in-state tuition to illegal immigrants.

""There's a certain honeymoon period,"" Osborne says now. ""But at some point they really want to know what you can do, what you know, and what you can deliver.""

At a conservative conference earlier in the year, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, ridiculed the 2016 Democratic field as “a rerun of ‘The Golden Girls,’ ” referring to Mrs. Clinton and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is 70.

And Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, seizing on the Fleetwood Mac song that became a Clinton family anthem, quipped to an audience in Washington, “If you want to keep thinking about tomorrow, maybe it’s time to put somebody new in.”

The 2016 election may be far off, but one theme is becoming clear: Republican strategists and presidential hopefuls, in ways subtle and overt, are eager to focus a spotlight on Mrs. Clinton’s age. The former secretary of state will be 69 by the next presidential election, a generation removed from most of the possible Republican candidates."

Paladino easily defeated Adrian Fitzgerald Harris 79 percent to 20 percent to capture a seat representing the south Buffalo neighborhood. The move comes 2 1/2 years after Paladino lost the race for the governor's mansion to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) by 29 percentage points after upsetting New York's Republican establishment in the GOP primary.

Paladino has described African American women school board members as a ""parasitic black sisterhood."" In 2010, the Buffalo Common Council considered a resolution condemning Paladino for racial insensitivity.

In 2011, Paladino proposed that Buffalo's school system create boarding schools in order to improve test scores. He said boarding schools would provide children with study skills, meals and a chance to escape dysfunctional families. He repeated the boarding school proposal during his school board campaign.

Despite his business success, Paladino has struggled in elective politics. In 2008, he used his own money in an unsuccessful effort to oust a Republican state senator he did not like.

Paladino won the 2010 Republican primary over former Rep. Rick Lazio, who was backed by the state GOP, based largely on landslide numbers in western New York, where he captured 93 percent of the vote in Buffalo's Erie County."

Kerry choked up at his secretary of state confirmation hearings this morning when discussing his father's history in the U.S. Foreign Service, and how he was ""equally proud"" of both that history and his own as part of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

""If you confirm me, I would take office as secretary proud that the Senate is in my blood, but equally proud that so, too, is the Foreign Service,"" the Massachusetts Democrat told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Washington, where all the members greeted him warmly.

""My dad's work under presidents, both Democratic and Republican, took me and my siblings around the world for a personal journey that brought home the sacrifices and commitment the men and women of the Foreign Service make every day on behalf of America.

""I wish everyone in the country could see and understand first-hand the devotion, loyalty and amazingly hard, often dangerous work that our diplomats on the front lines do.""

Republicans praised the Obama nominee today, with ranking member Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee telling Kerry that he's ""almost lived his entire life for this moment,"" adding that he was ""thrilled"" Kerry was in such a position.

Kerry has served on the Foreign Relations Committee for 29 years, and would be the first committee member to ascend to secretary of state in more than 100 years.

At the end of his otherwise uneventful testimony, a woman wearing a pink ski hat began yelling about America's role in the Middle East. ""I'm tired of my friends in the Middle East dying,"" she screamed while being forced out of the room by security.

Kerry, 69, was unfazed, recalling his own history of protesting against the Vietnam War when he first came to Washington. ""I respect the woman who was voicing her concerns about the world,"" he said, calling her outburst the right exclamation point to end his testimony and citing developments in the Middle East and Syria and how the world is watching.

""People measure what we do.""

He is expected to win the nomination and replace Secretary of State Hillary Clinton."

FBI officials executed a search warrant at former state Sen. Kent Sorenson’s home two weeks ago and confiscated computers and other materials connected to presidential campaign politics, his lawyer told The Des Moines Register today. “We were not notified that he was the target of any investigation,” attorney Theodore Sporer told the Register. “They took computers and things that would be used to verify or validate communications with presidential entities.”

“It wasn’t a ‘raid,’” Sporer told the Register. “They executed a search warrant that, frankly, we anticipated was coming.” The FBI on Wednesday, Nov. 20 were at Sorenson’s home for several hours and took computers belonging to his children, as well, Sporer said. “I assume it’s just kind of a dragnet to sweep for anything they could possibly find,” he said. “They’re very thorough.”

For those new to this story, Sorenson has some influence in Iowa politics. He worked for Michele Bachmann's presidential campaign before jumping ship to go over to Ron Paul's.

It is not legal to pay a member of the Iowa state Senate to work on your Presidential campaign, but the Bachmann campaign allegedly did just that, and laundered the money through a Colorado firm. Sorenson is also alleged to have asked for money to change over to the Paul campaign, and received a check for $25,000 and an EBT of $73,000 from them.

He is also alleged to have stolen an email mailing list of Iowa Christian home schooling advocates and used it on behalf of Michele Bachmann's campaign.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/25/Republican-Establishment-Signals-Primary-War-Against-Utah-Tea-Party-Senator-Mike-Lee,2013-10-25 00:00:00,['Michael Patrick Leahy'],GOP Establishment Signals Primary Fight Against Tea Party Favorite Mike Lee,"On Tuesday, 79-year old Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), now serving his seventh term in the Senate, signaled that he and other members of the Republican establishment are likely to encourage a primary challenge to first term Senator Mike Lee (R-UT).

Lee upset former Senator Robert Bennett (R-UT) in the 2010 Utah Republican primary convention in the Tea Party’s first major primary win over a Republican establishment politician.

Hatch told the Deseret News and KSL NewsRadio that “[i]t’s time now… for Lee and other tea party Republicans to be ‘rehabilitated’ for refusing to pass a budget bill needed to keep the government operating unless money for the act better known as Obamacare was removed.”

Hatch pointedly refused to endorse Lee for re-election to the Senate in 2016. “I’m not going to get into endorsements at this point in any way,” he said.

Hatch also criticized Lee’s tactics in the Senate. “The tactics were not the right tactics. It takes experience sometimes to make sure you can use the right tactics,” he stated.

Former Utah Governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman has also joined the establishment crowd attacking Lee. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that Huntsman “said Lee has bucked a trend of senators who work to grow this small state in a way that makes people proud.” According to Huntsman, in Utah “[y]ou don’t have ideological wack-jobs… For all of its labeling as a red state, underneath it all Utah is a pretty pragmatic Western state, a just-get-it-done ethos.”

Spencer Zwick, a Utah resident who was a key member of Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign’s leadership team, also criticized Lee. “Business leaders that I talk to, many of whom supported him, would never support his reelection and in fact will work against him, myself included,” Zwick told the Post. According to Zwick, Lee is just a “showhorse.”

Zions Bank President A. Scott Anderson, a major Republican donor in Utah, said, “I think people admire him for sticking to his guns and principles, but I think there are growing frustrations… If things are to happen, you can’t just stick to your principles. You have to make things work… You’ve got to be practical.”

The Post reported that a potential Republican establishment challenger to Lee has already surfaced in “Thomas Wright, who stepped down this spring as chairman of the Utah Republican Party.” According to the Post, “Wright said he is considering running against Lee in 2016 because he has grown ‘exasperated’ with the junior senator’s governing style.”

Touching on an often used Republican establishment theme, Wright said, “I want to work with people to get things done. I want to go be a leader and build bridges, not burn them down.”

If early signs from Utah are any indication, the entire Republican establishment is looking to burn down every bridge to the Tea Party movement around the country in the 2014 primaries."
http://news.yahoo.com/sarah-palin-relevant-162431270.html,,[],Does Sarah Palin still matter?,"She hasn't held public office in four years. She hasn't run for public office in five.



Yet there Sarah Palin was earlier this week, on NBC's ""Today"" show, sparring with Matt Lauer about Obamacare (""This broken website I think is symbolic of a broken administration""), the tea party and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (he's ""no Ronald Reagan"").



There she was on CNN, telling Jake Tapper she was ""taken aback"" by recent ""liberal"" statements made by Pope Francis, as well as by Christie's ""extreme"" weight.



There she was on Fox News (where Palin is a paid contributor) telling Sean Hannity that congressional Republicans unwilling to stand with Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee during the partial government shutdown ""threw the good guys under the bus.""



And there she was on Fox again, this time on the ""Fox & Friends"" couch, holding hands with the show's hosts, Steve Doocy, Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Brian Kilmeade, while promoting ""Good Tidings and Great Joy,"" her holiday book about the war on Christmas (tagline: ""It's OK to wish me Merry Christmas!""), before embarking on a 15-city book tour.



Palin is in the public eye again with her book, armed with tea party-friendly, Twitter-sized sound bites about, well, just about anything.



On the national debt: ""There is another definition of slavery and that is being beholden to some kind of master that is not of your choosing. And the national debt will be like slavery when the note comes due.""



On President Barack Obama: ""I'll never forget Bill Clinton saying about Barack Obama and his story, his agenda, that it was the biggest fairy tale he'd ever seen. And he was right, because Barack Obama was not qualified, he was not prepared, and the manifestation of that today is the problem that we see left and right in our economy.""



On congressional Republicans: ""They threw the good guys under the bus. Ted Cruz, Mike Lee willing to stand strong on planks of the platform they ran on in addition to so many other politicians running on the idea of repealing and replacing ObamaCare. They finally had an opportunity to stand up and defund it and get America to debate the issue. And then they were thrown under the bus.""



On Christie hugging Obama during Superstorm Sandy: ""Perhaps it hurt Mitt Romney. I think it was unnecessary to literally be embracing Barack Obama at the time of such national import when it came to that campaign season. But, again, more important has been anyone on the GOP ticket who could support these policies of Barack Obama when it comes to granting amnesty to illegal aliens, for instance, or thwarting our Second Amendment rights or growing national debt.""



On GOP leadership: ""I want the Republican Party, kind of that leadership of the machine of the party, to really stiffen its spine and not be squishy.""



On the 'war on Christmas': ""You see the ACLU letters that get sent around to all the school districts now, warning them, you know, you'd better not acknowledge that Jesus is the reason for the season and don't — heaven forbid — you sing a song about Bethlehem or 'Silent Night,' because somebody may take offense.""



On the pope: ""He's had some statements that, to me, sound kind of liberal. It has taken me aback.""



But does anything the former Alaskan governor and ex-vice presidential candidate say really matter, particularly to the GOP? And is she relevant?



""She's so compelling,"" CNN contributor and Democratic strategist Paul Begala said on Wednesday. ""She is. You can't turn away. She tends to say these things that either people love or that they hate.""



And, don't look now, but Palin ""plunged herself into the heart of a debate roiling the Republican Party between the moderate establishment on one hand and tea party fist-raisers on the other,"" David Freedlander wrote on the Daily Beast. ""As the Palin bus rolls into town, political observers on the ground are wondering if the former governor of Alaska will offer a few kind words, or even a photo op, for the candidate of their choice.""



But other pundits believe Palin's time has come and gone.



“Sarah Palin is an entertainer,"" Bloomberg Businessweek's Justin Green said on MSNBC. ""She is not a politician anymore. She is the equivalent of Skid Row or one of those ’80s bands that is out on the state festival circuit with the carnies and the farm animals playing their greatest hits and trying to earn a dollar.”



Palin's supporters, though, say she is just as relevant today, perhaps more, than she was in 2008.



“Her message resonates with the average person,” Ron Devito, who runs the website US4Palin, told Freedlander. “She supports limited government, free markets, low taxes and our Constitution.”



Still, Devito condeded, Palin “has to decide what her place in the GOP galaxy is, and I am not sure that has been decided, either by her or by anyone else. ... The tea party people already know her message. She needs to get her message out beyond her comfort zone.”



That's part of the idea of the book tour, which began Tuesday in Bethlehem, Pa., (where at least 600 people turned out for Palin's signing), with planned stops in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Georgia, Florida, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska and Minnesota — all before Thanksgiving. The other part is selling books. Palin's 2009 memoir, ""Going Rogue,"" sold more than 2 million copies."
"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/clout/chi-new-general-assembly-sworn-in-as-full-plate-looms-20130109,0,4540610.story",,"['Ray Long', 'Rick Pearson', 'Rafael Guerrero']",New General Assembly sworn in as full plate looms,"SPRINGFIELD --- A new Illinois General Assembly was sworn in today, and after the ceremony and celebrations are over, lawmakers will face a full plate of unresolved issues in the month ahead.



Democrats now have veto-proof majorities in both the House and the Senate, increasing the party's control at a time when the state's $96.8 billion pension debt looms as a major issue. Also left hanging following Tuesday's adjournment of the last session: gay marriage, gun control and gambling expansion, among others.



Gov. Pat Quinn presided over the 59-member Senate, which is his constitutional duty, until Sen. John Cullerton, a Chicago Democrat, was re-elected as the chamber's president. Democrats make up 40 out of the 59 senators.



The House is across town at the University of Illinois-Springfield at an auditorium. The House elected Democratic Rep. Michael Madigan as speaker, a post he has held since 1983 with the exception of a two-year period when Republicans won control. He is Illinois' longest serving House speaker. There are 71 Democrats out of 118 members.



Madigan challenged his newly sworn colleagues to tackle the difficult finances of the state, including the ""absolutely serious nature"" of the heavily indebted pension systems.



The Southwest Side Democrat warned House members that ""really difficult work"" lies ahead, asking them to call upon their ""inner resolve.""



After briefly relenting the past few days during efforts to get pension reform passed, Madigan stuck beside his call to shift the state's costs of paying for suburban and Downstate teacher pensions onto local school districts. Madigan said it is now a ""free lunch"" given that Chicago property taxpayers cover expenses for the city's public teacher pensions.



House Minority Leader Tom Cross, R-Oswego, called on lawmakers to ""be bold"" and put political consequences aside when deciding how to move forward on the ""incredibly difficult issues.""



Earlier, House Majority Leader Barbara Currie launched the renomination of Madigan to start his 15th term as speaker of the House, saying the hallmark of his leadership is one of hard work, intelligence and deliberative decision making.



""He's not a knee-jerk, not a snap judgment kind of guy,"" Currie said.



Citing the state's daunting financial challenges, Currie said: ""One man has shown the capacity to chart a course out of the morass.""



Among lawmakers seconding Madigan's nomination. Rep. Elaine Nekritz, D-Northbrook, said Madigan is always a step ahead, or maybe ""seven or eight,"" as the clear ""focal point"" of the legislative process.



Unlike most ceremonial debates over pre-determined leadership choices, Rep. Mike Bost, R-Murphysboro, ripped into Madigan while nominating Cross for the speakership.



Bost drew national attention last year for a paper-tossing tirade against the confining Madigan-backed rules of procedure in the House, but he said this time he would try to ""keep my emotions in check.""



But Bost wasted little time before he railed against Madigan.



""For the last 32 years, this has not been a very democratic place,"" Bost said, singling out Madigan as the ""one person"" responsible for the problem.



Bost pleaded with colleagues to back Cross because today they will take the ""most important vote"" of the session, one that will determine how committees are structured and whether bills will ever be heard.



At the House ceremony, there is a banner with a picture of the Capitol dome and American flags. There is also a quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln: ""Determine the thing that can be and shall be done, and then we shall find the way.""



Four years ago, the Illinois House was sworn in, then promptly voted to impeach then-Gov. Rod Blagojevich. The Senate went on to remove Blagojevich from office, and eventually the ex-governor ended up serving federal time in a Colorado prison following his conviction on political corruption charges.



The new Illinois House is home to two lawmakers who face federal criminal charges: Reps. Derrick Smith, who was kicked out last August but re-elected in November by West Side voters; and LaShawn Ford, who was indicted on financial charges late last year."

(CNN) – Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney praised President Barack Obama's remarks on Thursday at an interfaith service remembering victims of the Boston Marathon bombing.

In an interview on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,"" Romney also stressed the importance of learning from such terror attacks and opened up about how his faith plays a role in times of crisis.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""I thought the president gave a superb address to the people of this city and the state and the nation,"" the former Massachusetts governor said. ""It was an inspiring day.""

Romney has deep ties to Boston. He ran his presidential campaign from the city and now serves as a chairman of a committee for the Boston-based Solamere Capital, the investment firm founded by his eldest son, Tagg.

Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick invited Romney to attend the church ceremony, along with other current and former Bay State politicos. Romney and the president did not speak at the event, the former GOP nominee said.

In the interview, Romney repeatedly emphasized a need to learn everything possible from Monday's bombings, which killed three people and injured 180 others.

The FBI released video footage of two suspects on Thursday and asked the public for help in identifying them.

""This is a learning opportunity,"" Romney said. ""We should learn the lessons that come from this and apply them to the extent that we possibly can.""

Asked if he would consider working on a security commission to study the terror attack and design steps to avert future attacks, Romney said he wouldn't turn away from a call to prevent violence.

He pointed to his experience leading the 2002 Winter Olympics and the security measures installed in Salt Lake City.

He also referenced his time serving on the Homeland Security Advisory Council, a panel comprised of a range of leaders from both the private and public sector who advise the secretary of homeland security, under the George W. Bush administration.

""In my heart of hearts, what I understand is, it is intelligence work. And by intelligence, it's not just meaning the CIA and the FBI and wire taps. It is also people who are watching what's going on, reporting what's going on, combing that information such that we can prevent the worse things that are occurring,"" he said.

Romney, who belongs to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also gave a rare glimpse into his faith and how he sees the role of God and free will

Asked why he thinks bad things happen to good people, he said the only answer he knows for that type of question is to ""get on one's own knees and to pray for understanding and for comfort.""

""I believe very deeply that we have a creator and that he loves us and cares for us. But when he actually intervenes in the affairs of the people on this earth - it's something that happens only rarely - and when that happens and why that happens and who that happens to is something that we don't understand,"" he said.

Romney said he also gains strength from seeing the community come together during tragedy and talked about his visits with injured victims in Boston hospitals on Thursday.

""This is a time when your faith in God is enhanced by seeing the goodness of the men and women He's created,"" he said.

Referring to the interfaith service, Romney said it was an ""inspiring"" and lauded the singing of ""America the Beautiful,"" a song he was known to sometimes sing on the campaign trail.

""It was a hearty rendition.""

Washington (CNN) - John Kerry was overwhelmingly confirmed Tuesday as the 68th secretary of state by his colleagues in the U.S. Senate.

The vote was 94-3, with Republican Senators John Cornyn, Ted Cruz and James Inhofe voting no. Kerry voted present on his own nomination.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Earlier in the day he received the nod of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The panel approved his nomination unanimously by a voice vote.

Kerry submitted his resignation letter to Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, saying he resigns his seat effective Friday at 4 p.m.

Kerry, the longtime senator from Massachusetts and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, has served on the committee for decades and was the panel's chairman the past four years.

President Barack Obama last month nominated Kerry to succeed outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as the country's top diplomat.

In a statement, he said, ""I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed John Kerry as our next secretary of state with overwhelming bipartisan support. From his decorated service in Vietnam to his decades in the Senate as a champion of American global leadership, John's distinguished career has prepared him to guide American diplomacy in the years ahead.

""John has earned the respect of leaders around the world and the confidence of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, and I am confident he will make an extraordinary secretary of state,"" Obama continued. ""I look forward to his counsel and partnership in the years ahead as we ensure American leadership in the world and advance the interests and values that keep our nation strong.""

Patrick, who will appoint a temporary successor to the seat, said in a statement that he thanks ""Senator Kerry for his decades of service to the people of Massachusetts.

""From his days as lieutenant governor to his nearly thirty years in the United States Senate, he has been our steadfast champion,"" Patrick said. ""I know that he will bring the dedication, intelligence, and passion to his new role that he brought to representing Massachusetts. We are sad to lose him as our senator, but excited about and grateful for his service to the nation on the international stage.""

Democrat Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts freshman who becomes the state's senior senator with his resignation, said, ""John Kerry is a true statesman, and he will be an extraordinary Secretary of State. His experience as a Navy lieutenant, veteran, prosecutor, Lieutenant Governor, Senator, and Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee uniquely qualifies him to represent the people of the United States around the world. I was proud to cast my vote – and I am excited to call him Mr. Secretary.""

Democratic Rep. Ed Markey, the only declared candidate so far for Kerry's seat, praised him, saying: ""Americans can be confident that John Kerry is the most qualified, knowledgeable, and passionate person to represent our interests around the world. Going from Hillary Clinton to John Kerry at the State Department is like the Red Sox going from Ted Williams to Carl Yastrzemski, both possessing hall of fame talent and passion for the job.

Kerry has served in the U.S. Senate since 1984.

Kerry's confirmation makes him the first new member of Obama's second-term cabinet to be installed. Obama has also nominated candidates to lead the departments of defense and treasury.

The suit, which follows similar litigation against Texas, is the latest effort by the department to go after voting discrimination in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling in June striking down part of the Voting Rights Act.

Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. called the North Carolina law “an intentional attempt to break a system that was working,” and he said that it was clearly intended to discriminate on the basis of race.

But North Carolina and Texas represent only one front in the continuing battle to protect voting rights. Twenty years after Congress passed the “motor voter” law to make it easier for Americans to register to vote, numerous states keep trying to make it harder, relying on vague and dubious claims of voter fraud to push through misguided and harmful legislation.

The 1993 law, formally known as the National Voter Registration Act, established a uniform federal form that requires only that voters attest under penalty of perjury that they are citizens. The form, which states must “accept and use” when people apply for a driver’s license, has helped millions of Americans register to vote."

Consider these recent developments:

Late Thursday: Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a possible presidential candidate in 2016, ridicules fellow Republicans as the “stupid party” and urges Washington Republicans to get over their obsession with cutting budgets.

Friday afternoon: The office of Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, another would-be Republican presidential candidate, declares that he will not go along with a plan, hatched by conservative legislators, to rewrite the state’s election laws in a way that would stack Virginia’s electoral votes against Democrats.

Late Friday: Fox News says it has parted ways with Sarah Palin, the former vice presidential candidate and tea-party darling whose following had shriveled.

1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.

Saturday: Reports emerge that House Speaker John Boehner had given a speech in which he referred to “hard heads” in his Republican caucus.

Monday: Sen. John McCain, who during his 2008 presidential run backed an enforcement-only approach to immigration, declares his support for a plan for undocumented immigrants to become legal. Joining him on the stage is Sen. Marco Rubio, one of the party’s brightest stars for 2016.

This last offense was too much for Rush Limbaugh, who denounced the “amnesty” plan. “Why are we doing this?” he asked Rubio on-air Tuesday.

Rubio was solicitous but firm. “We do have this existing problem that has to be dealt with,” he replied.

It is too early to call a requiem for the tea party. The informal movement still dominates the House Republicans. And the GOP’s puritanical primary process, encouraged by the redrawing of districts to protect Republican seats, guarantees that the far right will remain entrenched in the party for some time. Fresh evidence of the phenomenon can be seen in the decision by Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) to retire rather than face a primary challenge from the right.

But if the tea party isn’t over, some of the more sensible partygoers are heading for the exits, realizing that things are getting rowdy and the neighbors may soon be calling the cops. Republicans with national ambitions — Jindal, McDonnell, New Jersey’s Chris Christie — are moderating their images and views in ways that keep pace with the electorate.

That electorate punished some of the party’s more incendiary elements in November — Missouri’s Todd Akin, Indiana’s Richard Mourdock, Florida’s Allen West — and now many of those same people are voting with their remotes. Fox News apparently decided that it was no longer worth paying Palin to give televised warnings of the catastrophic effects of President Obama’s “socialist” policies.

Demagoguery works well in bad times, but it’s harder to stoke fear and anger when the stock market is at a five-year high and the private sector has been adding jobs for nearly three years.

If anything, anger has turned against tea-party lawmakers. Christie, one of the most popular Republicans in the land, decried GOP leaders’ “disgusting” behavior after they forced a delay in funds for Hurricane Sandy recovery. The leaders relented, allowing the spending bill, like Obama’s tax hike on the wealthy, to pass despite no votes from most House Republicans.

On immigration, likewise, fear of the tea party’s demagoguery has subsided. McCain, for example, fought off a primary challenge in 2010 from an opponent who called him soft on illegal immigration. But on Monday, McCain stood up to those who would call his new plan amnesty. A “de facto amnesty” already exists, he said. “We have been too content for too long to allow individuals to mow our lawn, serve our food, clean our homes and even watch our children, while not affording them any of the benefits that make our country so great.”

The return of the old McCain (in 2010, he endorsed Arizona’s harsh immigration law) is an encouraging sign, as was the retirement of Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), a reflexive critic of anything he could label “amnesty.”

More good news comes from the House, where most declined to join Limbaugh in his “amnesty” rant. And Rubio, though he owes his job to the tea party, wasn’t going to be bullied.

“I know why people are uncomfortable about it,” he told Limbaugh on Tuesday. But he defended compromise. “Anytime I see anything that’s harmful to America, as a policymaker I try to make it better,” he said. “I’m just trying to do the best I can with what’s already a tough situation.”

Palin probably would disagree. But who cares?

(CNN) - Former President Bill Clinton may have stoked more speculation about his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and her potential run for president.

Asked during a Q-and-A session on Saturday if he'd rather take eight more years as president or complete 16 projects at the Clinton Global Initiative, Clinton said - after a pause - ""I would rather keep doing what I'm doing.""

""Because I think America will have some very good choices for president,"" he continued, drawing applause from the audience as they presumably clapped and cheered for his wife.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

His comments came in St. Louis at the annual meeting for the Clinton Global Initiative University, part of his nonprofit he runs that gets young people focused on innovations to improve poverty, development and medical care around the world.

The forum ended with Clinton being interviewed on stage by comedian Stephen Colbert, a conversation that will air on Comedy Central's ""Colbert Report"" Monday evening. Clinton and Colbert took questions from the young audience after the interview.

""I think that, except in unusual circumstances, a two-term limit is a good thing,"" Clinton continued. He said he wouldn't oppose allowing future presidents to run for a third term not immediately after their second.

""But I would personally rather keep on doing what I'm doing for as long as I can possibly do it, because I think I have learned how to do it, and I'm not sure anybody else would be doing this - whereas I'm quite sure there are going to be lots of talented people who are dying to become president of the United States,"" he said.

Although recent polls show Hillary Clinton would come out strong against potential Republican rivals should she decide to make another bid for the White House, one Republican senator said Sunday that her supporters shouldn't get their hopes up.

""I think after eight years of Barack Obama, if things don't change, the next Democrat running for president will be in trouble,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""She will be a formidable candidate. I think her time as secretary of state is mixed. Benghazi is yet to be told completely. Anybody underestimates her on the Republican side would do so at a peril. But yes, she can be beat; anybody can be beat in this country."""

But despite President Obama’s tepid job approval ratings, Democrats have a shot at breaking that rule this November. Some polls show the Democratic nominee, Terry McAuliffe, with a narrow lead over Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, his Republican challenger.

“Why is McAuliffe ahead?” asked Tom Davis, a former Virginia congressman and Republican strategist.

One important reason: The same demographic shifts that made it possible for Mr. Obama to carry Virginia twice after 10 consecutive Democratic losses have raised the water level for the party’s statewide candidates, too.

The swelling number of Virginia’s suburban, college-educated, moderate, minority voters — black, Hispanic and Asian — is hardly the only factor shaping the race. It is certainly not the most conspicuous, as scandal swirls around Gov. Bob McDonnell, the departing Republican, and buffets Mr. Cuccinelli at the same time."

Democrats will defend 18 incumbents and two open seats in the Senate in 2014

Seven of the races will be in states that voted for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012

Harkin has seniority and power in the Senate but says %27it%27s somebody else%27s turn%27

With barely a moment to celebrate an increase in their U.S. Senate majority, Democrats face a steeper challenge in keeping control of the chamber in 2014, thanks to the surprise retirements of two senior Democratic senators.

Iowa's Tom Harkin, powerful in the Senate and popular back home, said Saturday he will not seek re-election in 2014, creating an open seat in a swing state. Harkin's announcement follows that of Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, who said Jan. 11 he would retire at the end of his term.

Those departures mean that in 2014, Democrats must try to hang onto two open seats in addition to defending 18 incumbents – and seven of the 20 races are in states that voted Republican in the presidential election. The red-state Senators on the 2014 ballot include Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Begich of Alaska, Max Baucus of Montana, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina.

Republicans will have 13 senators up for re-election, all but one – Susan Collins of Maine — from red states.

Harkin's retirement puts Iowa ""in the top tier of competitive Senate races'' for 2014, Rob Collins, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement. ""With Democrats already on defense in a number of key states such as West Virginia, Louisiana, South Dakota and others, there is no question that this is very troubling news for Harry Reid and his liberal friends in Washington.""

Democrats — counting independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont — hold a 55-45 advantage over Republicans in the Senate after winning Senate seats in Indiana and Massachusetts that had been held by Republicans. In addition, Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who replaced Republican Olympia Snowe, caucuses with the Democrats.

The map is daunting for Democrats, but the math is hard for Republicans, says Matt Canter of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. To take the majority in the Senate, Republicans must win six of the seven red-state Democratic seats. ""Republicans essentially have no room for error if they're going to actually contest the majority,'' he says. ""This is a difficult map for Democrats, but Republicans face a very steep climb, and I don't think the retirements this week dramatically change the map where we sit today.''

Harkin, 73, was elected to the Senate in 1984 and is fourth in seniority among Democrats and the chairman of the important Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. He had already raised money for a 2014 race and planned a fundraiser for next month – minimum $1,500 contribution — with the pop star Lady Gaga.

""To tell you that it's easy to walk away from that kind of position and power, that would be a lie,'' he said Saturday. But ""it's somebody else's turn. I'm hopeful that the Democrats come up with a smart, savvy person who can organize a campaign, raise the money and win.''

Rep. Bruce Braley, a fourth-term Democrat from the northeastern part of Iowa, said in a statement Sunday that he is considering running for Harkin's seat. ""While Senator Harkin's shoes are impossible to fill, in the coming days my family and I will carefully weigh a possible candidacy for Senate,'' Braley said on his Facebook page Sunday.

Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., said Friday he would also retire. Chambliss, 69, was criticized by conservatives in November for refusing to pledge not to raise taxes. Though Georgia is a red-leaning state, Democrats hope Republicans nominate a conservative candidate that will leave an opening for a moderate Democrat to be elected – as happened last November in Indiana. DSCC executive director Guy Cecil called it ""one of the Democrats best pickup opportunities'' in a statement last week. ""There are already several reports of the potential for a divisive primary that will push Republicans to the extreme right.''

Born In San Francisco', 'He S A Graduate Of Stanford University.']",Dance of the GOP governors,"Don’t look now, but auditions for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination are already underway in Washington. And the flavor of the moment is — governors.

First came Chris Christie, the pugnacious governor of New Jersey, who won reelection by a landslide last month and almost immediately headed to the nation’s capital for a burst of speeches and television appearances.

Days later, a less pyrotechnic (but equally combative) chief executive arrived to do the Washington media rounds: Scott Walker of Wisconsin. His message was the same: “If we can do it in Wisconsin, we can do it anywhere, even in the nation’s capital.”

The point wasn’t subtle. As broken as Washington is, the next president should be an outsider, a hardworking governor, say, who has managed to tame a rebellious legislature and balance his budget.

It’s a message likely to play well with American voters (and not only Republicans) who have long believed that executive experience is a better qualification for aspiring presidents than time in the windy halls of Congress.

Barack Obama was the first legislator elected to the White House in almost half a century, and his wobbly performance managing the launch of his own Affordable Care Act could affect other senators’ chances for years.

Neither Christie nor Walker has announced that he’s running for president, but — refreshingly — neither pretends to be uninterested either.

To many Republicans, yearning for a primary contest less chaotic than the messy epic that produced Mitt Romney in 2012, that field looks decent already: two successful governors — a relatively moderate conservative from the Northeast and a more orthodox conservative from the Midwest.

Christie’s already nationally famous, if only for his battles with his weight (tamed last year by bariatric surgery) and his penchant for dressing down reporters (and occasionally voters) with words like “idiot.” And a CNN/ORC International poll released Friday declared Christie the early front-runner in the Republican race.

But who is Scott Walker?

At a breakfast with reporters in Washington last month — one of the obligatory stops for any politician thinking about running for president — the taciturn, understated Walker joked that he’s just like Christie but “with a Midwestern filter.”

“I’m willing to speak out, but I’m not going to call you an idiot,” he said.

Marc Thiessen, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush who collaborated with Walker on a recent book (another requisite pre-campaign step), described him this way: “Moderate in temperament but immoderate in policy.”

Walker, 46, was elected governor of Wisconsin in 2010 and, when confronting a budget deficit, made an audacious decision: Instead of raising taxes or cutting state services, he went to war with public employee unions over their contracts. The new governor initially proposed to eliminate collective bargaining, but he bowed to advisors who urged him to focus instead on cutting employees’ generous benefits, which exceeded what most private-sector workers enjoyed.

The ensuing battles included a virtual occupation of the state Capitol by protesters, the flight of 14 Democratic state senators across the state line to Illinois in a failed attempt to prevent a vote and a 2012 recall election that Walker won by a convincing margin.

Along the way, he also cut taxes, turned the state’s budget deficit into a surplus — and became a hero to fiscal conservatives across the country.

Now, Walker says, he’d like to bring the lessons of his experience in Wisconsin to Washington, even if only in advising his party’s next presidential nominee, who he thinks (surprise!) should be a governor.

His message is that rugged fiscal conservatism can win support from voters in the center, as long as it’s consistent, unwavering and focused on increasing economic opportunity for all. As evidence, he points to polls that show that 11% of Wisconsin voters supported both him and Obama last year.

“We need to do more than simply say no,” he writes in his book. “The way to win the center is to champion bold, positive reforms that make people’s lives better.”

That means focusing on the economy and jobs and the size of government, not on the arid federal budget issues that have captured Congress (“debt limits are not relevant to people’s lives”) or even the social issues that have dominated Republican primary races in years past.

“I’m pro-life,” Walker said. “I don’t apologize for that. But I don’t focus on it; I don’t obsess with it.”

Above all, capturing the center means reaching out to minorities and low-income people, he says, and avoiding the trap Romney fell into of dismissing the bottom 47% as unreachable for Republicans.

“Republicans need to reclaim their position as the party of upward mobility and opportunity for all,” Walker writes, citing Ronald Reagan as a conservative who appealed to blue-collar workers as well as business owners.

Which is a fine idea, so fine that almost every GOP candidate in memory, including Romney, has said it more than once.

The challenge none of the potential candidates has met is to show how they’d do it. For all the critiques Walker and Christie have been willing to sling at Washington, they’ve been shy on specific remedies.

And Republicans in Congress, including Wisconsin Rep. Paul D. Ryan and Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, aren’t likely to concede that a governor would make a better president. But at this early stage, the momentum in the GOP race belongs to governors.

If there was any doubt about the huge amount of discord within the Republican Party, the three-day Conservative Political Action Conference should put it to rest.

The suburban Washington gathering of the most conservative elements of the GOP this week featured speaker after speaker picking fights with other Republicans and offering criticisms — sometimes indirect and often direct — of party figures such as Mitt Romney, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Karl Rove, former president George W. Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Most of the speakers urged Republicans not to change but rather to double down on conservative principles. They included keynote speaker Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), a leader of the new generation of Republicans whom McCain recently labeled “wacko birds.”

“If standing for liberty and standing for the Constitution means you’re a wacko bird, then count me a proud wacko bird,” Cruz said Saturday. “I think there are more than a few other wacko birds gathered here today.”

Cruz also argued that the party’s new generation is starting to gain traction, pointing to Sen. Rand Paul — who had just won the CPAC straw poll — and his 13-hour filibuster this month against President Obama’s drone program, along with the spending cuts contained in the sequester that took effect at the start of the month.

Former Gov. of Alaska Sarah Palin stopped midway through her CPAC speech on Saturday to take a drink from a Big Gulp, and offer advice to young College Republicans. (The Washington Post)

“For the last three weeks, conservatives have been winning,” Cruz said.

The discord, while not new, is particularly noteworthy as the party seeks its way forward after a disappointing 2012 election.

Republican officials unhappy with their losses have begun to push for a new core message and changes or moderation on social issues and illegal immigration.

Two recent events have inflamed that debate. First was the launch of a new group headed by Rove that seeks to recruit and nominate more electable Republican candidates, which conservatives see as a veiled attempt to elect less-conservative Republicans. Second was Paul’s filibuster, which earned the ire of foreign policy hawks such as McCain and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.).

McCain has since apologized for his “wacko birds” comment, but he was booed several times at CPAC.

The speakers at CPAC were united against the McCain and Rove element in the party, picking on them repeatedly and suggesting that conservative principles would win the day if the party stuck with them.

“We do know deep down, as Ronald Reagan did, that we don’t have to change because . . . we know that we’re right and they’re wrong,” said David Keene, the president of the National Rifle Association and the former chairman of the American Conservative Union, which organizes CPAC.

Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who has been a frequent critic of Rove’s new Conservative Victory Project, urged Republicans not to change their principles but instead propose new ideas.

“The Republican establishment is just plain wrong about how it approaches politics,” Gingrich said. “The Republican consulting class is just plain wrong about how it approaches politics.”

Former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin was more direct, suggesting Rove head back to Texas, where he helped launched George W. Bush’s political career.

“The last thing we need is Washington, D.C., vetting our candidates,” Palin said. “The architects can head on back to the Lone Star State and put their names on some ballot.”

Palin riled the crowd up more than anybody, delivering a blistering attack on Obama with a string of one-liners.

“Barack Obama promised the most transparent administration ever. Barack Obama: You lie!” she said, alluding to the 2009 incident in which a House member yelled “You lie!” at Obama during a speech before Congress.

The crowd went wild when Palin paused mid-speech, produced a Big Gulp from beneath the lectern and mugged for the camera while taking a long sip. Conservatives have savaged New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I) for his proposed ban on sugary beverages of more than 16 ounces.

Emerging conservative star and Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon Ben Carson caused a stir by announcing he would soon retire from his practice and alluding to speculation that he could be an outsider presidential candidate.

“I want to quit while I’m at the top of my game, and there are so many more things that could be done,” the 61-year-old said as the crowd rose to its feet.

Carson offered a hypothetical involving an unnamed president — and then suggested that president could be him. “Let’s say you magically put me in the White House,” Carson said as the crowd howled.

Another Republican dipping his toe into the 2016 presidential campaign during CPAC was Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the winner of a contentious 2012 recall election who earned plaudits from conservatives by curbing collective-bargaining rights for public-sector unions. “Someday, maybe once we get past all this, we’ll take a look at it,” Walker said in an interview.

Paul’s victory in the straw poll was widely expected, especially given the past successes in the CPAC straw poll of his father, former representative Ron Paul (R-Tex.). Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) came in second.

Story highlights New York Times issues mayoral endorsements Primaries are Sept. 10 General election winner will replace Bloomberg

(CNN) —

The New York Times on Saturday endorsed Christine Quinn, a Democrat, and Joseph Lhota, a Republican, ahead of the primary elections to determine who will run to succeed New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The endorsements by the renowned newspaper could have substantial influence on the September 10 primary elections for each party.

Quinn, the City Council speaker and one of seven Democrats in the primary race, “offers the judgment and record of achievement anyone should want in a mayor,” the newspaper said.

“She has shepherded through important laws protecting New Yorkers’ health, safety and civil rights, including measures banning public smoking, protecting tenants and small businesses, and battling slumlords. She sponsored the sweeping 2007 legislation that made the city’s exemplary campaign-finance laws even stronger,” the Times endorsement said.

The newspaper gave credit to two other Democratic candidates, Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, and former comptroller William Thompson Jr., but said the editorial board had already been set to endorse Quinn even before what they believed was her impressive performance in a debate Wednesday.

“We are honored to have the endorsement of the New York Times. The endorsement makes clear that Christine Quinn hasn’t just talked about being a progressive, she has a long record of fighting for New York’s progressive values and she has delivered results every step of the way,” said Mike Morey, spokesman for the campaign.

According to the latest NBC 4 NY/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey released on August 16, de Blasio and Quinn are currently tied in the polls. If no candidate obtains the required 40% of the vote, the top two will hold a runoff on Oct. 1.

The crowded Democratic field includes former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner.

The Times called Republican candidate Joe Lhota, once right-hand man to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former chairman of the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority, “the best qualified of the three men seeking the Republican nomination for mayor.”

“Few people know better than Mr. Lhota how city government works. He was an expert budget director for Mr. Giuliani, and then became deputy mayor for operations,” the Times said.

“In 2011 and 2012, he ran the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which, under his leadership, recovered amazingly quickly from the damage done by Hurricane Sandy,” the paper said.

CNN’s Greg Botelho contributed to this report."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/12/rubio-ryan-values-voters-straw-poll,2013-10-12 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],"Rubio, Ryan Crater, Cruz Soars in Values Voter Summit Poll","Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), the GOP’s most recent vice presidential candidate, finished with a combined total of less than 10 percent of the vote in the Family Research Council (FRC) Values Voter Summit straw poll.

Rubio finished in fifth place with 5 percent of the vote, while Ryan finished in sixth place with 4 percent of the vote. The three biggest issues for the 762 straw poll voters were religious liberty, life, and Obamacare.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) finished overwhelmingly in first place, taking in 42 percent of the straw poll’s vote. Dr. Ben Carson, an ardent opponent of Obamacare, and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, a social conservative, finished tied for second place with 13 percent of the vote each.

Rubio has taken a beating among the GOP’s rank-and-file voters for his stance on immigration reform and continues to be unable to return to the top tier of conservative leaders. Ryan, who also supports comprehensive immigration reform, has recently become the face of the GOP establishment’s willingness to surrender to President Barack Obama on Obamacare and the ongoing fiscal fights over both the budget and the debt ceiling.

A high-ranking conservative Capitol Hill staffer told Breitbart News that Ryan’s fiscal stances seem to be out-of-step with the values of conservatives. “I don’t think he did himself any good by his latest proposal, mostly proved himself to be out of touch with the current trend,” the staffer said in an email. “We are hoping the majority of the majority will enjoy being on the right side.”

When FRC Action president Tony Perkins was asked by Breitbart News what he thought of Ryan’s performance in the straw poll, Perkins said, “He wasn’t here personally. Clearly, I think it helps if you’re here and able to speak. Now, he did speak via video, but I just think the competition is steep. We had really, really great speeches by some really great leaders. It’s hard to compete with that by video message so that’s what I would attribute it to.”

Ryan had previously stated he would join the summit but ended up sending in a video speech in order to attend negotiations with the White House instead.

Perkins also said he thinks the ongoing fiscal negotiations that Ryan is leading on behalf of House Republicans “factors in quite significantly.”

“As I was just talking with Ted Cruz to call him to give him the results of the polling, and I do that every year, I will call the individual and give them a heads-up on who wins the straw poll, and so I called and talked to Ted,” Perkins said. “He was very encouraged by the response he received here and very surprised and excited to hear the results that he won the straw poll. It simply served to encourage him and bolster him in the stand that he is taking, that he is representing and defending the families of this country that will be negatively impacted by Obamacare and keeping his word to voters that he would come here to repeal Obamacare.”

“So I think it says that those base voters are not only not punching those who are doing what they said they were going to do, but rewarding them for doing so,” Perkins said.

Perkins added he does not think immigration “divides the social conservative voters as much as some would like it to.”

“There certainly are differences in opinion of how we address it and how we approach it, but I do not think that in my numerous conversations regarding this issue that it divides social conservatives as much as some think,” Perkins said. “I think this [straw poll] is more a reflection of who has been out front on one of the most pressing issues; as I mentioned, Obamacare finished at the top three of our issues. Religious liberty was at the very top, which Obamacare is a direct assault on.”

“Who’s been leading the charge on that? And that answer would be Ted Cruz,” he stated.

Cruz also helped lead the charge, along with Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), in the U.S. Senate against the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill and remains opposed to any pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants in America.

Perkins added that this straw poll shows the GOP establishment must begin representing populist ideas of what the conservative base wants. “That [the establishment] is the same mindset that brought us the results in 2008 and 2012,” Perkins said. “These issues that the vast majority of the Republican voting base care about were ignored.”

“The numbers, and I’ve seen the analysis of the 2012 election specifically, the post-election analysis, and the Republicans said this is where they’re going and they wanted to reach the middle and they did, but they stepped over the base,” he explained. “What you’re seeing here consistently is the president is mobilizing and exciting his base on many of these issues and in many of these elections the Republicans have not. They’ve not been able to do that.”"

He Left The Post In April']",Is it 2016 already?,"Jan. 1, 2016, is 859 days away. But, judging from the headlines about the 2016 presidential race blaring across news Web sites and cable channels this August, you might think it were next month.

Hillary Rodham Clinton (along with her husband and daughter) is trying to raise $250 million for the family’s philanthropic foundation prior to 2016, in hopes of avoiding bad optics if she runs for president. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) spent last weekend in Iowa and was in New Hampshire on Friday. Vice President Biden’s political team is making clear that he is thinking seriously about the next presidential contest, and he’ll be in Iowa next month to show just how serious he is.

All of the early machinations by Republicans and Democrats who want to be the next president — even though President Obama won reelection just 292 days ago — have spawned a cottage industry of people wondering whether this is the earliest start ever for a presidential race and whether that’s a good or a bad thing. (Almost everyone, The Fix most definitely excluded, says it’s a bad thing.)

While the 2016 race may have started earlier than most, American presidential politics have been governed for some time by what we like to call The Fix’s Iceberg Theory. Here’s the theory in a sentence: Like an iceberg, the bulk of a presidential race happens underwater, or, out of sight of the average person.

Now, for the longer explanation.

Most regular people — even those living in states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina that play an outsize role in picking presidents — are paying absolutely no attention to what the people who might run in three years’ time for the nation’s highest office are doing right now.

That lack of interest tends to drive a narrative that what happens now simply does not matter for the 2016 race. That’s wrong. Simply because the average voter isn’t aware of what’s happening in presidential politics at the moment doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter.

The truth of presidential races is that the dominant story line for each of the potential candidates is built out of sight of the average voter, crafted years in advance of the political iceberg popping above the surface for everyone to see.

It was during the 2006 midterm elections that buzz started to build around Barack Obama, the freshman senator who was drawing massive crowds everywhere he went to stump or raise money for Democratic candidates.

It was during his 1998 Texas gubernatorial reelection campaign that George W. Bush built and honed the “compassionate conservative” message that he rode to the Republican nomination and the presidency in 2000.

On the other side of the equation, it was in 2006 that then-Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) was cast as a vanilla centrist, a characterization that played a major part in his decision not to run for president in 2008. Biden battled the perception that he was not serious enough to be the nominee throughout the 2008 race, an impression drawn from years of blunt/impolitic comments.

Fast-forward to the present day. Is Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) a conservative who can broaden the Republican Party’s reach to crucial Hispanic voters or a moderate in conservative’s clothing, as evidenced by his key involvement in the Senate immigration bill? Is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) a blunt-talking problem solver or a bullying blowhard? Is Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) a danger to the GOP or its savior? Is Clinton the inevitable nominee or the same flawed politician that Obama exposed during the 2008 Democratic primaries?

All of these questions will be answered — or come close to being answered — before a single vote is cast — and, in many cases, before the average person even begins to think about the 2016 presidential race.

And it’s not just narratives that get formed years in advance of actual votes. Building a national fundraising operation that can collect tens — if not hundreds — of millions of dollars takes massive amounts of time. Constructing a political team that has the right combination of experience and fresh-eyed insight can be the work of a political lifetime. Courting key activists in Iowa or New Hampshire or South Carolina or Nevada is an arduous process in which time spent can make all the difference.

Ignoring the iceberg nature of the presidential race then can have huge negative consequences. In 2008, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R) became the momentum candidate after winning the Iowa caucuses. But because he and his team either didn’t understand or ignored the iceberg theory, he was unable to build on that momentum in New Hampshire, where he finished a distant third. After a runner-up showing in South Carolina, Huckabee’s chances at the nomination vanished.

Smart candidates — and their campaigns — understand that the bulk of the work that goes into winning the presidential nomination happens well out of sight of a single voter. Momentum still matters — a lot — but without a structure to take advantage of that momentum, it can peter out as quickly as it comes. And if the primary fight drags out — a la the 2008 Democratic primaries or the 2012 Republican fight — what a candidate and his/her campaign team did years before when no voters were watching can be the difference between winning and losing.

If you remember one thing about the presidential race then, remember this: What’s going on below the surface can — and almost always does — make or break the candidates."
http://www.breitbart.com/InstaBlog/2013/10/05/Obama-Has-Lost-It,2013-10-05 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],Obama Has Lost It,"It is worth noting that in most of the serious political crises during (or, more accurately, fomented by) the Obama administration, President Barack Obama has done nothing to reach agreements, and much to destroy them. Dealmaking comes down–alarmingly!–to Vice President Joe Biden’s intercessions.

Now there’s an additional reason to question President Obama’s leadership–and competence to hold office: he apparently thinks that he never tried to get media attention as a first-term U.S. Senator–not like that evil, self-interested Ted Cruz. He also, he says, never voted to shut down the government (never mind that vote against the debt ceiling, which even his spokespeople have admitted was a “political” gambit).

How utterly crazy is the president’s claim? He may have kept a low legislative profile in the Senate, where he barely showed up for work, but he was constantly the center of media attention–and made himself so. He led the left’s opposition to the Bush administration, for instance–and the centrist Clinton faction. He wrote The Audacity of Hope–a bestseller, and one that involved much media promotion, of course.

Then there was the whole running for president in his first term thing. Even before the campaign, Obama was making the media rounds, even appearing on a commercial during Monday Night Football in 2006 to tease the media’s appetite for his political ambitions. It doesn’t get much more self-promoting than this:

In fact, all Barack Obama was as a first-term U.S. Senator was a media sensation–the biggest ever. And it’s pretty much all he’s been since, judged by his lack of interest in doing his actual job. To insist otherwise, you’ve really got to be cracked. I never thought I’d say this, but maybe he should step down for Uncle Joe.

In response to Obama’s shutdown war on the American people intensifies:"

Despite efforts by RNC spokesperson Sean Spicer to walk those comments back, local conservative grassroots leaders–almost all of whom have been working hard for over four years with no compensation–remain unimpressed.

Ben Cunningham, founder of the Nashville Tea Party and one of the leaders of the decade earlier Tennessee Tax Revolt, told Breitbart News that “we are not about to be led by a bunch of timid Washington, D.C. Brahmins who are interested in making a buck off of people they see as naive. Either join us in the fight or get the hell out of the way.”

Cunningham added that “the problem for Washington, D.C.-based Republican consultants is they have become almost completely detached from the passion and purpose of the grassroots. To the grassroots Tea Party activist,” Cunningham continued, “the future of the country is at stake and they immediately distrust ‘consultants’ who feel uneasy about manifesting their passion and fighting for the cause. Tea Party activists have been demonized and vilified and called every name in the book by liberals for four years and it has only made us stronger and more determined than ever.”

Zan Green, founder of the Rainy Day Patriots, a local tea party in Birmingham, Alabama organized in February 2009, echoed Cunningham’s sentiments. “The RNC is welcome to join ‘We The People’ in our self funded, personal-time-spent efforts to restore our republic. We could use some team players and there is always room for more boots on the ground.”

Eric Olsen, co-founder of the 5,000 member Montana Shrugged Teaparty Patriots of Billings, Montana, told Breitbart News that “I take exception to all the reports coming from the Republican old guard. They do not realize it, but they are losing their base with such remarks.”

According to Olsen “the GOP should totally embrace the teaparty/grassroots followers as it is to their best interest. But they lack the political will to do so. Instead they demean the success of the movement. They purposely went out of their way last election cycle to disenfranchise the tea party, libertarian and Ron Paul supporters. We all know what happened then. They lost crucial elections across the nation while successful teaparty backed candidates like Ted Cruz won handily.”

Olsen called the RNC Autopsy report “a joke,” and added that “it shows the willingness of the old guard GOP to throw their platform under the bus giving in to the pressure from the extreme left.”

“Passion for America,” Olsen concluded, “is the only force that will resurrect real hope and change for the United States.”"

And that explains why a seat on the Financial Services Committee is so coveted.

Political action committees — set up by lobbying firms, unions, corporations and other groups trying to push their agenda in Congress — have donated more money to Financial Services Committee members in the first six months of this year than to members of any other committee. The $9.4 million total is nearly $2 million more than the total for the Armed Services Committee, the only House panel with more members.

With so many lawmakers clamoring to be on the Financial Services Committee, it has grown to 61 members from 44 since 1980, forcing the installation of four tiered rows of seats in the Rayburn House Office Building — with the first row of lawmakers on the floor, just in front of the tables used for witnesses.

The committee’s chairman, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, remains the top recipient of donations from industry PACs this year, taking in $282,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that tracks the influence of money in politics. But three Republican freshmen — Mr. Barr and Representatives Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ann Wagner of Missouri — have raised more money from industry PACs than many longtime committee members like Representative Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican who served as the panel’s chairman until the end of last year.

The imbalance is apparent on the Democratic side as well. Each of the seven freshman Democrats on the committee has raised more industry PAC money so far this year than the committee’s top Democrat, Representative Maxine Waters of California, who has had a testy relationship with the industry.

These freshman Democrats joined this year with Republicans on the committee — over the objection of Ms. Waters and the Obama administration — to support measures advocated by Wall Street banks that would roll back some of the strictest provisions of the landmark Dodd-Frank financial regulations, which were passed in 2010 in the aftermath of the global recession."

The House and Senate adjourned for the day shortly after the incident as the shutdown extended into a third day.

Along with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, Mr. Boehner has long dismissed the idea that Congress would not act to prevent a damaging default, and President Obama on Thursday called a default “the height of irresponsibility.” But the failure of the House and Senate to reach a deal ahead of the shutdown has raised questions of whether Republicans could be persuaded to join in raising the debt limit before the Treasury Department runs out of money about the middle of October.

His comments were read by members of both parties as renewing his determination on the default and came as the Treasury warned that an impasse over raising the debt limit might prove catastrophic and potentially result “in a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse.”

Lawmakers said that in recent days, Mr. Boehner, who is under fierce attack from Democrats over his handling of the shutdown, has made clear that he is willing to use a combination of Republican and Democratic votes on the debt limit if need be. Representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey, one of the moderate Republicans who met privately with Mr. Boehner on Wednesday, would not provide details of the meeting, but said, “The speaker of the House does not want to default on the debt on the United States, and I believe he believes in Congress as an institution, and I certainly believe he is working for the best interests of the American people.”

One lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Boehner suggested he would be willing to violate the so-called Hastert Rule to pass a debt-limit increase. The informal rule refers to a policy of not bringing to the floor any measure that does not have a majority of Republican votes."

Peters']",Obama Tells Republicans to ‘Reopen the Government’,"On Tuesday, uninsured Americans, about 15 percent of the population, could begin enrolling in the state-based insurance marketplaces, known as exchanges, created by the 2010 law.

It was unclear how long the shutdown might go on, and no one in either party could say if Republicans would remain firm in their insistence that Democrats agree to significant changes to the health care law. But on the initial day of the first shutdown in nearly 18 years — when a Republican-controlled Congress battled another Democratic president, Bill Clinton — there was little business getting done in the House or the Senate other than photo opportunities and partisan speeches.

One senior Republican, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman, indicated that the stalemate could go on for at least two more weeks until the nation reaches its borrowing limit. He said the deadline to address the debt limit, and avoid a default, could be “the forcing mechanism to bring the two parties together.”

Yet House Republicans also vow to oppose an increase in the debt ceiling unless Mr. Obama delays the health care law.

On Tuesday night, Speaker John A. Boehner and House Republicans tried to ease the effects of the shutdown and force Democrats into negotiation. The Republicans proposed three bills — to finance veterans’ programs, the National Park Service and federally run services in Washington — but because they introduced the measures under a fast-track procedural rule that required a two-thirds vote, each of them failed."

http://news.yahoo.com/america-congress-suck-103016895.html,,[],America to Congress: You Suck!,"A bit of news for members of Congress on their way home for the weekend: America hates you.

Nearly eight in 10 Americans told Gallup pollsters this month they disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job, the 45th consecutive month that more than two-thirds of Americans graded Congress poorly.

The problem isn't as much what Congress is doing as what it is not getting done. Fifty-nine percent of the disapproving Americans cited partisan gridlock and ineffectiveness for their thumbs-down.

Fewer than 30 percent cited performance on specific issues or ethics.

It gets worse.

Gallup's 40-year study of the public's faith in U.S. institutions found that the percentage of people expressing confidence in Congress has dropped to 10 percent. For the fourth straight year, the first branch of government ranks last on a list of 16 institutions.

Congress's ranking is the worst Gallup has ever found for any institution it has measured since 1973.

Churches, businesses, the media, labor unions, and schools—people are losing faith in virtually every social institution that made America great, a dangerous decades-old decline explored by National Journal a year ago (""In Nothing We Trust"").

Gallup puts Congress at the bottom of a decrepit barrel.

""The divided Congress, with Democrats controlling the Senate and Republicans the House, is likely part of the reason for the low levels of confidence rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans express, and is tied to Americans' frustrations with Congress's inability to get much done,"" the Gallup study concluded.

Gridlock has many causes. First, House districts are drawn by politicians to protect incumbents, creating a situation where only hyper-conservative Republicans and staunchly liberal Democrats survive most party primaries. The rise of the tea party has particularly radicalized the GOP.

The Internet has polarized and democratized new media, enabling voters to limit their information sources to those that cement their partisan views. Polarized voters push Congress to extremes, making Americans both opponents of, and a cause of, gridlock.

Story continues

Finally, the Democratic White House and GOP-controlled House lack leaders able and willing to craft compromises. President Obama, House Speaker John Boehner, and their partisan choruses rarely even discuss ways to find common ground, much less find any.

In this era of partisanship, it is safer to demonize than to compromise.

Obama's job-approval rating is hovering near 50 percent, a sign that voters tend to blame Republicans a bit more than Democrats for gridlock. It is too soon to conclude whether the recent spate of controversies involving the White House will affect the public's view of Obama. His relatively high numbers may also may be a reflection of the esteem Americans hold for the office of the presidency.

Not so for Congress."

In a deep red state, Sam Brownback - who has used Kansas as an experiment in hopes of a presidential run, finds himself in a dogfight with Democratic Candidate Paul Davis.

Paul Davis, Democratic Senate Minority Leader in our state has made a hardened effort to hit the road, appear in multiple counties.



Sam Brownback's administration is at it's lowest popularity rating.. well, period. What makes this result interesting is that a similar poll was released earlier in the week with an error:

http://cjonline.com/...

Republicans pointed out the poll wasn't valid because the question was asked with the wrong name attached. The Wichita Eagle tossed the results and had the survey run again, different numbers, different respondents to see what the results would be.



""Sam Brownback can't hide from the truth: his policies are hurting Kansas families and they know it,"" Joan Wagnon, the chairwoman of the Kansas Democratic Party, said in a news release. When asked their opinion of Brownback, 22 percent called it ""favorable"" and 47 percent said ""unfavorable."" The remainder were unsure or neutral. Clay Barker, chairman of the Kansas Republican Party, expressed skepticism about the polling data. ""They didn't get the name of the Democratic candidate for governor right,"" Barker said via email. ""If they can't get someone's name right, what's your confidence in their ability to accurately do higher math?""

How did it turn out? With more respondents and a the question corrected... Brownback fell farther in the second attempt, making it a 4 point gap instead of a 2 point gap between the candidates.

Whoops.

At this point with a survey sample in two polls taken over one week there is no denying that Brownback faces a real challenge in 2014.

Kansas deserves better leadership. Paul Davis offers a real chance for some change in this state. Kansas is not 'out of reach' or unwinnable, and poll after poll should put Kansas as a state worth the fight.

If you're in this state and you've written it off in the past this is your chance to get active. If you're a democrat in a safe state that wants to make a serious difference in the direction of our country, this is a chance to put an end to policies like: Forced Ultrasounds; the ability of biological fathers to sue for emotional damages after abortions; resuming prosecutions of spousal abusers and domestic abuse cases; an education system that isn't hell bent on overturning scientific theory.

If you've got it to spare, and you want a candidate who has the ability to shock a nation, Paul Davis is worthy of a drop or two.

Among likely Democratic voters, de Blasio took 30 percent of the vote, followed by City Council Speaker Christine Quinn at 24 percent, former comptroller Bill Thompson at 22 percent, former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) at 10 percent, comptroller John Liu at 6 percent and former council member Sal Albanese at 1 percent. Another 7 percent was undecided.

De Blasio also held the lead in three potential runoff scenarios, beating Quinn by 54 percent to 38 percent, Thompson by 50 percent to 40 percent, and Weiner by a whopping 72 percent to 22 percent.

But voters' choices are hardly set in stone: 34 percent, including 37 percent who backed de Blasio, said there was a good chance they'd change their minds.

While there was little evidence of a gender gap among voters, there was a ""measurable racial divide,"" according to the poll. Thompson led among black voters, with 39 percent, followed by de Blasio and Quinn. Among white voters, de Blasio led with 39 percent, followed by Quinn and then Thompson.

De Blasio's 30 percent is the greatest share of the vote any candidate has attracted so far in polling on the race. In the weeks since Weiner's numbers dropped after new revelations of his inappropriate behavior, most surveys have shown Quinn leading the field, although generally with support in the mid-20s, far below the 40 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff.

But as shown by HuffPost Pollster's chart, which includes all publicly available polling, de Blasio and Thompson's numbers have also risen.

De Blasio's campaign, until recently mired in the middle of the pack, has been buoyed by improving numbers and a front-page New York Times story.

""I always had faith…when people start to focus, a real progressive impulse was going to come out in the New York City electorate,” de Blasio told Politicker in July, after an earlier poll found him gaining.

De Blasio attracted 40 percent of the city's ""very liberal"" voters in Tuesday's poll. He has sought to present himself as the campaign's most progressive candidate, as HuffPost's Michael McLaughlin reported Sunday:

For months, de Blasio stumped with bread-and-butter proposals to aid the poor and working class. He appealed to the middle class with a liberal agenda promoting green technology, equality for women in the workplace, and job growth in the tech and entertainment industries. Now, it seemed, his message was breaking through....His campaign rests on the idea that New York is ""a tale of two cities,"" divided between the haves and have-nots. Almost half of the city's population lived in or near poverty in 2011 -- a statistic that de Blasio frequently mentions. The villain in his story is none other than billionaire New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The pre-K tax is perhaps the centerpiece of his platform to alleviate economic and racial disparities. But de Blasio, the city's public advocate since 2009, also wants to build affordable housing, rescue hospitals on the verge of closing and reform the police department's controversial stop-and-frisk program.

A judge ruled Monday that the NYPD's use of the stop-and-frisk tactic violated the rights of thousands of New Yorkers.

Sixty percent of likely Democratic voters view the stop-and-frisk program as excessive, while 31 percent find it acceptable, according to Tuesday's poll.

The Quinnipiac poll surveyed 579 likely primary voters by phone between Aug. 7 and 12.

(CNN) - Newark Mayor Cory Booker will move on to New Jersey's special Senate election as the Democratic nominee after winning his party's primary on Tuesday.

He'll battle the GOP winner, former Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, for the October 16 contest, though polls show Booker is already considered the favorite to win the seat and become the first African American elected to the Senate since Barack Obama.



(Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina is currently the only African American in the Senate, but he was appointed–not elected–to his seat.)

""Thank you. It is such an honor to be your nominee, to be your Democratic nominee for the United States Senate,"" Booker, who won 59% of the vote, told supporters at his victory party late Tuesday night in Newark.

Speaking with a slightly hoarse voice, Booker pledged to be ""unwavering"" in finding common ground in Washington if he becomes the state's next senator.

""The direction I will be most concerned with will not be right or left, it will be with going forward.""

Heading into the special election, Booker has a massive fundraising advantage over his Republican opponent and a double-digit lead ahead of Lonegan, according to recent polls.

A rising star in his party, Booker handily beat out a crowded field of Democratic candidates for the nomination Tuesday–a group that included Rep. Frank Pallone, Rep. Rush Holt and General Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver.

Cory Booker joins Democratic rivals in Senate primary debate

In the Republican primary, Lonegan toppled physician Alieta Eck. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Monday at a press conference he fully anticipates endorsing the Republican nominee, no matter who wins Tuesday's contest.

While Lonegan now moves on as the GOP's pick for the seat, he trails Booker 29%-54% in a hypothetical matchup among registered voters, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released last week.

Lonegan won 79% of the vote in Tuesday's primary.

With more than 1.4 million followers on Twitter and Oprah Winfrey as one of his biggest supporters, Booker's appeal and frequent television appearances have reached beyond the borders of the Garden State.

In addition to voting, Booker on Tuesday greeted voters and retweeted shout-outs from celebrities on Twitter, including comedian Sarah Silverman, California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, writer and actress Lena Dunham, and Ivanka Trump, daughter of real estate titan Donald Trump.

Actress Eva Longoria appeared at an event for Booker on the eve of primary day, encouraging voters to turn out for the two-term mayor.

Oprah to host fundraiser for Booker

Elected in 2006, after losing his first mayoral attempt in 2002, the Stanford grad and former football player previously served on Newark city council. Booker's resume also includes a law degree from Yale and a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford.

His critics have accused the mayor of being more interested in his celebrity status than waging a serious campaign. But Booker's high profile has helped in part with his massive fundraising haul. As of July 24, the candidate has raised $8.6 million and has $4 million in the bank, according to Federal Election Commission reports.

Newark mayor says he's not a hero after daring rescue of his neighbor

Rivals also bring up Booker's involvement in his internet start-up, Waywire. As the chairman with the largest share, Booker began promoting the struggling company last year. Critics argue the business was a distraction to his job as mayor, and they faulted him for initially opening up offices in New York City, rather than in his own town of Newark. Those offices closed down this year, according to The New York Times.

He has said publicly that if elected to the Senate, he would step down from the board of Waywire and put his shares in a blind trust. He would prohibit Waywire from lobbying his office and prohibit his staff from doing any work on the company's behalf.

""Everybody knows that Mayor Booker is excited about technology and what it can do to empower real people,"" campaign spokesman Kevin Griffis said in a statement. ""He invested in an idea and helped get a business off the ground, and a lot of people found that idea compelling.""

Watch: Mayor Cory Booker 'fires up' DNC

Christie called the special election after Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg passed away in early June. While a Republican interim senator–appointed by Christie–currently holds the seat, it has been expected a Democrat would win the special election in the largely blue state.

At the top of his victory speech Tuesday night, Booker first acknowledged Lautenberg's legacy. ""He has made us safer and healthier. We are a better state and we are a better America because of Senator Frank Lautenberg.""

Lautenberg's family backs Pallone, says he's not a 'showhorse'

The winner of the October 16 race will finish out Lautenberg's term through 2014, and the winner can run for a full term next year.

The nonpartisan political handicappers Stuart Rothenberg and Charlie Cook both rate next year's Senate race in New Jersey as solid or safe for Democrats.

Christie was criticized earlier this summer when he set the oddly-timed date for the special election. Rather than scheduling the special election to fall in line with the already-set gubernatorial election in November, Christie set the special for October.

Critics pointed to the extra costs to taxpayers for a separate election, but the governor stood by his decision, saying New Jersey voters deserved to have an elected official in the Senate as soon as possible.

""I recognized that by virtue of the realities of my circumstances, there were some drawbacks to my candidacy for a lot of Republican voters,"" he told Balz in January. ""One, because I had a health care plan in Massachusetts that had been copied in some respects by the president, that I would be tainted by that feature. I also realized that being a person of wealth, I would be pilloried by the president as someone who, if you use the term of the day, was in the 1 percent.""

The book, titled ""Collision 2012: Obama vs. Romney and the Future of Elections in America,"" is due out Aug. 6. It details the 2012 White House race through Election Day and its aftermath.

Romney's exchange with his son wasn't the first time he expressed doubts about whether he would run. During a Christmas holiday trip to Hawaii in 2010, the Romney family held a vote. Should Romney, who lost in the 2008 primary, run for president once again? Ten of 12 family members voted no -- including the candidate. Only Tagg and Ann Romney voted yes.

Romney opened up to Balz about his conservative stance on immigration during the campaign, and his use of the term ""self-deportation,"" which Democrats slammed repeatedly. Romney said he did not anticipate the blowback he would face.

""I thought of it as being a term that is used in the community of those discussing immigration,"" Romney told Balz in January. ""I hadn't seen it as being a negative term."" He later added: ""You have two options of dealing with those that have come here illegally: deportation or self-deportation. The president has deported more I think in four years than President Bush did in eight years. So the president was using a deportation method. The view of others is, no, let people make their own choice. ... So I was looking for a more, if you will, compassionate approach, which is let people make their own choice, as opposed to deporting people.""

Romney also reflected on his ""47 percent"" comment, which he said he didn't initially think would become a major focus. He said the perception that his remarks suggested he didn't care about many Americans was incorrect.

""But I realized, look, perception is reality,"" Romney said. ""The perception is I'm saying I don't care about 47 percent of the people or something of that nature, and that's simply wrong.""

His campaign's biggest mistake in the primary, Romney told Balz, was not giving more attention to the Feb. 7 contests in Missouri, Minnesota and Colorado. He also worried during the campaign about the surge of Newt Gingrich, even as his advisers tried to assure him Gingrich would not win.

""I have to tell you that, in the discussions I had with my senior staff, people like Stuart Stevens and Russ Schriefer said, 'Look, Newt is not going to be the nominee. I don't care what the polls say, he's not going to be the nominee.' I was far less sanguine about that,"" Romney said."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/06/Mississippi-bloodbath-Cochran-seeks-reelection-against-Tea-Party,2013-12-06 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],76-Year-Old Thad Cochran Seeks Reelection vs. Tea Party's Chris McDaniel,"Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS) announced Friday he would seek reelection to a seventh term in the U.S. Senate.

“I’m comfortable with my decision,” Cochran, who turns 76 years old this weekend, told Gannett on Friday. “I’m looking forward to it. People have been very generous and expressed appreciation. Some have even started sending contributions and helping in that way.”

Tea Party-backed State Sen. Chris McDaniel has already launched a bid for the GOP nomination for Cochran’s seat. In response to Cochran’s announcement, one that surprised most in GOP politics who expected him to retire, McDaniel said he is undeterred. “Sen. Cochran has had a long and distinguished career representing the people of Mississippi,” McDaniel said. “I look forward to a positive campaign based on the future of our state, our country, and the Republican Party. As a strong conservative, I will fight to bring those values to Washington.”

McDaniel has the support of an amalgam of state lawmakers in Mississippi, as several of his state senate colleagues have joined his campaign. He also has the support of conservative organizations throughout the state, plus national conservative support from groups like the Tea Party Express, Club for Growth, Madison Project, FreedomWorks, the Senate Conservatives Fund, and others.

In response to Cochran’s announcement he would be seeking reelection, Club for Growth president Chris Chocola said voters in Mississippi have a “real choice” between someone who is conservative and someone who is not.

“Throughout his over forty years in Washington, Senator Thad Cochran has done some good things for Mississippi, but he’s also done some bad things,” Chocola said.

He voted to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, voted repeatedly to raise the debt limit by trillions of dollars, and even voted against a resolution that stated Congress has a “moral obligation” to cut spending. Senator Cochran has also voted to confirm liberal Supreme Court Justices and is a strong supporter of wasteful earmarks–something that is opposed by Republican leaders in both the Senate and the House. Mississippi voters will make the final judgment as to whether it is time for a change.

Cochran is backed by the establishment in Mississippi, most notably the political machine that former governor and one-time Republican National Committee chairman Haley Barbour built.

As rumors he was mulling a bid for Cochran’s seat began swelling in Mississippi, Barbour’s machine sought to quash any Tea Party insurgency in the state. Before McDaniel announced, back in September, Barbour’s nephew GOP lobbyist Henry Barbour told Roll Call that the GOP establishment would destroy McDaniel if he ran.

“I think he will get his head handed to him, and that will be what he deserves,” Henry Barbour said then. “[But] it’s a free country.”

Even so, when asked in a recent interview with Breitbart News what it’s like to run against Barbour’s machine, McDaniel said it’s “nothing personal.”

“I’ve worked with Haley when he was governor,” McDaniel told Breitbart News. “He and I worked on many instances together during his time as governor. But we do represent different visions for the Republican Party.”

“My vision is one to restore the party to the greatness it once had, particularly with regards to its fiscal restraint and its adherence to constitutional principles. The party I believe in is the party I joined years ago when Reagan was president and I hope that party gets restored,” McDaniel said. “But what’s it like to run against Haley? You know, it’s politics. I appreciate his positions. I appreciate his opinions. We just disagree.”

“It’s not personal,” McDaniel added. “I’m just going to stand my ground to fight for what I believe and I’m confident he’ll stand his ground as well to fight for what he believes.”

Of all the establishment GOP incumbent U.S. Senators in danger to primary challenges, from Sen. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina to Lamar Alexander in Tennessee to even potentially Mitch McConnell in Kentucky, Cochran, at this point, is the most likely to lose.

That is the question that residents in Weld County will face in November after county commissioners voted unanimously Monday in favor of putting a 51st state initiative on the ballot, the Greeley Tribune reports.

The initiative, which calls for the creation of the state of North Colorado, has already made it onto the ballot in Cheyenne, Sedgwick and Yuma Counties. Logan, Phillips, Washington and Kit Carson Counties have also set dates to vote on the initiative.

Several rural, predominantly Republican counties of north and and northeastern Colorado announced their plan to create a 51st state back in June. Supporters have cited a number of laws -- including gun control measures, an increase in renewable energy standards in rural areas, the curbing of perceived cruel treatment of livestock and expanded regulation of oil and gas production -- that the Democratically-controlled state legislature passed this year, as the impetus for the secession movement.

""Rural residents are now a disenfranchised minority of Colorado,"" Phillips County Administrator Randy Schafer told The Denver Post last month. ""National and urban values and needs are trumping rural values and needs.""

On the ballot, the initiative will read: ""Shall the Board of County Commissioners of Weld County, in concert with the county commissioners of other Colorado counties, pursue becoming the 51st state of the United States of America?""

The vote, however, has been regarded as largely symbolic, since the new state would have to be approved by the state legislature, the governor and Congress.

“We had to do something that would grab Denver’s attention,” said Weld County Commissioner Sean Conway."

In the early minutes of a marathon meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday morning, Rep. Steve Southerland, a funeral director from Florida, rose to suggest the lawmakers sing “Amazing Grace” — and his colleagues joined him in a rendition of the burial hymn.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,

David Goldman/Associated Press Wait 1 second to continue.

A life of joy and peace.

It was an appropriate choice, for the House GOP is practicing its own form of mortuary science: It is burying both the Republican brand and America’s standing in the world.

On Monday night, Washington was finally moving toward an agreement — albeit a temporary solution — to end the government shutdown and avoid a default on the national debt. The agreement in principle, negotiated by Senate Democratic and Republican leaders, probably would have sailed through the House. But then House Speaker John Boehner preempted the bipartisan agreement with a new plan of his own that had no Democratic support. It was difficult to see any reason for the proposal other than blocking progress on an agreement — and it succeeded at that. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called off a meeting in which he was to have unveiled the agreement, and Democrats lined up to denounce the new tactic, which emerged just two days before the Treasury runs out of room to maneuver on the nation’s bills.

Yet even that nasty piece of work didn’t have enough support from Boehner’s GOP caucus, because tea party Republicans were still holding out for an assault on Obama­care. After a two-hour caucus meeting — twice the usual length — Boehner emerged admitting there were “a lot of opinions” but “no decisions.”

Surely, he can’t be surprised. If a sizable minority within his caucus is here in Washington with the main purpose of disabling federal power, why would this faction be eager to end a government shutdown or avoid a default? Some of them are “default deniers” who think the whole threat to the full faith and credit of the United States is a hoax. Perhaps some others are of the mind that if they shock the economy back into recession, President Obama’s party will be blamed in next year’s elections for high unemployment.

Whatever their reasons, lawmakers took turns at the open microphones for two hours in the closed-door session — and they weren’t singing karaoke for Boehner. When they emerged to find 150 reporters lining the hallways of the Capitol basement, they clearly had no message worth delivering.

Rep. Mo Brooks (Ala.): “I have no comment.”

Rep. Trent Franks (Ariz.): “I never speak of things we talk about in conference. That’s rude.”

One claimed he was going to the men’s room. Others clutched phones to their ears. Rep. Patrick McHenry (N.C.) tried to create a diversion. “Hey, that was Tom Cotton,” he told reporters. “He’s running for Senate. He’s twice my height and three times as good-looking.”

GOP leaders apparently had nothing to say for themselves either, because they settled on a theme of saying their last-minute monkey wrench was meant “to provide fairness to the American people under Obamacare,” as Boehner put it.

“There should be fairness,” Majority Leader Eric Cantor agreed.

“Individuals should be treated fairly,” concurred Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy.

Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), the conference chairwoman, contributed her belief in “fairness for all.”

Fair for all? More like a free-for-all.

NBC’s Kelly O’Donnell asked Boehner whether he could guarantee that there would be no default.

“The idea of default is wrong, and we shouldn’t get anywhere close to it,” the speaker replied.

But Boehner had just put the country close to default by preempting the Senate compromise. With the country up against the debt ceiling, he had renewed the fight over Obamacare and inflamed Democrats by proposing to limit a president’s flexibility to avoid defaults in the future. (Boehner later revised the proposal to recruit conservative support, but late in the day that, too, fell apart.)

Twenty minutes after Boehner’s appearance, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid interrupted proceedings on the Senate floor to say that he spoke “for many of us who have been working in good faith when I say that we felt blindsided by the news from the House.” He pronounced himself “very disappointed with John Boehner, who would once again try to preserve his role at the expense of the country.”

Boehner and his colleagues can sing “Amazing Grace” in the Capitol basement, but if they get the blame for a shutdown and a default, the only way they’ll be able to preserve their majority is with embalming fluid.

Thad Cochran (R-MS) announced Friday he would seek reelection to a seventh term in the U.S. Senate.

“I’m comfortable with my decision,” Cochran, who turns 76 years old this weekend, told Gannett on Friday. “I’m looking forward to it. People have been very generous and expressed appreciation. Some have even started sending contributions and helping in that way.”

Tea Party-backed State Sen. Chris McDaniel has already launched a bid for the GOP nomination for Cochran’s seat. In response to Cochran’s announcement, one that surprised most in GOP politics who expected him to retire, McDaniel said he is undeterred. “Sen. Cochran has had a long and distinguished career representing the people of Mississippi,” McDaniel said. “I look forward to a positive campaign based on the future of our state, our country, and the Republican Party. As a strong conservative, I will fight to bring those values to Washington.”

McDaniel has the support of an amalgam of state lawmakers in Mississippi, as several of his state senate colleagues have joined his campaign. He also has the support of conservative organizations throughout the state, plus national conservative support from groups like the Tea Party Express, Club for Growth, Madison Project, FreedomWorks, the Senate Conservatives Fund, and others.

In response to Cochran’s announcement he would be seeking reelection, Club for Growth president Chris Chocola said voters in Mississippi have a “real choice” between someone who is conservative and someone who is not.

“Throughout his over forty years in Washington, Senator Thad Cochran has done some good things for Mississippi, but he’s also done some bad things,” Chocola said.

He voted to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, voted repeatedly to raise the debt limit by trillions of dollars, and even voted against a resolution that stated Congress has a “moral obligation” to cut spending. Senator Cochran has also voted to confirm liberal Supreme Court Justices and is a strong supporter of wasteful earmarks–something that is opposed by Republican leaders in both the Senate and the House. Mississippi voters will make the final judgment as to whether it is time for a change.

Cochran is backed by the establishment in Mississippi, most notably the political machine that former governor and one-time Republican National Committee chairman Haley Barbour built.

As rumors he was mulling a bid for Cochran’s seat began swelling in Mississippi, Barbour’s machine sought to quash any Tea Party insurgency in the state. Before McDaniel announced, back in September, Barbour’s nephew GOP lobbyist Henry Barbour told Roll Call that the GOP establishment would destroy McDaniel if he ran.

“I think he will get his head handed to him, and that will be what he deserves,” Henry Barbour said then. “[But] it’s a free country.”

Even so, when asked in a recent interview with Breitbart News what it’s like to run against Barbour’s machine, McDaniel said it’s “nothing personal.”

“I’ve worked with Haley when he was governor,” McDaniel told Breitbart News. “He and I worked on many instances together during his time as governor. But we do represent different visions for the Republican Party.”

“My vision is one to restore the party to the greatness it once had, particularly with regards to its fiscal restraint and its adherence to constitutional principles. The party I believe in is the party I joined years ago when Reagan was president and I hope that party gets restored,” McDaniel said. “But what’s it like to run against Haley? You know, it’s politics. I appreciate his positions. I appreciate his opinions. We just disagree.”

“It’s not personal,” McDaniel added. “I’m just going to stand my ground to fight for what I believe and I’m confident he’ll stand his ground as well to fight for what he believes.”

Of all the establishment GOP incumbent U.S. Senators in danger to primary challenges, from Sen. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina to Lamar Alexander in Tennessee to even potentially Mitch McConnell in Kentucky, Cochran, at this point, is the most likely to lose. Recently released polling data from Public Policy Polling showed McDaniel just six points back on Cochran after only a month since his announcement. That poll showed Cochran at 44 percent, compared to McDaniel at 38 percent."
http://news.yahoo.com/kerry-field-questions-panel-chairs-080534135.html,,[],Kerry to field questions from panel he chairs,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. John Kerry, on a smooth path to confirmation as secretary of state, is likely to face friendly questioning when he testifies before the committee that he's served on for 28 years and led for the past four.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman will sit at the witness table Thursday when he appears before the panel, a month after President Barack Obama said he wanted him to succeed Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Clinton is stepping down.

The five-term Massachusetts senator is widely expected to win overwhelming bipartisan support from his colleagues, and that notion was reinforced by the list of people who will introduce him: Clinton, Massachusetts freshman Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Republican Sen. John McCain.

McCain and Kerry are friends who have worked closely on national security issues. They're also decorated Vietnam War veterans and former presidential candidates who know the sharp sting of defeat.

At the conclusion of a Capitol Hill news conference Tuesday, McCain joked about Kerry's hearing and the tough tactics that won't be employed.

""We will look forward to interrogating him at his hearing — mercilessly,"" McCain said to laughter. ""We will bring back, for the only time, waterboarding to get the truth.""

The hearing is the first of three for Obama's national security nominees and the least controversial.

Former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel, nominated for defense secretary, will face tough questions about his past statements on Israel, Iran, nuclear weapons and defense spending at his confirmation hearing next Thursday before the Senate Armed Services Committee. John Brennan, the president's choice for CIA director, will be quizzed about White House national security leaks and the use of unmanned drones at his hearing next month.

The job of the nation's top diplomat would be the realization of a dream for Kerry, whom Obama passed over in 2008 when he chose Clinton. When Joe Biden became vice president, Kerry replaced the former Delaware senator as chairman of the committee. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., the incoming chairman, will preside at Kerry's hearing.

Story continues

Obama nominated Kerry after Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, removed her name from consideration following criticism from Republicans over her initial comments about the attacks on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya.

Kerry, 69, is the son of a diplomat and has served as Obama's unofficial envoy, using his skills of persuasion with leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Although a rough hearing is unlikely, Kerry will be pressed about the civil war in Syria and other hot spots, foreign aid and the Keystone XL oil pipeline, about which he'll have a major say.

More than half the Senate has urged quick approval of the pipeline, increasing the pressure on Obama to move forward on the project despite concerns from environmentalists.

""We urge you to choose jobs, economic development and American energy security,"" wrote 53 senators, who added that the pipeline ""has gone through the most exhaustive environmental scrutiny of any pipeline"" in U.S. history.

The $7 billion project would carry tar sands oil from Canada to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast.

The Obama administration has twice thwarted the 1,700-mile pipeline, which Calgary-based TransCanada first proposed in late 2008. The State Department delayed the project in late 2011 after environmental groups and others raised concerns about a proposed route through environmentally sensitive land in Nebraska.

The State Department said this week it does not expect to complete a review of the project before the end of March. The State Department has jurisdiction over the pipeline because it crosses a U.S. border.

In the past, Kerry has played a major role on climate change legislation and has warned of the environmental dangers.

In advance of his hearing, Kerry said he plans to divest holdings in dozens of companies in his family's vast financial portfolio to avoid conflicts of interest if he is confirmed.

He notified the State Department earlier this month that within 90 days of his confirmation he would move to sell off holdings in three trusts benefiting him and his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry. In the Jan. 8 letter to the department's Office of the Legal Adviser, Kerry said he would not take part in any decisions that could affect the companies he has holdings in until those investments are sold off.

Kerry is the wealthiest man in the Senate, worth more than $184 million, according to a 2011 Senate disclosure.

Pat Quinn has named former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas as his Democratic running mate for next year's election.



Vallas, an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor in 2002 against Rod Blagojevich, fills the vacancy on the ticket left by incumbent Lt. Gov. Sheila Simon's decision to run for state comptroller next year.



A new state law requires candidates for governor and lieutenant governor to run as a team before nominating petitions can be filed. Petition filing begins later this month.



""I've known Paul Vallas for 30 years and he's never been shy about fighting for education, reform and opportunities for working people,"" Quinn said in a statement. ""We have made great progress these last few years, but serious challenges remain and our mission is not yet accomplished.""



Quinn called Vallas ""an independent problem solver with a proven record of reform.""



Vallas said he was ""honored to join forces with the strongest reform governor in the country.""



After leaving CPS, Vallas headed public schools in Philadelphia, New Orleans and, most recently, Bridgeport, Conn. A Connecticut judge has ruled that Vallas did not hold the proper qualifications to be superintendent of the state's largest school system."

Of the state’s three House seats, a Democrat has a fighting chance only in the district encompassing Omaha and its suburbs. And the party’s sole hope there, Omaha’s popular City Council president, had declared that he was not going to run.

But suddenly, the Council president, Pete Festersen, has jumped into the 2014 race against an eight-term incumbent Republican. And a Lincoln lawyer, Dennis Crawford, declared his candidacy in a second Nebraska district where the Republican incumbent also had been unopposed. Both say their moves are fueled by popular anger over the 16-day Republican-led shutdown of the federal government.

“If I ever see Ted Cruz, all I’m going to say is ‘Thank you, thank you,’ ” Vince Powers, Nebraska’s Democratic Party chairman, said in an interview. “I would’ve been in witness protection, because I didn’t have anybody to run.”

Here and nationally, the Democratic Party is enjoying something of a boomlet in newly declared candidacies for the House. Since Oct. 1, five candidates have lined up to contest Republican-held seats, with at least four more in the wings, Democratic officials say. Almost all say they are driven to run — ostensibly, at least — by disgust over the shutdown, first espoused by Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, and embraced by Tea Party Republicans in the House and, eventually, most others as well."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/03/07/Former-Bush-Adviser-Continues-Elitist-Crusade-Against-Palin-Conservatives,2013-03-07 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],"Former Bush Adviser Continues Crusade Against Palin, Conservatives","Former George W. Bush chief political strategist Matt Dowd continued to try to diminish Sarah Palin and conservatives by once again making false claims about the former Alaska governor.

On Sunday’s “ABC’s This Week,” Dowd assailed CPAC for, in his mind, lessening its credibility by inviting conservatives like Palin and not liberal Republicans favored by the northeastern elite like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

“CPAC, to me, has totally diminished its credibility as an organization,” Dowd said. “And you invite Sarah Palin, who wasn’t competent enough to keep a Fox News contract? But she’s invited to the CPAC meeting?”

Dowd falsely claimed that Palin was not competent enough to be on Fox, whereas Palin turned down Fox’s offer to renew her contract. His remark was not only a dig at Palin but also a shot at Fox, implying the news network that has dominated the cable news ratings employs people with subpar levels of intelligence who do not meet the lofty standards of the Aspen Institute or Harvard’s Institute of Politics. His comments also imply that he feels the conservatives who came out in droves to elect Bush twice–which is the only reason he has his media perch and anyone has even heard of him–are dumb as well.

Other writers purporting to represent the right, like Jennifer Rubin, the Washington Post‘s token conservative, also have chimed in, writing any gathering that includes Palin while not inviting GOProud and Christie “isn’t worth attending.”

Conservative writer Jeffrey Lord assailed these elitist Republicans who feel entitled to make CPAC “a big tent” instead of the “conservative tent” that it is supposed to be.

Since Bush left office, his top advisers have begun to show their true–and not-so-conservative–colors. Mark McKinnon, the scarf-wearing, No Labels-founding former Bush media maven, has actively courted the approval of the media elite and made himself a featured attraction at elitist seminars. Karl Rove has slammed conservative candidates and now has created as super PAC that will arm itself to wage war against Tea Party candidates in GOP primaries.

As BizPacReview notes, in 2010, Palin, in response to talk radio host Laura Ingraham’s claim that the Bush family was trying to “kneecap” a potential Palin presidential campaign, referred to the Bush family as “blue bloods” who make up the Republican establishment.

As the publication notes, many pundits attribute the lack of enthusiasm on the right over Mitt Romney’s candidacy to Romney’s and the Republican establishment’s snub of Palin and the Tea Party that won the GOP its House majority in 2010. The Republican establishment advisers were fearful of what their mainstream media bettors would think of them if they embraced the vice presidential candidate who has galvanized the Tea Party and the conservative base more than any other figure on the right over the last four years.

Having not learned their lesson, establishment Republicans, BizPacReview notes, “continue to attack Palin for no apparent reason.”

But there is a deeper reason why establishment Republicans disdain Palin the reformer.

When Palin made her first appearance at CPAC last year, she blistered Washington’s crony capitalism and permanent political class, which Stephen K. Bannon and the non-partisan Government Accountability Institute’s Peter Schweizer would later document in “Boomtown.”

At CPAC 2012, journalists and observers noted that no speaker galvanized the conservative base–with conservative words and ideas–like Palin.

And that is why establishment Republicans like Dowd, who helped enable D.C.’s “Boomtown,” would rather anoint moderates like Christie and Romney as leaders on the right instead of conservatives like Palin, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), or Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)–both of whom Palin endorsed in their respective primaries–who are unafraid to challenge Republicans as well as Democrats."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/us/politics/upstart-groups-challenge-rove-for-gop-cash.html,2013-12-24 00:00:00,['Nicholas Confessore'],Upstart Groups Challenge Rove for G.O.P. Cash,"The fragmentation threatens not only the position of Mr. Rove and Crossroads as the dominant Republican players in the world of outside spending, but also the hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of business that has flowed from Crossroads to a small circle of consultants and advertising buyers. In 2012, those consultants — many of them sharing the same floor of an office building in Alexandria, Va. — handled much of the media spending by the two Crossroads groups and Restore Our Future, a super PAC that spent $153 million to bolster Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign.

Mr. Law said Crossroads’ scale and its financial controls help maximize the amount of money that flows to actual advocacy. Because of the volume of advertising the Crossroads groups buy, they have been able to negotiate media buyers’ commissions down to 3 percent or less, far below the traditional rate.

Until recently, Crossroads’ deep ties to the Republican establishment were a source of authority and legitimacy, not controversy. Mr. Rove’s stature provided entree to prominent Republican donors around the country; Mr. Law and other officials there had long résumés with the party’s campaign committees, offering a kind of semiofficial imprimatur with donors and candidates.

But this year, Crossroads announced that it was financing a new effort, the Conservative Victory Project, to intervene in next year’s Republican primaries. Some conservative leaders accused Mr. Rove of trying to squelch anti-establishment candidates.

Now Crossroads appears to be testing a new approach. The group has so far stayed out of Kentucky, for example, where Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, is facing both a Tea Party challenger in the primary and a strong Democratic opponent. Instead, Mr. McConnell is backed by a new group called Kentuckians for Strong Leadership. Although it is legally separate from Crossroads, most of its cash came from Crossroads donors, Mr. Law sits on its board, and the two organizations share a treasurer.

Crossroads has lobbied to help set up similar groups in races where its brand may be less appealing to voters or donors, according to two Republicans with knowledge of the conversations. But Mr. Rove has grown so controversial among some conservatives, the Republicans said, that candidates worry that donors will not contribute to a super PAC if it is connected to Crossroads.

In West Virginia, Mr. Law warned supporters of Representative Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican who is a top prospect to win a Senate seat next year, that if they formed their own super PAC, Ms. Capito would not be able to count on significant support from Crossroads, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions."

In August of that year, Clinton testified before a grand jury and admitted to having ""inappropriate intimate contact"" with Lewinsky, but he said it did not constitute sexual relations because they had not had intercourse. He was impeached in December on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.

The Clintons dance on a beach in the U.S. Virgin Islands in January 1998. Later that month, Bill Clinton was accused of having a sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

The first lady holds up a Grammy Award, which she won for her audiobook ""It Takes a Village"" in 1997.

The Clintons hug as Bill is sworn in for a second term as President.

Clinton waves to the media in January 1996 as she arrives for an appearance before a grand jury in Washington. The first lady was subpoenaed to testify as a witness in the investigation of the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas. The Clintons' business investment was investigated, but ultimately they were cleared of any wrongdoing.

During the 1992 presidential campaign, Clinton jokes with her husband's running mate, Al Gore, and Gore's wife, Tipper, aboard a campaign bus.

In June 1992, Clinton uses a sewing machine designed to eliminate back and wrist strain. She had just given a speech at a convention of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union.

Bill Clinton comforts his wife on the set of ""60 Minutes"" after a stage light broke loose from the ceiling and knocked her down in January 1992.

The Clintons celebrate Bill's inauguration in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1991. He was governor from 1983 to 1992, when he was elected President.

Arkansas' first lady, now using the name Hillary Rodham Clinton, wears her inaugural ball gown in 1985.

In 1975, Rodham married Bill Clinton, whom she met at Yale Law School. He became the governor of Arkansas in 1978. In 1980, the couple had a daughter, Chelsea.

Rodham was a lawyer on the House Judiciary Committee, whose work led to impeachment charges against President Richard Nixon in 1974.

Before marrying Bill Clinton, she was Hillary Rodham. Here she attends Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Her commencement speech at Wellesley's graduation ceremony in 1969 attracted national attention. After graduating, she attended Yale Law School.

Hillary Clinton accepts the Democratic Party's nomination for president at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28, 2016. The former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state was the first woman to lead the presidential ticket of a major political party.

(CNN) —

Big banks have found few political friends in recent years. Excoriated by President Barack Obama and progressive Democrats like Elizabeth Warren for their “greedy” policies, rejected by Tea Party conservatives for being too cozy with Washington, and even seemingly scolded by Pope Francis in his Evangelii Gaudium last month, it’s almost as if Wall Street has been sent to the woodshed.

And after the 2012 presidential election, it’s not hard to understand why no one wants to appear too comfortable with the “plutocracy.” Many have argued that Mitt Romney’s Bain Capital pedigree and his comments at the Boca Raton, Florida, home of private equity manager Marc Leder about the “47%” helped tank his campaign. Fate sealed: Romney-the-plutocrat was cooked.

But perhaps the big banks have found an unlikely new ally: Hillary Clinton.

S.E. Cupp

An article in Politico Magazine this week, one that elicited little response from Democrats, recounted Clinton’s recent remarks to Goldman Sachs executives and a few hundred major investors, seemingly to reassure them that she didn’t think the banks were all bad.

According to the story (ironically headlined, “Lament of the Plutocrats”):

“…Clinton offered a message that the collected plutocrats found reassuring, according to accounts offered by several attendees, declaring that the banker-bashing so popular within both political parties was unproductive and indeed foolish. Striking a soothing note on the global financial crisis, she told the audience, in effect: We all got into this mess together, and we’re all going to have to work together to get out of it. What the bankers heard her to say was just what they would hope for from a prospective presidential candidate: Beating up the finance industry isn’t going to improve the economy – it needs to stop. And indeed Goldman’s Tim O’Neill, who heads the bank’s asset management business, introduced Clinton by saying how courageous she was for speaking at the bank. (Brave, perhaps, but also well-compensated: Clinton’s minimum fee for paid remarks is $200,000).”

It’s hard to imagine how this will square with Obama’s renewed progressive, middle-class agenda for Democrats. According to the White House, raising the minimum wage and lessening income inequality will be major parts of Obama’s 2014 domestic plan – as well as his State of the Union address and budget.

More problematic is how Hillary Clinton’s bighearted rhetoric toward Wall Street will accord with Democrats generally. You don’t have to go to Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts or Bill de Blasio in Manhattan; it isn’t hard to find a Democrat, be they union machinist, single mom, or Wal-Mart cashier, who wants to punish the banks and weaken their influence in politics and everything else we do.

Hardest of all to figure is how this will square with Clinton herself. Since leaving the State Department, she’s made concerted (and some would argue necessary) efforts at rebranding herself as more progressive, speaking on voting rights, women’s issues, and gay rights.

In a recent New Republic piece by Noam Scheiber titled “Hillary’s Nightmare? A Democratic Party that Realizes its Soul Lies with Elizabeth Warren,” the writer describes Clinton’s hard left turn this way: “she recently used the word ‘progressive’ so many times in a single speech it was tempting to describe her condition as ‘severe.’”

Indeed, is Clinton in danger of becoming the next Mitt Romney? Heir(ess) to the throne, the natural front-runner, but out of touch with “the little people,” stuck in the rhetoric – and passé politicking – of the 1990s?

I talked to several Democratic strategists who were incredulous that Clinton cozied up to the bankers, and wondered how long it would take for progressive groups – or Republicans – to jump on it. Her bizarre tryst with Goldman and friends, and her nurturing message to them, doesn’t only put her to the right of progressive superstars like Warren and DeBlasio – and to the right of Obama, and to the right of most Democratic voters – but also to the right of many anti-bank, populist conservatives.

That’s tough – and odd – territory for Hillary Clinton to stake out in the run-up to a presidential election. But will Democrats hold her accountable? Or will she get a pass because she’s (sigh) Hillary? Elizabeth Warren, where are you?

He was thinking about running for president, and he put on his blog the next day six points of the speech, question-and-answer session. And point six was allegedly Senator Hagel said that the U.S. State Department was an adjunct of the Israeli foreign minister’s office, which I think would be breathtaking if he said that, had such a view.

I got a letter back from Senator Hagel, in response to my question, did you say that and do you believe that? And, the letter says he did not recall saying that. He disavowed that statement.

GRAHAM: Well, if in fact that’s true, that would end that matter because he previously said in a book that the Jewish lobby intimidates members of Congress, particularly the U.S. Senate, and makes us — pushes us to make very bad decisions.

http://www.wjla.com/...



Having lost the closer-than-expected Virginia gubernatorial election last week against Democrat Terry McAuliffe, he still has work to do in his remaining weeks as the state’s attorney general but nonetheless faces an uncertain political future.

Or not. That’s the word the past several days from a variety of conservative thinkers who believe Cuccinelli should run for the U.S. Senate next year against the popular incumbent and former Virginia governor Mark Warner. Take, for example what columnist Judson Phillips wrote last week in the Washington Times: “. . .In short, Ken Cuccinelli is the only potential candidate in Virginia with statewide name recognition who could take on Mark Warner and make this seat competitive. Cuccinelli has a lot of advantages that no one else has. His statewide organization is still intact. Another advantage is if he ran, the Republican Party would almost be forced to give him a significant amount of help.” And then there’s this from Quin Hillyer: “There’s every reason to believe ObamaCare will be an albatross around donkey necks next fall as well, and especially around the necks of senators such as Warner, without whose vote the dreadful law would not have passed. Because of his terrific lawsuit against Obamacare, there is nobody on Earth who is better suited than Cuccinelli to make that case against Warner.” If the Affordable Care Act continues to struggle, the thinking goes, Cuccinelli and his Tea Party supporters suddenly don’t look like obstructionists but wise people ahead of the curve. Mark Rozell, however, is skeptical. He’s the Acting Dean and Professor of Public Policy at George Mason University, and says that “unless circumstances change substantially,” Warner would be “extremely” hard to beat. - WJLA 5, 11/14/13

Honestly, who really thinks Ken Cuccinelli running up against Mark Warner next year after a narrow but humiliating defeat earlier this month? Apparently right-wing newspapers have a boner for the idea of Cuccinelli running for Senate:

http://www.americanthinker.com/...



Yet it would be a problem for the 2013 campaigner Ken Cuccinelli to run for U.S. Senate, from what we saw in Ken's unsuccessful campaign for governor. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Ken Cuccinelli as a potential senator. Yet Ken will fail badly unless he fires his 2013 campaign strategists, consultants, and leaders, and adopts a new strategy. Note that no Republican is currently running who has ever held elected office before. That is why Ken Cuccinelli is such an interesting possibility. Many leaders are enthusiastic about either Howie Lind or Shak Hill. Yet in enormous and highly political Virginia, no Republican either well-known or experienced is even hinting at running. I have been talking up Ollie North or Gary Bauer, teasing Jim Martin about running, and hoping for Jamie Radtke, Bob Marshall, or George Allen. Maybe E.W. Jackson will run. Apparently Newt Gingrich has said no. - American Thinker, 11/12/13

Will he actually run for Senate. Some folks are pretty doubtful:

http://www.staffordcountysun.com/...



Plus Virginia Democrats aren't even finished with going after Cuccinelli:

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...



The State Board of Elections updated the count to reflect provisional ballots from Fairfax County. Herring now leads by 164 votes out of more than 2.2 million cast. Herring had declared victory late Tuesday night, saying ""voters in Virginia have spoken."" At a news conference in Richmond on Wednesday, Obenshain termed Herring's declaration ""bravado"" and said the Democrat should resign from his state Senate seat if he is so confident. Obenshain said talk of a recount is premature, pending the Nov. 25 vote certification by the State Board of Elections. Obenshain also said he is not concerned about conflict of interest questions Democrats are raising because Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli is calling on supporters to help fund Obenshain's potential recount. Cuccinelli's office advises and counsels state agencies -- including the elections board, which would be in charge of a recount. State Sen. A. Donald McEachin, D-Henrico, on Wednesday called on Cuccinelli to ""stop tainting the electoral process and to refrain from fundraising for Senator Obenshain."" Cuccinelli has a critical role to play to help ensure Virginians have confidence in the outcome, McEachin said in a statement. ""Attorney General Cuccinelli needs to take his responsibilities seriously in this process and refrain from his overt and extreme partisanship,"" he said. - Huffington Post, 11/14/13

So yeah, maybe the Cooch better think carefully about running against Warner and not give in to the right-wing fan base cheering the idea. Plus I don't want the Cooch to run. For the obvious reasons, of course, but I also just have too many races to write about. It was fun writing a lot about the Virginia Governor's race this past month but I'm ready to move on. Plus I doubt Cuccinelli would even make the race competitive for Warner but then again, I could be wrong. Stay tuned."

Kilgore is so committed to the idea of having Texas leave the union that he legally changed his name – Larry SECEDE Kilgore. That’s the way he’ll appear on the ballot next March in the Texas Republican primary, where he is challenging front runner Greg Abbott for the GOP nomination.

Well, Texas killed satire again. It's dead. Hope you're happy, Texas. Kilgore talking with the clerk when next renewing his driver's license: ""No, that's SECEDE with all caps. All the letters.""

Apparently Larry SECEDE's big contribution to Republicanism is that he wants gay Americans to vote for him too so that, at long last, Texas can SECEDE. Once that's out of the way, we'll worry about the pesky details of who in the new Texas utopia will be able to kill who, and why.



Kilgore believes the Bible offers a good guide for government. As such, he suggests that in accordance with the biblical injunction against homosexuality, gay people should be put to death. But Kilgore says he’s willing to temporarily set aside his opposition to homosexuals in the interest of winning. [...] “I am a Christian, and I have lots of Christian beliefs. However, I am trying to build a coalition of all different types of people. I look at the lesbians and the homosexual folks and I say, ‘Hey, D.C. is stealing my money just like they’re stealing your money.’ After we get our freedom, then we can decide all that stuff — hopefully at a county level. Right now, lesbians and homosexuals and Christians may have differences with each other, but we’ve got a bigger enemy.”

So good news for all of you gay Texas Republicans—Larry SECEDE's willing put aside the question of whether or not we murder all the gay people until after y'all get your ""freedom."" Vote Larry!

There is going to be a debate, right? We will get to hear all the Texas Republican candidates for gubbiner debate their important issues like what the new free Texas flag will look like and who has the most awesomest middle name. Oh, but I suppose we can't have every nut in Texas up there on the same stage, so the party will probably limit it to ""serious"" candidates only, candidates who have a prayer of actually getting nominated.



In 2006, Kilgore finished second behind Gov. Rick Perry for the GOP nomination for governor.

Holy hell."

Raffi Williams, the 24 year-old son of the liberal Fox commentator, will be the RNC’s deputy press secretary and will be tasked with helping the GOP make inroads in these communities.

He told BuzzFeed that even though it is not realistic to expect Republicans to “get a ridiculous amount of African Americans in the next election,” the party can “can start to make inroads, and the more inclusive we are as a party the better optics we get to other demographics as well — not just African Americans — and that helps us in the long run.”

Williams was a Communications Director for the Republican Study Committee and worked for Rep. Dan Benishek’s (R-MI) reelection campaign.

After losing every minority group badly during the last election cycle in a country that is getting more diverse, the RNC conducted an “autopsy” report that identified the problems the GOP has had with minority voters. Williams said RNC Chair Reince Priebus is enthusiastic about his efforts and it seems like he will be given the resources to succeed.

“So it’s about making those new connections and getting the support I need. People are really enthused about it,” Williams said. “And that’s a nice thing for me. I didn’t know what I was walking into exactly but from the Chairman on down everyone is so on board with this.”

Republicans may be able to win over black voters after Obama leaves office because many blacks tend to be conservative on issues like immigration and gay marriage.

For instance, George W. Bush won 16% of the black vote in Ohio in 2004, largely because many culturally conservative black voters went to the polls to vote against gay marriage. In 2008, Obama won 97% of the black vote in Ohio. And in 2012, Obama received 96% of the black vote in Ohio, but blacks made up an astounding 15% of Ohio’s electorate on election day, which made the difference for Obama in the state."

“Too many people are forgetting that the lines that divide us are nothing compared to the ties that bind us,” he said. “It forgets that old saying, ‘If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.’ ”

Conceding the race before a crowd of a few hundred supporters at a banquet hall in Bridgewater, N.J., Mr. Lonegan called the race a victory, even in defeat, and thanked the prominent conservatives who had come to the state to campaign for him, including Rand Paul and Sarah Palin.

“We came well closer to winning this election than anyone ever expected,” Mr. Lonegan said to loud cheers. “The big Washington power groups and consultants said we couldn’t win. Well, maybe if they had played a role in this election, we would have won.”

Mr. Booker grew up in the wealthy North Jersey suburb of Harrington Park, where his parents, some of the first black executives at I.B.M., helped integrate the town.

A graduate of Stanford and Yale Law School, and a former Rhodes scholar, he was a celebrity even before he became mayor — with an Oscar-nominated documentary about his first, failed race in 2002. He was elected in 2006 to replace Sharpe James, the longtime mayor who later served time in prison for fraud.

Mr. Booker brought excitement to a city that has long struggled to shake off the cloud of the riots that nearly destroyed it 46 years ago. And with his national profile, he also attracted more business development, including Newark’s first new hotel and supermarket in decades, and millions of dollars in philanthropy, including a $100 million pledge to the city’s long-failing schools from the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg."

Gillespie said that, for now, the state party's focus should be on the looming recount in the razor-thin 2013 state attorney general's race. But the fields are largely set in the most competitive Senate races, and most major candidates tend to get in before the new year.

The filing deadline is Feb. 1.

Warner, despite coming from a swing state, doesn't rank among the GOP's top targets in 2014. Part of that is because Republicans are pursuing seven states that went for Mitt Romney in last year's presidential election, and part of it is because Warner is a very popular former governor with a moderate reputation.

A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in August showed Warner had a 61 percent approval rating, with just 25 percent of Virginians disapproving of him.

But Gillespie, 52, said Warner's record isn't as centrist as most people think.

""They thought he’d be an independent voice, but he’s voted with President Obama 97 percent of the time since he got elected with him in 2008,"" Gillespie said. ""They thought he’d be fiscally responsible, but he voted for a trillion dollar stimulus bill that borrowed from future generations to waste on pork barrel spending. And he promised he’d never vote for a bill that would mean people losing the insurance they like if they wanted to keep it, then cast the deciding vote in favor of Obamacare.""

Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II, who lost the state's 2013 governor's race last month, said over the weekend that he wouldn't challenge Warner in 2014. Other potential candidates include state Sen. Jeff McWaters.

If Gillespie were to win the seat, both of Virginia's senators would be former national party chairmen (Gillespie and former Democratic National Committee chairman Timothy M. Kaine), as well as its governor-elect, Terry McAuliffe, a former DNC chairman who will assume office in the coming weeks."

The Free Press reported that Bentivolio, no Edmund Gwenn in “Miracle on 34th Street,” left a teaching job in 2011 “after complaints he bullied students, even telling one class on its first day that his goal was to make all the students cry once during the year.” How much more gratifying to bully the president.

Not content with fighting off a popular immigration overhaul or threatening to shut down the government and set off the first federal default, hard-core Congressional Republicans want to nullify the election. Unlike when the Republicans did their nutty impeachment of Bill Clinton — (Newt Gingrich is back, starring in the “Crossfire” reboot) — they don’t even control the Senate. And as David Axelrod told me, there isn’t a “scintilla of justification.”

It’s lucky the president got another dog if Tom Coburn is his friend. At a town hall in Muskogee Wednesday, when an audience member called the administration “lawless,” the Oklahoma senator said his buddy was “getting perilously close” to the standard of high crimes and misdemeanors.

“I wonder what Coburn is saying about his enemies,” Axelrod says dryly.

In Texas recently, another Republican congressman, Blake Farenthold, answered a birther at a town hall. “If we were to impeach the president tomorrow, we would probably get the votes in the House of Representatives to do it,” he said, but added that it would never pass in the Senate.

At another Texas session Monday, someone asked Senator Ted Cruz (R-Canada), why they couldn’t impeach Obama. “It’s a good question,” Cruz replied, before noting that Democrats control the Senate.

Earlier this month, the president’s motorcade pulled into the Orlando Hilton and was greeted by about 50 protesters holding signs saying “Kenyan Go Home,” “Impeach Obama” and “Obama Lies.”"

The harsh reality is that, in order to seize a House majority, the Democrats are probably going to need a bigger cushion than even the 1.4 million vote edge they took last year.

And that is because the ""it's not all about gerrymandering crowd"" does have some political science to back them up.

The New Republic's Nate Cohn addressed the issue back in February when he wrote:



But even if redistricting were non-partisan, Republicans would possess a modest advantage in the chamber. Democrats do even better in cities than Republicans do in rural areas, so even a fair process would pack a larger number of Democratic voters into strongly Democratic districts.

This type of ""geographic clustering"" is based on a very simple premise:segregation.

African-Americans have spent decades as the most loyal voting bloc in the Democratic coalition, and the past several elections have also seen a steady movement of Latino voters into the ""loyally Democratic"" column. If either voting bloc congregates together in one community, that community is inevitably going to be terribly one-sided come election time.

And those are two ethnic groups, as it happens, that tend to be clustered tightly in ethnic enclaves in the larger cities of the United States, as well as other pockets of rural America (the Rio Grande River valley in Texas and Alabama's ""black belt"" of rural counties near the Mississippi border are excellent examples).

Ergo, even if you drew perfectly compact maps, you'd probably see a situation where there would be a large number of districts where Democrats would absolutely throttle the GOP, because of the high concentrations of African-American or Latino voters nestled within those districts. That would ""throw off the curve"" on those national numbers, because almost all of that 1.4 million vote edge is going to be owed to ... if you crunch the numbers ... less than 10 districts that are so deep blue that the margins are simply ridiculous.

Consider: if one looks at the Daily Kos Elections compilation of how all the 435 House districts voted for president last year, you'd see that the most one-sided Republican district in the nation was TX-13, an absurdly right-wing slice of rural Texas represented for nearly two decades by Rep. Mac Thornberry. Mitt Romney snared 80.2 percent of the vote in the 13th district.

You would also see that there are ... wait for it ... 25 Democratic House districts that are more one-sided in favor of the blue team. The most Democratic district in the nation? Jose Serrano's district in the Bronx is the winner, with 96.3 percent of the district vote going to Barack Obama in 2012.

Lest you think that this alone is proof of rampant gerrymandering, remember that a large number of those districts came from states where Republicans did not control the pen in the redistricting process (nearly a half dozen, for example, came out of California).

What's more, under the previous maps, where the Democrats had a healthy majority at one point, this phenomenon was still present. By going back to 2008, the recent high-water mark for Democratic majorities in the House, we see that there were a total of 87 districts in the country where Obama beat McCain by a two-to-one margin or greater. There were only 21 districts nationwide where McCain beat Obama by a similar margin. Of course, some of that is owed to the fact that Obama beat McCain nationally by a healthy margin, but that doesn't explain the gap in total.

So, does that mean that the defenders of the Republican majority are correct, and that gerrymandering played little-to-no role in the perpetuation of a GOP House majority?

Nah.

Residential patterns explain some of the disparity between seats and votes, but it would be absolutely asinine to say that it explains it completely. If that were true, I'd make this challenge to the GOP House majority and all of its defenders in the public conversation: do a mid-decade redistricting, in every state, entirely by independent commission (a la Iowa or California). After all, if the GOP House majority can be explained entirely by geographic clustering, there'd be nothing to lose, right?

George Mason University professor Michael P. McDonald jumped on this subject earlier in the month. The entire article is worth a read, but here is a key point:



Upon some reflection by anyone who has drawn a redistricting plan -- and I've been a redistricting consultant in 14 states -- geography is not really constraining on congressional redistricting. Congressional districts are very large. In moderate- to large-sized states they consist of over 700,000 persons. It is easy in all but the most densely-urban areas to combine urban, suburban, and rural voters within a compact district. And again, the plans implemented in the states with the largest urban centers are not responsible for the current partisan imbalance among the congressional plans.

McDonald very subtly makes two incredibly important points here. For one thing, the sheer size of American congressional districts make it easy to draw ""fair districts,"" if that is the goal. For another, the districts where geographic clustering are the most obvious are in states where the lines were drawn in such a way that Democrats actually do quite well. Of the 25 most one-sided districts in the nation, 15 of them came in three states: California, Illinois and New York. Democrats drew the lines in Illinois. California was drawn by a newly created independent commission in a map that was more favorable to Democrats than the previous one. And New York was the result of a court-drawn map that largely held in place the overwhelming Democratic majority in the delegation.

When people talk about Republican gerrymandering, they aren't talking about those three states. They are talking about Ohio. About Michigan. About Pennsylvania. About Florida. And about North Carolina.

North Carolina, in particular, is a real case study in the impact of gerrymandering. When Republicans snared control of the legislature in 2010, their redistricting efforts (which, in a curious quirk of state law, could not be vetoed by the state's Democratic governor) were ambitious to say the least. In the previous incarnation of the state's maps, the median district in the U.S. House was 47 percent Obama in 2008: a point or two behind his statewide result there, but generally in line with the statewide outcome. As would be expected in a closely contested state, Obama won a majority of the vote in six of the state's 13 CDs. After the NC GOP finished their handiwork, the median district in the state's U.S. House delegation was 41.7 percent Obama. The president scored a majority in just three of the state's 13 districts in 2012, despite only performing only slightly worse in the state between 2008-2012. But in those three districts, he scored a higher percentage of the vote (between 71-78 percent) than he did in any of the Tar Heel State's districts in 2008, when he carried the state.

What's more: Obama's 4th best performing district in the state? An 11.9 percent win for Mitt Romney in the reconfigured 13th district. The Democrats were not only packed into a trio of districts, but the remaining 10 districts were essentially rendered uncompetitive, with the sole exception of conservative Democrat Mike McIntyre somehow clinging to his seat in a district that went 59-40 Romney.

Now, it seems incredibly implausible that the voters of North Carolina somehow dramatically reclustered themselves in four years. So, in this case, the argument that residential patterns drove the result would take a pretty ignorant GOP cheerleader in order to make it. Just as it would be equally ignorant to claim that the current imbalance of the House delegation there (9-4 Republican) accurately reflects the will of the people in the state. This was the purest example of a gerrymander one can find.

The other states mentioned were not quite as naked, but they were notable nonetheless. And ""geographic clustering"" partisans would probably be quick to point out that those states are not necessarily gerrymandered, because of Democratic vote sinks in each state (Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, Columbus and Cleveland in Ohio, etc).

But Working America's Seth Michaels took that point head on earlier in the month, with an awesome example to the contrary:





@sethdmichaels geographical sorting matters a lot, but if gerrymandering didn't matter, Southeastern PA wouldn't be drawn like this. http://t.co/...

Well, yeah ... that looks pretty compact, doesn't it?"

“In 2008, I was an early supporter of then-Senator Obama’s campaign,” Ms. McCaskill said in a statement on the Ready for Hillary Web site. “I worked my heart out to elect him president. Now as I look at 2016 and think about who is best to lead this country forward, I’m proud to announce that I am Ready for Hillary.”

The unusual declaration was not as much a presidential endorsement of Mrs. Clinton — she had expressed that support earlier this year — but an endorsement of a “super PAC” encouraging her to run. It was the first endorsement of the Ready for Hillary PAC by a sitting member of Congress, the group said.

Even as she was lending her name to the group’s fund-raising efforts, Ms. McCaskill played down the significance of her action."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/03/24/1196592/-Bob-Dole-Calls-out-Current-Republicans,2013-03-24 00:00:00,"['Daily Kos Staff', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",Bob Dole Calls out Current Republicans,"It was an event in the late eighties, my brother had just won the state National Geographic bee. Suffering from a broken arm and forced to lay on a mat on the stage, he pressed on to have one of those weekends we will all remember.

We received cards from several, but it was a phone call from our senator - Robert Dole - that came across to let us know that he was proud of the effort and wanted to talk. The only issue on the list of those around us surrounded basic rights - especially for the disabled. Senator Dole came to a town event early the next year, stopped in and laid out why working toward the Americans with Disabilities Act was important to him.

Giving people a chance to participate in society was the way to move things forward; and that the most important role of government was to allow more people to participate in every level.

Now, twenty years later, former Senator Dole sees what his party has become and tells us something is very wrong.



As Dole sat in his Washington law office in February, still stunned by the outcome, he blamed his own party and suggested a headline: “Republican Party closes its doors to make repairs.” The GOP, added Dole, one of the party’s most revered figures, “needs a timeout” to tone down the antigovernment rhetoric.

They saw their job as meeting halfway. “I thought when I was elected I was supposed to do something,” Dole said.

Supporters hoped the time was right to win ratification. Of the 193 countries in the United Nations, 155 have signed the treaty and 129 have ratified it, including countries such as Afghanistan, Cuba, and Russia. In an effort to win Republican support, treaty backers asked Dole to take up the fight. The old warrior, while weakened from his most recent hospitalization, promptly agreed. No one disputed the difficulties faced by many of the 1 billion people worldwide with disabilities; in many developing countries, most children with disabilities don’t go to school and have little chance of gainful employment, not to mention basic accommodation, according to the State Department. Ratifying the treaty, supporters said, would spread American leadership around the globe as well as create new markets for US-made disabilities products.

Senators James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Jim DeMint of South Carolina, favorites of the Tea Party, wrote an op-ed for The Washington Times that said the treaty “calls for government agents to supersede the authority of parents of disabled children and even covers abortion.” Dole and other supporters of the treaty viewed the charges as laughably false. The treaty legislation clearly stated that it required no change in US law, and there were no new abortion rights, they said.

The article is chock full of quotes that describe the problem with the current leadership of the republican party.Republicans turned their backs on those who were part of one of their greatest victories.

I can remember sitting in a room listening to Senator Dole tell us how he always held a pen in his hand - a hand he couldn't really use due to a war injury, because as a younger man from the war the sign of disability made it harder for him to get respect; and holding a pen in his hand was a way to seem as though he was doing something and to hide a disability. His story was a moving moment to how a person understood directly the issues that face those who are disabled.

I am not here to rah-rah a Republican Senator who I'm sure we all would have many policy disagreements with. But I am here to remember a Republican Senator who pushed through the Americans with Disabilities Act. He put forward the Clean Air Act.

I read the article at the Boston Globe and remember that at one point, Dole was right "" “I thought when I was elected I was supposed to do something""

Too bad the current Republicans believe they are elected to make sure nothing happens. A nation cannot move forward if leadership from 20 years ago looks infinitely more progressive then a current implementation of a party. While everyone else tries to move forward, the modern Know-Nothings do everything in their power to take as many steps back as possible."

The former first daughter clearly has increased her public profile since that race. She has quit full-time, private-sector work and assumed more responsibilities in the family’s foundation -- a staging ground for a likely 2016 Clinton presidential campaign.

Yet the larger, emerging questions are whether the 33-year-old Clinton is ready for a bigger campaign role or a campaign of her own someday.

Clinton is indeed better prepared this time, having one presidential race, Wall Street experience and a side-gig as an NBC-TV special correspondent under her belt. However, Clinton’s ability to move among those worlds has also raised questions about her professional commitment and whether her last name carries more clout than her qualifications.

“She doesn’t have the charisma,” Tim Graham, a director at the conservative-lean Media Research Center, told FoxNews.com. “That doesn’t means she’s not smart. She just doesn’t have that soaring, transcendent oratory.”

The younger Clinton struggled at times as a family surrogate during the 2008 race. Though she was a grown woman, seasoned reporters were denied access to her. She once even told a child reporter: “I’m sorry, I don’t talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately, even though I think you’re cute.”

Though dispatched to college campuses, the effort had limited impact, as the youth vote helped catapult Barack Obama to victory. Though Obama won nearly 70 percent of that vote, Clinton supporters argue Chelsea helped cut into Obama’s percentages and that Hillary improved among younger votes as the campaign progresses, essentially matching Obama in California and Massachusetts.

The younger Clinton estimates making roughly 400 campaign stops, include at least 100 college-campus visits over five months, after being on the sidelines for essentially the first year of the campaign.

However, that role this time could be even more challenging, in part, with Hillary Clinton turning 66 in October.

And Chelsea might not get a pass from the press. Graham said Chelsea Clinton became fair game for reporters the day she took the NBC job and that she has always been used to soften her parents’ sharper edges -- despite their attempts to appear to do otherwise.

With an increased role would almost certainly come the responsibility of taking questions from reporters and otherwise moving even further beyond her fiercely protected earlier life, which included Secret Service agents in her Stanford University dormitory and a 1993 New York Times letter to the editor from Margaret Truman telling the press that too much Chelsea coverage could be damaging.

Whether she stumps for her mother or pursues some higher calling, Chelsea inevitably faces a thorny mess of previously off-limit questions that could range from the infamous Monica sex scandal to her ambitions to continue the Clinton political dynasty to an uneven professional resume that bounces between Wall Street, academia, journalism and philanthropy.

“You at least have to admire her resilience and desire to remain in the political process,” a Democratic strategist told FoxNews.com. “She has lived through the worst of politics and clearly evolved. The bigger question might be whether Hillary Clinton has learned from her mistakes in 2008.”

Chelsea has recently suggested she is keeping her options open about running for elected office.

""Not now,"" she told CNN this month. ""I'm ... grateful to live in a city and state and a country where I really believe in my elected officials, and their ethos and their competencies. Someday, if either of those weren't true and I thought I could make more of a difference in the public sector ... I'd have to ask and answer that question.""

The Clinton Foundation did not respond to a request for comment.

Chelsea’s first job after graduate school at University College, Oxford, was in 2003 at the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. in New York City.

“Partly, I had no idea what I wanted to do at that time,” she said last year, according to an interview taped by Bloomberg News. “I felt there were people there I could learn a lot from.”

Three years later, she joined the Wall Street firm Avenue Capital Group, a hedge fund cofounded by Marc Lasry, who has given more than $600,000 to mostly Democratic candidates since 1995, including $11,500 to Hillary Clinton’s successful 2000 bid to win a New York Senate seat, according to the website InfluenceExplorer.com.

The firm declined to reveal Chelsea’s job, citing company policy. But last year, she said she joined Avenue Capital to learn about the business of making money and identified her boss as Matthew Kimble, listed on the company website as a portfolio manager.

“I didn’t want to grow up to be my boss,” Clinton said. “After a few years, I just thought I had to go figure out what I do want to do.”

She also revealed in a 2011 interview with Time Magazine that she left Advance Capital without advance notice after her mother won the 2008 New Hampshire primary.

“I called my boss and I was like, ‘I’m really sorry. I think I need to quit my job because I don’t know how long I’m going to be gone,” Clinton recalled saying.

Yet her job at NBC has drawn the most criticism, largely because she had no real journalism experience and turned in some less-than-spectacular performances.

“This one-dimensional, under-reported, naive celebration of a charter school in Rhode Island was just as much of an empty-headed puff job as Clinton's first report on an after-school program in Little Rock,” David Zurawik, a media critic for the liberal-leaning Baltimore Sun, wrote last year, after Clinton’s second on-air report.

Still, NBC renewed Clinton’s contract this year, as she begins to “play a significant role in shaping the foundation’s future,” according to a New York Times story this month about the financial challenges facing the newly renamed Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation.

Clinton also has begun to “assert herself as a force” within the organization, according to The Times story, which suggested her motivation has in part been to save the foundation she stands to inherit.

Meanwhile, Clinton will keep her board positions at the Clinton Health Access Initiative, the School of American Ballet, Common Sense Media, and the Weill Cornell Medical College and remains active in Of Many Institute at NYU, according to the foundation.

She also continues to work on her doctoral thesis at Oxford and teach part-time at Columbia University from which she received a master’s in public health in 2010.

If Clinton has found her mark, it appears to be at the foundation and its related works.

During a recent trip to Nigeria, she spoke passionately about her effort to curb the preventable deaths of 1 million women and children annually in that country.

""I couldn't imagine not doing work like this,"" she told Reuters. “I define success in my life by how much of a difference have I made in a given day, whether that is being a good wife to my husband, a good daughter to my parents, a good friend to my friends, or helping push forward our work at CHAI or the Alliance for a Healthier Generation or any other facet of the foundation."""

A poll released Friday by Democrat-leaning Public Policy Polling shows Gomez, the former Navy SEAL and political newcomer, trailing Democratic Rep. Ed Markey by just 4 percentage points, 40 to 44 percent.

The poll follows one released Thursday by Emerson College that shows Gomez trailing Markey by 6 percentage points, 36-42, in the special election to fill the seat held by Democrat John Kerry, now secretary of State.

The numbers are in sharp contrast to those before the primaries in which Markey led by as many as 19 points in a hypothetical match up with Gomez.

The battle lines have already been drawn, with both candidates essentially putting new edges on a mix of familiar political strategies.

The 47-year-old Gomez, a Hispanic and private equity investor, is trying to portray Markey, a congressman for the past 36 years, as a Washington insider.

“He’s been a career politician since I was playing little league,” he told Fox News after his primary win. “He’s a poster boy for term limits.”

Markey, a progressive aligned with President Obama’s policies, is attacking Gomez for his connection to a documentary that accuses Obama of seeking political gain by leaking details of the Usama bin Laden killing that they say put troops and national security at risk.

He also told The Washington Post that Gomez not agreeing to keep their race free of outside money makes him “the poster boy for politics as usual.”

And the contest has already turned negative.

Markey now has an attack ad titled “Meet Gabriel Gomez: Just Another Republican,” which includes a split screen shot of bin Laden and Gomez.

""Markey has started his campaign with a textbook despicable political attack,"" Gomez said. ""Markey should direct his campaign to immediately stop this ad, stop his mudslinging and debate me on issues that Massachusetts voters care about, the economy and jobs.”

Political analysts are comparing the contest with last year’s Senate race in Massachusetts, in which incumbent Republican Scott Brown was defeated by Democratic political newcomer Elizabeth Warren, a progressive who supported Wall Street reform and women’s health-care choices, as Markey is expected to do.

They also point to Brown’s stunning 2010 special election victory as proof a Republican can win in this heavily Democratic state.

As a relatively unknown state senator, Brown managed to catch Massachusetts Democrats by surprise, after trailing their candidate, state Attorney General Martha Coakley, by as many as 31 points.

However, Gomez appears to have more statewide name recognition earlier in the race. And Democrats are prepared not to have a repeat of three years ago.

""While we don't pay attention to public polls, we're confident that the more people learn about Gomez..., the more people will realize his radical agenda is bad for Massachusetts,"" said Andrew Zucker, Markey's campaign press secretary.

Zucker cited Gomez's position on women's reproductive issues as part of that agenda.

The general election in June 25.

“The victory window has cracked open for Gomez,” said Rob Gray, a Republican strategist for New England-based Gray Media, who sees an enthusiasm gap among Democrats.

He argued Friday that Gomez’s relatively surprising primary victory over more established candidates and ability to raise campaign money shows he has the kind of statewide appeal that will help him win over much needed Independent voters.

“He’s at a good place to start,” Gray said.

Tim Buckley, spokesman for the state Republican Party, said Gomez’s first step toward victory came on election night when the losing candidates pledged their support and “put their eye on the prize.”

He also agrees that Gomez has “crossover appeal” and added his own historically perspective, saying “Massachusetts likes new political figures.”"

(CNN) - Newark, New Jersey Mayor Cory Booker on Saturday declared his candidacy for the Senate in this year's special election to fill the seat of the late Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg.

Booker's campaign sent out an email release the day before stating that the mayor would make an announcement regarding his candidacy at the event in Newark, followed by a similar event a few hours later in the southern part of the Garden State.

At Saturday's news conference, Booker cited a track record of compromise as Mayor of Newark as an example of how he can help change gridlock in Washington.

""I am here because I believe that people who care, can find solutions to even the most difficult problems. I am here because when we work together, I know from experience that there is no problem we can't solve,"" Booker said.

Lautenberg died Monday at age 89 and was buried on Friday at Arlington National Cemetery. On Tuesday New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced plans to hold a special Senate election this year, with the Democratic and Republican primaries on August 13 and the general election on October 16. The winner would serve the final 14 1/2 months of Lautenberg's term. An election to a full six-year term will be in November 2014.

CNN reported Thursday that Booker had begun collecting signatures to run in the special election. Candidates hoping to run in the race must hand in 1,000 signatures by 4 p.m. ET on Monday.

Booker, considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, earlier this year announced he was exploring a run for Senate in 2014. He made the news before Lautenberg announced he would not run for re-election.

Booker will become the second Democrat to formally jump into the race. Rep. Rush Holt, who's in his eight term representing New Jersey's 12th Congressional District, said in a statement that on Thursday that, ""I ask for your support as I seek to serve as your Senator in that seat. The reason is simple: I believe I am the best candidate to continue the passionate advocacy for progressive values that Sen. Lautenberg exemplified.""

Rep. Frank Pallone, who's also considered likely to make a bid, has not made any announcements. A Democratic source with knowledge of Pallone's thinking told CNN ""an announcement will be forthcoming"" but added that it would come after the late senator's funeral process is over, ""out of respect to Lautenberg, who was a close friend to the congressman.""

Pallone has the biggest war chest of the three Democrats, with approximately $3 million cash on hand. Booker, who is seen as the favorite in the Democratic nomination battle and who has the potential to raise a large sum of money thanks to his star power and national connections, currently has a smaller war chest than Pallone, with Holt having around $700,000 in the bank.

On the GOP side, former Bogota, New Jersey, Mayor Steve Lonegan says he'll run. Other possible candidates include Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, Rep. Jon Runyan, and biotech executive John Crowley. State senators Joe Kyrillos and Tom Kean Jr., who have both run for the Senate in the past, seem to be leaning against making another bid this time around. Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnic has said he won't run.

Christie on Thursday appointed state Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa, a fellow Republican, to serve as interim senator until the October election but Chiesa said he won't run.

As for Booker, he challenged critics Saturday who say Washington can't be fixed, a sure campaign theme of his going forward.

""We in New Jersey know a thing or two about toughness, about resiliency and strength. I know this and I've seen it over and over at every point in my career as an elected official. I know the truth of who we are when we are together and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt, especially here in New Jersey, that there is nothing we can't do together,"" Booker said.

(CNN) - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday in an interview with CNN that she still has ""absolutely no plans to run"" for president but added she's looking forward to more ""adventures"" down the road.

""I am lucky because I've been very healthy. I feel great. I've got enormous amounts of energy that have to be harnessed and focused, so I'm very fortunate,"" she told CNN's Jill Dougherty and Elise Labott. ""I'm looking forward to this next chapter in my life, whatever it is.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Pressed further on whether she has ruled out another White House bid, Clinton said; ""I have absolutely no plans to run.""

""I don't know everything I'll be doing. I'll be working on behalf of women and girls, hopefully writing and speaking, those are the things that I'm planning to do right now,"" she added.

She also appeared unaware that a super PAC, ""Ready for Hillary,"" had formed recently in support of a possible run.

""Is there really?"" Clinton asked.

Her successor, Sen. John Kerry, was confirmed by the Senate Tuesday afternoon.

When Clinton official leaves her post, she'll be capping a run of public service that includes being a first lady, U.S. senator, presidential candidate and the nation's top diplomat.

Asked what it will feel like to suddenly have some free time, Clinton said it's ""going to take some adjustment.""

""I've been talking to colleagues who left the government earlier, and the most common thing they say to me is don't make any decisions, you have no idea how tired you are,"" she said.

Clinton has repeatedly brushed aside questions about a potential presidential run and has yet to be specific about her plans. While she has previously said she was not interested in running at all, her answers of late have been less firm.

But Clinton said for now, she's ready for some rest.

""I know it sounds vague because I have never done this before in my life…to have the luxury of nowhere to go nothing to do, no frantic call about calling some leader about some impending crisis,"" Clinton said. ""I'm actually interested to see how that goes.""

Her husband, former President Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea, are both involved in philanthropic and public service efforts. Asked about their plans as a family, Clinton said she's not sure what the next few years will look like.

""I think we'll work all that out, it's going to be fun to talk about what our next adventures might be,"" she said.

Finishing up the wide-ranging interview, Clinton thanked Dougherty and Labott, two reporters who have covered Clinton extensively over the last four years at the State Department.

""We'll have some adventures and maybe the two of you will come along again sometime,"" she said.

A special election will be held June 25 for the rest of John Kerry%27s term

Brown won a 2010 election to succeed Democrat Edward Kennedy

The moderate Republican criticized partisanship in Congress

Former senator Scott Brown will not run for the Senate seat vacated by John Kerry in Massachusetts, saying Friday he was unsure ""of returning to a Congress even more partisan than the one I left.""

The decision by Brown, a moderate Republican, means Democrats now have a better chance of keeping the Massachusetts seat.

Brown was defeated in November by Democrat Elizabeth Warren, in the nation's most expensive Senate race. Democrats had made Brown a top target since he was the surprise winner of a 2010 race to replace Democrat Edward Kennedy, who died the previous summer.

Kerry officially stepped down Friday afternoon and was sworn in as secretary of State, replacing Hillary Rodham Clinton as the nation's top diplomat.

Brown said he gave ""serious thought"" to running, but it would have been his third Senate race in four years. If he won the June 25 special election, Brown would have to run again in 2014 for his own term.

Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick has already appointed William ""Mo"" Cowan, a lawyer and his former chief of staff, to be the interim senator until voters pick a new senator. Primaries will be held April 30.

Democratic Reps. Ed Markey and Stephen Lynch have already declared their Senate candidacies.

The Senate GOP campaign committee vowed Republicans will be competitive. ""As the Democratic primary ... turns uglier and nastier each day, the Massachusetts special election provides a real pickup opportunity for Republicans, and we intend on defeating whichever career politician limps through,"" said Rob Collins, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

Brown was a little-known state senator when he ran for the U.S. Senate after Kennedy's death. He defeated Democrat Martha Coakley, the state's attorney general, who ran what many people believed was a lackluster campaign in 2010.

In his statement, Brown suggested he will continue in public service — but made no mention of whether he will run for governor next year. Serving in Congress, he said, is ""not the only way for me to advance the ideals and causes that matter most to me.""

Although Massachusetts consistently votes Democratic in presidential elections, it doesn't always do the same in governor's races. Three Republicans — William Weld, Paul Cellucci and Mitt Romney — were elected governors from 1990 to 2006.

Terry McAuliffe ekes out victory in Virginia

Democrat Terry McAuliffe won the Virginia governor's race, squeaking by Republican Ken Cuccinelli with the help of voters in the predominantly blue Washington suburbs. McAuliffe's victory in the key swing state was an affirmation of his strategy to portray Cuccinelli, the state attorney general, as a Tea Party champion who is too extreme for Virginia.

Christie wins re-election; seen as prelude to 2016

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie won re-election in a race seen mainly as the kickoff for the next one: the popular Republican is considered a good bet to run for president in 2016. Christie dominated in money, airtime and polls against his opponent, state Democratic Sen. Barbara Buono – but his real opponent may well be any other Republican considering 2016.

Christie's challenger blasts her own party

Democratic Sen. Barbara Buono used her concession speech to offer a blistering critique of her own party. She said: ""We rose above the political system that too often requires surrendering one's values. A system where backroom deals fueled by greed and self-interest are just the order of business. The Democratic political bosses, some elected and some not, made a deal with this governor despite him representing everything they're supposed to be against. They didn't do it to help the state. They did it out of a desire to help themselves politically and financially. But we did it our way and I'm proud of that.""

Bill de Blasio elected mayor of New York

Bill de Blasio was elected mayor of New York, signaling a new era for a city whose new leader promises to undo much of what Michael Bloomberg accomplished. De Blasio, who vowed to narrow the gap between the rich and poor and reform controversial policing tactics, is the first Democrat elected mayor of the nation's largest city since David Dinkins beat Rudy Giuliani in 1989.

Detroit elects first white mayor since 1974

Former Detroit Medical Center chief Mike Duggan consistently led Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon in polls. Duggan will be the first white mayor since 1974 in the majority-black city. He faces hefty problems, not the least of which is the city's $20 billion bankruptcy, and will have little power until the tenure of an emergency city manager ends.

Warning flags for Tea Party

The staying power of the conservative movement that burst onto the scene four years ago was called into question in this year's marquee contests. Tea Party nemesis Chris Christie swept to a landslide re-election as governor in New Jersey, a case study in how more moderate Republicans can carry even Democratic-leaning states. Tea Party favorite Ken Cuccinelli lost a closer race against Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor in Virginia, a contest establishment Republicans thought they could have won with a more mainstream candidate.

Colorado pot tax & secession

Voters approved a 25% tax on newly legal recreational marijuana to fund school construction. Opponents argued the tax rate would benefit black market sales.

Voters in at least six of 11 affected rural Colorado counties voted down a proposal night to secede from the state. Results were still being tallied.

Washington state rejects GMO labels

Washington state voters rejected 55% to 45% an initiative that would have required foods containing genetically engineered ingredients to be labeled. The initiative was part of an ongoing national fight by those opposed to genetically engineered crops to push for labeling. Food industry ads claimed that the initiative would raise food prices.

Houston Astrodome doomed

Texas voters rejected a plan to authorize bonds to turn the Houston Astrodome, the world's first multipurpose domed stadium, into a giant convention and event center and exhibition space. The outcome means the stadium is likely to be torn down.

New Jersey minimum wage increase

New Jersey voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment Tuesday to raise the minimum wage by $1, to $8.25 an hour, and add automatic cost-of-living increases each year.

Election Day oddity

In Takoma Park, 16- and 17-year-olds hopped in line to vote. In May, Takoma Park City Council voted to become the first city in the United States to lower its voting age from 18 to 16.

They are tired of brinkmanship.

Republicans have taken a HUGE hit:



Participants in the poll gave the Republican Party overall its lowest marks in the history of Journal polling, which goes back to 1989: More than twice as many hold a negative view of the GOP as a positive one. By contrast, the number of Americans viewing the Democratic Party positively or negatively was nearly equal, at about 40%.

n all, 53% of those polled blamed Republicans for the shutdown, compared with 31% who blamed Mr. Obama—numbers that showed the GOP taking a worse beating than the party did 17 years ago during the last extended shutdown, under President Bill Clinton.

Asked about the current budget battle, 70% of participants faulted Republicans in Congress for putting their political agenda ahead of what's good for the country. In a separate question, 51% said Mr. Obama was more concerned about his agenda than the good of the country. The public was divided over the president's refusal to negotiate with Republicans unless they reopen the government and raise the federal debt ceiling, with 40% agreeing with his stand and 43% disagreeing.

Bill McInturff , a Republican pollster who conducted the poll along with Democratic pollsters Fred Yang and Peter Hart , called the data ""toxic"" and noted key areas in which the GOP had suffered from what he called ""an ideological boomerang"" contrary to the outcome sought when members of the party launched the budget fight last month.

The poll also showed a slight uptick in support overall for the health law and a larger jump, to 52%, in support of the government doing more to solve people's problems.

Far more blame Republicans than Obama for the shutdown.Although Obama has taken a hit, it is not nearly as bad as the Republicans.In all this poll is TOXIC for the GOP:And Obamacare got an uptick!Please proceed GOP!"

But we can’t hear ourselves think here this summer over the roar of the Clinton machine — and the buzzing back to life of old Clinton enemies. Meanwhile, Obama’s vaunted campaign machine, which has morphed into a political group called Organizing for Action, has sputtered in its attempt to tear down Republican obstacles and push through his agenda.

While President Obama seems drained and disgusted at the idea of punching through the Republican blockade that awaits him on his return from Martha’s Vineyard, he told Jay Leno that Hillary “had that post-administration glow” when they met for lunch recently.

As the president was getting ready for his news conference, his former secretary of state was dominating the news with an event she didn’t even attend. Emily’s List held what was, in essence, Hillary’s first Iowa campaign event, titled “Madam President” and featuring Claire McCaskill, the Missouri senator who famously broke away from Clinton Inc. to join the Obama revolution in 2008. Now McCaskill, who once said she wouldn’t trust Bill Clinton near her daughter, is presciently back in the fold, on board with Ready for Hillary, the super PAC supporting Clinton for 2016.

As ABC News’s Michael Falcone reported from Iowa, the state that allowed Obama to vault over Hillary, McCaskill said she’s dreaming of “that moment in 2017 when we can say ‘Madam President’ to Hillary Rodham Clinton.’ ”

In a funny echo of Hillary’s defense of Bill during the Gennifer Flowers scandal, when she said she wasn’t home baking cookies and having teas, McCaskill told the forum it’s hard for women to run for office because it’s “not sitting down to tea and crumpets.”"

Maureen Dowd Knocks One Out Of The Park For Once,"The New York Times Columnist whom George W. Bush famously referred to as ""The Viper"" (and the author of ""Are Men Necessary?"" to boot) hasn't hit a home run with us in a long time. Most of the time she hasn't made it to second base. But today she (if you'll excuse this exercise in double entendres) nails it.

Excoriating the House Republicans' recent ""impeachment fixation,"" Dowd goes straight to the heart of the matter:

For some of the rodeo clowns clamoring for impeachment around the country, Barack Obama’s real crime is presiding while black.

Earlier this month, the president’s motorcade pulled into the Orlando Hilton and was greeted by about 50 protesters holding signs saying “Kenyan Go Home,” “Impeach Obama” and “Obama Lies.” BuzzFeed had a pictorial on the “Overpasses for Obama’s Impeachment” fad, where people hold up homemade signs on overpasses. And they reported on 100,000 preorders for the book “Impeachable Offenses: The Case for Removing Barack Obama from Office,” covering sore points from Benghazi to Obamacare to T.S.A. screenings.

“I stood 12 feet away from the guy and listened to him and I couldn’t stand being there,” he said of President Obama, “but because he is president I have to respect the office.” Bentivolio is the perfect avatar of the impeachment fever gripping a G.O.P. that’s unmoored from reality....

Not content with fighting off a popular immigration overhaul or threatening to shut down the government and set off the first federal default, hard-core Congressional Republicans want to nullify the election. Unlike when the Republicans did their nutty impeachment of Bill Clinton — (Newt Gingrich is back, starring in the “Crossfire” reboot) — they don’t even control the Senate. And as David Axelrod told me, there isn’t a “scintilla of justification.”

Perhaps the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington prompted her to train her venom where it really belongs. Whatever the cause, there's not a trace of the mocking ""Barry"" epithet she habitually throws out when criticizing the President. Instead, she focuses on the sheer rank idiocy of the GOP's obsessive campaign to impeach him, a campaign rooted in principle since he won the Democratic Primary in 2008 but one that now appears to be entering an even more virulent phase thanks to Fox News and right-wing talk radio:Her column castigates Michigan Congressman Kerry Bentivolio, who gratuitously advised us that he can't even bear being in proximity to President Obama and is one of the prime cheerleaders of the ""impeachment movement:""Dowd's verdict on this sorry Republican strategy is harsh:Of course she's right. But what she doesn't acknowledge is the likelihood that the Republicans know full well their impeachment talk is hollow, yet they persist in it to satisfy their core constituents who apparently thrive on a diet of racism and bile. Had she faced up to that uncomfortable reality, this column could have been a classic. But God knows we can't blame the constituents for the behavior of their Representatives, can we?

Still, she does get the point:

The Democrats never impeached W. and they had real grounds: starting a war on false premises and sanctioning torture. “The Republican Party is in a constant struggle between its ego and its id,” Axelrod says, “and the id has mostly won out lately.” It isn’t the president who should leave. It’s the misguided lawmakers trying to drive him out.

Except they're not ""misguided."" They're just playing to the impotent rage of the people who voted for them."

Overall%2C roughly 58 percent of the nation%27s voters participated in 2012 election

Blacks and whites are expected to remain biggest racial groups of voters



Black voter turnout fell below historic levels in 2004

WASHINGTON (AP) — America's blacks voted at a higher rate than other minority groups in 2012 and by most measures surpassed the white turnout for the first time, reflecting a deeply polarized presidential election in which blacks strongly supported Barack Obama while many whites stayed home.

Had people voted last November at the same rates they did in 2004, when black turnout was below its current historic levels, Republican Mitt Romney would have won narrowly,according to an analysis conducted for The Associated Press.

Census data and exit polling show that whites and blacks will remain the two largest racial groups of eligible voters for the next decade. Last year's heavy black turnout came despite concerns about the effect of new voter-identification laws on minority voting, outweighed by the desire to re-elect the first black president.

William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, analyzed the 2012 elections for the AP using census data on eligible voters and turnout, along with November's exit polling. He estimated total votes for Obama and Romney under a scenario where 2012 turnout rates for all racial groups matched those in 2004. Overall, 2012 voter turnout was roughly 58 percent, down from 62 percent in 2008 and 60 percent in 2004.

The analysis also used population projections to estimate the shares of eligible voters by race group through 2030. The numbers are supplemented with material from the Pew Research Center and George Mason University associate professor Michael McDonald, a leader in the field of voter turnout who separately reviewed aggregate turnout levels across states, as well as AP interviews with the Census Bureau and other experts. The bureau is scheduled to release data on voter turnout in May.

Overall, the findings represent a tipping point for blacks, who for much of America's history were disenfranchised and then effectively barred from voting until passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965.

But the numbers also offer a cautionary note to both Democrats and Republicans after Obama won in November with a historically low percentage of white supporters. While Latinos are now the biggest driver of U.S. population growth, they still trail whites and blacks in turnout and electoral share, because many of the Hispanics in the country are children or noncitizens.

In recent weeks, Republican leaders have urged a ""year-round effort"" to engage black and other minority voters, describing a grim future if their party does not expand its core support beyond white males.

The 2012 data suggest Romney was a particularly weak Republican candidate, unable to motivate white voters let alone attract significant black or Latino support. Obama's personal appeal and the slowly improving economy helped overcome doubts and spur record levels of minority voters in a way that may not be easily replicated for Democrats soon.

Romney would have erased Obama's nearly 5 million-vote victory margin and narrowly won the popular vote if voters had turned out as they did in 2004, according to Frey's analysis. Then, white turnout was slightly higher and black voting lower.

More significantly, the key states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida and Colorado would have tipped in favor of Romney, handing him the presidency if the outcome of other states remained the same.

""The 2012 turnout is a milestone for blacks and a huge potential turning point,"" said Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University who has written extensively on black politicians. ""What it suggests is that there is an 'Obama effect' where people were motivated to support Barack Obama. But it also means that black turnout may not always be higher, if future races aren't as salient.""

Whit Ayres, a Republican consultant who is advising Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a possible 2016 presidential contender, says the last election reaffirmed that the Republican Party needs ""a new message, a new messenger and a new tone."" Change within the party need not be ""lock, stock and barrel,"" Ayres said, but policy shifts such as Republican support for broad immigration legislation will be important to woo minority voters over the longer term.

""It remains to be seen how successful Democrats are if you don't have Barack Obama at the top of the ticket,"" he said."

Kilgore is so committed to the idea of having Texas leave the union that he legally changed his name – Larry SECEDE Kilgore. That’s the way he’ll appear on the ballot next March in the Texas Republican primary, where he is challenging front runner Greg Abbott for the GOP nomination.

Well, Texas killed satire again. It's dead. Hope you're happy, Texas. Kilgore talking with the clerk when next renewing his driver's license: ""No, that's SECEDE with all caps. All the letters.""

Apparently Larry SECEDE's big contribution to Republicanism is that he wants gay Americans to vote for him too so that, at long last, Texas can SECEDE. Once that's out of the way, we'll worry about the pesky details of who in the new Texas utopia will be able to kill who, and why.



Kilgore believes the Bible offers a good guide for government. As such, he suggests that in accordance with the biblical injunction against homosexuality, gay people should be put to death. But Kilgore says he’s willing to temporarily set aside his opposition to homosexuals in the interest of winning. [...] “I am a Christian, and I have lots of Christian beliefs. However, I am trying to build a coalition of all different types of people. I look at the lesbians and the homosexual folks and I say, ‘Hey, D.C. is stealing my money just like they’re stealing your money.’ After we get our freedom, then we can decide all that stuff — hopefully at a county level. Right now, lesbians and homosexuals and Christians may have differences with each other, but we’ve got a bigger enemy.”

So good news for all of you gay Texas Republicans—Larry SECEDE's willing put aside the question of whether or not we murder all the gay people until after y'all get your ""freedom."" Vote Larry!

There is going to be a debate, right? We will get to hear all the Texas Republican candidates for gubbiner debate their important issues like what the new free Texas flag will look like and who has the most awesomest middle name. Oh, but I suppose we can't have every nut in Texas up there on the same stage, so the party will probably limit it to ""serious"" candidates only, candidates who have a prayer of actually getting nominated.



In 2006, Kilgore finished second behind Gov. Rick Perry for the GOP nomination for governor.

Mike Enzi, a popular conservative Enzi said that Cheney told him she would not run if he ran for re-election

(CNN) —

The U.S. Senate race in Wyoming has it all: A popular incumbent Republican facing a primary challenge, a GOP feud, a generational divide, and Dick Cheney, one of the most polarizing figures in politics.

Liz Cheney met with reporters in Casper on Wednesday, one day after announcing her bid for the seat. It came on the same day that three-term Republican Sen. Mike Enzi said he would run for re-election.

“I’m focused on earning every vote I can, the way it ought to be done in Wyoming, which is one person at a time,” Cheney said.

Enzi says Wyoming voters will stick with him

Cheney, a former State Department official and Fox News contributor, is the eldest daughter of the former vice president, who served for a decade as the congressman from Wyoming.

Like her father, Cheney is a very vocal critic of President Barack Obama.

“President Obama has launched a war on our Second Amendment rights. He has launched a war on our religious freedom. He has used the IRS to launch a war on our freedom of speech. He has used the EPA to launch a war on Wyoming’s ranchers, farmers and energy industry,” said Cheney in a statement announcing her bid.

CNN Chief National Correspondent John King, who covered the Cheneys over the years, says Liz Cheney has been a very loyal aide to her father.

Liz Cheney announces Senate run

“Clearly she has his blessing or she wouldn’t do it,” King said. “If her dad had turned to her and said ‘Don’t do this,’ she wouldn’t have done this. In her putting her neck out, in her offending Mike Enzi and everyone else in the Wyoming Republican party, so has her dad.”

Enzi is a proven conservative but has been willing to try to accomplish bipartisan solutions in the Senate.

While not directly criticizing him in her announcement, Cheney said, “I am running because I know as a mother and as a patriot, we can no longer afford simply to go along to get along.”

And the 46-year-old Cheney appears to be making Enzi’s age an issue, saying, “I believe it is necessary for a new generation of leaders to step up to the plate.”

Enzi is 69.

One veteran analyst of Senate races isn’t sure the age argument will be effective.

“She is running against an incumbent from her own party who has a solidly conservative voting record and is well-liked by voters. Her theme seems to be Enzi’s age, but I don’t know that it will play that well,” said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the non-partisan Cook Political Report.

But the primary will highlight the ongoing struggle for the future of the GOP.

“This race now will be the highest-profile test of what’s happening in the Republican Party, the struggle over whether you fight and compromise or do you fight and keep fighting. This race will capture huge national attention,” King added.

Enzi says he’s not surprised he’s being challenged.

“She’s been traveling around Wyoming for a long time, so I’m not surprised. I’m only surprised in that she said if I ran she wouldn’t. She announced 30 minutes after I more specifically stated my intention,” Enzi told CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash on Wednesday.

And he pushed back on his age, telling Bash, “I’m absolutely not too old to be a senator. I’m about the median age for this body. I’m in really good health, I’m on the committees that I want to be on. I have seniority.”

And Enzi doesn’t think his ability to work with Democrats is a liability, saying “I’ve developed trust on both sides of the aisle, people trust me that what I say I’m going to do, I do.”

On Tuesday Enzi told reporters that he wouldn’t change his plans to run for a fourth term, but admitted to reporters that fundraising has “always been a problem for me.”

But he told Bash that people in Wyoming “complain about long campaigns. It doesn’t take them long to make up their mind. And it doesn’t cost a lot of money to have them make up their mind.”

Enzi appears to have the backing of the two other members of Wyoming’s congressional delegation.

“I think that Mike has done an excellent job representing the people of Wyoming and I’m going to continue to work to support Mike Enzi, Sen. John Barrasso told CNN on Wednesday.

“I have a great deal of respect for the entire Cheney family, for the vice president, for Liz and for Lynn, but I think it’s the wrong race at the wrong time,” he said.

Republican Rep. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming ripped Cheney’s decision as “bad form” and predicted she would lose in the GOP primary next year.

“I don’t know that anybody can out-conservative Mike Enzi,” Lummis told CNN Senior Congressional Producer Deirdre Walsh and other reporters outside the House chamber on Tuesday.

The congresswoman, Wyoming’s at-large representative, admitted Cheney had the upper hand in raising money, but said that wouldn’t matter.

“She will outraise him by factors of 10 or more, and he will still win because Wyoming is grassroots, retail campaigning,” she said.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee was quick to say it stands firmly behind Enzi, the GOP incumbent.

“Our mission is to re-elect our incumbents and build a Republican majority,” NRSC Communications Director Brad Dayspring told CNN.

Cheney, who chairs a nonprofit on national security and education called Keep America Safe, had been rumored this year to be considering a Senate run.

Early last week, former Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming told the New York Times that a potential Cheney primary challenge would bring about “the destruction of the Republican Party of Wyoming,” adding that, “It’s a disaster – a divisive, ugly situation – and all it does is open the door for the Democrats for 20 years.”

Simpson had a different message after Cheney’s announcement on Tuesday.

“I deeply care about them both,” he said, according to the Casper Star Tribune.

Cheney will come under attack for being a carpetbagger. She was born in Wisconsin and grew up in Virginia’s D.C. suburbs before attending college in Colorado and law school in Illinois. She spent most of her career working in the nation’s capital before moving to Wyoming last year.

Cheney touted her family’s longtime Wyoming roots in a speech in May and in her announcement Tuesday.

He highlighted that her family “first came here in 1852, in search of religious freedom,” adding that her grandmother “was raised in the Salt Creek oil field and grew up to become Natrona County’s first female deputy sheriff.”

Will the carpetbagger tag stick?

There have already been comparisons to Hillary Clinton. In 2000 the first lady, who grew up in Illinois and lived for many years in Arkansas, successfully ran for the U.S. Senate in New York, but faced the carpetbagger attacks.

“What did Hillary Clinton have? She had national name identification. She had a giant fundraising network, she had a bunch of people willing to work for her and willing to fight and she ran a very effective campaign and she won,” King recalled.

As for Cheney, he said, “She will have money. She has the name identification. Now the test is, since she’s new to politics, can she run a campaign. Can she convince the people of Wyoming that she’s right.”

We’re open with each other. We’re honest with each other,” said Boehner.

“Do you trust President Obama?” Raddatz asked.

“Absolutely,” Boehner replied.

“Absolutely?” Raddatz emphasized.

“Absolutely,” Boehner repeated.

Framing Republicans as out-of-touch radicals, Raddatz then asked, “President Obama says these meetings are intended to find members of the common-sense caucus who he can make a deal with …. Are you not a member of the common-sense caucus?”

Boehner, falling for the trap, shot back, “I’m part of the common-sense caucus. We appreciate the outreach. We appreciate the engagement from the president. But it’s gonna take more than this if we’re serious about solving our problems.”

Then Boehner dropped the bombshell. Raddatz, after quoting President Obama saying we don’t have “an immediate crisis in terms of debt,” asked Boehner for his thoughts. And Boehner eagerly agreed: “We do not have an immediate debt crisis. But we all know that we have one looming …. It could be a year or two years, three years, four years. It’s not an immediate problem.” And then Boehner said he agreed with Obama on the immediacy of the problem.

With Republicans fighting tooth and nail to implement solutions necessary to reducing the national debt, Boehner’s language certainly undermines the public relations narrative set by conservatives. A House GOP aide angrily told Breitbart News today, “This undercuts the fight House conservatives have waged since 2010. Our efforts to prevent a debt crisis we will certainly face should never be minimized.”

Bloomberg and Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York appears headed for a sharp left turn when voters select a new mayor in November.

“I’m a progressive,” said Bill de Blasio, the city’s public advocate and dominant front-runner in the mayoral campaign. “I believe in an activist role of government. I’ve been exceedingly clear that I borrow from the distant but still very pertinent examples of Franklin Roosevelt and [former mayor] Fiorello La Guardia. And I think it is time, especially at this moment in history, for activist, progressive government that will address the inequalities we are facing.”

The lanky de Blasio was digging into a bowl of penne pasta at a corner restaurant near his home in Brooklyn. It was a day after his first general election debate against Republican Joe Lhota, and the press reviews noted that the front-runner acted almost like the underdog, pounding his opponent rather than sitting on his lead. “In general I believe in an aggressive strategy,” he told me. “I’m not a rope-a-dope kind of guy.”

Not so many months ago, de Blasio was a distinct underdog in a four-way Democratic primary, overshadowed by City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, the early favorite, and Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman who decided to seek redemption by running for mayor.

In the end his rivals faded, and de Blasio won the primary without a runoff. Today, polls show him with a lead of roughly 40 points. If current trends hold, he would be headed toward one of the biggest victories in an open-seat race in the modern history of the city.

De Blasio’s campaign theme is “a tale of two cities.” He represents a clear departure from many of the policies of the Bloomberg administration, as well as the national Republican Party, to which he has sought to tie Lhota. He wants to sound an alarm about a city in which nearly half the population lives on incomes of 150 percent of the poverty level or less.

“I talk about a crisis of inequality because it’s not just about the cost of living,” he said. “It’s not just about the dumbing down of wages and benefits. It’s not just about the effects of the recession. It is all that plus continuing inequalities in education, continuing inequalities in health care, obviously deeper inequalities in policing that we experienced, say, a decade ago.”

De Blasio wants to raise income tax rates on the wealthy to pay for early childhood and after-school programs. He advocates more-generous paid sick leave for families. He has challenged the Bloomberg administration’s charter school policies, particularly the policy of allowing such schools to use city facilities rent-free. He was sharply critical of the city’s stop-and-frisk policy, a key element of its anti-crime efforts that was later declared unconstitutional by a federal judge.

“He is poised to be the most progressive big-city mayor in America,” said Howard Wolfson, deputy mayor under Bloomberg and someone who has known de Blasio for many years.

Giuliani and Bloomberg

New York is heavily Democratic. But for the past 20 years, voters have looked to politicians of other stripes to address problems that had become intolerable.

Giuliani, a Republican, tackled the city’s crime problem with relentless focus. Today, crime is not considered a major issue.

Bloomberg, a Republican-turned-independent, applied his management skills to the problems of local government and made the city more efficient, among other successes.

Bloomberg will leave office with net positive ratings, and yet de Blasio has run a successful campaign that has been both explicitly and implicitly critical of the incumbent. He said that the “sharp, sharp stories of people’s economic duress” persuaded him that there was a hunger for a change in direction.

De Blasio sees inequality as a national problem but says the federal government has defaulted on the problem. He blames Republicans in Congress for that. “You can’t wait on the cavalry to come from Washington,” he said. “It’s not coming anytime soon.”

If de Blasio becomes mayor, he will face potentially significant obstacles as he seeks to implement his campaign promises.

New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said last week that

he opposes the tax increase de Blasio is calling for to pay for his early childhood and after-school program.

Business leaders are wary of his expansive view of government and his tax policies.

Giuliani has called him anti-police.

School reformers dislike his charter schools policy.

“I think we’ve all been to this movie before,” de Blasio said of the resistance he faces. But he remains unapologetic about his views. “I think progressives can’t be looking over their shoulder,” he said. “If you look over your shoulder, you might as well declare defeat.”

Still, de Blasio is a politician. Even before the election, he has been spending time with groups wary of his agenda, seeking to explain why his policies are not as threatening to them as they think. “There’s a certain demystification I’m trying to achieve,” he said.

He said he also wants to explain to these audiences why it’s important to them that he address inequality as aggressively as he plans to do. “I think some of them have not given enough thought to what happens to society if more and more inequality grows and fewer and fewer people have opportunities,” he said. “My hope over time is that there will be a recognition that this is in everybody’s interest.”

Vision and leadership

De Blasio’s politics long have been rooted in the left.

In the 1980s he worked for a social justice organization that delivered food and medicine to Nicaragua during the war there. A profile of him in the New York Times called him “an ardent supporter of the Nicaraguan rebels.”

Later he turned to more conventional politics. He served as campaign manager for Hillary Rodham Clinton’s 2000 U.S. Senate campaign and spent eight years on the City Council before he was elected as public advocate.

That background, he said, has prepared him to be mayor.

Others, including his opponent, question whether he has the managerial experience needed to run an enterprise as large and complex as New York City. Lhota, who was a deputy mayor and budget director under Giuliani, asserted in last week’s debate that de Blasio was “untested” and unready to be mayor. “I can be mayor on day one without any training,” he said.

When I asked de Blasio about this, he talked about a lunch he had about two years ago with former mayor Ed Koch, who died earlier this year. De Blasio said he had sharply disagreed with some of Koch’s policies but admired what he had done on housing. He said he had sought out the Democrat for advice. “I tried to draw out of him how he went from junior liberal congressman to in many ways an extraordinarily effective CEO of New York City in very adverse times,” de Blasio said.

What did he learn? “He said it’s really about leadership,” de Blasio said. “It’s really about a vision of where you’re trying to go . . . and rally people around it. . . . To him it was something more human, more intrinsic, because he hadn’t run anything bigger than a congressional office. But he knew he had the human capacity. So in my own humble way, I feel the same way.”

If the polls hold, and there’s little to suggest they won’t, New York will soon be under new management. New Yorkers — and people around the country — will be paying close attention to the next chapter in the city’s history."

http://news.yahoo.com/booker-wins-nj-senate-seat-says-hes-scrapper-121828212--election.html,,[],"Booker wins NJ Senate seat, says he's 'a scrapper'","NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — U.S. senator-elect Cory Booker said Thursday he's ready to go to Washington and is not afraid if he ""breaks dishes"" trying to serve his constituents in New Jersey.

Booker, 44, the Democratic mayor of Newark, made the rounds on the morning talk shows a day after defeating Republican Steve Lonegan. His win came after an aggressive two-month race to finish the term of Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who died in office in June at age 89.

Booker said he wants to channel Americans' frustration with Congress into energy for change.

""I think everybody feels there's fatigue and frustration with how things are, which creates a great climate for change,"" Booker said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ''Often before you have great victory, you have to have great frustration.""

The mayor of New Jersey's largest city takes to Washington a national profile — boosted by a strong social media presence, frequent television appearances and his status as a surrogate for Barack Obama during the president's 2012 re-election campaign — just as the federal government begins functioning again after a 16-day shutdown.

He hasn't even started his job as senator, but he is already being asked if he wants to run for president.

""I would rule it out,"" he said on WNYW's ""Good Day New York."" ''I'm going into the Senate. If I break dishes on the way to try to serve the people of New Jersey, so be it.""

Booker called himself a ""scrapper"" and said he was able to change Newark despite people claiming its problems were intractable, which is what he said people are now saying about Congress.

""I find it eerily familiar with what people are saying to me now, because it was said 15 years ago in Newark,"" he said. ""The problems are too big.""

Booker had 55 percent of the vote to Lonegan's 44 percent. He brushed off criticism that the race was closer than many anticipated. Lonegan was backed by the tea party in a Democratic-leaning state.

""We did not worry. We put our plan in place and we worked our plan,"" Booker said. ""I feel very lifted by the people of the state of New Jersey.""

Story continues

Booker said he will likely be sworn in ""the next week, two weeks max."" The timing, he said, depends on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Vice President Joe Biden, who will likely swear Booker in.

Booker will be the first black senator from New Jersey and will arrive in Washington with an unusual political resume.

He was raised in suburban Harington Park as the son of two of the first black IBM executives, graduated from Stanford and law school at Yale with a stint in between as a Rhodes Scholar before moving to one of Newark's toughest neighborhoods with the intent of doing good.

He's been an unconventional politician, a vegetarian with a Twitter following of 1.4 million — or five times the population of the city he governs. With state funding dwindling, he has used private fundraising, including a $100 million pledge from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, to run programs in Newark, a strategy that has brought him both fame and criticism.

Former state Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa had been appointed by Christie to temporarily replace Lautenberg. The governor scheduled the special election for just 20 days before Christie himself is on the ballot seeking re-election. Democrats said Christie was afraid of appearing on the same ballot as the popular Booker, but courts upheld the election schedule.

Before Lautenberg died, Booker passed up a chance to run against Christie this year, saying he was eyeing Lautenberg's seat in 2014, in part so he could complete a full term as mayor — something he won't do now.

Delli Santi reported from Trenton, N.J. Associated Press reporters Geoff Mulvihill in Trenton and Bruce Shipkowski in Bridgewater, N.J., contributed to this report."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/us/politics/lessons-for-republicans-in-hazleton-pa.html,2013-04-01 00:00:00,['Trip Gabriel'],New Attitude on Immigration Skips an Old Pennsylvania Coal Town,"HAZLETON, Pa. — Before Arizona’s crackdown on illegal immigrants, before “self-deportation” became the Republican presidential platform in 2012, there was Hazleton.

This working-class city in the Poconos passed the country’s first law aimed at making life so difficult for illegal immigrants that they would pack up and leave.

Hazleton has faded from the national attention it drew with its Illegal Immigration Relief Act in 2006. But as Republicans in Congress advance plans to provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, the city presents a test case of whether the party risks leaving behind a critical part of its core constituency: white working-class voters for whom illegal immigration stirs visceral reactions.

A city of 25,000 on a mountain plateau, a former center of coal and rail, Hazleton evokes the white, ethnic Pennsylvania stronghold in “The Deer Hunter,” the 1978 Robert De Niro movie. Local officials and many non-Hispanic residents said last week that they did not accept the reasoning of Republican leaders in Washington, including some 2016 presidential hopefuls, that giving legal status to illegal immigrants was overdue and a political imperative if Republicans are to win more Hispanic voters."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/09/03/New-Political-Media-Establishment-Thinks-More-Conservatives-Not-Needed-for-Better-Campaign-Coverage,2013-09-03 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],Media/Political Establishment: More Conservatives Not Needed in Reporting,"Journalists and professional political tacticians in Washington’s permanent political class ecosystem apparently do not believe the mainstream media would be better served if they had more reporters who were familiar with conservative politics and voters.

After the 2012 presidential election, CNN reporter Peter Hamby interviewed over 70 “journalists and political tacticians” that make up a “who’s who” of the Washington permanent political class for ideas on new election beats and how presidential elections may better be covered. He published his findings in a paper for Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, titled, “Did Twitter Kill the Boys on the Bus? Searching for a better way to cover a campaign.”

The paper, by primarily examining Mitt Romney’s failed 2012 presidential campaign and the media coverage of it, extensively examines and lays out the new terrain on which modern political battles are contested. It looks at how the the “digital firehouse of information,” especially Twitter, “is being channeled by a new generation of campaign journalists, and how political decision makers are adjusting their tactics, because there is no turning back.”

On Monday, Politico’s Playbook picked out some of the reporters and tacticians quoted in Hamby’s paper and listed them in its morning e-mail, which has been likened to a camp newsletter:

David Axelrod, Stuart Stevens, Matt Rhoades, Eric Fehrnstrom, Adam Nagourney, John Harris, Dick Stevenson, Marcus Brauchli, Dan Balz, Jeff Zeleny, Jonathan Martin, Mo Elleithee, Phil Rucker, Garrett Haake, Tommy Vietor, Ben LaBolt, Lis Smith, Stephanie Cutter, Chuck Todd, Karen Hughes, Joe Klein, David Carr, Jon Ward, Tim Miller, Scott Conroy, Maggie Haberman, Reid Epstein, Nancy Gibbs, Sasha Issenberg, John Dickerson, Jim Acosta, John Berman, Rachel Streitfeld, Mike Murphy, Kevin Madden, Rick Gorka, Peter Alexander, Sarah Boxer, Will Ritter, Maeve Reston, Michael Feldman, Tim Pearson, Rob Lockwood, Ashley Parker, Kasie Hunt, Ryan Williams, Paul West, Michael Calderone, Zeke Miller, Ben Smith, Dave Weigel, Matt Viser, Chris Rowland, Liz Sidoti, Sam Youngman, Shushannah Walshe, Jeff Smith, Carl Cameron, Jake Suski, Robert Costa, Jackie Kucinich, Sara Murray, Jim Heath

As Hamby reported in his groundbreaking examination of Twitter’s importance in campaigns, Romney and Obama campaign officials during the 2012 race were in amazement that younger mainstream media reporters who were fluent in the medium were hardly so in politics. Obama and Romney officials told Hamby they were incredulous that reporters on the campaign could not recognize Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson.

Many of those Hamby interviewed for his research (listed above) would surely be familiar with Reed and Robertson, for they too are institutional figures. But they may be less familiar with shows conservatives watch like Duck Dynasty; churches they attend; politicians that influence them like Sarah Palin; the guns they like to shoot and need for self-protection; the books (Liberty and Tyranny, The Liberty Amendments) and websites they like to read; and the talk radio hosts (Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin) to whom they listen.

Hamby’s reporting about Reed and Robertson also underscores a broader problem with the mainstream media and those allowed into their ranks. Though the mainstream media often bemoan the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in America’s institutions–even though studies have shown they are guilty of the same–not much is said about the lack the ideological diversity in mainstream media organizations. Such diversity is needed to more critically report on politics and challenge and correct insular assumptions and stereotypes about conservatives.

While those reporters in question may not have known who Reed and Robertson were, it is safe to assume that there is a greater chance they would have known Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards and Jesse Jackson.

In February of 2013, Gallup found that conservatives make up a plurality of the country. Other surveys by Gallup and Pew in recent years have found the Republican party has gotten more conservative and Republicans want it to be even more so, something the mainstream press should consider as they attempt to fairly cover the 2016 GOP presidential primary. In the 2016 primary, Republicans may be pulled to the right as Democrats were pulled to the left during a 2008 primary in which the liberal base was as antagonistically opposed to President George W. Bush and his war in Iraq as conservatives are to Obama and his policies.

Some of the suggestions for better campaign coverage that were offered to Hamby are worth noting for serious consideration:

“voter contact”–studying how campaigns actually reach out to voters and the emerging science behind it.

“media tactics”– “As campaigns increasingly seek ways to make end-runs around the Washington media filter, reporters should track their activities in niche media platforms, on radio, on the web or in social networks,” Hamby writes. “Where, how and why? Is a campaign pushing their message in a popular video game, on Pandora radio, on the Big Ten Network? In the pages of Us Weekly or the Spanish-speaking press? What local TV stations are top targets for campaign advertising?”

“Downballot races”: Hamby suggests finding “a few contests in swing-y House or Senate districts on the state level– races that are barely covered anymore, even by local media, despite the colorful characters involved–and check in every few weeks.”

“Political science”: Hamby writes that reporters should pay attention to the academics that “are publishing smart, counterintuitive work or documenting trends that often go unnoticed in the press” instead of political scientists who seek to get quoted in every publication and mistake quantity for quality.

Others solutions included: “The money trail and the political industry,” which would study where the massive amount of money that is raised is actually spent and some of the shadier ways political influence is purchased; a focus on better reporting and interpreting polling; and a focus on “Political movements, new and old.” Hamby also suggested sending reporters to cover states–instead of specific candidates–to play “zone defense” like CNN did in 2008 in states like South Carolina, or hiring local reporters or bloggers in key primary states who know the terrain well.

Perhaps Hamby, who gained respect for being one of the few mainstream reporters who has covered Sarah Palin fairly, had a blind spot to some suggestions that were not being offered or assumed his fellow denizens in Washington’s political ecosystem understand and give conservatives a fair shake.

Consider what former Washington Post editor Marcus Brauchli told Hamby, though. Brauchli said that he did not think “the media did a terrific job of explaining Obama and his presidency”–and perhaps that was so because the same reporters that have difficulties understanding conservatives also are unable to critically report on Obama.

Ultimately, the suggestions Hamby puts forth for better campaign coverage may not be worth that much in the long run without reporters, producers, and editors who have the knowledge and life experiences to cover an electorate that greatly influences one party’s primary and makes up a plurality of the nation. The closest anyone came to touching upon this in the study was Sasha Issenberg of Slate, who observed that the New York Times did not have a gun-culture beat reporter.

At the very least, reporters should have a genuine curiosity that enables them to learn and challenge their assumptions about an electorate and parts of the country with which they may not be familiar–that is a trait the late David Broder, who is mentioned with reverence in Hamby’s report, had in spades."

And this makes things very tricky for Dems right now. They need to escalate the threat level in order to force Senate Republicans to drop their unprecedented opposition to Obama’s nominations. Currently they are expected to filibuster Obama’s pick as Labor Secretary and his choices to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Environmental Protection Agency, and they are threatening to oppose his three nominations for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. All of these are key to Obama’s ability to move his agenda forward. But the numbers are such that we simply can’t be sure whether Dems can make good on the threat to change the rules by hitting the nuke button. This could embolden Republican obstructionism further."
http://news.yahoo.com/ryan-says-gop-needs-pick-fights-obama-204420214--politics.html,,[],Ryan says GOP needs to pick its fights with Obama,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep. Paul Ryan has a message for fellow Republicans: Let's stick together and carefully pick our fights with President Barack Obama.

In a speech Saturday to conservatives, the Wisconsin congressman and 2012 vice presidential nominee outlined a pragmatic approach for dealing with a second Obama administration. Saying that Obama would attempt to divide Republicans, Ryan urged them to avoid internal squabbles.

""We can't get rattled. We won't play the villain in his morality plays. We have to stay united,"" Ryan said at the National Review Institute's weekend conference on the future of conservatism. ""We have to show that if given the chance, we can govern. We have better ideas.""

The GOP is reeling from back-to-back presidential defeats and trying to determine whether to oppose Obama at every turn or shape his proposals with conservative principles.

How the party rebounds was a major theme of the three-day meeting of conservative activists, a dominant voice in the GOP. A similar theme dominated the Republican National Committee's winter meeting, which ended Friday in Charlotte, N.C.

With a surging minority population altering the electorate, Republican leaders have discussed the need to attract more women and Hispanics while at the same time standing firm on the values that unite conservatives. Republicans said despite the losses, the party could return to power by projecting optimism and attracting new voters with a message of economic opportunity.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a star among conservatives after surviving a union-led campaign to recall him from office, said government needed ""brown-bag common sense,"" a reference to his frugal practice of packing his own lunch of ham-and-cheese sandwiches every day. Qualities like optimism, staying relevant to voters and showing courage in tackling big problems would be rewarded at the voting booth, he said.

""We've got to learn to be more optimistic. We've got to learn to give a viable alternative to the voters,"" Walker said.

Story continues

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said Republicans needed to use upcoming fights over the budget and the deficit as ""leverage points"" to tame long-term spending and debt. Projecting an upbeat outlook for the party, he said Obama's policies would drive many voters to Republicans just as many Americans turned to Ronald Reagan after the economic turmoil of the late 1970s.

""We're on the verge of a rebirth of conservativism,"" Cruz said.

Looking ahead, Ryan rejected the notion that Republicans were ""in the wilderness,"" noting that the party controls the House and most statehouses. But he said Obama's victory over Romney meant that Republicans would need to recalibrate their approach to deal with the new political realities.

""If we want to promote conservatism, we'll need to use every tool at our disposal,"" Ryan said. ""Sometimes, we will have to reject the president's proposals — that time may come more than once. And sometimes we'll have to make them better."" He said Republicans should have two main goals for the next four years, namely ""to mitigate bad policies"" and ""to advance good policy wherever we can.""

Ryan acknowledged that ""we all didn't see eye to eye"" on the recent ""fiscal cliff"" vote to deal with a combination of spending cuts and higher taxes that were set to take effect at the start of the year. He defended his support for the bill, saying it was the only way to avoid sweeping tax increases and prevent the economy from going into a free-fall.

As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Ryan said Republicans needed to guard against a debt crisis for the country that would undermine the economy. He said he would promote changes to Medicare and Medicaid and would propose a budget ""that will balance and pay down the debt.""

But November's election results still linger. Ryan said he was ""disappointed"" by the outcome, saying he was ""looking forward to taking on the big challenges"" while living at the vice president's residence. ""My kids were looking forward to having a pool,"" he joked.

C-Span ratings would go through the Capitol dome, giving Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s “Veep” a run for its money.

It was sweet justice for a man who was the victim of friendly fire from White House aides after he blurted out his support for gay marriage during the campaign while the president was still dithering, spurring Obama to do the right thing. From the beginning of their alliance in 2008, Biden felt passionately that he needed to interpret the dispassionate Obama for regular folk. It was an attitude that probably annoyed Obama, who does not like to feel dependent or beholden, having fought his way up in the world mostly under his own steam.

But when Obama let Biden take over the cliff talks, and when he noted with asperity that he would not debate Congress again over paying its bills, he dug into his revulsion at playing the game, his reluctance to even fake the flattering, schmoozing and ring-kissing needed to coax Congress into doing what he wants.

Even members of his own party have lost faith in his ability to use the White House as a social lubricant to get his agenda passed, or to use that big brain of his to become a more clever negotiator, rather than a scolding lecturer.

“His inability to engage the politicians here has been a real liability,” one Democratic lawmaker complained. It’s odd, given that he was renowned for making a group of egotists feel that they were being heeded at The Harvard Law Review.

The vice president was in the Senate for 36 years while the president merely breezed through. Obama radiates contempt at Congress for not being a bunch of high-minded, effective people, and for expecting him to clean up its mess. He thinks reasonable people should see things his way in a reasonable amount of time, and gets impatient when ideology, ego, identity politics and pork-project whining hold up progress.

Biden is a realist. He understands lawmakers’ limitations, motivations and needs. He leans right in and speaks — and speaks and speaks — their language. That’s who he is. And he believes, as creaky and unwieldy as the system is, that it still has integrity. More Rocky than Spocky, Biden can spread everything out on the table and negotiate his way through all of his former colleagues’ shortcomings, weaknesses, fears and frailties."

President Barack Obama was sworn in for his second term at a White House ceremony on Sunday. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office. (The Washington Post)

President Obama’s historic election in 2008 and his reelection last year proved decisively that race is no longer an insurmountable hurdle to high political office in the United States.

But the current pool of possible candidates suggests that the next black president will not be taking the oath of office anytime soon.

“In the shadow of Barack Obama, there’s not been a lot of growth,” Cornell Belcher, a pollster who was involved in the president’s 2008 campaign, said. “It is really hard for minorities to get elected at the statewide level, and before you start talking about president, frankly, you have to get elected to statewide office.”

The notion of a post-Obama reformation of black politics has not been borne out at the ballot box, as black politicians continue to struggle to win the statewide offices that are the traditional paths to the presidency.

While the election of the first black president marked a significant break from the country’s history of racial prejudice, race still matters: The vast majority of black elected officials are put into office by black voters. Even Obama needed large numbers of black and Latino votes to win, particularly last year, when a majority of whites voters voted for someone else.

Ashley Bell, a former county official in Georgia who switched from the Democratic to the Republican Party with an eye on a future run for statewide office, said that Obama “did convince a lot of young black politicians that they can aspire to crossover offices. We may not live in a post-racial America, but I think we do live in a new era of politics where, on either side of the aisle, everyone knows that a good political candidate is one with crossover appeal, be they white or black or Latino.”

While the country’s changing demographics will favor political leaders of color in the future, the current landscape remains challenging for minority candidates seeking statewide office, particularly governorships and U.S. Senate seats, the typical steppingstones to presidential bids.

Deval L. Patrick (D-Mass.) currently is the nation’s only black governor, and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) is the only black member of the Senate, having recently been appointed to fill a vacancy.

Patrick, 56, is often mentioned as a potential presidential candidate, but he has said he has no plans to run in 2016. No other black politicians’ names have come up on the short list of credible contenders for the next national election.

On the GOP side of the aisle, former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice has been mentioned as a possible candidate but has steadfastly denied any interest. Colin Powell, who preceded Rice as President George W. Bush’s secretary of state, was once a favored GOP prospect, but he also declined to run.

Most recently, Herman Cain, a black Georgia businessman, was briefly a hit among Republican grass-roots activists in the run-up to the primaries, but he dropped his candidacy after a woman revealed a longtime extramarital affair and other women accused him of sexual harassment.

Obama’s political trajectory was extraordinary for any political figure. He rocketed to the top tier of national politics after a stirring speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, where he used his personal story and oratorical skills to call for uniting a country long divided by race and partisan politics. His election that year to the Senate was helped by the implosion of his strongest opponents in the primary and general elections.

Obama was the third African American to be elected to the Senate since Reconstruction when he won the seat from Illinois seat in 2004; Patrick is only the second black governor elected since that period.

Black politicians seeking to build cross-racial coalitions must make sure they don’t alienate black voters with their appeals to white and others. Former Washington mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), whose name was often included in the list of black political leaders who, like Obama, crossed the old lines of racial politics, lost his bid for a second term after African American voters deemed him more concerned with pleasing the city’s growing white professional class.

Newark Mayor Cory Booker (D), whose name is still on the A-list of nouveau black pols, struggled to overcome the skepticism of African American voters in his first, unsuccessful mayoral campaign.

Booker, a Rhodes Scholar who grew up in Harrington Park, N.J., an upscale suburb of Newark, lost in 2002 to longtime former mayor Sharpe James (D), who said Booker was “not black enough.”

The 43-year-old Booker, now in his second term as mayor, filed papers this month to form a campaign committee for a Senate run in 2014. He also is mentioned as a potential future presidential candidate. Booker’s office did not make him available for an interview.

Scott’s performance in South Carolina’s 2014 Senate race, if he decides to seek a full term, will add to the debate about how much racial politics have changed. Black residents make up 28 percent of South Carolina’s population and are solidly Democratic. The state’s Republican governor, Nikki Haley, is Indian American, and both she and the 48-year-old Scott launched their political careers in predominantly white districts.

Artur Davis, a former House member from Alabama, worked hard to present himself as a crossover candidate when he set out to become the first black governor of his state.

But he turned off black voters by distancing himself from Obama and Alabama’s black leadership and, failing to pick up significant white support, made a surprisingly poor showing in the Democratic primary.

Davis, who has since joined the Republican Party and moved to Northern Virginia, acknowledged the challenge faced by black politicians striving to break barriers. But he said that each contest is unique.

“Political breakthroughs depend more on the circumstance of one person than some magic alchemy of timing,” Davis wrote in an e-mail. “If a black with sufficient political skills, a fundraising base, and a record that appeals to the voters in his or her party emerges, that person will be taken seriously in a way that would not have been possible for my parents’ generation.”

Davis predicted that “within the Democratic Party, the internal pressure to nominate a white female will be far greater than any impetus to elevate a Deval Patrick or Cory Booker in the near future.”

A Hispanic might also have a better shot at the White House before another African American. There are five Hispanic governors and senators, most of them Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who at 41 is being touted as presidential timber.

Many post-civil rights and Generation X black political leaders have demonstrated the political and cultural dexterity to move up to statewide office, sometimes in states that have very small black populations, such as Colorado, where 4.3 percent of the residents are black.

Two years ago, Kamala Harris, who is of African-American and Indian-American descent, was elected attorney general of California, a first in a statewide race. Blacks make up only 6.6 percent of state’s population. She is often talked about as a future gubernatorial candidate.

But in Alabama, where black residents make up 26.5 percent of the population, Davis lost his primary for governor in 2010. Similarly, Thurbert Baker lost in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in Georgia, where nearly a third of the residents are black. Baker had been elected state attorney general three times.

For those who manage to win their party’s nominations, general elections have proven to be be extreme long shots.

Johnny DuPree won the Mississippi Democratic primary for governor in 2011, the first African American to do so in recent history. DuPree, 59, the first black mayor of Hattiesburg, lost to his Republican opponent in the general election by 20 percentage points.

Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, said black candidates in the South, most of who are Democrats, are disadvantaged as much by their party as by their race.

“Georgia and Alabama don’t have any Democrats in statewide office. None,” said Bullock said. “If you’re running statewide and you’re a Democrat, regardless of your ethnicity or your gender, you’re going to lose.”

More than half of the country’s African Americans live in the South, and continued demographic changes could upend its politics over the next two decades. Several states are projected to have populations mostly comprised of people of color.

Already there are signs. Bullock said that in 1996, whites cast 78 percent of all votes; in 2008, the percentage was down to 64 percent.

Bullock said voter rolls show that whites made up less than 60 percent of registered voters in Georgia last year.

Those nonwhite voters will most likely back Democrats, Bullock said. “Unless the Republicans come up with a broader, more encompassing message, all they will succeed in getting is white voters, but they will ultimately run out of white voters.”

“The demographics are changing in favor of minority candidates,” said Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research Center. In addition to population growth among Latinos and Asians, Kohut pointed to a generational change in attitudes about race.

“It’s simple: Generational demographics really favor minority candidates,” he said."

Paul spent nearly 13 hours on the Senate floor

Kentucky senator says his opposition was to drone policy%2C not Brennan

Harry Reid said a vote to approve Brennan would happen Thursday

WASHINGTON — After nearly 13 hours on the Senate floor, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., ended his filibuster blocking Senate confirmation of John Brennan, President Obama's pick for director of the CIA.

""I'm going to speak as long as I can to draw attention to something I find very disturbing,"" Paul said when he started speaking around 11:45 a.m. Wednesday morning. He finally ceded the floor at about 12:40 a.m. local time on Thursday.

But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, also a Kentucky Republican, said he would continue to oppose Brennan's confirmation and ending debate on it.

What started in the morning as a solo effort turned into a multi-senator debate that included one Democrat, Ron Wyden of Oregon, and at least seven Republicans questioning the constitutionality of drone strikes on U.S. citizens at home and abroad.

In a show of support, several of Paul's colleagues who share his conservative views came to the floor to take turns speaking for him and trading questions. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, read Twitter messages from people eager to ""Stand With Rand."" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., made references to rappers Jay-Z and Wiz Khalifa.

""No American should be killed by a drone on American soil without first being charged with a crime, without first being found guilty of a crime by a court,"" Paul said. ""How can you kill someone without going to a judge, or a jury?""

Paul, a critic of Obama's unmanned drone policy, started his self-described filibuster by demanding the president or Attorney General Eric Holder issue a statement assuring that unmanned aircraft would not be used in the United States to kill terrorism suspects who are U.S. citizens.

Paul said that his opposition was not about Brennan himself, but the constitutional issues involved. ""We really just want [Obama] to say he won't"" attack noncombatants on U.S. soil.

The federal government has not conducted such operations and doesn't plan to, Attorney General Eric Holder told Paul in a March 4 letter. But, Holder added, it was possible President Obama could be forced by an ""extraordinary circumstance"" to kill citizens inside the United States, and he cited the Pearl Harbor and 9/11 attacks as examples.

During his filibuster, Paul said the fuzziness of such language created a slippery slope that could lead to the targeting of citizens who merely have different opinions about policies than the president.

""You can't be judge, jury and executioner all in one,"" Paul said.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., took the floor around 4:30 p.m. to say any vote to end debate on Brennan's nomination or to approve him as CIA director would happen Thursday.

Wyden, a longtime critic of excessive government intelligence and surveillance programs, said ""the senator from Kentucky has made a number of important points.""

There are times, Wyden said, when a U.S. citizen who takes up arms against the United States while overseas can be attacked by a drone. But the executive branch of government, he said, should not be allowed to ""conduct such a far-reaching policy without scrutiny.""

It's not a partisan issue, Paul said, noting that he voted to support the nominations of John Kerry and Chuck Hagel, the secretaries of State and Defense.

Paul and other senators had delayed a full Senate vote on Brennan's nomination until they received more information about the drone program. The White House provided Justice Department documents on the drone program to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday.

The committee then voted 12-3 to approve Brennan's nomination.

Brennan, the White House's top counterterrorism adviser, was closely linked to the drone program. The administration has used the unmanned aircraft to regularly target suspected terrorists in the Middle East and Africa.

In 2011, U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was killed by a drone strike in Yemen, raising questions about the use of the armed drones on American citizens.

Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina had used Brennan's nomination to air concerns about the administration's handling of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador.

McCain and Graham said they would oppose Brennan unless they got classified documents detailing the administration's actions immediately following the attack, the Associated Press reported.

The White House has said it provided more documents to lawmakers about that attack.

Before coming to the White House, Brennan served 25 years in the CIA.

""I have not received the letter,"" McCain told CNN Thursday morning. ""They sent the letter to Sen. Levin. It was Sen Graham and I and Ayotte that asked for an answer. We haven't received an answer."" In the interview, he said the letter's delay was a chief reason he was holding up a vote on Hagel's nomination. ""I have to receive a letter, I have to receive a letter, see whether I receive a letter or not, and there are other questions that other senators have raised which are not answered as well,"" McCain told CNN.

So McCain said he was upset that Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) had received a letter with answers to his questions, but that he hadn't received it. Fair enough, except the thing is, McCain actually had received the letter—the very same letter that had been sent to Sen. Levin. The only catch: McCain had been cc'd.

The White House responded to McCain's concern by sending the exact same letter it had already sent to him, but this time it put him on the ""To:"" line and cc'd Levin. Problem solved, right? Sure, except by Thursday afternoon McCain had decided the reason Republicans were filibustering Hagel is that they are bitter about him saying they were wrong to support George W. Bush and Iraq.

This is all a dark comedy, really. Actually, more like a tragedy, because all this nonsense could have been avoided if a handful of Democrats hadn't killed filibuster reform last month. That's a mistake they can fix, however. Please sign the petition to tell Harry Reid: Re-open filibuster reform in light of continued Republican obstructionism."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/us/politics/texans-stick-with-cruz-despite-defeat-in-washington.html,2013-10-19 00:00:00,['Manny Fernandez'],Texans Stick With Cruz Despite Defeat in Washington,"Mr. Cruz, for one, said his Texas support has been uplifting. “The many supportive letters, e-mails, calls and social media comments we’ve received from Texans since Labor Day have been inspirational,” he said in a statement. “Hearing from constituents keeps me focused on the concerns of the people I work for and the issues I ran on. That’s what matters.”

Of course, not everyone is applauding, particularly Democrats in Texas, where Republicans control both houses of the Legislature.

“I just kind of shake my head and say, ‘I don’t believe this guy is for real,’ ” said State Senator John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat. “Many individuals in his own party say he has helped the Democrats. I’m more concerned about what he’s done to the country than the good he’s done to any Democratic effort.”

Moderate and establishment Republicans in Texas privately grumble about Mr. Cruz and his handling of the budget fight. They criticize the wisdom of forcing a government shutdown over a health care law that the Supreme Court validated, and wondered how much of Mr. Cruz’s battle was done to benefit his presidential aspirations.

“I grit my teeth and bear it,” said a prominent Texas Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he said he wanted to avoid an intraparty fight. “I really hope he implodes sooner rather than later.”

One of the few public displays of any Texas backlash came in an editorial on Wednesday in The Houston Chronicle. Headlined “Missing Kay,” the editorial criticized Mr. Cruz, whom the paper endorsed last year, for being “part of the problem in specific situations where Hutchison would have been part of the solution.” But even that criticism was muted. When news outlets reported that The Chronicle had “unendorsed” Mr. Cruz, the paper’s editors clarified that they did not pull their endorsement, but were evaluating the work of elected officials in an “active, ongoing process.”

The doubts from Texas Republicans invariably play out behind closed doors. They do not fear Mr. Cruz’s personal wrath, but that of his supporters and the possibility of a primary fight if they criticize him. Mr. Cruz won his Senate seat by defeating one of the most powerful Republicans in Texas, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a victory that exposed the ideological split between moderate establishment Republicans and the younger, more aggressive and conservative movement of grass-roots activists and Tea Party supporters."

As a leader in the National Lawyers Guild, Kurland was tireless in defending the civil and political rights of New Yorkers and earned a respect in all the circles she traveled in - labor, lgbt, civil rights, healthcare, neighborhood activists, and the legal community.

Two communities she failed to impress include real estate and Wall St. So no one was surprised with Corey Johnson, a hollow candidate if there ever was one, entered the race with Christine Quinn's blessing. Reading his resume you might be impressed with his public track record of activism. One thing stands out though: no mention of how he earns a living.

It's easy to understand why. As CityCouncilWatch.net reports""



What it turns out he is covering up and scrubbing from his Internet presence is his work as Director of Governmental Relations and Community Affairs for GFI Development Company, beginning in July 2008. GFI Development is the real estate development branch of GFI Group, which according to the company website “has been at the forefront of credit derivative brokerage services, leadership that we are now leveraging to help establish an active, liquid Exotic Credit Derivative market.” Exotic credit derivatives, for those among us with short memories, are those quaint financial instruments that enable banks to make massive bets on the failure of loans, without having to actually own any of the underlying debt. Credit derivatives caused a minor kerfuffle in the markets in late 2008. GFI Group “handled as much as 40 percent of the credit-derivatives trades between the world's banks in 2007,” according to Bloomberg. Well, Corey Johnson had nothing to do with any of that, of course…he worked for the real estate development arm of GFI. And real estate development firms are wholesome, salubrious entities. Which must be why after I asked Johnson’s campaign manger about his work there, his speaker bio at the Gay Center website was scrubbed. (Compare here and here.) And his LinkedIn profile was closed.

To recap, not only is Kurland a fantastic candidate worthy of our support, but she's running against the recession era caricature of pure, unadulterated evil: a real estate lobbyist in Manhattan working for the leader in the 'exotic derivatives' industry. A starker choice could not be made.

Visit Yetta Kurland for Council.



Full disclosure: I don't live in Kurland's district but I love her. She got me out of jail when I was arrested for operating the Illuminator. She shows up at political events across the city and across issues. And she's a warm, authentic human being who puts the professional political class to shame."

Sen. John McCain said in an interview published Wednesday in the New Republic that if the 2016 White House race boils down to Hillary Clinton vs. Rand Paul, he would face a “tough choice.”

In the wide-ranging question-and-answer session, McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, fiercely defended his choice of Sarah Palin to be his running mate, affirmed that President Barack Obama has grown in office, and criticized the Pentagon’s obvious reluctance to get more involved in Syria’s civil war.

So who would he vote for in 2016 if it came down to Kentucky’s junior Republican senator and the Democratic former secretary of state?

“It’s gonna be a tough choice,” McCain told the magazine with a laugh.

“Let me just clarify that,” McCain added quickly. “I think that Rand Paul represents a segment of the GOP, just like his father. And I think he is trying to expand that, intelligently, to make it larger.”

McCain — a foreign policy hawk who favors an assertive American role in world affairs — has clashed openly with the younger Paul, who warns against military intervention and has sharply criticized the national security state.

The Arizona Republican, who sits on the Senate’s Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, has frequently been sharply at odds with Obama on international affairs. So he does he think Clinton did as secretary of state?

“I think she did a fine job. She’s a rock star. She has, maybe not glamour, but certainly the aura of someone widely regarded throughout the world,” McCain said.

“I do think it is interesting that the issues where (Secretary of State) John Kerry is engaging is where Hillary Clinton did not engage in, that those decisions were left to the White House and the National Security Council,” he added, implicitly laying first-term foreign policy setbacks at the feet of the White House.

What about Palin? Does it bother him that the decision to pick her as his running mate in 2008 will weigh on his legacy?

Story continues

""No, because I think historians will decide that facts are stubborn things,"" McCain replied, saying that his campaign got a boost in the polls and that the former Alaska governor ""held her own"" against then-Sen. Joe Biden.

""She did everything I ever wanted. She excited our base in a way I was unable to achieve,"" McCain said. ""Not only do I not regret it, but I have probably not seen anyone in American life savaged like she was, particularly by the liberal left.""

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/06/16/1216376/-About-Jan-Brewer,2013-06-16 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",About Jan Brewer...,"Let's be clear, Jan Brewer is not an idiot. She may have been the rising star and darling of the far right of the Arizona Republican Party, but she's not a Black Helicopter Republican. Consider the gold coin bill. This pile of arble-garble had two reasons behind it. There was the reason that the national press got - the need to give opportunities to gold savers to spend their gold (which defeats the purposes of gold saving). Then there was the actual reason that circulated on the ground. OBAMA was going to spend so much money that the dollar was just going to continue inflating so much it would be useless, and Arizona needed to be prepared! Prepared, I say!!

Nevermind that the facts dictate that neither inflation nor federal spending have exactly been rocketing into the sun, they know.

The Black Helicopter Caucus has given us the Agenda 21 ban, forced oaths of loyalty, a pee bill (not joking, and neither were they), and defended your right to hate. Granted, this has provided Arizona with some excellent political entertainment. But walk through the Governor's signatures of these bills. The Agenda 21 ban? Signed. Pee bill? Killed in the House (due to global outrage turning it completely toxic, thanks everybody). The gold coin bill? Vetoed for technical reasons. But what Jan Brewer cares about is Jan Brewer. That lovely religious anarchy bill? She wrote in a letter that she regretted vetoing it, but she shot that hostage (and four more) dead to get AHCCCS expansion.

Now, to someone who has lived here for years, I feel the need to inform all of you who have not of a simple truth. Arizona is not normal. I do not mean ""weird"" the way most out of state folk mean it. I do not mean crazy. I mean there's the way the rest of the South runs, then there's how the South runs, and then there's Arizona. Arizonans like the political theater. We're the state that produced both Sinema and McCain, both Brewer and Grijalva. We expect them to be colorful, energetic, full of ideas and brilliant speeches, and if they are anything less, we tend to just stay home and let the other guy win.

Now, in terms of colorful, Jan Brewer is a damn rainbow. The electoral issue for her is to whom her colors appeal. Arizona's demographics are shifting at a breathtaking pace. The state is rapidly turning younger and browner, the electorate is moving steadily leftward on high-visibility issues. Now, were Jan Brewer running for governor again, she'd've taken the Medicaid money and not moved on immigratiion. But Brewer can't run for Governor, she's term limited. She can, however, run for McCain's seat in 2016.

Consider McCain's behavior. He's back to work on his legacy issue - immigration. On immigration, he reality checked his own party. On drones he all but body checked Rand Paul. He's monkeying in Syria, rumored to be scuttling Russian-American talks on the subject. McCain is spending political capital like a sailor spends cash, which only makes sense for one reason: he's getting done. McCain will be 80 when his term ends. Generic old at this age usually raises the r-word, but lest we forget, the man valiantly served his country under what can only be described as the most harrowing of circumstances, and carries the physical scars that go with it. I may not always agree with his politics, but he's generally proved himself to be an upright man whose convictions are real. He's earned the right to shore up his reputation, settle some old scores, and live out his days in well-earned peace on his Cornville ranch. That said, in my opinion, all signs point to Brewer burnishing her legacy in the hopes that in 2016 she'll be remembered more for Medicaid expansion than for SB1070, for denying DREAMers their licenses, for selling the Capitol, and on and on the list goes. The reason is simple - she is gambling that by the 2016 Senate race, if she can run as the Governor that worked across the aisle, she can force the Democrat to run negative against her, and Democrats do not win when we run negative.

There's only one catch. This strategy relies on collective amnesia. We would do well to let that stop being a feature of the American electorate. She's no less extreme and calculating a politician after Medicaid than before it, and the media, especially the liberal media, should remember all of her tenure, from 2009 to 2014, not from January til now. So America, do Arizona a favor - stop white-washing Jan Brewer. She doesn't deserve it."

With 95% of precincts reporting, Booker was leading Republican opponent Steve Lonegan, 55% to 44%. The seat had long been held by Democrat Frank R. Lautenberg, who died in June.

Booker will be one of two African Americans serving in the U.S. Senate, joining Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina.

Booker spoke optimistically during a victory speech at the Prudential Center in Newark, thanking supporters for coming out to vote on a Wednesday in October at a time when many Americans are fed up with politics.

“Despite the cynicism and the negativity we often see on TV, despite a special election, New Jerseyans, hundreds of thousands, rejected all that and came out and voted,” he said. “But more than that, you didn’t just vote, but you believed that your voice and your vote mattered.”

Though Booker won, his margin of victory was smaller than some polls had predicted.

That’s partly because he didn’t engage enough with voters and spent weeks away from the state raising money elsewhere, said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.

That allowed Lonegan to raise an oft-repeated criticism of Booker: that he’s more concerned with his national reputation than with local voters.

“The margin could have been wider, but people really weren’t enthusiastic about Cory Booker, so they stayed home,” Murray said.

But Booker successfully argued that Lonegan’s tea party views were out of step with the state, which has not elected a Republican to the Senate since 1972.

The special election, oddly timed three weeks before another election in New Jersey, had the lowest turnout of any election for a statewide seat in the last century, Murray said.

Booker tried in the days leading up to the election to use the federal government shutdown to cast himself as a moderate who is willing to compromise. He was best known before this election as a mayor with famous friends -- such as Oprah Winfrey -- who went from Stanford to Oxford and back to the inner city.

Lonegan, a legally blind former mayor of Bogota, N.J., has not shied from his conservative positions. He spoke repeatedly about his support for the government shutdown and his opposition to the Affordable Care Act.

He was the state director for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group founded by the Koch brothers, and held a rally last weekend with Sarah Palin and the Tea Party Express.

He said he planned to return to the private sector after the election.

“Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the message we delivered together ... did not win the day,” he said to supporters in Bridgewater, N.J., according to the Associated Press.

Democrats have an advantage in statewide voter registration: One-third of voters are registered Democrats and 20% are Republicans. But pollsters said in preelection surveys that the election’s odd timing made predictions of voter turnout difficult.

Republicans may have fared better with a more moderate candidate, but Republican Gov. Chris Christie blocked anyone else from running, wanting GOP support focused on his reelection effort next month, Murray said.

“A lot of Democrats may decide to vote for Cory Booker and sit out on the losing gubernatorial campaign,” he said.

Booker will have to run again next year to defend his seat. Though party leaders will probably push the charismatic Booker to become a face of the Democratic Party, he’ll need to work hard to keep voters happy at home too, said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University.

“He’s going to have to keep his head down, do a lot of constituent service and build up more trust,” Dworkin said. “I don’t think we’ll necessarily see him gallivanting around the country.”

113th Congress convened Thursday

Democrats retained control of the Senate, Republicans the House following the 2012 election

New Congress will face ongoing battles over the nation's debt

WASHINGTON--House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, was re-elected to a second two-year term to lead a polarized Congress, which convened for the 113th session on Thursday. Debates on deficit reduction, immigration, and gun laws are on the agenda.

For Boehner, leadership challenges also await. He begins the new Congress on a weakened note after failing to deliver a majority of Republicans in support of a bipartisan deal to avert the fiscal cliff of tax hikes and spending cuts, which passed on the strength of House Democrats' support.

He also came under fire this week from Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., for delaying action on federal aid for storm victims in the Northeast.

His re-election was never in doubt, but rank-and-file frustration spilled out on the House floor during the roll call vote to elect the speaker, which is the first order of business in a new Congress. Nine Republicans voted for someone other than Boehner, and one lawmaker, Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, voted present. Of the nine who voted against Boehner, three voted for his top deputy, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va. Two freshman lawmakers who won in the 2010 Tea Party wave, Reps. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina and Raul Labrador of Idaho, did not vote despite being present.

Boehner was re-elected with 220 votes, while Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., received 192. Pelosi did not receive the support of a half dozen Democrats.

In a speech before the House, Boehner sought an inspirational tone for the new session. ""For those who are returning, who have walked these aisles before, maybe it's time we feel awestruck again,"" he said, calling the the 113th Congress ""a time to rise"" and cautioned lawmakers against putting politics ahead of the country. ""So if you have come here to see your name in lights or to pass off political victory as accomplishment, you have come to the wrong place. The door is behind you,"" he said.

In her remarks, Pelosi called on Congress to address immigration reform and gun laws, invoking the shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

The Senate was also sworn in Thursday, ushering in a historic level of women, 20, serving in the chamber and the first black senator from the South since Reconstruction, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. He is the only African American in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., will continue to lead the chamber.

Vice President Biden swore in the 12 new members elected in November. Opening day draws scores of former lawmakers back to Capitol Hill. Looking on from the Senate gallery was former senator and vice president Walter Mondale from Minnesota. Defeated GOP senator Richard Lugar and retired Democratic senator Evan Bayh appeared alongside newly elected home state Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, a Democrat. Former Ohio Democratic senator John Glenn appeared with newly reelected Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.

Shortly before the session, Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., who had been absent for the past year while recovering from a stroke, slowly walked up the 45 steps to the Senate, with Biden nearby and the Senate leaders at the top of the stairs to greet him.

""A courageous man,"" Reid said. Members of the Illinois congressional delegation and senators stood on the steps.

As he entered the building, resting on a cane, Biden and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., helped Kirk take off his coat. The senator said he was glad to be back.

The traditions come against the backdrop of a divided Congress that is on a collision course with President Obama over upcoming budget fights to extend the $16.4 trillion debt ceiling and fund the federal government.

A deal to avert the ""fiscal cliff"" of big tax increases and spending cuts split the parties in New Year's Day votes, and the House's failure to vote on a Superstorm Sandy aid package before adjournment prompted GOP recriminations against the leadership.

""There's a lot of hangover obviously from the last few weeks of this session into the new one, which always makes a fresh start a lot harder,"" said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas.

Followng the 2012 elections, Democrats tightened their grip on the Senate for a 55-45 edge in the new Congress, while Republicans maintained their majority in the House but will have a smaller advantage, 233-200. There are two vacancies.

The new Congress still faces the ideological disputes that plagued the dysfunctional 112th Congress, one of the least productive and most unpopular in more than 60 years. Tea Party members within the Republican ranks insist on fiscal discipline in the face of growing deficits and have pressed for deep cuts in spending as part of a reduced role for the federal government. Democrats envision a government with enough resources to help the less fortunate and press for the wealthiest to pay more in taxes.

""We can only hope for more help,"" said Manchin, who was re-elected in November. ""Any time you have new members arriving you have that expectation of bringing fresh ideas and kind of a vitality that is needed. We hope that they're coming eager to work hard and make some difficult decisions and put the country first and not be bogged down ideologically.""

At least one longtime Democrat, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, will be departing in a few weeks, nominated by Obama to be secretary of State. That opens the door to former Republican senator Scott Brown, the only incumbent senator to lose in November's elections, to possibly make a bid to return to Washington.

Eighty-two freshmen join the House — 47 Democrats and 35 Republicans.

In the Senate, the Associated Press reported that Reid and Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are negotiating possible changes in the rules as lawmakers face a bitter partisan fight over filibusters, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about private matters.

Reid has complained that Republicans filibuster too often and has threatened to impose strict limits with a simple majority vote. That step could set off retaliatory delays and other maneuvers by Republicans, who argue that they filibuster because Reid often blocks them from offering amendments.

The aide said Reid was preserving the option of making changes with a simple majority vote.

• IA-Sen: Man. This is some seriously bottom-of-the-barrel business. I hadn't even heard of West Des Moines Mayor Steve Gaer, who is just the latest Republican to decline a Senate bid, but I'm more amused at the roster of other potential candidates found at the link. Apparently, some mystery list of 13 GOP names ""surfaced"" recently, and Gaer's was on it, but so is that of one Kevin O'Brien, who is described as an ""owner and operator of nine McDonald's stores, including one in Iowa City."" And the rest of the bunch aren't really much more notable than that.

• MA-Sen: Rep. Ed Markey has released his first negative ad of the campaign, a spot that lacerates Republican Gabriel Gomez on guns. In particular, it features footage of Gomez saying he opposes both an assault weapons ban and a ban on high-capacity magazines, which the narrator compares to ""the ones used in the Newtown school shooting."" Gomez doesn't come off looking good in those clips, particularly since both bans register over 60 percent support nationally (and likely higher in Massachusetts). That probably explains his histrionic response, in which he outlandishly claims Markey ""blames me for the horrific Newtown shooting."" When you're attacking your opponent for politicizing something, it usually means you're on the losing end of the issue.

There's no word on the size of Markey's buy, but we do have a new FEC report showing sizable spending on his behalf by the SEIU. The union is shelling out $340,000 on canvassing efforts, the first independent expenditure by any group since the April 30 primary. Gomez has pointedly refused to sign the so-called people's pledge to bar outside advertising, so conceivably we could start to see third-party ads here. But Markey seems to prefer beating Gomez up for not taking the pledge, and by focusing their money on canvassing (which would be permitted even with the pledge), SEIU allows Markey to maintain the high ground while still helping him.

• NC-Sen: Jim Cain, an ambassador to Denmark under George W. Bush, says he's considering a run against Dem Sen. Kay Hagan next year. Also of note in Kyle Trygstad's piece is that Rep. Virginia Foxx is supposedly taking a look at the race, according to unnamed ""sources."" I have to think her particular brand of crazy would contrast nicely in a general election.

• SD-Sen: Proving that you can never be conservative enough for the nutters, the Club for Growth's communications director took to Twitter on Friday to slam GOP Rep. Kristi Noem, who has often been held out as a purer alternative to ex-Gov. Mike Rounds in South Dakota's open seat Senate race. But nope, Noem isn't good enough. The Club says she's ""no fiscal conservative or darling of Tea Party"" and adds that she sports ""a very bad 62 percent on CFG Scorecard."" This is actually somewhat discouraging for Democrats who still held out hope that a nasty Republican primary would give us a better shot at holding this seat next year. If the Club doesn't want to help Noem, that makes it all the less likely that she'd want to get in the race.

Gubernatorial:

• CO-Gov: In a pretty stark about-face, Republican Secretary of State Scott Gessler now says he's considering a bid against Gov. John Hickenlooper, even though he declared months ago that he'd seek re-election instead. It's not at all clear what's changed in Gessler's thinking, and as Kurtis Lee at the Denver Post notes, his conservative activism as secretary of state could prove to be a real turnoff in a higher-scrutiny race. However, if he does run, it would open up his current job, giving Dems a good chance at winning back the SoS post.

• RI-Gov: He gets credit for sticking to his timetable: In late December, Republican Brendan Doherty said he was considering a bid for governor and would decide in four or five months. Five months later, he has indeed decided, and not too surprisingly, it's a no. Doherty, a former state police chief, ran for Congress last year against in RI-01; though the seat is ocean blue, Rep. David Cicilline's personal troubles made it look like Doherty was poised for an upset, but he wound up falling far short.

A January PPP poll did show Doherty with narrow leads in some three-way matchups, assuming independent Gov. Lincoln Chafee were to run again, but there's no guarantee he will. Republicans very likely need him to in order to have a chance, though, because in direct pairings with Democrats, they fared much worse, Doherty included. But it would still be a bank shot even if the unpopular Chafee does try to seek another term, just given Rhode Island's strong Democratic lean, so it makes sense that Doherty would rather not try.

House:

• MA-07: Local analyst David Bernstein, ensconced in his new gig at Boston Magazine, takes a look at possible Democratic candidates who could seek to replace Rep. Mike Capuano, assuming Capuano runs for governor (which Bernstein thinks he will). Bernstein names Boston City Councillors Ayanna Pressley and Felix Arroyo, as well as Somerville Mayor Joseph Curtatone, but says that the rumor mill ""has been pretty quiet"" so far.

• NJ-05: I think we're going to have to call it the ""Rick Nolan phenomenon"": former Dem congressman, now in his 70s or thereabouts, hasn't served since the 1980s, but decides to stage a comeback in the 20-teens. Nolan, of course, pulled this off in Minnesota's 8th District last year, and then, back in January, there was a bit of chatter that ex-Rep. Andrew Maguire might be interested in running in New Jersey's 5th. Maguire's 74 and left office in 1981, after losing to Republican Marge Roukema in an old district then numbered the 7th.

It seemed like an incredible longshot that he might actually get back in the game, but lo and behold, he's filed a statement of candidacy with the FEC. Maguire isn't commenting and he may not ultimately go through with it, but he'd certainly be an interesting opponent for GOP Rep. Scott Garrett.

• OH-06: State Sen. Lou Gentile, who came up in politics as a driver for then-Rep. (and later Gov.) Ted Strickland, says he's considering a run against Republican Rep. Bill Johnson in Ohio's 6th Congressional District, but doesn't have a timetable for making a decision. This district is definitely a tough nut to crack, though: It went 55-43 for Romney last year, and at the same time Johnson fended off a stiff challenge from ex-Rep. Charlie Wilson, the man he'd unseated two years earlier. However, David Skolnick points out that Gentile was the GOP's top target in 2012, weathering a seven-figure assault to win by 5 points, so he certainly knows how to fight.

Other Races:

• Portland, OR: Have you ever seen a Commie drink a glass of water? You might soon get your chance, since SurveyUSA's new poll confirms their last one, which I first became aware of during the physical act of love. Our comrades in Portland now look set to defeat a measure to add fluoride to ice cream, Mandrake, children's ice cream the city water supply by a 53-40 margin, up from 48-39 a week earlier. Peace on Earth/Purity of Essence.

Grab Bag:

• Demographics: Pew Research has some fascinating new data on the changing map of where legal immigrants to the U.S. are coming from. Over the last 20 years, as you'd probably expect, the share of Europeans among all immigrants has fallen considerably—but so too has the share of Latin Americans. Instead, there are percentage gains among Asians and Middle Easterners, but the most significant gains come among the oft-overlooked group of sub-Saharan Africans (9 percent of immigrants in 2012, up from 2 percent in 1992). (David Jarman)

• House: If you liked Stephen Wolf's series of diaries on what the House would look like under a nationwide regime of nonpartisan redistricting, then you'll want to also check out the new effort from Real Clear Politics' Sean Trende, which also tries to imagine that scenario. However, he comes to a different set of conclusions, that it wouldn't change the House's composition too much, largely because of Democrats' increasingly inefficient concentration in the nation's urban areas.

Perhaps that points to the very Rorschach-test-like nature of redistricting where one sees what one wants to see in the blots, though Trende also uses a slightly different set of assumptions on how a nonpartisan commission would do its work (and he also doesn't force the issue of additional VRA seats where possible, like Louisiana and South Carolina). Also, we don't get to actually see the maps he actually drew in DRA, just a chart of median Obama vote share for each state, so we can't do the kind of fun seat-by-seat analysis as seen in Stephen's work—though, of course, predicting real-world outcomes in fantasy districts is where the real Rorschach-test stuff happens. (David Jarman)

• Red vs. Blue: No doubt you've noticed that the nation is gradually sorting itself out better at the downballot level as the parties lose their regional quirks and take on more national identities, especially at the congressional level but also at the level of state legislatures and statewide offices. But Governing magazine's Louis Jacobson actually sets out to quantify just how much things have consolidated in the red and blue states. In state Senates, for instance, Republicans now have 4 percent fewer seats in blue states than they did in 2004, while Democrats have 12 percent fewer seats than they did in red states back then.

Put another way, Ronald Reagan ran the federal government at 22 percent of GDP when the country’s population was much younger, and health care consumed about 11 percent of GDP.

Did I mention that Ronald Reagan ran the federal government at 22 percent of GDP when the country’s population was much younger, and health care consumed about 11 percent of GDP?

Now Paul Ryan says we can run the federal government at 19 percent of GDP as the massive baby-boom generation retires and when health costs (largely for seniors) have already soared to 18 percent of GDP.

Sorry, but Ryan is either deeply confused or doing his best to snooker us.

In the sandstorm of commentary on what’s wrong with the Wisconsin Republican’s budget, its easy to lose sight of the few central facts that should make people of all political stripes scratch their heads. The most important is that Ryan wants to shrink government precisely when we have an unavoidably costly demographic tsunami bearing down on us and when per capita health costs have spiraled. (These costs must be challenged, but the medical industrial complex’s current level of loot has to be the starting point for the debate.)

In 1989, when President Reagan left office, there were 34 million people on Medicare and 39 million on Social Security. In 2025, according to these programs’ trustees, there will be 73 million on Medicare and 78 million on Social Security.

This is not happening because we’re stringing up the “hammock of dependency” that Ryan often invokes. It’s happening because our famously big postwar birth cohort is getting older.

Ryan obviously knows these facts. This means he’s disingenuously trying to use the aging of America to force a severe cutback in the non-elderly, non-defense portion of government, which is already headed toward historic lows as a share of GDP.

“I ... think that the historic size [of government as a share of GDP] is about right, or smaller,” Ryan told me in an interview 18 months ago.

“But how can that be if we’re doubling the number of seniors?” I asked.

“Because we can’t keep doing everything for everybody in this country,” he replied.

Huh? The Reagan comparison plainly irked him.

“If Reagan was at 22 [percent of GDP], how can we be at 20 when we double the number of retirees?” I asked (Ryan was talking of running government at 20 percent of GDP at the time).

“That’s sort of a non sequitur argument, the whole Reagan thing,” he said.

“Why?”

“Because that was then, this is now. That was a defense with a discretionary…

“We were a much younger population.”

“I think you’re turning to Ronald Reagan because we all adore Ronald Reagan,” Ryan said.

“No, I’m just saying it was a much younger population and he was a conservative icon. No one was screaming then, ‘Oh my God, you know, he’s running the government at…’”

“He was spending money on something that people liked him to spend money on, the conservatives did… to win the Cold War. So I think that’s what your point is.”

“But it was a much younger population.”

You see the impasse. Truth is, it’s Ryan who peddles non sequiturs. All through his new plan he insists that the existence of a budget gap means that government is too big. “An unbalanced budget is a sign of overreach,” he writes.

But it is no such thing. “Overreach” is a judgment. An unbalanced budget is math. It means that spending is greater than revenue. We could balance the budget at 19 percent of GDP, or at 15 percent, or at 25 percent. It’s refreshing that after years of make-believe, Ryan has finally decided to take a stab at becoming a fiscal conservative (though even his plan’s magic asterisks have magic asterisks — quite a feat). But the level of spending and taxes at which we fiscal conservatives seek to balance the budget depends on what we want government in an aging America to do.

At 19 percent, Ryan’s vision is an America with 50 million uninsured ... forever. Of infrastructure and R&D investment that trails other advanced nations ... in perpetuity. Of a nation that assigns its least effective teachers to poor children . . . permanently. (Amazingly, Senate Democrats have fallen prey to Ryan’s gravitational pull, with the budget they put out Wednesday coming in at 21.7 percent of GDP in the years ahead, a tad below Reagan-era spending.)

Ryan thinks we’re too dumb to see what he’s up to. Is $41 trillion really not enough for the federal government to spend over the next decade, he asks as he sells his new plan, exploding indignantly on the “t,” as if the Lira-like power of big-sounding numbers should scare us into submission.

It speaks volumes about today’s political culture that this thin gruel vaulted Ryan from obscurity to the “intellectual leadership” of his party and a national ticket. If all that was possible, imagine what a sensible plan championed by an intellectually honest Republican – Jon Huntsman, perhaps? – could do.

Strickland announced Tuesday morning that he would not challenge Gov. John Kasich (R) next year, ending the possibility of a rematch between the two 2010 rivals. Strickland, a one-term governor, was a vocal surrogate during the 2012 election for President Barack Obama and Ohio Democrats, including Sen. Sherrod Brown (D).

He said in his statement Tuesday that he looked back ""fondly"" on his four years in the governor's mansion and that it was a ""very difficult decision."" Strickland used the statement, released by the Ohio Democratic Party, to highlight his administration's accomplishments, including the auto bailout, which was a top issue for Obama, Brown and Democrats during the 2012 election.

""Most significant for jobs, we were leaders in investments in alternatives sources of energy and went to bat for the automobile industry; working closely with President Obama on the rescue plan that has been so pivotal in Ohio’s economic recovery,"" Strickland said.

Strickland's decision shifts attention to Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald (D) as the leading Democratic challenger to Kasich. FitzGerald, the first county executive in his county, has been mentioned along with Strickland as one of two leading contenders to challenge Kasich. FitzGerald has taken steps to increase his visibility within Ohio, including highlighting his opposition to Kasich.

Kasich, a potential 2016 GOP presidential candidate, is considered a target for Democrats in 2014, stemming from his role in changing Ohio's collective bargaining system, which was overturned by voters in 2011. Within Ohio, Democrats are expected to push heavy challenges against Kasich, Secretary of State Jon Husted (R) and state Treasurer Josh Mandel (R) in the 2014 races."

(CNN) - If Republicans suffer losses in next year's mid-term elections because of the recent partial government shutdown, Sen. Ted Cruz said Senate Republicans–not Democrats–will be responsible.

""The single-most damaging thing that has happened to Republicans for 2014 is all of the Senate Republicans coming out, attacking the House Republicans, attacking those pushing the effort to defund Obamacare and lining themselves up opposite of the American people,"" Cruz told CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash in an interview in San Antonio.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

His comments, which aired Monday on ""New Day,"" come as a new CNN/ORC International survey indicates that more than half of the country is displeased with Republicans holding majority power in the House.

According to the poll, 54% say it's a bad thing that the GOP controls the House, up 11 points from last December, soon after the 2012 elections when the Republicans kept control of the chamber. Only 38% say it's a good thing the GOP controls the House, a 13-point dive from the end of last year.



Cruz to CNN: ‘I don’t work for the party bosses in Washington’

This is the first time since Republicans won back the House in the 2010 elections that a majority of people say GOP control of the chamber is bad for the country.

Cruz helped lead the conservative Republican strategy to attach anti-Obamacare provisions to must-pass spending legislation this fall. With the support of the White House, the Democratic-controlled Senate refused to take up anything that tried to dismantle the president's signature health care law.

Ultimately the disagreement led to the 16-day partial government shutdown, which removed $24 billion from the economy, according to an initial analysis from Standard & Poor's.

Republican shutdown pain may boost Dems in 2014

Many Senate Republicans rebuked the effort led by Cruz, a first-year senator who was elected in 2012, and they privately and publicly discouraged the senator from pursuing the tactic.

""It was a fool's errand to start with. It was never going to succeed,"" Sen. John McCain said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

McCain didn't single out Cruz but blamed ""the whole effort"" instead.

""Keep up the fight against Obamacare. But don't shut down the government and have so much collateral damage,"" the Arizona Republican added.

Some argue Cruz's strategy was taken in part to raise money for conservative groups that back primary challengers. One group, the Senate Conservatives Fund, which supported Cruz last year, raised $2.1 million in September–a large amount for a nonelection year.

McCain: Obamacare website rollout a 'fiasco'

Asked if his effort was a money-making enterprise, Cruz said: ""Not remotely.""

The Texas Republican said he's ""hopeful"" Senate Republicans will change.

""I am hopeful there will be some time, some reflection, and that Senate Republicans will come back. Come back to the principles they believe and they campaigned on. I'm hopeful we'll actually put action behind the campaign promises,"" he said.

In the Senate, Democrats hold 55 seats, including two independents who caucus with the Democrats, while Republicans hold 45. Democrats are defending 21 of the 35 seats up for grabs next year, with Republican defending 14.

Chris Christie. Everybody is; he’s the politician of the hour. At the top of the latest poll of likely Republican presidential primary voters in New Hampshire. (Just two-and-a-half years to go until the Iowa caucuses!)

If he winds up running, it could be a fantastic test of my theory that women won’t vote for men who yell.

We don’t need to have a discussion about whether or not Christie is a yeller, right? You just have to call up that video of him pursuing a heckler down the boardwalk, waving an ice cream cone. And while Christie is probably not any more in love with himself than your average major league politician, he is a little less good about concealing it. Dan Balz of The Washington Post interviewed him for the newly released book, “Collision 2012,” in which Christie happily recounts the way the rich and powerful begged him to run for the White House. (Henry Kissinger, the governor reported, told him: “Being a successful president is about two things, courage and character: You have both, and your country needs you.”)

Also, we all remember the Christie keynote speech at the Republican convention, in which he told the crowd how wonderful he had made things in his home state and urged them to support whatshisname, who would carry out the New Jersey agenda in Washington. (Before which, Balz reports, the governor had a meltdown over plans to cut his introductory video in the interest of time and threatened to either walk away or go onstage and say the world’s most popular obscenity on live TV.)"

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/books/the-center-holds-by-jonathan-alter.html,2013-06-03 00:00:00,['Michiko Kakutani'],"‘The Center Holds,’ by Jonathan Alter","Mr. Alter’s thesis is that the 2012 election was possibly “the most consequential” in recent times and “a hinge of history” — “a titanic ideological struggle” that put the “social contract established during the New Deal era” on the line. He readily acknowledges that he thinks the United States “dodged a bullet in 2012,” and that in re-electing Barack Obama and rejecting the Republicans’ “extremist” views, America reaffirmed its identity as an essentially “centrist nation.”

Toward the end of this volume, Mr. Alter quotes Mr. Obama telling an aide that if he lost, his presidency would be “a footnote” and that “all of the progress we made in the first four years would be reversed”; if he won, his first-term achievements would be cemented for a generation and he could move ahead on promises sidetracked by the recession.

Whereas there had “famously been ‘two Clintons,’ the brilliant policy analyst” and “the volcanic and self-pitying victim of his own appetites,” Mr. Alter says, President Obama was “pretty much the same calm and self-contained guy inside the bubble as he was in public.” With one exception, Mr. Alter adds: “the intense racial consciousness that he had nurtured in his own mind since childhood was more apparent in private. He knew that if he crossed a certain line in reacting to criticism, he would hand his enemies a weapon: “ ‘See, he’s like all the rest of them.’ It was better for him to be perceived as ‘different,’ with all the challenges that brought.” This “stifling of himself,” this “inability to swing at certain pitches,” made him, according to one aide, about “5 percent more aloof than he had been before coming to the presidency.”

A similar sort of dynamic, in Mr. Alter’s opinion, helps explain the president’s dismal first debate, which jeopardized his re-election: “Obama didn’t trust himself to tangle with Romney. He thought Romney was a liar and an empty suit and would reverse everything worthy he had done as president,” and he had “long worried that his attitude would spill out. Suppressing that was part of what threw him off his game” in that Denver debate.

Such observations help propel the well-worn narrative of the presidential campaign forward, and Mr. Alter scatters some worthwhile nuggets of information along the way.

He reports that Bill Clinton had for many months thought Mr. Romney would win (“the Obama-Christie moment during Hurricane Sandy,” Mr. Alter says, changed the former president’s mind). And he provides some interesting observations on Republican-backed efforts to implement election “reform” around the country (like requiring state-issued photo ID’s and cutting back on early in-person voting) that would hold down “turnout among young people and minorities, who tended to vote Democratic.” Those efforts failed, says Mr. Alter, instead creating a backlash against Republicans as a wave of black voters headed to the polls in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia and Florida, angry at attempts to suppress their votes."

Story highlights NEW: The establishment candidate beat the tea party candidate in Alabama primary runoff Democrat Terry McAuliffe defeats Ken Cuccinelli in race for Virginia governor, CNN projects Bill de Blasio heads toward becoming first Democrat to lead NYC in 20 years Chris Christie easily takes another term as New Jersey governor

(CNN) —

Democrat Terry McAuliffe, buoyed by strong results from voters in Northern Virginia, has defeated Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli in the race for Virginia’s governor, CNN projects.

While both campaigns took on national issues, such as the partial government shutdown earlier this year and the health care law’s flawed rollout, the race was nasty from the outset and devolved into incessant mudslinging and personal attacks. Voters throughout the commonwealth of Virginia were bombarded by negative ads.

Libertarian Robert Sarvis, a third-party candidate, has pulled in 7% of the vote with more than 90% of the vote counted. That’s a significant chunk when the Republican and Democratic candidates are so close.

McAuliffe will succeed Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, who’s not running for re-election because Virginia governors cannot serve consecutive terms.

What might make results from Virginia – along with races including a gubernatorial contest in New Jersey, a race for mayor in New York City and a primary battle for a U.S. House seat in Alabama – most interesting is what they may tell us about 2014 midterms and the 2016 race for the White House.

5 things to know about this year’s most important race

Democrat Bill de Blasio has defeated Republican nominee Joe Lhota in the race for mayor of New York City, CNN projects, making the public advocate the first Democrat to lead the nation’s largest city in 20 years.

After de Blasio won the Democratic nomination in a crowded and circus-like field earlier this year, the liberal Democrat’s victory in the general election was never in question. All polls going into the election had de Blasio defeating Lhota in a landslide, with one released Monday indicating de Blasio was ahead of Lhota with likely voters by more than 40%.

Earlier Tuesday night, in another long-predicted result, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie won four more years leading the Garden State by defeating Democratic state Sen. Barbara Buono in the state’s gubernatorial race.

Christie’s victory became a forgone conclusion long before polls closed in New Jersey, as public opinion polls for months have indicated the tough-talking Republican headliner was far ahead of his Democratic challenger.

There are national implications to the race, too. With Christie considering a run for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, his re-election campaign is seen as a tuneup or stepping stone for that likely White House bid.

According to CNN exit polls of New Jersey voters, Christie performed well with groups that normally cast ballots for Democrats. Early exit polls indicate the GOP governor grabbing 56% of the female vote, and winning all age groups other than those 18-29. Christie also took a fifth of the African-American vote and 45% of Latinos, a much better performance than most Republicans in recent elections.

Virginia and New Jersey are the only two states that hold elections for governor in the year after a presidential contest.

And as a more moderate Republican won in New Jersey and a conservative Republican lost in Virginia, the establishment candidate defeated the tea party candidate in a Republican primary runoff for a congressional seat from Alabama’s 1st district.

Bradley Byrne, a former state senator, defeated businessman Dean Young in the race, according to CNN projections. The contest was seen as a precursor to more intraparty fights ahead in primary elections for the 2014 midterms and was the first time Republican voters could weigh in on which direction they want to take their party after the partial federal government shutdown in October.

Here’s a closer look at some of the night’s most interesting races and ballot measures:

A nasty race in purple Virginia

The McAuliffe and Cuccinelli campaigns engaged in nasty political warfare that took over the airwaves in Virginia. McAuliffe made sure women were aware of Cuccinelli’s support of “personhood” legislation that critics say restricts abortion and some forms of birth control, while Cuccinelli frequently highlighted federal investigations of an electric car company that McAuliffe co-founded.

Both sides also attempted to frame the race as a referendum on larger national issues. Cuccinelli’s supporters argued a vote against McAuliffe was a vote against Obamacare.

McAuliffe and Democrats pinned Cuccinelli as a tea party activist, linking him to conservative lawmakers in Washington who initiated a strategy that eventually led to last month’s government shutdown.

What Christie’s 2013 re-election bid tells us about 2016

Christie performed well with groups that normally cast ballots for Democrats.

Early exit polls indicate the GOP governor grabbing 55% of the female vote, and winning all age groups other than those 18 to 29. Christie also took one fifth of the African-American vote and half of the Latino vote, a much better performance than most Republicans in recent elections.

What Christie’s victory means for the next presidential race

NYC picks first Democratic mayor in a generation

At the center of the race were disagreements over taxes and the city’s controversial “stop-and-frisk” program backed by incumbent Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

De Blasio campaigned on a promise to raise taxes on those earning more than $500,000 a year to pay for universal prekindergarten, an idea Lhota vehemently opposed.

While Lhota painted himself as a fiscal conservative, he sought distance from national Republicans on social issues by reiterating his support of abortion rights and same-sex marriage.

De Blasio expected to win NYC mayoral race

Deep-pocketed Republicans pick winner in Alabama

Byrne, the establishment candidate, far outraised Young, the tea party candidate, thanks to major help from the business wing of the party, including the Chamber of Commerce. He also garnered endorsements from establishment figures, including several Republican House leaders.

In total, Byrne has raised nearly $700,000, with substantial donations from business community political action groups and individual business donors. Young, on the other hand, has raised $260,000 and has received donations from a political action committee run by former Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle, a darling of the tea party movement, as well as endorsements from conservative talk show hosts Mark Levin and Erick Erickson.

However, despite that support for smaller tea party personalities, Young was largely ignored by the national tea party groups. Tea Party Express, Club For Growth and FreedomWorks – three of the largest national tea party groups – sat on the sidelines of the intra-party fight.

Establishment beats tea party in Alabama runoff

Also on the ballot

New York is not the only major city holding a mayoral contest on Tuesday. Voters in Boston, Seattle, Detroit and Cleveland are also electing mayors.

And voters in six states will be weighing in on 31 ballot measures. Among the most interesting: genetically modified food labeling in Washington state, a proposed special marijuana tax in Colorado, secession in 11 Colorado counties and a push to raise New Jersey’s minimum wage to $8.25 per hour.

The fact that Chris Christie rolled to a second term in New Jersey and Terry McAuliffe won in Virginia wasn’t a surprise. Public opinion polls have consistently shown both men in the lead.

USA TODAY

Democrats need to gain 17 House seats to win control%2C a high bar for a president%27s 2nd midterm

One big Democratic target%2C Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann%2C locked in a close race

Republican hurdles and natural growing pains could make %22Obamacare%22 an issue for Democrats

WASHINGTON — Could Democrats regain the House of Representatives in 2014?

History says no, but New York Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, says the combination of an improving economy and a Republican Party focused on investigating President Obama just might make it possible.

""It's going to be hard, no question about it,"" Israel said in an interview in his Capitol Hill office on ""Capital Download,"" USA TODAY's weekly newsmaker video series. But ""this country has an unquenchable thirst for less ideology and more solutions. ... As long as our candidates are running as problem-solvers and solution-ists and a strategy of solutions, I think we have a good chance of winning the House.""

Over the past century, the party that has held the White House for two terms has lost House seats, sometimes dozens of them, in every midterm election except one. However, the exception was in 1998, during Bill Clinton's second term — and that anomaly is fueling Democratic hopes of defying the political norm again next year.

""It was very similar to the climate that we have now,"" Israel said. ""The president gets elected, re-elected, in 1996. The Republicans in the House of Representatives make a decision to do everything they can to bring him down. ... They launched 35 separate, partisan, witch-hunt investigations — and the Democrats won seats in the second midterm election of the Clinton presidency; won five seats.""

Democrats need to pick up 17 House seats to regain the control they lost to Republicans in 2010. Israel says there are 52 House seats ""in play."" The non-partisan Cook Political Report now identifies 37 Democratic-held seats and 30 Republican-held seats as competitive or potentially competitive.

One big target for Democrats: Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, who for a time sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 but only narrowly held on to her House seat in November. She faces a rematch against businessman Jim Graves. Israel said a campaign poll taken last week by the firm PPP for the Graves campaign put him ahead of Bachmann, 47%-45% — within the margin of error of 4.4 percentage points but a sign of a close contest.

The biggest boost for Democrats would be an improving economy, Israel said. ""If the economy shows signs of health, then I think we have a much better climate in which to win the House.""

And he acknowledged concerns about the political impact of the Affordable Care Act as major provisions to cover the uninsured go into effect in January. Most states have declined to set up the exchanges where the uninsured will shop for coverage — defaulting instead to a federal marketplace — and close to half have raised questions about whether they will participate in the expansion of Medicaid to cover low-income Americans.

""There's no question in my mind that many Republicans have made the calculation that they want the programs to fail in order say 'I told you so,' even though they're responsible for the failure,"" Israel said. ""Where there are problems, whether they are inflicted by Republicans or they're created by the natural growing pains of any new endeavor, we need to make sure those problems are solved, that people understand the benefits of this act."""

Born In San Francisco', 'He S A Graduate Of Stanford University.']","Ted Cruz, wacko like a fox","Ted Cruz is on a roll.

The tea party firebrand from Texas has been in the Senate all of seven months, but he’s already looking like a strong contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.

Last week, Cruz won a straw poll at a major gathering of the party’s conservative wing in Denver with an impressive 45% of the votes, far ahead of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.

Before that, he wowed social conservatives in a campaign-style visit to Iowa, whose caucuses are the first stop on the long trail that leads to the nomination.

Advertisement

“I saw a lot in Ted Cruz, and I liked what I saw,” said Bob Vander Plaats, an Iowa evangelical leader whose endorsement has carried weight in earlier caucuses. “If he proves to be the real deal, he will be a phenomenon.”

Naturally, Cruz responds to talk of a presidential candidacy with the obligatory aw-shucks: “My focus is entirely on the Senate.” But he doesn’t say no. So watch what he does, not what he says. He’s on his way back to Iowa next week and New Hampshire after that, unusual destinations for a freshman senator whose day job is looking out for Texas.

Isn’t a presidential campaign a stretch for a 42-year-old first-time officeholder whose initial media coverage painted him as a nutty combination of Joseph McCarthy and Sarah Palin?

After all, Cruz’s first moments in the national spotlight came during Chuck Hagel’s nomination hearing to become Defense secretary, when Cruz asked whether the nominee might be hiding secret income from North Korea. Later, he attacked his Republican colleagues as unprincipled “squishes” on gun control. Fellow Senate Republican John McCain dismissed him as a “wacko bird.”

But Cruz is wacko like a fox. He is driven by his belief that government spending is the problem, and he says he has a strategy for changing the country’s direction. He believes that the tea party movement, if sustained and better organized, could force the Republican establishment to the right — where, in his view, it belongs.

Will he succeed? If not, it won’t be for lack of brains. At Harvard Law School, he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review (like Barack Obama), and constitutional lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who taught Cruz, told me this week that the senator was “among the smartest students I’ve ever had.”

So far, Cruz’s career in Washington has focused on a series of high-profile “no” votes. He voted against raising the federal government’s debt ceiling, against aid to states ravaged by Superstorm Sandy and against the nomination of John F. Kerry as secretary of State. Along with most other Republicans, he voted against the immigration reform bill that would grant a path to citizenship to immigrants who entered the country illegally. And now Cruz is leading a campaign to press Republican senators to threaten a government shutdown in October unless President Obama’s healthcare program is entirely defunded — a proposal several conservatives have denounced as suicidal.

But Cruz cheerfully shrugs off the criticism of his GOP colleagues as the complaints of an entrenched establishment made up of, in his words, “a lot of people that don’t like to be held accountable.”

Cruz says his main goal is recasting the Republican Party’s economic message to embrace both low-income voters and the Mitt Romney set.

“Republicans should be the party of the 47%, of those climbing the economic ladder,” he said at a recent conference sponsored by the Hoover Institution, adding that policies should be evaluated in terms of how they affect “those who are least well off among us.”

Cruz calls his approach to these issues “opportunity conservatism,” although most of his specific policies still sound like traditional GOP doctrine. He opposes hiking the minimum wage, for example, but on grounds that it would be harmful to “young people, African Americans, Hispanics, single women.”

So far, the message seems to be resonating, and Cruz has pulled off a feat that has eluded most other tea party candidates: He is drawing fervent support from social conservatives, economic conservatives and libertarians at the same time.

“He is already trusted on the values issues that mean a lot to social conservatives,” Vander Plaats told me. “So we don’t mind when he says he wants to focus on economic issues; for most people, we would agree that the focus has to be on growth and opportunity.”

Cruz’s rawboned attacks on his fellow Republicans haven’t won him many friends in the Senate or put his name atop any successful legislation, but they aren’t designed to. His goal, he says, is to mobilize the GOP’s most conservative voters and push the party in their direction.

It may not be a recipe for winning the next presidential election — not according to conventional wisdom, at least. But it’s made this once unknown Senate freshman a man to watch in the race for the GOP nomination.

Story highlights William Bennett: Here is some advice for the GOP in the second Obama term Bennett: Don't just blame GOP leadership; the choice of the people also matters He says conservatives must win the cultural war to change political institutions Bennett: The American people voted in big government, and they will be punished for it

Editor’s Note: William J. Bennett, a CNN contributor, is the author of “The Book of Man: Readings on the Path to Manhood.” He was U.S. secretary of education from 1985 to 1988 and director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President George H.W. Bush.

If President Barack Obama’s inaugural address was any indication, his second term will be a doubling down of the progressive, big government agenda.

With that in mind, here is some advice for conservatives and the Republican Party for the next four years of Obama’s presidency:

Don’t blame the GOP leadership

William Bennett

First and foremost, if we are to prevail, we cannot afford to continue firing upon and wounding or maiming our own soldiers and officers. We need everyone in the fight.

It is more difficult to be in a position of governance, such as John Boehner, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, than a journalist, pundit or conservative talk show host. Trust me, I’ve been in both arenas. It’s much harder to be Boehner and the Republican leadership than it is to be Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Medved, etc.

Unlike those who operate solely in the arenas of commentary, opinion and philosophy, Republicans in Washington bear the responsibility and burden of actual governance, where ideological purity must often yield to compromise. Much of the blame placed at the feet of Republican leadership by many in the party or the commentariat lies not with the party or its leaders but ultimately, as in all things with a democratic republic, with the choice of the people.

Face reality

William Buckley aptly described conservatism as the politics of reality. As such, we must recognize the realities of political governance. You cannot govern unless you have power. That is, Republicans cannot govern with control of only one half of one third of the branches of government.

They can block and prevent, but they cannot impose. Our agenda, our goals and our expectations should be oriented to these facts of reality.

It’s the culture, stupid

Conservatives are losing the culture war when, according to a 2011 Pew Research poll, 49% of Americans ages 18-29 have a positive view of socialism while just 46% have a positive view of capitalism. Such views are the products of our education system and the movies, music and entertainment young Americans consume. We must change those cultural institutions before we can truly change our political institutions in the long term.

The roots of our cultural and educational outreach must be as far reaching as the left’s. This means broadening our scope of influence outside Fox News and conservative talk radio and into the left’s strongholds of Hollywood and higher education. Perhaps some of the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on PACs could be better spent taking back the culture.

Play offense

In politics, as in sports, you’re either on offense or you’re on defense. Be on offense. This is a simple maxim, but one too often neglected.

He who initiates sets the terms of debate and forces the dialogue on his terms. Gov. Scott Walker’s aggressive fiscal reforms in Wisconsin are an example of effective political offense.

Elevate the next generation

During the 2012 presidential primaries, conservatives often lamented the absence of rising Republican stars such as Sen. Marco Rubio, Gov. Bob McDonnell, Gov. Bobby Jindal, Gov. Susana Martinez, Gov. Scott Walker, Rep. Paul Ryan and so on. Our bench is strong, but now it’s time for the bench to take the field.

Politics: After inauguration, political reality returns to Washington

Consequences of big government

The American people must realize for what they voted when they re-elected Obama and a Democratic-controlled Senate. So far, they’ve been immunized from many of the consequences. But now, with the expiration of the payroll tax cut and the gradual implementation of ObamaCare, the taxes of almost all Americans have risen, along with many of their health care premiums.

Conservatives must draw the direct link between higher taxes and premiums and Democratic policies. As St. Paul instructs, misery teaches lessons that success doesn’t. The American people voted in big government, and they will be punished and made to pay for it in immiseration.

Don’t become cynical

Do not make people more cynical or pessimistic about politics or the political system. Every day on my radio show, I hear of people withdrawing from the political arena into a cocoon of disengagement and discouragement. We cannot allow this to happen.

We must encourage the American people to be active and involved in important policy decisions.

It was the great novelist Walker Percy who warned of America’s downfall, not at the hand of a great outside power, but from crumbling within.

Politics: Republicans assess Obama’s address

“Probably the fear of seeing America, with all its great strength and beauty and freedom … gradually subside into decay through default and be defeated, not by the communist movement, but from within, from weariness, boredom, cynicism, greed and in the end helplessness before its great problems,” Percy said.

We must get our heads up. As Margaret Thatcher said to us often, “Don’t go wobbly,” and, “Cheer up. America is a strong country.”

Labor Secretary Hilda Solis is leaving ahead of Obama's second term

Labor Secretary Hilda Solis will not be returning for a second term, President Obama said Wednesday.

""Over the last four years, Secretary Solis has been a critical member of my economic team as we have worked to recover from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression and strengthen the economy for the middle class,"" Obama said.

Meanwhile, White House officials said three other Cabinet members will remain after the president's next term starts Jan. 20: Attorney General Eric Holder, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki.

In disclosing her resignation to Labor Department employees, Solis trumpeted their work on job training and community college programs. She also cited programs devoted to veterans employment, worker safety, and reclaiming lost wages.

""Because President Obama took very bold action, millions of Americans are back to work,"" said Solis, a former member of Congress from California. ""There is still much to do, but we are well on the road to recovery, and middle class Americans know the president is on their side.""

Obama did not announce a replacement.

Solis is the fifth Cabinet-level to announce his or her resignation prior to the start of Obama's second term on Jan. 20.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, and Environmental Protection Agency administration Lisa Jackson have also announced their departures.

The president has nominated Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., to replace Clinton at State and former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., to replace Panetta at the Pentagon. He is expected to tap White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew to succeed Geithner at Treasury, and has not nominated a new EPA administrator.

(CNN) —

For the first time since the 2008 presidential race, Hillary Clinton made a foray back into the thorny world of campaign politics on Saturday, appearing at a rally for Terry McAuliffe, the longtime Clinton confidante now running for governor of Virginia.

About 500 people showed up to the historic State Theatre in Falls Church, a suburb of Washington, D.C. to witness Clinton’s smiling re-emergence on the political scene, showering her with applause when she made even the slightest allusion to running for office again.

What did we learn about her future plans as she considers a repeat bid for the White House in 2016? Not much at all, actually.

But here are three important takeaways from Clinton’s first big political speech since leaving the State Department earlier this year:

She was relaxed

Never a dynamic speaker on the stump in 2008, Clinton was instead relaxed, confident and authoritative on Saturday.

It’s not hard to see why.

This was a supremely low-risk event for Clinton – as perfect a re-entry into national politics as she could have asked for. Barring some kind of wacky collapse in the final three weeks of the race, McAuliffe is generally expected to defeat his Republican opponent Ken Cuccinelli, though some Democrats here expect the winning margin to be a few points smaller than the eight-point lead he holds in the polls, given the usual GOP turnout edge in an off-year.

The former secretary of state has a close personal friendship with McAuliffe, a longtime fundraiser, poker buddy, cheerleader, political fixer and all-purpose confidant for the Clintons.

The event’s frame – it was billed as a “Women For Terry” rally – was right in Clinton’s strike zone, giving her a chance to talk about politics in terms she feels most comfortable.

“The whole country is watching to see if the rights of women and girls will be respected, especially over our own bodies and our health care,” she said of the Virginia race, alluding to Cuccinelli’s efforts as a state legislator and attorney general to curb access to abortion.

Add it all up, and Clinton was completely at ease on Saturday, campaigning in front a fawning audience in the Washington suburbs, talking about women’s issues and propping up one of her longtime pals.

“I thought hard about what I wanted to say to Virginians today,” she said. “I’ve been out of politics for a few years now. And I’ve had a chance to think a lot about what makes our country so great. What kind of leadership is required to keep it great.”

How long can Hillary Clinton wait?

She wasn’t afraid to jab Republicans, however gently

Clinton stayed mostly positive, but she didn’t shy away from taking a few shots at Republicans, albeit not by name.

Talking about the political gridlock on Capitol Hill that led to a 16-day government shutdown this month, she said that “we have seen examples of the wrong kind of leadership” in recent days, an unmistakable poke at House Republicans.

“Politicians choose scorched-earth over common ground,” she continued. “They operate in what I called the evidence-free-zone, with ideology trumping everything else,” she said, before listing the consequences of the shutdown, such as furloughed workers and “children thrown out of Head Start.”

Clinton also made sure to highlight Republican efforts to enforce stricter abortion regulations in Virginia. McAuliffe, she said, would “stand up against attempts to restrict women’s health choices.”

Rounding out her speech, Clinton alluded to Alexis de Tocqueville, the French writer who described Americans as having “habits of the heart” when he traveled to the U.S. nearly 200 years ago.

But Clinton warned that such a spirit is under threat.

“We cannot let those who do not believe in America’s progress hijack this great experiment, and substitute for the habits of the heart suspicion, hatred, anger, anxiety. That’s not as a people who we are.”

Clinton on possible presidency: ‘I’m realistic’

She executed the McAuliffe game plan

As much as Clinton was the story here, time and again she served as a character witness for McAuliffe, whom Republicans have relentlessly attacked as a carnival barker and Washington insider.

“I’ve seen the values that he was raised with,” Clinton said of McAuliffe, standing next to her on stage at the State Theatre, along with his wife Dorothy. “He grew up in a middle class family. He was taught about the dignity of work and the importance of looking out for each other. He started his first business at the age of 14 because he knew he was going to have to put himself through school. He’s lived those values.”

The Clinton appearance was straight out of McAuliffe’s playbook from day one.

No one in Virginia is surprised that his campaign deployed Clinton at this late stage of the game, an effort to stir up scads of press attention and drown out the cash-strapped Cuccinelli, who is not even airing television ads in the crucial northern Virginia media market this weekend, two ad-buying sources told CNN.

Cuccinelli spent Saturday rallying the conservative base with Mike Huckabee in central Virginia.

The Democrats’ goal is to lock in McAuliffe’s lead and keep their boot on Cuccinelli’s neck as they head into the final stretch.

And guess what: former President Bill Clinton, the big dog himself, will also be campaigning for McAuliffe in the coming weeks. Date TBD."

President Obama is weighing appointments for campaign fundraisers%2C political allies

About 30%25 of ambassadorship selected during the president%27s first term went to political friends and donors

It%27s a time-honored tradition to reward political friends and campaign contributors with plum ambassadorship

WASHINGTON – Visit the U.S. Embassy in Albania, Bangladesh, Chad or most of sub-Saharan Africa or central Asia and you'll find a career diplomat representing the government's interests.

The picture is starkly different, however, in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the Bahamas – all countries where 90% or more of the ambassadors in recent decades have been political appointees, according to the American Foreign Service Association, which represents career officers. Its data track all appointments since 1960.

It's a time-honored presidential tradition to reward political friends and campaign contributors with plum ambassadorships to Caribbean islands and glittering European capitals. The practice is getting fresh attention as President Obama weighs second-term appointments for the donors and fundraisers who help collect more than a $1 billion for his re-election.

In the 2012 campaign, 773 individuals and couples raised at least $50,000 for Obama, who is expected to fill about 30 political positions in his second term.

""It's a very competitive scene to get one of these jobs,"" said John Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Clinton who oversaw Obama's 2009 transition to the White House. Strong ambassadors have come from both the career and political ranks, he said.

Among the names in circulation: Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of late President John F. Kennedy, as a possible ambassador to Japan. Kennedy was an early Obama supporter, endorsing him in January 2008 over his better-established rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Matthew Barzun, an ex- tech company executive who chaired Obama's 2012 fundraising operation, is viewed as the top contender for England. He served as U.S. ambassador to Sweden during Obama's first term. Neither he nor Kennedy returned phone calls, and administration officials have not answered questions about specific appointments.

White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the administration is seeking qualified candidates from ""all walks of life.""

""Being a donor does not get you a job in this administration,"" Schultz said in a statement. ""Nor does it preclude you from getting one.""

Nearly 30% of Obama's ambassadors have been political appointees – in line with his predecessors. Even so, Susan Johnson, the president of the American Foreign Service Association, said there is too much patronage. She said the system hurts the morale and professional development of career diplomats.

""You are reserving ambassadorships for the moneyed elite,"" she said.

""Anybody who criticizes political appointees on a generalized basis doesn't know what they are talking about,"" said Louis Susman, a top fundraiser during Obama's 2008 campaign. He returned to the United States last week after serving nearly four years as the United States' top envoy to England, a position he called ""the best job in the world.""

The appointments are ""not only based on what they have done for President Obama, but on qualifications and expertise,"" said Susman, a former Citigroup executive.

Not all political appointees have worked out. Cynthia Stroum, a Seattle venture capitalist and Democratic fundraiser, resigned her ambassadorship to Luxembourg in 2011 ahead of a scathing report by the State Department's inspector general that said her ""confrontational management style"" and and ""bullying"" had led to low morale at the embassy.

Stroum said the embassy had morale and financial troubles long before she arrived, and no senior career foreign service officers were sent along to help during her tenure. ""In retrospect, I was ill-equipped and unprepared to manage the challenging situation I had inherited without a backup team in place,"" she said in an e-mail.

Two years later, the ""resignation still stings,"" Stroum added. But, given the chance, ""I would do it all over again.""

Much of the recent attention has focused on Kennedy, who would join a long tradition of high-profile American envoys in Japan.

Previous ambassadors have included former vice president Walter Mondale and former Senate majority leader Howard Baker. Talk of her appointment comes as North Korea escalates its threatening rhetoric and as China and Japan feud over control of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.

Podesta said Kennedy, 55, is well qualified for the post. A lawyer by training, she serves as president of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum and co-chaired Obama's vice presidential search committee in 2008.

""She's a well-known commodity, who is quite close to the president, and that counts for a lot,"" Podesta said. ""That direct channel to the secretary of State, the national security adviser and the president himself is extremely valuable."""

Since he was elected, Governor Rick Scott has sought to make it increasingly more difficult for citizens to vote. First, he made registering voters prohibitively complicated.3 Then, he purged hundreds of thousands of voters from the rolls, many of which were legally eligible to vote.4 And his final act to suppress the vote was to shorten early voting hours, including canceling the Sunday before Election Day, which historically, is a day that many African American churches take their members to the polls.5

The result was long lines on Election Day, discouraging many Floridians from voting. And it certainly hasn’t gone unnoticed that Rick Scott’s actions have targeted Hispanics, African Americans, seniors and young people — all of which tend to lean Democratic.

The right to vote in this country is fundamental to our Democracy. It is fundamental to what this country is founded on and since the inception of this country, we have consistently worked to extend that right to all Americans. That is, until now.

When President Obama gave his second inaugural address, he said, “Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.”6 We couldn’t agree more.

The future.

After flirting with ""rebranding"", conservatives convinced themselves they could win elections again by merely getting more white people to vote for them. Ron Brownstein delivers a solid rebuttal , including stuff we've discussed ad infinitum around here—like noting that demographic trends will push white Americans into eventual minority status (old white people being replaced by diverse and tolerant young voters).

But a white-voter-focused GOP has another big problem on its hands. Turns out, the kinds of white people Republicans attract are shrinking as a percentage of the electorate.

Republicans do worse among college educated whites. In 1984, 62 percent of white voters didn't have a college degree. In 2012, the number of college-educated whites equaled that of those without a degree.

Republicans do worse among white women than men. In 1984, white men and women were an equal percentage of the vote. In 2012, white men lagged white women by four points (38 versus 34) of the total sex by race vote.

Put it all together?

In 1984, those blue-collar men cast nearly three times as many votes as the white-collar women; in 2012, for the first time, the college women (at 19 percent) outvoted the noncollege men (at 17 percent). Given that the share of white adults with at least a four-year degree has increased in every year since 1981 except two, and that women are garnering nearly three-fifths of those degrees, this gap is likely to widen.

Republicans do better among married voters than single ones. In 1984, married couples were 70 percent of all white voters. In 2012, it was 65 percent.

Republicans do better among religious voters. In 2007, 15 percent of white voters were secular. In 2012, it was 20 percent.

Republicans do better among whites in states ignored by Democratic presidential campaigns. Here's an amazing stat: ""Obama equaled or exceeded his national share of the vote among noncollege whites in 22 of the 31 states in which exit polls were conducted last year—and won each of them except Indiana.""

Republicans do better among older whites. During the 1980s, Democrats averaged 36 percent among white voters under the age of 30. Since 2000, Democrats have averaged 45 percent.

On the Republican side, the decline of labor households has given them a boost among working-class non-college educated whites. But the broader trends are not favorable to them. And unless the GOP does an about-face on social issues like gay marriage, for starters, its slide into electoral irrelevance will continue.

And you know they won't. Not without suffering additional electoral pain."

Public Campaign Action Fund, a campaign finance reform advocacy group, and USAction, a progressive grassroots advocacy group, are purchasing air time in three Kentucky media markets beginning Friday and running through Oct. 13. The ads aim to challenge McConnell to explain his opposition to campaign finance restrictions.

""The ad is intended to get a response out of McConnell about why he thinks unlimited campaign contributions are the way to go,"" said Public Campaign Action Fund executive director David Donnelly.

McConnell's lawyer has been allowed time to argue before the Supreme Court for the elimination of campaign contribution limits on Oct. 8 in the McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission case.

The McCutcheon case challenges the aggregate limit on contributions by an individual donor. For the 2014 election, an individual donor may give $123,200 in total to candidates, parties and political action committees -- a limit the McCutcheon case threatens to overturn.

McConnell's argument before the Supreme Court will challenge the court's longtime distinction between campaign contributions and campaign spending. The court ruled in the 1976 Buckley v. Valeo case that campaign spending restrictions violate First Amendment free speech rights. But the court found that limits on campaign contributions are constitutional. Contribution limits have been upheld in every major campaign finance case since.

Donnelly said campaign finance reform groups may have failed to adequately stir public interest before the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which allows unlimited campaign contributions. He said McConnell's role in the McCutcheon case is a chance to bring attention to the issue.

""We need to sound the alarm earlier, and engaging in a debate with Sen. McConnell is probably the best way to raise the stakes on this,"" Donnelly said.

The ads are not designed to take sides in McConnell's reelection. McConnell faces a GOP primary challenge from Matt Bevin. Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes is the leading Democratic candidate in the general election.

Still, Donnelly said McConnell's campaign finance views are likely to become a campaign issue.

""I can't imagine how it won't be,"" Donnelly said. ""Arguing before the high court that we should have no campaign limits whatsoever. Someone predicted the race will be $100 million. What will it be with no limits? It's just outrageous."""

Norquist told The Hill that he opposed allowing conservative talk radio hosts Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin to moderate the 2016 Republican presidential primary debates, saying it would not be “useful.”

Having conservative talk radio hosts Mark Levin or Rush Limbaugh host debates would be “not useful,” Norquist told The Hill. Talk radio hosts, he said, are primarily entertainers who would draw attention away from the candidates themselves. He also said the radio hosts, despite their popularity, did not necessarily represent the Republican mainstream. He pointed toward immigration reform as an example, saying that while Levin opposes comprehensive immigration reform fiercely, polls show most Republicans are amenable to it.

Someone close to the Limbaugh camp spoke to Breitbart News said, “It’s ironic that when everyone was jumping on the bash Grover bandwagon, Rush never said a word. He has too much class.” The source also noted that in the past Norquist has used Rush’s quotes on the ATR website to fundraise and promote his cause of the moment.

“Some friend, huh.”

During the vote at the last Republican National Committee meeting when members decided to oust CNN and NBC as potential networks to moderate primary debates over the airing of a Hillary Clinton movie, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus commented it would be a “very good idea” to have both Limbaugh and Levin as RNC debate moderators. “I actually think that’s a very good idea,” He said, adding, “I mean, there’s a lot of good people out there that can actually understand the base of the Republican Party, the primary voters.”

A GOP state party official agreed with Priebus telling Breitbart News, “[Limbaugh and Levin] should be moderators. Chris Matthews did the primary debate in 2008.”

Immediately after Priebus’s comments, Limbaugh said on his radio show, “I don’t see how I can, I’m too famous.” However, Limbaugh noted the debate would certainly get high ratings."

Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) - Former Gov. Mark Sanford finished first in Tuesday's crowded Republican primary for the U.S. House special election in South Carolina, CNN projects. However, Sanford fell well short of the 50% margin needed to avoid a runoff.

The former governor will compete against Curtis Bostic, a former Charleston councilman, in a runoff election in two weeks. The third place finisher, state Sen. Larry Grooms, conceded the race Wednesday.



""Are you guys ready to change things in Washington, D.C.?"" Sanford said to supporters at his campaign headquarters in Charleston on Tuesday night. All four of his sons attended the party.

""What we've earned is the honor of being on the playing field here for the next two weeks,"" he added, asking the crowd to redouble their campaign efforts. ""Indeed, we are at that tipping point.""

On the Democratic side, CNN projects Elizabeth Colbert Busch, sister of comedian Stephen Colbert, won the nomination.

""This is absolutely incredible. What a wonderful night,"" she told supporters at a victory party in Charleston, South Carolina. ""It's the start of a new beginning, right?""

The longtime area businesswoman was considered the favorite on the Democratic side over opponent Ben Frasier. She'll compete against the Republican nominee in the general election in May.

The winner of the special election will fill the U.S. House seat vacated by now-Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican appointed to fill the Senate spot that Jim DeMint left last month.

""I am ready to go to Washington, D.C. to be your voice, so we're going to do that,"" Colbert Busch said.

The Republican primary ballot featured 16 candidates, including Sanford and Teddy Turner, son of CNN founder Ted Turner.

Sanford's re-entry into politics comes after an extramarital affair derailed his marriage and political career. As governor, he infamously told the public in 2009 he was hiking the Appalachian Trail while he was actually traveling to Argentina to carry on the affair.

He and his then-wife, Jenny, were divorced in 2010 and Sanford finished his second term in January 2011.

Sanford is asking the public for a second chance, and in his own informal poll of the voters, he said he's finding an openness to forgive, if not forget.

In an interview Tuesday night, Sanford said his first-place finish was ""incredibly humbling.""

""There's this amazing reservoir of human grace out there that's a reflection of God's grace, and I've seen it first hand,"" he said, adding that he looks forward to a ""spirited contest"" during the runoff.

Sanford's colorful not so distant past was far from the only distraction in the race.

Turner had family ties, deep pockets and a sudden rise in some internal polling. All that made him a big target.

Opponents filled mailboxes with attack ads on Turner, with some tying the candidate to one of his father's ex-wives, Jane Fonda.

""You know it's absolutely amazing how dirty the game is, how expensive the game is. It just doesn't make sense,"" Turner said.

John Avlon, a CNN political contributor whose family has lived in South Carolina for decades, said Sanford's honesty about his imperfect personal life has made him more relatable to voters.

""There is an affection for a guy who admits he's a sinner and asks for forgiveness, especially down here,"" Avlon said.

Despite his transgressions, the former governor insists he is worthy of the public trust. Sanford maintains he learned some important life lessons after wondering off-trail.

""Oddly enough, I think you learn from the valleys of life rather than the peaks,"" Sanford said.

Paul spent nearly 13 hours on the Senate floor

Kentucky senator says his opposition was to drone policy%2C not Brennan

Harry Reid said a vote to approve Brennan would happen Thursday

WASHINGTON — After nearly 13 hours on the Senate floor, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., ended his filibuster blocking Senate confirmation of John Brennan, President Obama's pick for director of the CIA.

""I'm going to speak as long as I can to draw attention to something I find very disturbing,"" Paul said when he started speaking around 11:45 a.m. Wednesday morning. He finally ceded the floor at about 12:40 a.m. local time on Thursday.

But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, also a Kentucky Republican, said he would continue to oppose Brennan's confirmation and ending debate on it.

What started in the morning as a solo effort turned into a multi-senator debate that included one Democrat, Ron Wyden of Oregon, and at least seven Republicans questioning the constitutionality of drone strikes on U.S. citizens at home and abroad.

In a show of support, several of Paul's colleagues who share his conservative views came to the floor to take turns speaking for him and trading questions. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, read Twitter messages from people eager to ""Stand With Rand."" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., made references to rappers Jay-Z and Wiz Khalifa.

""No American should be killed by a drone on American soil without first being charged with a crime, without first being found guilty of a crime by a court,"" Paul said. ""How can you kill someone without going to a judge, or a jury?""

Paul, a critic of Obama's unmanned drone policy, started his self-described filibuster by demanding the president or Attorney General Eric Holder issue a statement assuring that unmanned aircraft would not be used in the United States to kill terrorism suspects who are U.S. citizens.

Paul said that his opposition was not about Brennan himself, but the constitutional issues involved. ""We really just want [Obama] to say he won't"" attack noncombatants on U.S. soil.

The federal government has not conducted such operations and doesn't plan to, Attorney General Eric Holder told Paul in a March 4 letter. But, Holder added, it was possible President Obama could be forced by an ""extraordinary circumstance"" to kill citizens inside the United States, and he cited the Pearl Harbor and 9/11 attacks as examples.

During his filibuster, Paul said the fuzziness of such language created a slippery slope that could lead to the targeting of citizens who merely have different opinions about policies than the president.

""You can't be judge, jury and executioner all in one,"" Paul said.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., took the floor around 4:30 p.m. to say any vote to end debate on Brennan's nomination or to approve him as CIA director would happen Thursday.

Wyden, a longtime critic of excessive government intelligence and surveillance programs, said ""the senator from Kentucky has made a number of important points.""

There are times, Wyden said, when a U.S. citizen who takes up arms against the United States while overseas can be attacked by a drone. But the executive branch of government, he said, should not be allowed to ""conduct such a far-reaching policy without scrutiny.""

It's not a partisan issue, Paul said, noting that he voted to support the nominations of John Kerry and Chuck Hagel, the secretaries of State and Defense.

Paul and other senators had delayed a full Senate vote on Brennan's nomination until they received more information about the drone program. The White House provided Justice Department documents on the drone program to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday.

The committee then voted 12-3 to approve Brennan's nomination.

Brennan, the White House's top counterterrorism adviser, was closely linked to the drone program. The administration has used the unmanned aircraft to regularly target suspected terrorists in the Middle East and Africa.

In 2011, U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was killed by a drone strike in Yemen, raising questions about the use of the armed drones on American citizens.

Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina had used Brennan's nomination to air concerns about the administration's handling of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador.

McCain and Graham said they would oppose Brennan unless they got classified documents detailing the administration's actions immediately following the attack, the Associated Press reported.

The White House has said it provided more documents to lawmakers about that attack.

Before coming to the White House, Brennan served 25 years in the CIA.

Mr. Cornyn succeeded Mr. Gramm. Mr. Cruz occupies the seat once held by Mr. Bentsen.

Mr. Gramm bucked the Democratic Party in support of Ronald Reagan’s economic policies, switched parties, quit his United States House seat, won it again and then won the Senate seat he held for 18 years.

White House officials have told Congressional leaders that the president plans to press for action on Capitol Hill, and Democrats say they expect him to highlight the issue in his State of the Union address next week. Democrats in the House and Senate have already introduced bills that would require states to provide online voter registration and allow at least 15 days of early voting, among other things.

Fourteen states are also considering whether to expand early voting, including the battlegrounds of Florida, Ohio and Virginia, according to FairVote, a nonprofit group that advocates electoral change. Florida, New York, Texas and Washington are looking at whether to ease registration and establish preregistration for 16- and 17-year-olds.

Several recent polls and studies suggest that long waiting times in some places depressed turnout in 2012 and that lines were longest in cities, where Democrats outnumber Republicans. In a New York Times/CBS News poll taken shortly after Election Day, 18 percent of Democrats said they waited at least a half-hour to vote, compared with 11 percent of independents and 9 percent of Republicans."
http://news.yahoo.com/after-a-bitter-election--bloomberg-and-de-blasio-make-peace-195157227.html,,[],"After a bitter election, Bloomberg and de Blasio look to make peace","NEW YORK — They spoke in voices so hushed it was hard to judge exactly what the conversation was about, but their body language said it all.

Just hours after New York voters overwhelmingly picked Democrat Bill de Blasio to succeed Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the two political nemeses met for the first time, sitting across from one another at a wooden conference table inside the mayor’s office at City Hall.

The post-election night get-together has been a long tradition in New York politics, a sign of two rivals putting aside the bitterness of the campaign to move forward for the good of the city. But this meeting was of particular curiosity — given that de Blasio, who currently serves as the city’s public advocate, rode to a landslide victory over his Republican rival by essentially casting himself as the anti-Bloomberg.

Unlike past efforts by political rivals to make nice with each other in front of cameras, De Blasio and Bloomberg skipped any pretense of jocularity and didn't speak to the large press scrum who came to watch. Instead, reporters were led in groups of six at a time to witness minute-long snippets of their meeting, which was held overlooking the infamous “bullpen” — the open floor plan of desks that Bloomberg installed inside the mayor’s office at City Hall.

Journalists shifted in and out of the room to eye the two politicians, demonstrating the same kind of curiosity that they might have at an exhibit of caged zoo animals. De Blasio seemed fidgety, rearranged his six-foot-five frame several times in his chair, leaned forward and back, and whispered occasionally audible phrases like “What did…” and “How did you…” and “Didn’t he…"" It suggested a friendly curiosity by the mayor-elect toward the incumbent, though de Blasio never smiled.

Bloomberg, who wore a blank look, whispered answers in return, his hand resting near a digital clock that tallied up the length of the meeting, which by then was past the half-hour mark. Nearby, another digital click ticked down — this one counting the hours he has left until he leaves office on Dec. 31.

Story continues

The outgoing mayor has never projected much warmth and didn't do so today. He clutched a cup of coffee, while de Blasio had a can of ginger ale. But neither man took a sip.

At one point, Bloomberg looked past de Blasio to the reporters who held their iPhones and tape recorders aloft, trying to capture the meeting. He crossed his arms and frowned — a moment that quickly made the rounds through a photo posted on Twitter.

Aides said there would be no read-out of the details of their roughly hour-long conversation.

De Blasio later held a press conference to announce the formation of a transition team to help him prepare to take office in 55 days. And he offered rare praise for Bloomberg, telling reporters their meeting had been “very, very productive,” “very cordial,” “very helpful” and “very collegial."" He said he planned to work “very closely” with Bloomberg during the next few weeks, though he still offered no details on what the two had discussed.

“He and his team have been very forthcoming, very positive,” de Blasio said of Bloomberg. “It is obvious this is going to be a smooth and productive transition, and I want to thank him for the spirit in which he is approaching this and for the helpful advice he gave this morning.”"

NJ) in the special election against Newark Mayor Cory Booker (D. NJ) on Wednesday:

http://www.buzzfeed.com/...



In the final weeks of the race, Lonegan has increasingly sought that momentum from the Tea Party, a loud but likely small block of voters in a state that has voted for Democratic presidents since 1992 and Democratic senators since 1979. The event Saturday was just past the Ocean County line, one of New Jersey’s reliably conservative areas; Mitt Romney, John McCain, and George W. Bush all did well in this South Jersey Republican stronghold. The crowd, receptive to Lonegan’s stump speech lines about the Revolutionary War, hawked standard-fare Tea Party flags in the air — “Don’t Tread on Me” and “Liberty or Death” were two — and held up signs that called for the president’s impeachment. A singer who took the stage before the speakers to perform live warned attendees of a possible “U.S.S. of A” — the United Socialist States of America. “They’ll own our banks, our healthcare too. They’ll own our houses, they’ll own our food. They’ll own the cars we all will drive, they’ll own every aspect of our lives,” she crooned. “They’re takin’ away our liberty, it’s a nightmare, don’t you see?” The event, Lonegan’s biggest yet, was sponsored in part by the bus tour group, Tea Party Express, and by Palin’s political action committee, Sarah PAC. Lonegan, who also received endorsements from Sen. Rand Paul and Gov. Rick Perry last month, has more recently focused his campaign on the partisan gridlock in Washington that shutdown the federal government two weeks ago. In a debate with Booker last week, Lonegan said he’d “like to see the government open,” but at the racetrack, he had a different message. “Tell Republicans in Washington, D.C., to hold the line,” Lonegan said, speaking before Palin. “Hold the line! Hold the line! Hold the line!” Palin downplayed the negative impacts of the shutdown. “They’re callin’ it the government shutdown — I think it should be called the slim-down,” she said during her 15-minute speech. “Because really it’s only 17 percent of our bloated, burdensome, out-of-control federal government that has even slowed down this week.” - BuzzFeed, 10/13/13

But the best part of the rally was Palin's ""Oops, I did it again"" moment:

http://www.opposingviews.com/...



According to Buzzfeed.com, while speaking to a crowd of two thousand people at the New Egypt Speedway in New Jersey on Saturday, Palin yelled, “We need a leader not a tweeter! That was poem-worthy!"" ""Leader not Tweeter,"" was written on one of Palin's hands, tweeted Buzzfeed.com writer Ruby Cramer. “New Jersey, just know that the eyes of America are on you right now,” stated Palin. “Something big is happening here. And it’s exactly clear, it’s called momentum.” However, Newark, N.J. Mayor Cory Booker (D) is leading Lonegan by 53-41 percent, according to a recent poll by Quinnipiac University. During his Saturday rally, Lonegan expressed his support with the unpopular government shutdown: ""Tell Republicans in Washington, D.C., to hold the line. Hold the line! Hold the line! Hold the line!” - Opposing Views, 10/13/13

Oh Sarah, you truly are the gift that keeps on giving. What's also funny is while Lonegan is cheering on the shutdown, Palin was trying to shift blame from the Republicans:

http://www.nj.com/...



""Bottom line, guys: The politicians are using the military as pawns,"" she added.

""Thank you for you being here. You who have the Jersey fight — you who are here for love of country,"" she said, to cheers and applause. - The Star-Ledger, 10/12/13

Meanwhile, Booker remains the favorite on Wednesday night to win but he's not taking any chances. He's been hitting back at Lonegan's former lead campaign aide, Rick Shaftan's ridiculous rant about Booker's Twitter conversation with a Portland stripper:

http://talkingpointsmemo.com/...



Shaftan's ribald diatribe was the latest in a series of intense attacks on Booker from the Lonegan campaign, which has accused him of having owned a ""crackhouse"" in Newark, mocked him for being effeminate, and criticized him from focusing more on becoming a celebrity than on his constituents. Speaking to TPM on the campaign bus, Booker accused Lonegan of running a race consistently filled with ""nastiness."" ""I didn't know Steve Lonegan at all. My staff had to remind me, my first knowledge of him was when he, on Martin Luther King Day, did a protest. Chose that day to do a protest on the front steps of City Hall against affirmative action,"" said Booker. ""But it didn't take long for the campaign to start. It was first with that tweet and calling sections of my city, I can't remember the nations he picked. ... Next thing you know, I have him saying that you're not a real man. ... This has been a constant theme for him of this kind of stuff."" Along with statements seemingly designed to raise questions about Booker's sexuality, on several occasions, the Lonegan campaign has painted Newark as a crime-ridden urban nightmare. These jabs included the aforementioned tweet, which showed a map labeling some of Newark's poorer neighborhoods as third world countries. They also included a comment Lonegan made during a debate last week referring to Newark as a ""big black hole,"" and a press conference where Lonegan promised to ""address the interests of suburban New Jerseyans"" that he said Booker ""ignores."" At his first speech Saturday in Newark, Booker accused Lonegan of exploiting ""tired tropes."" ""When I stood up there in the last debate and he referred to Newark as, I think it was a black hole or a big black hole ... where he talked about dead bodies in the river, floating in the river. ... With all the things that are going on in our city for the positive, to have somebody there disrespect our city. ... It was painful for me as one of the city fathers to have somebody talk about the community that they love,"" Booker said. ""But worse than that, they were playing into these tired tropes that there are many different New Jerseys. You know, there are some people that say there's an urban New Jersey and a suburban New Jersey. Some people say there's a minority New Jersey and a non-minority. Some people would say that there's a South Jersey and a North Jersey. Some people even say there's a Republican New Jersey and a Democrat New Jersey. Well, anybody who's fought in this battle like we all have knows one truth fundamentally; we are one state, with one destiny, and we all need each other, and that's how we get strong."" - TPM, 10/12/13

Booker's also been out on the campaign trail slamming Lonegan and the GOP government shutdown:

http://newyork.cbslocal.com/...



Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez joined Booker on Sunday. As WCBS 880′s Jim Smith reported, Booker told a crowd at the annual Bergen and Passaic Counties Hispanic Rally that New Jersey voters have a special opportunity by voting during the government shutdown. “We’re the only election for the United States Congress that is happening during this shutdown,” he said. Booker said New Jersey voters can “endorse the tea party and their shutdown politics” or say, “No, not here in New Jersey, not in this nation.” Wasserman-Schultz said voters should help make sure the tea party is “squelched.” “We are apparently, not any closer, to reopening the government,” she said. - CBS New York, 10/13/13

This is good becuase Booker for a long time avoided attacking Lonegan but had a missteps along the campaign trail:

http://tv.msnbc.com/...



The shift, to many observers, was a clear sign of worry, especially when New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Political Action Committee stepped in to spend $1 million for ads in support of Booker. Many Democrats have privately grumbled that missteps, including some self-inflicted wounds, have opened up opportunities Lonegan has exploited. The Democrat was dinged late last month after it was revealed he had exchanged direct messages with an Oregon stripper. Booker said it was just part of his active social media life, and he hadn’t scrutinized her profile. The accuracy of other anecdotes he’s used on the trail, including a story of a former drug dealer, “T-Bone,” he later befriended, have been called into question. Booker’s also faced questions over his stake in an internet video company and payouts he received from his former law firm, who got contracts with the city. Booker’s campaign says the race was always going to tighten, and said the drop in polls was only natural. “When we looked at this race early on there was a level of support among Republicans that, in this environment, was not going to be sustainable,” said Booker spokesman Kevin Griffis. While Booker may have put this race at least within Lonegan’s grasp, the conservative activist is no Scott Brown — or even Chris Christie, who he challenged from the right in the 2009 gubernatorial primary. Lonegan hasn’t poised himself as able to take advantage of a Democrat’s missteps in a special election with such a conservative record in the solidly blue Garden State. - MSNBC, 10/13/13

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/opinion/brooks-a-second-g-o-p.html,2013-01-29 00:00:00,['David Brooks'],A Second G.O.P. - The New York Times,"Americans are still skeptical of Washington. If you shove a big government program down their throats they will recoil. But many of their immediate problems flow from globalization, the turmoil of technological change and social decay, and they’re looking for a bit of help. Moreover, given all the antigovernment rhetoric, they will never trust these Republicans to reform cherished programs like Social Security and Medicare. You can’t be for entitlement reform and today’s G.O.P., because politically the two will never go together.

Can current Republicans change their underlying mentality to adapt to these realities? Intellectual history says no. People almost never change their underlying narratives or unconscious frameworks. Moreover, in the South and rural West, where most Republicans are from, the Encroachment Story has deep historic and psychological roots. Anti-Washington, anti-urban sentiment has characterized those cultures for decades.

It’s probably futile to try to change current Republicans. It’s smarter to build a new wing of the Republican Party, one that can compete in the Northeast, the mid-Atlantic states, in the upper Midwest and along the West Coast. It’s smarter to build a new division that is different the way the Westin is different than the Sheraton.

The second G.O.P. wouldn’t be based on the Encroachment Story. It would be based on the idea that America is being hit simultaneously by two crises, which you might call the Mancur Olson crisis and the Charles Murray crisis.

Olson argued that nations decline because their aging institutions get bloated and sclerotic and retard national dynamism. Murray argues that America is coming apart, dividing into two nations — one with high education levels, stable families and good opportunities and the other with low education levels, unstable families and bad opportunities.

The second G.O.P. would tackle both problems at once. It would be filled with people who recoiled at President Obama’s second Inaugural Address because of its excessive faith in centralized power, but who don’t share the absolute antigovernment story of the current G.O.P.

Would a coastal and Midwestern G.O.P. sit easily with the Southern and Western one? No, but majority parties are usually coalitions of the incompatible. This is really the only chance Republicans have. The question is: Who’s going to build a second G.O.P.?"

Rucker Also Is Co-Author Of', 'A Very Stable Genius', 'A No. New York Times Bestseller']","In the Clintons’ talk of brokering compromise, an implicit rebuke of Obama years","In recent stump speeches and policy remarks, Bill and Hillary Clinton have offered sharp criticisms of the partisan gridlock paralyzing Washington, signaling a potential 2016 campaign theme if Hillary Clinton chooses to run for president.

The Clintons’ critiques in recent days have been explicitly aimed at congressional Republicans, who helped spur a 16-day government shutdown and potential debt default in October. But their remarks also seem to contain an implicit rebuke of President Obama’s failure to change Washington as he pledged when first running for the White House.

The arguments suggest a way that Hillary Clinton could attempt to run in 2016 as an agent of change — potentially putting her at odds with the two-term Democrat she would be seeking to replace.

At campaign rallies and other recent appearances, both Clintons have called for soothing partisan tensions and have espoused a vision of governing by compromise. Barnstorming Virginia this week with longtime friend and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, Bill Clinton repeatedly assailed ideological politics on both sides of the aisle.

“When people sneeringly say, ‘McAuliffe is a dealmaker,’ I say, ‘Oh, if we only had one in Washington during that shutdown,’ ” the former president said at a rally here in Norfolk on Monday. “It’s exhausting seeing politicians waste time with all these arguments. It is exhausting. People deserve somebody who will get this show on the road.”

Such themes of change and comity are particularly ironic for the Clintons considering that one or the other has held public office in Washington for the past two decades. Bill Clinton’s tenure in office was also marked by fierce partisan battles that roiled the nation, including an impeachment fight and two government shutdowns.

In the 2008 Democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton dismissed Obama’s message of post-partisanship as woefully naive. But since stepping down as Obama’s secretary of state earlier this year, she has adopted a similar theme, repeatedly berating lawmakers for choosing “scorched earth over common ground.”

“We are careening from crisis to crisis instead of having a plan, bringing people to that plan, focusing on common-sense solutions and being relentless in driving toward them,” Clinton said last week during at a Center for American Progress gala.

Neither Clinton has brought up Obama directly in their remarks or explicitly criticized his leadership. Still, the Clintons’ general critiques carry echoes of the charges Republicans have frequently leveled against the current president: that Obama doesn’t respect their ideas and resists any compromise with them.

Obama has been making his own pleas for bipartisanship, even if they fall on deaf ears on Capitol Hill. “Now more than ever, America needs public servants who are willing to place problem solving ahead of politics,” he said at Wednesday’s memorial service for former House speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.).

The Clintons have been careful to distinguish between promoting bipartisanship and ceding ground on core values. Hillary Clinton, for example, has been busy advocating for traditionally liberal issues such as minority voting rights, gay marriage equality and women’s rights.

This appears to be an effort by Clinton, following a four-year hiatus from domestic politics, to cement ties to the Democratic Party’s progressive wing. If she runs, Clinton would want to avoid a repeat of the 2008 campaign, when Obama built support among liberal activists by running to her left on the Iraq war.

The Clintons’ message is one that Democrats across the country could carry into the 2014 midterm elections, where the battle for control of the Senate could come down to a handful of hotly contested races in states that lean Republican.

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D), who represents a Northern Virginia swing district, said after a recent McAuliffe rally that the message laid out by Bill Clinton would be “a really powerful theme into the next cycle.”

“We’re the party of governance,” Connolly added. “You want things to work? You have to eschew that hard-right, I-know-best ideology.”

In Kentucky, where Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R), Clinton recorded a video endorsing Grimes in which he says the nation needs more political leaders “willing to work together across the lines of party, geography and philosophy.”

“We have simply got to have more people who are willing to reach across the aisle and say, ‘I’m ready to work with you to build a better future,’ ” Clinton said.

In his Virginia speeches, Clinton said that he learned through eight years as president and 12 years as Arkansas governor that it’s important to advocate for your own philosophy but a mistake to not consider your opponent’s.

“When you’ve got a complicated set of problems with a lot of moving parts — and even Albert Einstein couldn’t give you the right answer to every question — the only thing that works is cooperation,” Clinton said Sunday in Dale City.

Principled compromise, Clinton asserted later that evening in Hampton, Va., is “a moral position.”

“It simply recognizes that nobody’s right all the time, your life is as important as mine, your opinion is entitled to the same respect mine is, and we’re all in this together, so we might as well work together to row this boat and go somewhere,” Clinton said.

Clinton’s presidency, however, was marred by plenty of partisan battles. Republicans torpedoed his health-care reform proposal and won control of the House midway through his first term. In 1995, a budget stalemate with the GOP-controlled House led to two separate government shutdowns. Three years later, the House voted to impeach Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

Nevertheless, Clinton credited his work across the aisle with balancing budgets and creating 22 million new jobs — and lamented the state of the country today.

“This economic thing, it’s terrible,” Clinton said in Hampton. “Median family income — after you adjust for inflation, is lower than it was the day I left office. That was a long time ago. And we need somebody who wants to do something about it.”

Many voters attending the rallies said they longed for a return to the Clinton era.

“He’s the voice of reason,” said Sally Mullikin, 52, a self-described women’s rights advocate from Richmond.

“We’re tired of the fighting,” said Eileen Slade, 63, a Democrat from Midlothian, Va., who was wearing a “Ready for Hillary” button. “We want compromise — whatever it takes to get things done.”

This is the sentiment that both Clintons have been channeling. At his Virginia stops, Bill Clinton repeatedly said the Founding Fathers wanted elected officials to be practical above all else, designing a system of governing that would force them to negotiate with each other.

“Read the Constitution of the United States of America,” Clinton said Sunday in Richmond. “It might as well have been subtitled, ‘Let’s Make a Deal.’ ”"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/12/justice-scalia-says-fits-right-in-in-texas/,2013-11-12 00:00:00,[],Justice Scalia says he 'fits right in' in Texas,"U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said Monday that if he weren't a Virginian he'd ""probably want to be a Texan.""

Swearing in new Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice Nathan Hecht before a packed state House chamber, Scalia said, ""I do fit right in here."" That came in response to Republican Gov. Rick Perry, who suggested in an address moments earlier that Texas and its fiercely conservative politics suited Scalia.

""We welcome you to Texas, sir,"" Perry told Scalia to applause. ""You would fit right in.""

Scalia was appointed to the nation's highest court in 1986, which makes him the longest-serving justice currently on the court. He now has come to Texas to administer the oath of office to the state's last three Supreme Court chief justices but joked that Hecht has been on the court since 1988 before assuming his new role.

""Judge Hecht has been on this court for 25 years and already he's chief justice,"" Scalia quipped. ""I've been on mine 27 with nothing to show for it.""

Scalia oversees the U.S. Fifth Circuit which includes Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. He also swore in new Justice Jeff Brown who fills Hecht's old slot and becomes the fourth one-time state Supreme Court law clerk to later serve on the court.

Hecht replaces Wallace Jefferson, who resigned last month to join a private law firm in Austin.

Perry, who has been in office since 2000, appointed Brown and named Hecht to his new post. The governor now has chosen six of the nine justices on the Texas Supreme Court, the state's highest civil court.

Addressing hundreds of judges, state officials and top attorneys in the House chamber Perry said: ""Today we can say, as we can every day in Texas, that God is good.""

Next year, Hecht is poised to surpass the late Joe Greenhill, who served on the court 25 years — 10 of those as chief justice — as the longest-serving justice on the state Supreme Court.

Hecht promised Monday to continue Jefferson's efforts to better ensure that all Texans have access to the court system regardless of economic background saying ""this is not a matter of politics, liberal or conservative, it is about good government.""

""I do not regard the position to which Governor Perry has appointed me as a career capstone,"" Hecht said, ""certainly not a headstone, but as a cornerstone for the work that lies ahead."""

Born In San Francisco', 'He S A Graduate Of Stanford University.']","For the GOP, rightward ho!","The Republican Party is at war with itself. It’s divided over how best to shrink the federal budget and how to undo President Obama’s healthcare law. It hasn’t been notably successful at either, which helps explain why the GOP’s standing in the eyes of most voters has plummeted to depths not seen in three decades of modern polling.

None of this was planned, of course; parties don’t flirt with political suicide on purpose. But it wasn’t accidental either. Behind the GOP crackup over the government shutdown lies a much bigger battle for control of the party.

And the most important actors aren’t Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and the tea party members of the House who brought us the government shutdown. The party rift’s chief driver is a constellation of hard-line conservative fundraising groups, led in part by a former senator most Americans couldn’t pick out of a lineup, Jim DeMint of South Carolina.

When DeMint resigned from the Senate in January to become president of Washington’s Heritage Foundation, many were mystified; he was abandoning a safe seat with four years left in his term, all to run an aging conservative think tank across the street.

But DeMint has quickly turned Heritage — especially its new lobbying arm, Heritage Action for America — into a powerful engine of pressure on Republicans in Congress to move further to the right and reject almost any form of compromise with Obama.

“There’s no question in my mind that I have more influence now on public policy than I did as an individual senator,” DeMint told NPR recently.

It was Heritage Action that focused tea party conservatives in the House on the idea of using this fall’s long-scheduled votes on federal spending to try to “defund” Obamacare, and the group then organized a summer-long campaign (starring Cruz) to publicize the idea.

Meanwhile, the Senate Conservatives Fund, a separate political action committee that DeMint founded, played the role of enforcer, publicly attacking GOP members of Congress who didn’t fall in line. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other Republicans broke with the hard-liners on a procedural vote, the fund accused them of “betraying their principles.”

“Nobody worked harder to fund Obamacare in the Senate than Mitch McConnell,” the group said in a statement posted on its website and emailed to donors

The drive to defund Obamacare hasn’t accomplished much so far, but that doesn’t appear to worry Heritage Action’s 31-year-old CEO, Michael A. Needham, who said last week that the group’s long-term goal was to transform the GOP, which he called “the allegedly conservative party.” The government shutdown, he insisted, was a step on “a path to electoral success.”

After Mitt Romney lost the presidential election last year, Needham told a group of reporters that “the Republican establishment’s response … [was] to raise taxes, pass amnesty [by which he meant immigration reform], pass gun control and not fight on Obamacare.” Instead, he said, “The Republican Party should start authentically leading based on the values that their voters have” and “become a more populist party … that stands up for core conservative values.”

In other words, the party should oppose new taxes, immigration reform, gun control and, of course, Obamacare.

Heritage Action’s one concession to pragmatism so far has been an announcement that it wouldn’t oppose a short-term measure to lift the federal debt ceiling while budget talks continued.

There have been insurgent movements in American political parties before, of course. Goldwater conservatives broke with the party’s mainstream in 1964, and antiwar liberals divided the Democratic Party during the Vietnam War.

Those earlier movements, like this one, aimed to change their own parties first, on the assumption that voters wanted a purer form of politics.

But here’s what’s different about DeMint and his allies: They are eager to target Republican incumbents, even to the point of challenging them in Republican primaries. In addition to calling out McConnell, the Senate Conservatives Fund has denounced Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), all of whom will face tea party primary opponents next year.

And DeMint is helping to build an impressive and apparently permanent infrastructure of fundraising organizations with the avowed goal of displacing the GOP’s traditional business backers. The goal, as Needham put it, is “to take on cronyism and the way K Street [lobbyists] run this town.”

But they should expect some push-back. Some of those K Street Republican lobbyists told me last week they were already organizing to support endangered incumbents, including McConnell, and plan to do some “primarying” of their own, funding moderate GOP challengers to several tea party members of the House, including two Michigan Republicans, Justin Amash and Kerry Bentivolio.

As a result, some of the toughest, most expensive campaigns in next year’s congressional election cycle may not be between Republicans and Democrats but in primaries that pit Republicans against each other — with the future of the GOP at stake.

Ronald Reagan, an icon to both sides in this fight, said to GOP volunteers in 1967: “There is room in our tent for many views. It is not your duty, responsibility or privilege to tear down or attempt to destroy others in the tent.”

Instead of Bolling conceding on election night after losing the primary and pledging to support the voters' choice, Bolling and many of his supporters have declined to support Cuccinelli, who after all did steal the nomination with a cheap trick instead of winning it fair and square. From the very beginning then Cuccinelli's nomination has borne a taint of fast dealings behind closed doors.

Having arranged for his own nomination, Cuccinelli then did something strange; he feigned complete disinterest in who would be chosen to be his running mates. In the case of the attorney general nomination, this did not present much of a problem; there were only two candidates and the nomination was decided on the first ballot, going to State Senator Mark Obenshain--a very, very extreme conservative, but reasonably presentable candidate.

The problem arose in the Lieutenant Governor's race as no fewer than seven candidates presented themselves for consideration. After a series of ballots involving all sorts of betrayals and embitterment, the RPV convention settled on Bishop E.W. Jackson, Sr., probably as flawed a candidate as could ever be imagined. At the time, it apparently never occurred to Cuccinelli to throw his support and endorsement behind a more viable candidate for lieutenant governor. Jackson has been an impressive drag on the GOP ticket ever since.

Fast forward to this week and Cuccinelli's call for a special session to deal with ethics. In making this request, Ken Cuccinelli was looking for a quick fix to his own ethics problem: a series of gifts from Star Scientific's CEO Jonnie Williams totaling about $18,000, not all of which was reported as it should have been. In addition, Cuccinelli held a block of Star Scientific stock which Cuccinelli held and did not report during a period time when Star Scientific had a million dollar tax dispute before Cuccinelli's office. Cuccinelli's conflict of interest with Star Scientific was so great he had to withdraw from providing legal advice to Governor Bob McDonnell in connection with McDonnel own ""Giftgate"" scandal with Star Scientific, costing Virginia's taxpayers more than $50,000 a month in legal fees.

Cuccinelli wants all of this to go away. His answer? A special session of the Virginia General Assembly. In Cuccinelli's short-sighted view, this is an ideal solution. Governor McDonnell calls the 140 members of the General Assembly together and in a few weeks' time, a new tough ethics bill is passed and signed into law by Governor McDonnell. Reform is achieved and Cuccinelli can claim credit because the special session was his idea. Cuccinelli becomes the ""Reform Guy,"" instead of the guy who came in second in ""Giftgate.""

What Cuccinelli didn't see is how his plan would never be accepted by his own party. Cuccinelli doesn't even seem to have coordinated his call for a special session with Governor McDonnell or the Republican leadership in the General Assembly. Both Governor McDonnell and Republican House leadership quickly responded to Cuccinelli in the negative. Why?

Well, for starters, Cuccinelli's quick fix would completely screw up Bob McDonnell's new strategy for dealing with ""Giftgate."" After months of stonewalling and denials, McDonnell got a new team of advisors and a new three-part strategy: 1) apologize; 2) give everything back; and 3) get out of town as much as possible: go on vacation, go to Afghanistan, and then go on tour around the state and hope everyone just forgets about you.

Cuccinelli's quick fix special session plan would require Bob McDonnell to come back to Richmond and wait around while the General Assembly debated ethics reform just across his lawn. And make no mistake, a special session on ethics reform would be all about Bob McDonnell all the time--every hearing, every committee meeting, every debate would center on what Bob McDonnell did or didn't do. No way Bob McDonnell is signing on for that--no way.

Of course, if enough legislators were willing, they could call themselves into a special session, but the Republican leadership in the House of Delegates aren't interested. House Speaker Bill Howell, House Majority Leader M. Kirkland Cox, and other senior Republican legislators aren't interested in Ken Cuccinelli's quick fix, and can you blame them? Ken Cuccinelli wants them to stop what they're doing, suspend their campaigns for re-election, stop fundraising (remember Ken, you can't fundraise while the General Assembly is in session), and come to Richmond for a couple of weeks to pull Ken Cuccinelli's ass out of the fire. All so Ken Cuccinelli doesn't have to reimburse Jonnie Williams for $18,000 in gifts. A special session of the General Assembly would cost at least $50,000 a day!

A special session would be a trap for House Republicans. Once in Richmond they couldn't go home again until they passed real ethics reforms. What if Senate Democrats decided to slow things down? House Republicans would be stuck in Richmond, unable to campaign or fundraise while their Democratic challengers were free to do both, all the while mocking the Republican incumbents for their inability to pass real reform.

And has Cuccinelli also forgotten that he would have to stop fundraising while the General Assembly was in session? Terry McAuliffe would be free to campaign, fundraise, and talk about Cuccinelli's $50,000 a day special session. If Republicans tried to end the special session before real reform was passed, Democrats could skewer them as the party that failed to pass ethics reform--a potential disaster for the GOP just before statewide elections for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and the House of Delegates. Is Ken Cuccinelli crazy enough to have believed that the Republican House leadership would walk into such a trap?

Bob McDonnell and the Republican House leadership have made certain that there will be no special session on ethics, and in rejecting Cuccinelli's call for one they have hung him out to dry. Ken Cuccinelli still has an ethics cloud hanging over his head, and now he looks like he is completely out of touch with his own party's leadership. All of this because Ken Cuccinelli won't cough up $18,000 to reimburse Jonnie Williams for the gifts he gave Cuccinelli.

No, Ken Cuccinelli is not a very skilled politician. He rode into office on Bob McDonnell's coattails in 2009. Thanks to ""Giftgate,"" Bob McDonnell no longer has any coattails to offer. As for his running mates, well he's trying his best to avoid E.W. Jackson, and it won't be long before Mark Obenshain will start trying to put some distance between himself and Cuccinelli. Ken Cuccinelli has driven the Republican Party of Virginia off a cliff . . . for $18,000.

His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",EJ Dionne: Chris Christie’s debate phobia,"“We are not a debating society. We are a political operation that needs to win.”

Thus did Chris Christie offer one of the most pregnant statements yet in the ongoing Republican argument over the party’s future. At the risk of sounding like one of those “professors” the New Jersey governor regularly condemns, I’d argue that these 15 words, spoken at a Republican National Committee meeting in Boston last week, raise more questions than they answer. Here are a few.

How do you decide on a winning strategy without debating it first? What is wrong with debating differences on policy and philosophy that people in political parties inevitably have? Don’t the voters expect to have some idea of what a party and a candidate believe before they cast their ballots — and doesn’t that imply debate? Doesn’t the phrase “political operation” risk implying that you are seeking power for power’s sake and not for any larger purpose?

There is also this: Isn’t Christie himself engaged in an important debate with Sen. Rand Paul over national security issues? There’s nothing academic about that.

One of two things is going on here: Either Christie knows he’ll need to have the debate he claims he wishes to avoid but doesn’t want to look like he is questioning fundamental conservative beliefs, or he really believes that the “I can win and the other guys can’t” argument is enough to carry him to the 2016 Republican presidential nomination he shows every sign of seeking. The latest signal came Friday when, under pressure from pro-gun activists, he vetoed a weapon ban he once advocated.

His target audience, after all, is an increasingly right-wing group of Republican primary voters who are unforgiving of ideological deviations. The last thing Christie needs is the sort of debate that casts him as a “moderate.”

Let’s stipulate that Christie is far less “moderate” than either his fans among Democrats and independents or the hardest-core conservatives seem to believe. Simply because Christie was nice to President Obama after Hurricane Sandy — at a moment when New Jersey needed all the federal help it could get — lots of people forget how conservative the pre-Sandy Christie was.

In 2011, he went to the summer seminar sponsored by the Koch brothers in Colorado, heaped praise on them and said, among other things: “We know the answers. They’re painful answers. We’re going to have to reduce Medicare benefits. We’re going to have to reduce Medicaid benefits. We’re going to have to raise the Social Security age. We’re going to have to do these things. We’re going to have to cut all type of other government programs that some people in this room might like. But we’re gonna have to do it.”

If I were on the right, I’d be taken with Christie’s skills at making conservative positions seem “pragmatic” and “practical.” Candidates who are perceived as dogmatic or highly ideological rarely win elections.

But here’s the problem: You can’t run as a pragmatic candidate if your party won’t let you. For Christie to win, he will have to convince the grass-roots Republicans who decide nominations that the party’s steady march rightward is a mistake.

Surely Paul, Ted Cruz and others among Christie’s potential opponents won’t let him slide by without challenging him hard — yes, “debating” him — about what he really stands for. Christie needs something more substantial than “You guys are losers,” even though he would relish saying it.

Mitt Romney’s experience in 2012 is instructive. He was a relatively pragmatic governor, especially on health care, and could have been a more attractive candidate than he turned out to be. Yet the dynamics of a Republican primary electorate that is short on middle-of-the-roaders pushed Romney away from his old self and toward positions that made him less electable. Faced with opponents to his right, he was reactive and drifted their way. In the end, it wasn’t clear who Romney was, other than the candidate who spoke derisively about the “47 percent.”

Those who understand how a “political operation” works know that genuine pragmatism requires a defeated party to engage in rethinking, not just repositioning. Bill Clinton laid out a detailed program and a set of arguments as a “New Democrat.” George W. Bush spoke of “compassionate conservatism” and challenged at least some of the most reactionary positions held by congressional Republicans.

Winning reelection this November by the biggest possible margin will buy Christie time. But eventually the debating society will beckon. He’ll have to be very clear, if not professorial, about the argument he wants to make.

The 5-4 ruling on Tuesday addressed a 1960s-era provision that largely singled out states and districts in the South -- those with a history of discrimination -- and required them to seek federal permission to change their voting laws.

The court ruled that the formula determining which states are affected was unconstitutional.

In doing so, the court potentially opened the door for certain states to proceed with voter ID laws and other efforts that to date had been held up because of the Voting Rights Act. Prominent among those are voter identification laws in Alabama and Mississippi.

Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott also put out a lengthy statement vowing to proceed with both a voter ID law and potentially a new set of redistricting maps without federal oversight.

More On This...

""Today's ruling ensures that Texas is no longer one of just a few states that must seek approval from the federal government before its election laws can take effect,"" he said. ""With today's decision, the state's voter ID law will take effect immediately. Redistricting maps passed by the Legislature may also take effect without approval from the federal government.""

Attorney General Eric Holder warned states against going too far. He said the Justice Department would not hesitate to take ""swift"" action against states looking to ""take advantage"" of the ruling.

He, like President Obama, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" in the decision, saying discriminatory practices live on and need to be addressed.

""These problems have not been consigned to history,"" Holder said.

Holder and Obama urged Congress to create a new formula.

""Today's decision invalidating one of its core provisions upsets decades of well-established practices that help make sure voting is fair, especially in places where voting discrimination has been historically prevalent,"" Obama said.

But their statements acknowledged that until Congress intervenes, officials' hands are largely tied when it comes to screening particular states.

The court effectively determined that the law, which Congress most recently renewed in 2006, relied on old data that does not reflect racial progress and changes in U.S. society.

""In 2006, the Act was reauthorized for an additional 25 years, but the coverage formula was not changed. Coverage still turned on whether a jurisdiction had a voting test in the 1960s or1970s, and had low voter registration or turnout at that time,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.

He clarified that the provision requiring advance approval of voting law changes -- known as Section 5 -- was not being struck down. Rather, the court found that the provision pertaining to the formula, known as Section 4, was unconstitutional.

The decision, though, challenges the overall practice of federal screening unless and until Congress addresses the formula.

The decision means that a host of state and local laws that have not received Justice Department approval or have not yet been submitted will be able to take effect.

Going forward, the outcome alters the calculus of passing election-related legislation in the affected states and local jurisdictions. The threat of an objection from Washington has hung over election-related proposals for nearly a half century. At least until Congress acts, that deterrent now is gone.

Roberts argued that these states and the conditions in them have ""changed dramatically"" over the years.

""The tests and devices that blocked ballot access have been forbidden nationwide for over 40 years. Yet the Act has not eased (Section 5's) restrictions or narrowed the scope of (Section 4's) coverage formula along the way. Instead those extraordinary and unprecedented features have been reauthorized as if nothing has changed, and they have grown even stronger,"" Roberts wrote.

The court warned of problems with the voting rights law in a similar case heard in 2009. The justices averted a major constitutional ruling at that time, but Congress did nothing to address the issues the court raised. The law's opponents, sensing its vulnerability, filed several new lawsuits.

The latest decision came in a challenge to the advance approval, or preclearance, requirement, which was brought by Shelby County, Ala., a Birmingham suburb.

The lawsuit acknowledged that the measure's strong medicine was appropriate and necessary to counteract decades of state-sponsored discrimination in voting, despite the Fifteenth Amendment's guarantee of the vote for black Americans.

But it asked whether there was any end in sight for a provision that intrudes on states' rights to conduct elections, an issue the court's conservative justices also explored at the argument in February. It was considered an emergency response when first enacted in 1965.

The county noted that the 25-year extension approved in 2006 would keep some places under Washington's oversight until 2031 and seemed not to account for changes that include the elimination of racial disparity in voter registration and turnout or the existence of allegations of race-based discrimination in voting in areas of the country that are not subject to the provision.

The Obama administration and civil rights groups said there is a continuing need for it and pointed to the Justice Department's efforts to block voter ID laws in South Carolina and Texas last year, as well as the redistricting plan in Texas that a federal court found discriminated against the state's large and growing Hispanic population.

Advance approval was put into the law to give federal officials a potent tool to defeat persistent efforts to keep blacks from voting.

The provision was a huge success because it shifted the legal burden and required governments that were covered to demonstrate that their proposed changes would not discriminate. Congress periodically has renewed it over the years. The most recent extension was overwhelmingly approved by a Republican-led Congress and signed by President George W. Bush.

The requirement currently applies to the states of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia. It also covers certain counties in California, Florida, New York, North Carolina and South Dakota, and some local jurisdictions in Michigan. Coverage has been triggered by past discrimination not only against blacks, but also against American Indians, Asian-Americans, Alaska Natives and Hispanics.

Towns in New Hampshire that had been covered by the law were freed from the advance approval requirement in March. Supporters of the provision pointed to the ability to bail out of the prior approval provision to argue that the law was flexible enough to accommodate change and that the court should leave the Voting Rights Act intact.

Ex-South Carolina governor seeks redemption after admitting extramarital affair

Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch has been competitive in GOP stronghold

Sanford held this seat in House from 1995 to 2001

WASHINGTON — Disgraced ex-South Carolina governor Mark Sanford won his bid for redemption on Tuesday night, defeating Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch for his old seat in Congress.

Sanford, a Republican who admitted an extramarital affair in 2009, was ready to quit politics for good if he was not victorious in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District. He will replace Republican Tim Scott, who was appointed to the Senate.

The former governor — once a rising GOP star considered presidential material — was an early favorite in the Republican district, which Mitt Romney carried by 18 percentage points in the 2012 election. But the revelation that Sanford's ex-wife, Jenny, accused the candidate of trespassing at her home caused the National Republican Congressional Committee to withdraw its support in mid-April and gave Colbert Busch an opening.

At his victory party, Sanford thanked the ""angels"" he met during the campaign and spoke of learning about ""human grace"" as reflected through a higher power. ""I just want to acknowledge a God not just of second chances, but of third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth chances ... because that's the reality of our shared humanity,"" he said.

Sanford must appear in Charleston County Family Court on Thursday on his ex-wife's complaint. It is not clear when he will be sworn in to office.

Colbert Busch, a businesswoman and sister of comedian Stephen Colbert, stayed competitive but a final Public Policy Polling survey two days before the special election showed a dead heat. A business development officer who worked in the shipping industry, Colbert Busch focused on her plans to create jobs and vowed she would be an independent voice for the district.

""The people have spoken and I respect their decision,"" she told supporters Tuesday night.

This was the first time Sanford was on the ballot since his admission in 2009 that he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail — when he was actually in Argentina visiting his mistress — became a punch line on late-night TV.

""I absolutely failed. Period,"" Sanford said in an interview earlier Tuesday on CNN, one of several he gave on Election Day. He told MSNBC that ""one event does not define your life.""

Sanford urged his friends and neighbors to help him spread the word about his ideas to curb the nation's debt and to send a message about his Democratic rival. He stressed that Colbert Busch received help from labor unions and liberal groups from outside the district, and tied her to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.

Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, chairman of the House GOP campaign committee, congratulated Sanford and made no mention of how the organization parted ways with the candidate. ""These results demonstrate just how devastating the policies of Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi are for House Democrats in 2014,"" Walden said in a statement. ""At the end of the day, running on the Obama-Pelosi ticket was just too toxic for Elizabeth Colbert Busch.""

Rob Godfrey, a spokesman for South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, said the governor congratulates the congressman-elect. Haley, who appeared at a fundraiser for Sanford last week, ""looks forward to working with him to bring jobs to the Lowcountry, fight job-killing unions, rein in out-of-control Washington spending, turn back Obamacare and strengthen the Charleston port,"" Godfrey said.

Democrats, meanwhile, saw a silver lining in Colbert Busch's efforts.

Rep. Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said the candidate's efforts will be an example of how the party will stay aggressive in the 2014 elections. Democrats need a net gain of 17 seats next year to win majority control in the House. Sanford's election does not change that equation.

""The fact that the Democrat made this competitive is a testament to the strength of Elizabeth Colbert Busch as a candidate and the Republican habit of nominating flawed candidates,"" Israel said. ""Democrats will be aggressive and drive deep into Republican-held territory this cycle to find districts with flawed candidates where we can compete.""

The House Majority PAC, which spent $450,000 on TV ads and direct mail to boost Colbert Busch, said the outcome in South Carolina reflects poorly on the GOP.

""The House Republican caucus has added yet another ethically challenged embarrassment who will be an albatross around the neck of every Republican forced to answer for Mark Sanford's embarrassing and reckless behavior,"" said Alixandria Lapp, executive director of House Majority PAC."

Bush's presidential library in April, former first lady Barbara Bush was asked how she felt about her son Jeb, the former governor of Florida, being a possible presidential candidate in 2016.

""We've had enough Bushes,"" Barbara Bush replied bluntly.

Her husband doesn't agree, at least according to Jeb.

In an interview that aired on Sunday's “This Week with George Stephanopoulos,"" Jeb Bush, who served two terms as governor of Florida, was asked what his father thought about his potential candidacy.

""What about your dad?"" ABC's Jonathan Karl asked the former Florida governor. ""Has he offered you any advice? Does he think you should run?""

""I think we've got a split ballot amongst the Bush Sr. family,"" Jeb Bush, 60, said with a laugh. ""Pretty sure that's the case.""

Jeb's brother, former President George W. Bush, has said he thinks Jeb should run for president.

Jeb, considered among several early contenders for the Republican nomination in 2016, has not ruled out a run for the White House, but says he won't decide until at least 2014.

""My thinking is not to think about it for a year,"" Jeb Bush said last month. ""Life teaches you that you need to make decisions in the right time—not too early, not too late. ... I'll check in maybe a year from now, 15 months from now, something like that.""

Earlier in the ABC interview, Jeb was asked about his 89-year-old father's failing health.

""I think it was hard at first for my dad to transition to being immobile,"" Jeb Bush said. ""[But] I think he's found the right balance. I think he's in a good place, he's mentally alert, he's funny as all get out. He's spiritually in a place that we should all envy. He's more comfortable with his age. And that makes me happy."""

WASHINGTON -- Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced on Monday another amendment to throw a wrench into the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill: tying it to voter ID.

The amendment, which he first announced on Twitter, is unlikely to make it into the eventual bill. Cruz voted three times -- once in the Judiciary Committee and twice on the Senate floor -- against moving the ""gang of eight"" bill forward even for debate, and is considered unwinnable as a ""yes"" vote for the legislation as a whole.

Still, he has attempted to add his own touches to the bill, such as stripping it of its path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The most recent amendment would touch on the equally contentious issue of whether would-be voters should be required to show identification to prove their citizenship before registering to vote.

I'll file amendment to immigration bill that permits states to require ID before registering voters & close this hole in fed statutory law. — Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) June 17, 2013

The Supreme Court ruled earlier Monday that states cannot require people to prove their U.S. citizenship before using a federal voter registration system.

UPDATE: 6:30 p.m. -- Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced an amendment later Monday aimed at addressing voter ID issues brought up by the Supreme Court ruling. According to a statement, his ""Secure the Vote"" amendment is meant to ensure immigrants do not vote until they become citizens -- they are already banned from doing so -- by providing ""new procedures to enable states to check that individuals gaining status or a work visa are not illegally registered to vote.""

""Not only would this amendment prevent voter fraud, it would also clear up the problem created by today's Supreme Court decision,"" Paul said in a statement. ""My amendment requires states to check citizenship before registering people to vote in federal elections."""

He has been popular in Iowa%2C earning favorability ratings in the 60%25 range

Senator chairs a key committee on health-care issues

He has served 27 years in the Senate and 10 in the House

Tom Harkin, Iowa's powerful Democratic U.S. senator, won't seek re-election in 2014, he told The Des Moines Register Saturday morning.

His retirement is expected to leave a huge void for Iowa, but clears the way for Democrats trying determine their lineup for the mid-term elections.

The next generation of Democratic candidates depended on whether Harkin, 73, chose to run again, party operatives have said. Rep. Bruce Braley is the favored replacement, Democrats have said.

""I have mixed feelings,"" said Harkin, who was born in Cumming and has served in the Senate for 27 years and in the U.S. House 10 years before that. ""You know what, it's somebody else's turn.""

He added: ""To walk away from this position and this power is not an easy thing. But I think it's the right thing. And I have two years left. I'm not passing the torch sitting down; it's a running relay. I intend to be very active over the next two years.""

The news was unexpected: Many leading Democrats thought Harkin would run again. He and his Republican counterpart, Sen. Chuck Grassley, 78, are a major force in the federal government.

Following Harkin's announcement, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada called the Iowan a ""pillar of the Senate"" whose ""work on behalf of people with disabilities has changed millions of lives and advanced the cause of equality for which he has fought tirelessly for decades.""

Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat, said in a statement: ""Tom Harkin comes from the heartland of America and represents the best of that region's values, combining strong convictions with a deep, personal humility.

""His hard work and abiding commitment to caring for one's neighbor has made him one of the Senate's most respected progressives,"" Schumer said. ""He will be deeply missed by senators on both sides of the aisle.""

Harkin is popular in Iowa, regularly earning job approval ratings in the 60% range in the Iowa Poll.

He is a big voice on social issues, and he has the ear of party leaders. Since Democrats control his chamber, he can move bills and tuck in an amendment here or there. He has left a thumbprint on agriculture, improvements for people with disabilities, health care and various progressive causes for decades.

Harkin shoulders an important assignment in the Senate: He's chairman of the HELP committee, which stands for Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, a huge jurisdiction. The No Child Left Behind education law and the 2010 health care reform law — the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare — originated there. Those assigned to this powerful committee generally aren't supposed to serve on other committees, but Harkin has taken on three others: agriculture, appropriations and small business.

Democrats have to defend 20 seats in 2014; the Republicans 14. Democrats currently have a 55-45 voting advantage, with two independents organizing with them.

Harkin is the third senator up for re-election to say he is not running again. His decision follows Friday's surprise announcement that Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., would not seek re-election. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., is also retiring.

Harkin's seat is likely to be in play in a swing state that Obama won both times.

A Virginia Republican delegate, Scott Lingamfelter, said that he received a robocall on Sunday night claiming that Cuccinelli supports ObamaCare and taxpayer funding of abortions. According to the Washington Free Beacon, the calls are believed to be an attempt to depress conservative voter turnout and to use pressure to boost voter turnout among Democrats in the final days of the race.

Rather than a supporter of those positions, Cuccinelli was the first attorney general in the United States to challenge ObamaCare in federal court and is adamantly pro-life.

A description of the robocall from Lingamfelter’s Facebook page claimed:

About 25 minutes ago (7:24 PM 3 November) the Democratic Party of Virginia dropped a robo-call (that they said they paid for in the recording) at MY house to try to tell ME that Ken Cuccinelli supports Obamacare and public financing of abortion!!! Virginia, pa-leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeezzz understand that the party that wants Terry McAuliffe to be your governor will flat lie about anything! If you want proof that they will say ANYTHING to gain power over you and your life, you need go no further than the “robo-lies” they are sending around Virginia this Sunday evening. They are shameless in their tactics. (I guess they are trying to suppress GOP voters.)

The Beacon states that neither Lingamfelter nor the Democratic Party of Virginia responded to questions about the robocall campaign.

In an update on its report of the story, LifeNews indicated that Cuccinelli himself has commented on the robocalls via an email sent out to his supporters:"

Later, the speaker said his daughter knew he had no intentions of stepping down, leaving questions about the attorney general's contention that she ""never planned to run"" if he remained as speaker."

As a result, the party will formally bar Republicans from partnering with the networks on any primary or Presidential debates in 2016.

Priebus wrote to CNN:

I find CNN’s actions disturbing and disappointing. Your credibility as a supposedly unbiased news network will most certainly be jeopardized by the decision to show political favoritism and produce an extended commercial for Secretary Clinton’s nascent campaign.

And to NBC:

I find this disturbing and disappointing. NBC cannot purport to be a neutral party in American politics, and the credibility of NBC News, already damaged by the partisanship of MSNBC, will be further undermined by the actions of NBC Universal executives who have taken it upon themselves to produce an extended commercial for Secretary Clinton’s nascent campaign.

The decision by NBC and CNN to produce a mini-series or film about the life of Hillary Clinton is indeed odd. They do not regularly produce films about major figures in American politics. Perhaps I missed it, but I don’t recall a network bio of former Secretary of State Condolezza Rice. I also haven’t seen films about NY Senator Kristin Gillibrand or First Ladies Laura Bush and Michelle Obama.

The RNC Summer meeting is August 14th. Unless the networks scuttle their plans to produce their Hillary Clinton films, Priebus will seek a binding vote by the full RNC to bar the party from partnering with, or sanctioning, any primary or Presidential debate with the two networks.

BOSTON -- Gallup, the company that has faced intense criticism after its polling consistently understated President Barack Obama's support during the 2012 campaign, shared details of its ongoing review of its election polling methods on Saturday.

Over a four-week period before the November 2012 election, Gallup's daily tracking poll showed Republican opponent Mitt Romney leading by margins ranging from 1 to 7 percentage points, including a 4-point Romney lead just 10 days before the election. Obama defeated Romney by a 51 to 47 percent margin.

Shortly after the election Gallup's editor-in-chief Frank Newport pledged to conduct an internal review of Gallup's telephone survey methodology. As promised, Newport reviewed on Saturday the kinds of studies conducted on issues including drawing samples, interviewing voters, and how to weight data and select the likely electorate. The company pledges to make the findings of its ongoing review publicly available.

Although much analysis is now complete and set to be unveiled June 4, the investigation awaits ""a major experiment"" in conjunction with the gubernatorial campaigns in the fall.

""We take it seriously"" when polls misfire, Newport explained on Saturday. ""We've been doing presidential polling since 1936 which is what put George Gallup on the map ...The results [in 2012] certainly were not what we wanted them to be from Gallup's perspective.""

Newport's remarks came during a private, on-the-record briefing in Boston attended by The Huffington Post, and a handful of other pollsters and academic researchers at the annual American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) conference.

Michael Traugott, a University of Michigan political scientist and survey methodologist retained by the company for the review, said he recommended broadening the scope and timing of the inquiry.

""Early on,"" Traugott said, ""Frank and I had a conversation, about trying to learn what we could from an investigation of the data"" collected during the 2012 campaign, ""but then using that information to design a series of experiments going forward.""

Traugott also said he recommended reviewing all of Gallup's methods and assessing the data collected before the 2012 campaign. ""We have been assembling data on presidential approval back to 2002 as a benchmark to look at the Gallup data in relations to other data and also party identification data going back.""

His analysis confirms, for example, that by ""a small but consistent amount,"" ratings of President George W. Bush ""were a little bit higher than the average"" of other pollsters ""and the Obama ratings were a little bit lower than the average."" Those findings are consistent with a Huffington Post investigation of Gallup's results published in June 2012.

Traugott also clarified that Gallup ""has agreed to make all of this information publicly available."" He stressed that both he and Newport, as former presidents of AAPOR ""are firmly committed to transparency. And this is an ongoing part of our relationship as well.""

When pressed on whether that included releasing raw respondent-level data, Newport said that although they are ""still making the final decisions, we think we'll try to make the data available as well."" Such data will allow other scholars and researchers to attempt to replicate Traugott's findings and test other theories. On Saturday, Newport also asked assembled AAPOR researchers for further input on a list of 20 specific parts -- virtually every aspect -- of Gallup's methodology included in the review.

While Newport declined to reveal specific findings from the review ahead of the June 4 announcement, he shared some new information.

One of the experiments, for example, checked on potential bias associated with the Gallup brand name by running a full ""shadow"" sample to a recent Gallup poll in which respondents were told the polster was ""Selection Research Incorporated,"" rather than Gallup. ""The Gallup name significantly increased the response rate,"" Newport said, but without producing differences in the demographics of the resulting sample.

Newport also explained that earlier this year, the company changed how it asks respondents to describe their race, replacing yes/no questions critiqued in last year's Huffington Post investigation with a question in which respondents could select more than one in a list of potential answers. That change allowed for a related modification to Gallup's weighting procedure. ""We think that's already had some impact on our data,"" Newport said.

It is difficult, Traugott explained, to reconstruct Gallup's problems ""retrospectively"" using the data collected last fall. Instead, he convinced Gallup to conduct experiments to determine if alternative methods would have produced different and more accurate results.

Because such experiments only make sense ""in the context of a campaign,"" Traugott explained, they decided to undertake them during the upcoming gubernatorial campaigns in Virginia and possibly New Jersey. He stressed that the experiments would only be used for further analysis, and would not be released publicly before the election.

Three academic survey methodologists are joining Traugott in the investigation: Chris Wlezien from Temple University, an expert in likely voter models; James Wagner from the University of Michigan, an authority in telephone survey operations; and Frauke Kreuter from the University of Maryland, an expert on sampling and weighting.

Shortly after the election, Newport speculated that ""it is likely that we could see significantly fewer polls conducted in the 2016 election."" Asked Saturday if he was signaling Gallup's intention to withdraw from polling in the next presidential race, Newport replied, ""Well, check back with us in 2016. I don't know what any polling organization is doing in 2016,"" given the increasing challenges to traditional pollster methods.

However, despite the months of criticism, Newport was upbeat about the potential for improvements with advances in technology. He spoke favorably about a future in which ""polling is augmented by non-probability data, administrative data, social media data.""

""I think it is an exciting time,"" he said later. ""Rather than doing things the same way in any business, it's always exciting when technology in particular opens up all these other opportunities."""

The GOP picked up 63 seats in the House and six in the Senate. And that was horrible. But the real damage was done at the state level, where they picked up 680 state legislative seats and 29 of the 50 governorships, including in key states such as Ohio, Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania. They also held absolute control in half the state legislatures.

Thus, Republicans were able to not just solidify their control of the House, where they maintain a 33-seat advantage despite losing the House popular vote by one point in 2012, but they locked in control of myriad state legislatures. And you can just scroll down this site to see the damage those wingnut legislatures are wreaking across the country. Thus, we can't allow a repeat of 2020. Republicans are on the wane. The only way they can retain power is via voter suppression or gerrymandering. We must deny them both those options.

As you can see with this map, most states still redistrict via state legislatures, subject to a governor's veto. We have found the last few cycles that when a state deadlocks on drawing boundaries, a fair map designed by judges ends up benefiting Democrats, and even if it doesn't, fair is fair. So gaining the ability to merely block a map is generally a net gain for us.

Winning back heavily gerrymandered state legislatures is not always impossible, but is far more difficult than merely winning back governorships. So how are races in 2014 relevant to 2020? It's all about the power of incumbency.

Learn more about the power of incumbency below the fold."

She Writes About News', 'Politics', 'Culture. Her Columns Appear On Wednesday', 'Sunday.

On Tuesday, using his own life as an example of the American Dream, Schwarzenegger argued for immigration reform during a panel discussion at his USC institute.

Also Tuesday, Shriver announced she would return to NBC as a “special anchor” focusing on women’s issues.

Which raises the question: Whose reinvention is working out better?

Since leaving office in 2011 and being forced to admit he had fathered a child with his family’s longtime housekeeper, Schwarzenegger, 65, has tried to recreate himself as the cartoonish movie action hero that brought him worldwide fame.

It’s been a bumpy ride.

Advertisement

He’s had occasional movie cameos and a big belly flop in 2012’s “The Last Stand.” Plans for a Stan Lee collaboration on a Saturday-morning cartoon-style character called “The Governator” fell through after revelations about his domestic treachery. And despite a truly extraordinary life, his memoir, which was billed as a “tell-all,” was panned by The Times as “almost completely devoid of self-examination.”

Maybe he’ll have better luck with a sequel to “Conan the Barbarian,” scheduled for release next year.

Producer Frederik Malmberg put Schwarzenegger in perspective in comments to Deadline Hollywood last year, apparently referring to the movie: “It’s that Nordic Viking mythic guy who has played the role of king, warrior, soldier and mercenary, and who has bedded more women than anyone, nearing the last cycle of his life.”

Schwarzenegger has also struggled to stay relevant on the political stage. He bought himself the shiny new Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy at USC, which has a very nice website and seems devoted to holding conferences and panel discussions that will keep his name in the news. Prof. Schwarzenegger — don’t laugh, he holds an academic appointment now — is good for the school’s fundraising, USC President C.L. Max Nikias told The Times last year.

Shriver, 57, whose work as the state’s first lady revolved around various women’s causes and family issues, such as Alzheimer’s research and the Special Olympics, has taken on the persona of struggling midlife everywoman.

It’s not entirely apt, given her status as a member of one of America’s royal families, her fame and her wealth.

Advertisement

But that lousy husband of hers has given her a new kind of cred. She knows from broken families and broken hearts. And despite the whiff of elitism that attaches itself to any Kennedy, she has been publicly trying to figure out this unexpected new chapter of her life in veiled but honest ways.

Her website is devoted to issues women care about, and her blog is relentlessly upbeat, even as she drops hints of her pain. One poignant photo shows a silver necklace with a ripped heart, its jagged edges stitched together with blood-red cord.

Advertisement

I tried in vain to find the word “Schwarzenegger” anywhere on her website. When she writes about her experience as California’s first lady, it’s as if she was elected to the job without having been required to be married to the man who was, in fact, the governor.

I don’t blame her for erasing him wherever possible. Was there a woman whose heart didn’t break for Shriver and her four children when The Times reported that their marriage had collapsed after Shriver discovered what her husband had done, in their own home?

Advertisement

What I do blame her for, though, is vouching for her husband on the eve of the 2003 election after six women told The Times he’d sexually groped them.

Many believe her assuring words swayed the race in his favor: “I’ve known this man for 26 years,” Shriver said. “I’ve been married to him for 17. He’s an extraordinary father, a remarkable husband, a terrific human being. He has the character to be governor, the temperament to be governor and he is a leader for all of you.”

Advertisement

Well, what would you expect a loyal wife to do? That, for sure.

But when it all came crashing down, she should have taken some responsibility as the enabler who foisted him off on the public as a man of character. She owed California an apology.

Advertisement

Still, when all is said and done, I’m on Team Maria. I wish her luck in her new job. I hope she finds some good stories to tell.

As for Schwarzenegger, meh.

Advertisement

When he was governor, I used to see him riding his bicycle at the Santa Monica beach. Surprised and delighted passersby would yell greetings.

The last time I saw him, a few months after the scandal, a group of middle-aged women out for their morning power walk noticed him whizzing by on his bike, security at his side.

“That’s Arnold,” one said. “Ugh.”

Newark Mayor Cory Booker (D) put talk of his likely U.S. Senate campaign and love of Twitter aside Tuesday night to engage in a ""Star Trek"" trivia contest while calling into a New Jersey radio station's pledge drive.

Booker competed with comedian and ""Daily Show"" correspondent John Hodgman in the contest on WFMU, a Jersey City-based radio station, around 11 p.m. Tuesday. The Star-Ledger first reported Booker's late night geek-a-thon Wednesday evening, posting audio of the 15-minute interview.

“John and I know the difference between a Vulcan mind meld and a Jedi mind trick,"" Booker told host Tom Scharpling when he was challenged to battle Hodgman in the trivia contest.

Questions included ""Star Trek"" trivia from the original series and the more recent incarnations. Booker was asked about the shirt color most likely to indicate a character will get killed. He said that while red is the prevailing guess, a recent statistical analysis he read showed it was yellow. Booker indicated he was pointed to the statistical analysis on his favorite medium, Twitter.

Booker's love of ""Star Trek"" was never a secret, sharing his inner Trekkie with his more than 1.3 million Twitter followers. During the recent South by Southwest conference, Booker engaged his Twitter followers in a ""Star Trek"" discussion before his presentation.

Booker has formed an exploratory committee for a 2014 run for the seat now held by retiring Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.).

A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll released Wednesday shows Booker with 50 percent of the vote in a hypothetical Democratic primary match-up against Rep. Frank Pallone, who received 4 percent and Rep. Rush Holt who received 7 percent. Neither Pallone nor Holt has announced a run for Senate, but Pallone is considered a likely candidate. State Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-East Orange) has also indicated that she is considering entering the Senate race."

Up to 700%2C000 attend ceremonies%2C fewer than half 2009%27s 2 million

Today%27s oath follows yesterday%27s official swearing-in

WASHINGTON — Facing a divided political system, economic troubles at home and continued unrest overseas, President Obama urged Americans to work together to ""face the realities of our time.""

""This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience. A decade of war is now ending. An economic recovery has begun. America's possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands: youth and drive; diversity and openness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention. My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it — so long as we seize it together.""

Obama's 18-minute inaugural speech touched on the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., education, gay rights, climate change, jobs and the swelling federal budget deficit, but it acknowledged polarizing politics that have divided much of the nation and thwarted problem-solving.

""Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life; it does not mean we will all define liberty in exactly the same way, or follow the same precise path to happiness. Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time — but it does require us to act in our time,'' Obama said.

""For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect.""

After watching the Inaugural Parade as night fell, Obama addressed cheering crowds at the Commander in Chief Ball and spoke by video to troops in southern Afghanistan. He then introduced his ""date,"" Michelle Obama, who danced with her husband in a ruby chiffon and velvet gown while Jennifer Hudson sang Let's Stay Together.

Earlier, Obama declared in tweets that ""our work begins today"" and vowed to ""finish what we started"" before arriving at the Capitol.

Obama adviser David Axelrod told CBS' This Morning that the speech was designed to focus on ""values and principles, not so much about programs and prescriptions.""

There was a minor blip when Obama was sworn in by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. In 2009, Roberts flubbed Obama's official swearing-in — prompting Roberts and Obama to repeat the presidential oath in a private ceremony to ensure there were no constitutional issues

On the steps of the Capitol, Roberts got it right Monday, but Obama appeared to stumble over the word ""states"" as he repeated back the words ""the office of president of the United States.""

Obama had officially been sworn in for a second term Sunday, in accordance with the Constitution, which requires presidential terms to begin Jan. 20.

Thousands began gathering in the dark, chilly predawn hours to see Monday's event, with up to 700,000 expected to flood into the city for his address, parade and other festivities.

They filled street corners and stood in long snaking lines all around the Capitol and surrounding neighborhoods. Blocks from where Obama would be inaugurated, people shuffled down streets, snapping photos before sunrise. Many wore long coats, hats, scarfs, earmuffs and sequined Obama hats.

Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter were in attendance, but former president George H. W. Bush, released Monday from a Houston hospital and recuperating from bronchitis, did not attend. Neither did his son, former president George W. Bush.

The Obamas attended a service at 8:45 a.m. at St. John's Church. It included prayers from pastors Joel Hunter and Luis Leon, followed by a blessing by Bishop Vacti McKenzie. ""Bless this administration with both favor and grace,"" McKenzie said. ""Give them the resources and people necessary to get the job done.""

First daughter Malia was in a playful mood as the family returned to the White House. As the president's limo pulled up, Malia sneaked up to surprise her dad, shouting ""Boo!"" as he got out. ""You scared me!"" he told her.

Around town, police and military authorities were part of a ubiquitous security presence, stretching from downtown to Metro train platforms in suburban Virginia and Maryland.

Coast Guard patrol boats were the only vessels plying the Potomac River. A large stretch of the river, from the Francis Scott Key Bridge to south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, was closed to commercial and recreational users as part of an elaborate inaugural security plan.

Federal and local law enforcement officials reported no arrests throughout the morning. Crowd numbers continued to run well behind the record numbers at the inauguration in 2009.

D.C. Metropolitan Police, FBI and Secret Service officials said security operations had encountered no serious problems through Monday afternoon.

""Things have run pretty smoothly so far,'' Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said.

U.S. Capitol Police spokesman Shennell Antrobus said there had been some ""medical emergencies'' but did not elaborate.

Transit officials said four stations were temporarily closed Monday afternoon because of crowding, causing major delays for people leaving the inauguration. At the L'Enfant Plaza station south of the National Mall, hundreds waited outside in massive bottlenecks as police temporarily barred entry. The line to get into the Judiciary Square station stretched a block, then wrapped around a corner.

Dionne Davis, 36, of Columbus, Ohio, woke at 4 a.m. determined to get as close as she could to the festivities without an official ticket. She watched the last inauguration at home, but decided this time she had to be here.

Davis traveled from a family member's home in Capitol Heights, Md., parked at the Metro and took a long train ride into the city. ""I just want to be part of history,"" Davis said. ""I want this to be something I can tell my kids and grandkids.""

Briskly walking down 3rd Street at 6:30 a.m., Davis said she was happy to brush shoulders with other people. She's ready for a long day and has supplies to prove it.

""We ate before we left, I took my vitamins, and I got my bottle of water,"" she said. ""I'm just excited. These are experiences that last forever.""

""What the inauguration reminds us of is the role we have as fellow citizens in promoting a common good even as we carry out our individual responsibilities,"" Obama told supporters during a reception Sunday. ""The sense that there's something larger than ourselves that gives shape and meaning to our lives.""

Obama begins his second term four years after inheriting an economic crisis and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The first Obama administration saw a national health care plan, a major stimulus bill, new financial regulations and an end to combat operations in Iraq, the winding down of the war in Afghanistan and the Navy SEAL raid that killed 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden in 2011.

Obama tangled with congressional Republicans who protested a record-setting rise of the federal debt, a slow-growing economy and a stubbornly high unemployment rate. Republicans still control the U.S. House.

As the president started a new term, throngs of well-wishers were in town.

Before 7 a.m., the Metro station closest to the Capitol building looked and sounded like a baseball stadium. Crowds flocked from trains and up the escalators, where they were greeted by vendors selling pins and posters while volunteers carrying ""ask me"" signs offered directions and greetings.

Vendors set up folding tables for several blocks along Pennsylvania Avenue behind the Capitol, selling trinkets ranging from Obama pins and T-shirts to knit caps embroidered ""Obama: Back 2 Back.""

""Good morning, welcome to the inauguration!"" a pair of volunteers sang out to the crowd.

DuWanna Thomas, a lawyer and consultant from Atlanta, was on an Orange Line Metro train headed to inauguration festivities by 6:15 a.m. She came to Obama's inauguration four years ago.

""This is very rewarding for me,"" said Thomas, armed with an Obama blanket and a small backpack with food. ""It's just excellent. He's the best president.""

Pam Johnson of Floyd, Iowa, was also on a Metro train by 6:15. She voted for President Obama twice and managed to snag a ticket to his second inauguration. ""This is an experience of a lifetime for me to be right here, right now,"" said Johnson, president of the National Corn Growers Association. ""When I found out the opportunity to go, I didn't want to miss it.""

Thomas Kannam, 8, came with his mom, dad and older sister. It's Kannam's first inauguration. ""I want to see the president,"" Thomas said, holding tightly to a blanket wrapped around his shoulders for warmth.

The New York African American Chamber of Commerce sent two buses with 56 people on each, according to Raquel Sanchez, 41, of New York. They arrived at around 5:45 a.m. Some were unable to put partisan politics aside.

""I hate the divide in the House and in Congress,"" said Stephanie Simmons, 59. Obama has struggled because Republicans won't work with him, Simmons said, which she said may be ""a black-white thing"" beyond regular partisan differences.

University enrollments have shown tremendous growth in the state

Young Virginia voters supported Dole over Clinton in 1996 but have gone heavily for Obama

In the gubernatorial race%2C Democrats face challenge of getting these voters to the polls

FAIRFAX, Va. — As an ugly gubernatorial race grinds to conclusion in Virginia, Republicans in the commonwealth face a growing demographic problem: young people.

Young voters in Virginia are a growing chunk of the state's electorate, and as a group, their politics have shifted dramatically in favor of Democrats over the past 15 years.

The question facing Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Ken Cuccinelli is whether they will show up at the polls in big enough numbers to matter next week.

Both campaigns are playing to their slice of the youth vote: McAuliffe campaigned with former president Bill Clinton in college towns across Virginia this week, including Blacksburg (Virginia Tech), Charlottesville (University of Virginia) and Harrisonburg (James Madison University). Cuccinelli appeared at Lynchburg's evangelical Liberty University — the fastest-growing school in the state — with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. on Monday.

In 1996, voters age 18-29 made up 15% of the state's presidential vote, and they voted for Republican Bob Dole over Bill Clinton, 49%-42%, bucking the national trend. That year, 53% of young people nationwide voted for Clinton, according to exit polls.

By 2012, the under-30 crowd had grown to 19% of the state's voters and their politics had shifted. They voted 61% for President Obama's re-election, 1 point higher than the national total for their peers.

""For young people age 18-29 there has been a dramatic shift in the voting and party identification,"" said Peter Levine, director of CIRCLE, a Tufts University research center on youth voting and civic engagement. ""Young people are dramatically more liberal in Virginia than they were in '96.""

In 2012, there were 1,162,000 citizens age 18-29 eligible to vote in Virginia, up from 979,000 in 1996 – a jump of nearly 20%. Part of this growth is reflected in significant increases in higher education enrollments in the state, which also tends to be a heavily Democratic constituency. The significant exception is Liberty, which went from 7,700 students in 1996 to 74,000 last fall, but only about 12,600 of these students are residential — most of the rest take classes online.

Overall, the ""fall headcount"" at Virginia colleges and universities grew from just under 342,000 in 1996 to just under 540,000 last year, according to data collected by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia.

Tod Massa, the council's director of policy research, said a recent study by the state predicted the total undergraduate enrollment would increase 9.6% though this decade. And student body expansion also means increases in staff, faculty, services and the economic footprint of the institution.

Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said the state is trending toward becoming reliably Democratic in statewide campaigns in part because of the academic presence. ""This is a state with a remarkably large number of college communities (that) are heavily Democratic and major employment magnets.""

Virginia overall has grown by more than a million people over the past decade. According to the Census Bureau, Virginia's population was 7 million in 2000 and about 8.2 million in 2012.

Craig Brians, a political science professor at Virginia Tech, said, ""those million people are not a random sampling of people — those are folks who are younger, more educated and they are more likely to be Democratic."" But he noted that young voters ""only vote at a 40-50% rate.""

For Democrats, the issue becomes getting the young voters to the polls, which is much easier during a presidential race than an off-year gubernatorial election.

But the state may be helping.

Fairfax County added a new polling precinct on the campus of George Mason University in 2011 to accommodate the university's dramatic expansion. Once a sleepy commuter college with no on-campus housing, the school now has 6,000 beds and a total headcount of around 33,000.

Fairfax County election manager Judy Flaig said the first year the polling place opened, ""there was a lot of publicity and we had maybe 1,800 or so"" students registered. Now there are ""about 3,000 students registered at that polling place"" and the county is anticipating about half of those will turn out to vote Nov. 5.

Tom Kramer, the executive director of Virginia21, a non-partisan non-profit that encourages student engagement in public policy, said that on campuses and college communities around the state, ""Voter registration is notably higher in 2013 than it was in 2009,"" which suggests that ""youth turnout in 2013 will be higher than it was in 2009.""

Mohammad Ahmad, a George Mason freshman who will turn 18 and vote in his first election this year, said he thinks students will vote in strong numbers. ""People are more interested in government now because of the shutdown,"" he said. Ahmad noted that many students have families in the area whose employment was directly affected by the battle over federal spending.

George Mason student Miranda Haynie, 18, agreed, ""I definitely noticed that,"" she said. ""Just in class – we had discussions about the shutdown, and it was all over the Internet."" Both Haynie and Ahmad say they plan to vote for McAuliffe.

Polls have shown McAuliffe, a businessman and Democratic fundraiser, has a consistent lead over Republican Attorney General Cuccinelli in a race that has been unrelentingly negative. Democrats have hammered Cuccinelli for accepting improper benefits in a scandal that has engulfed GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell and for his advocacy of strict anti-abortion legislation. Republicans have attacked McAuliffe for a series of questionable business deals, including an investment with a Rhode Island estate planner who has been charged with stealing the identities of terminally ill patients.

In an interview with the Dallas Morning News published Saturday, the freshman senator said he hoped to complete the legal procedure in 2014.

“I have retained counsel that is preparing the paperwork to renounce the citizenship,"" Cruz said.

Cruz released his birth certificate to the Morning News in August in an effort to curb speculation that he is not a natural born citizen (and therefore ineligible to run for president in the U.S.). However, the newspaper pointed out that the circumstances of Cruz's birth -- he was born in Calgary, Alberta to an American mother -- meant he likely retained citizenship in both the U.S. and Canada.

""Now the Dallas Morning News says that I may technically have dual citizenship,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""Assuming that is true, then sure, I will renounce any Canadian citizenship. Nothing against Canada, but I'm an American by birth and as a U.S. senator; I believe I should be only an American.""

Cruz, who was first elected to the Senate last fall, has stoked speculation that he will run for president in 2016 by making appearances in early primary states and courting major GOP donors at fundraisers.

However, in the Morning News interview, Cruz denied that his decision to renounce his citizenship had any implications for his political future.

""My political perspective is focused on representing the state of Texas,"" he said."

That's nine presidential elections. Democrats won five of them. Better yet, Democrats have won five of the last six.

Still, I'm confused... Republicans get to throw tenter tantrums because Reagan was once president?



They did win elections! I know the DICTATOR doesnt respect the PEOPLES HOUSE but all of those republicans were elected and most of them campaigned on getting rid of his crappy healthcare law. He speaks of bipartisanship but his actions are totally the opposite. When Obama says WE WONT NEGOTIATE, how is that being bipartisan? He acts like a spoiled child. The reason he wont negotiate is because he simply doesnt know how to. He has never worked anywhere in the real world. He is a community organizer. He only knows how to rant and rave, picket and complain and beat his opponents into submission. Its like dealing with a child who just pisses and moans until the parent gives in. Unfortunately its been effective with this republican leadership that has little or no spine.The left's idea of compromise is that they get thier way no matter what. Compromise to them is simply to tell our side the we're really lucky that they didnt scew us even more. For example they say: We wanted a single payer system but we compromised with this free market solution by allowing private companies to be the insurance providers. We on the right hear them say: We could have went full blown communist on you but we compromised and only went socialist/facist on you.

1. We are not a democracy, we are a Constitutional Republic. 2. This is not a winner takes all political system. 3. You can only draw from a poisoned well so many times.

The most loyal voting bloc for the Dems. is the bloc of freeloading, panhandling, gimmee, gimmee, bums. It is tough to beat Santa Claus.

If we ever have an honest election again, we need voter I.D., no illegal aliens, no dead voters, no one voting multiple times, no disallowing of the military vote, no district with over 100% voter turnout, you would not be so quick to say that

STFU. I am your lord and god and thou shalt not oppose me. I'm growing tired of this whining little boy who really believes no one should criticize him. Grow up Little Man. We had thousands of Americans who died to free us from despots and I'll continue to speak out as long I have breath in my lungs.

Phukin Ni****ER.

We did...they're called Tea Party Republicans in the House of Representatives. And there will be more after the 2014 mid-terms.

IMPEACH OBAMA NOW! This illegal alien has committed at least 50 impeachable acts against the Constitution. He is a walking Hitler incarnate who will murder millions of Americans with his ""change"".

Our national elections are as rigged as anything in Stalin's USSR! The illegal alien Obama was never elected...he was SElected, twice; and his agenda is the total destruction of the USA and the murder of tens of millions. This will allow the confiscation of all our wealth by the Jewish international banking cartel so they can invest in that slave labor nation, China. George Soros and his band of Hebrew gangsters are pulling all of Obama's strings. They are merely the latest in the continuing sacking of the wealthiest nations on earth and the murder of millions. HITLER was financed and set up by Jewish banksters on Wall Street; and so is Obama!

Obama: 'Go Out There and Win an Election' if You Want to Oppose My Agenda Well...those WI Democrat Senators didn't seem to get that message, Mr. President.

From the communist sneaker who stole into the first term by hiding his past, and stole into the second using the IRS to suppress his opponents. And now he wants an election crony in the military in charge of DHS. Posse comitatus, destroyed from the top. Time for the jackboots. Go to H377 you evil communist, Frank Marshall POTUS. Go to H377.

If Oblamo throws the gauntlet down, the least we can do is accept the challenge. We can start by primary'ing McConnell. Heck, even Ed Schultz wants McConnell around. Was slobbering over all the pork projects McConnell votes for.

Republican won 230 elections, ya dumba$$.

Hey, Mr. Community Organizer. Just because conservatives lost the election and you won doesn't mean that they will allow you to destroy this country. The inept and incompetent Obama as President is so far in over his head on doing the job someone needs to step in and do the job right or at least the way it should be done.

How about we just drag this fraud out of office and dispatch him as a traitor?

Those are the most evil eyes I have ever seen.

I think he really is the Anti Christ .....

Throw this guy out now while were still alive.

The Nuremberg trials will get this traitor sooner or later.

False flags will commence now , probably another this week for punishment .

He is evil.

Yeah, sure, go try to win an election now that the dims have hacked the electronic voting system and have a completely untraceable way to modify the election results in any county they so desire. Just a few close counties flipped is all it will take. So, go ahead, try to win against that.

I oppose you WITHOUT an election, you little puzzy!

Come and get me.

Hey Hey IRS

Look at what I said today!

The Black Socialist Dick #Obama and Ugly looking Communist Democrats are afraid of the ""New"" Tea Party taking over in 2016. Thanks to the Christian Extremists and the Almighty power of Jesus Christ the one and only King of ""ALL"" Kings & Lord of ""ALL"" Lords. Obama is a Loner!!!

Democrats NEVER compromise! Well, except that one time they compromised. And sure, it was a HUGE compromise because they did things the way WE wanted to, but, WHY WON'T THEY COMPROMISE?What about a well full of Tea Party Kool-Aid? When does that run out?Why do people vote for people who are generous and kind and beloved and dedicated to bringing joy to the masses and kinda jolly? They should vote for Genghis Kahn instead.Ithard to cover up evidence of five million undocumented immigrants and dead voters voting!Boy?How many ""g""s does that racist think is in that word?They won FIFTY elections in the House. Why won't Obama let them decide them everything?FIFTY? Adorable! Every teabagger member in the House chipped in with a fantasy impeachable act.It was right there on his ""issues"" page: the murder of tens of millions, and he wasselected president by the sheeple!You mean the ones that tried to effect change with ... elections?Go to hett?I don't think Obama was talking about pri-- Ah hell, that'swhat he was talking about: beating Mitch McConnell. Lamar Alexander too. And Susan Collins. You know what? Just go whole hog and primary all of them.With fewer votes than the Democrats who won about 201. Because that's what happens in republics, apparently.Why rehash the GOP's 2012 election message, given how poorly it performed?Obama: Win an electionTeabagger: Sorry no-can-do. Maybe sedition instead?He gave himself away when he fought for expanded access to health care. Only Satan would want such evil.It'll be pretty awesome when he's shipped back in time to 1946 to stand trial.Democrats are so incompetent that they have a system to rig elections in completely untraceable ways ... AND FORGOT TO USE IT IN THE HOUSE!IRS is busy. Can we stick you in a FEMA concentration camp instead?""Obama is kinda of anti-social!"" is the nicest thing any Breitbarter has said Obama ... perhaps ever?"

Tom Cotton announces campaign for Arkansas Senate seat,"First-term Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton announced Tuesday he's challenging Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, setting up what's expected to be one of the most expensive and heated U.S. Senate races in the country next year.

Cotton, 36, made his run official in front of supporters in his hometown of Dardanelle. He's the first Republican to announce a bid to unseat Pryor, who has served two terms and is widely viewed by the GOP as the most vulnerable Senate incumbent on the ballot next year.

The former management consultant, who served in the Army in Iraq and Afghanistan, was elected in November to represent Arkansas' 4th Congressional District, which stretches across the western and southern parts of the state. Pryor was first elected to the Senate in 2002.

""I'm running because I think Arkansas deserves a senator who stands with them and not with Barack Obama,"" Cotton told The Associated Press before his announcement speech. ""Mark Pryor, by his voting record over the last four and a half years, has proven that he now stands with Barack Obama, not with Arkansas.""

The campaign to unseat Pryor has already been well under way in Arkansas, with groups on the right and the left blitzing the state with television ads targeting the incumbent lawmaker. The groups airing ads against Pryor include the Club for Growth, which backed Cotton's congressional bid last year and has indicated it's prepared to assist him in the Senate campaign as well.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group founded by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has aired TV spots criticizing Pryor for voting against expanded background checks for firearms purchases. Pryor used his television ad of the campaign to respond to the group's criticism.

The ad blitz in Arkansas also focused on Cotton as he mulled a Senate run, with two Democratic political action committees running a spot accusing the congressman of seeking the national limelight at the expense of his constituents.

Pryor moved quickly to criticize Cotton after word of his expected run emerged last week, accusing the Republican lawmaker of alienating students, farmers and women since joining Congress in January. Pryor also launched a 60-second TV ad on Tuesday blasting Cotton's votes, while the state Democratic Party has created a website calling the congressman ""reckless.""

Pryor continued going after Cotton ahead of his announcement and said the Republican's votes showed he ""lost touch"" with Arkansas.

""The bottom line is he's not voting for us,"" Pryor told the AP on Tuesday. ""I don't know who he's voting for, but it's not the people of Arkansas.""

Pryor and Democrats have criticized Cotton for voting against the farm bill over objections to funding for the food stamp program. Cotton, who was the only Arkansas House member to vote against the farm bill, later voted for a revised version of the legislation that didn't include funding for food stamps.

Cotton dismissed the criticism, saying that Pryor had ignored the state's voters by supporting the federal health care overhaul.

""That's a sad and desperate attempt by a panicked politician to cling to power,"" Cotton said. ""If anyone has alienated the people of Arkansas, it's Mark Pryor.""

Cotton has also come under fire for voting against a student loan bill that was given final approval by the House last week.

Pryor is the only Democrat in the state's Washington delegation after Republicans made major gains in the state over the past two elections. The GOP won control of the state Legislature for the first time since Reconstruction in the November election, and swept all four of the state's U.S. House seats."

The noon appointment, which will be held in the President's private dining room, is closed to the press. The White House did not disclose the purpose of the meeting. However, as with anything related to Clinton these days, discussion in the media will likely circle back to one topic: 2016.

NBC is so confident Clinton will play a starring role in 2016, it just announced plans for a four-episode miniseries about the former Secretary of State, set to debut during the heat of the general election. A big-screen dramatization of the her life is also slated for a 2016 release.

Obama has not voiced support for a presidential candidate, laughing off the subject during an interview with Clinton on ""60 Minutes"" in January. The rare joint interview nonetheless triggered a frenzy of speculation about his preferences. Vice President Joe Biden, who previously sought the Democratic nomination twice, is also eying a possible run.

Clinton, for her part, has not signaled anything definite with regard to her presidential ambitions. Since stepping down as Secretary of State in February, she has kept busy delivering speeches to a variety of industry groups across the country, collecting $200,000 an appearance. She is widely considered the early favorite to win the Democratic nomination and polls ahead of potential Republican nominees."

http://news.yahoo.com/john-boehner-voters-8th-congressional-district-162828908.html,,[],"Embattled in the House, John Boehner draws mostly sympathy, support back home","John Boehner’s 8th Congressional District is a jigsawed chunk of southwestern Ohio that hugs the Indiana border to the west and runs north along Highway 127 from Hamilton through Eaton and Greenville before jutting east to Springfield. Significantly farmland — its largest cities are Hamilton with 62,447 residents, and Springfield with 60,608 — it eschews the Cincinnati and Dayton metro areas, and it provides an incumbent like Boehner plenty of political flexibility for his stances in Congress and re-election bids back home.

According to 2012 data from the Ohio Secretary of State’s office, 326,825 of its 468,484 voters are registered as “other” or are unaffiliated. Of the leftovers, 109,781 Republicans call Ohio’s 8th home, while only 31,878 Democrats live in its boundaries — a huge advantage for Boehner, who’s held the seat since Jan. 3, 1991.

In 2012 the Democrats didn’t even field a candidate and Boehner, running essentially unopposed, captured 99.97 percent of the vote. Earlier, he beat his primary opponent, David Lewis, by more than 5-to-1.

So how could a man with such a substantial political advantage run aground lately in battles over the budget and debt? First, and obviously, he’s contending with White House and Senate Democrats, but he’s also sparring with more conservative House members who have pushed Boehner into this stalemate.

Could his district be a microcosm of a fractured House? Numbers say no, but how do Ohioans feel about their representative and the House speaker — proud, upset, exhausted, hopeful, chagrined? This week, Yahoo News asked voters in his district to judge him specifically on how he’s handled the shutdown, the infighting with tea party Republicans and the across-the-bow bickering with President Barack Obama.

Here are some excerpts from what they wrote. Some residents shared their opinions before the House offered a deal on Thursday to raise the debt limit and possibly end the shutdown.

Mixed feelings for Boehner, caught in a tough spot

Story continues

Brian Smith dubs himself the “rare Democrat” in West Chester, north of Cincinnati. He’s lived in the area for 16 years and says when Boehner assumed the speakership, he felt pride for his neighbor and fellow Buckeye. But now he worries Boehner’s become dangerous. He writes:

The Speaker of the House is playing Russian roulette with the American economy in an effort to appease a minority of his majority in the House of Representatives and to hold onto his speakership.

But with the rise of the tea party within the Republican Party — and particularly within the House of Representatives — I began to feel a bit sorry for Boehner. I've thought him a reasonable man who knows how things get done in Washington, D.C. Trying to manage his caucus now, though, is like trying to herd cats. Not only do tea party representatives not understand how things in Washington work, they don't care if they work at all. Speaker Boehner is now caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place.

I am torn between feeling sorry for the man and feeling contempt for his blatant ambition, which is single-handedly putting the nation at risk. He could call a vote to end the stalemate today, and that would probably pass a clean continuing resolution and a clean debt limit, ending the shutdown and moving us back from the edge of another fiscal cliff.

But to do so he would have to violate the Hastert Rule, risk the wrath of the tea party and possibly lose his role as speaker. He could be putting his job as a congressman on the line as well, as he would risk someone running to the right of him in 2014's GOP primaries.

If he called for a vote, however, he would be a hero in my book, and I'd even consider switching over to vote for him in the primary.

Washington politics are child’s play — and that’s not a good thing

In the predominantly conservative areas of Miami County, which is just north of Dayton and west of Springfield, Maggie May notices her neighbors solidly backing Boehner. But she fears global perception of the scuffle between the House GOP and Democrats has been distilled to “a bunch of little kids arguing over a sandbox toy.” She writes:

Boehner has the right idea, executed poorly. To compromise with people who don't want to is just like dealing with a child. He is overseeing an understaffed ""daycare"" full of a bunch of whining, screaming people that are paid way too much not to compromise. And I feel sorry for him.

To get past this, let's give and take and, please, for God's sake, keep talking.

Quit fearing being re-elected as Speaker. Who cares? If he does his job with tact and a straightforward approach, he will have nothing to worry about. There's no risk, no reward — as history has shown only those bold enough to take a stand and offer a solution are the people who change the world.

I would like to say this to all of the lawmakers: The pawns are off the board. Stop using scare tactics like school cuts, the poor, children, elderly, sick and dying. It’s the knights and bishops that are really in play — big business, lobbyists, and your own pay and luxuries.

Stalemate a fool’s errand for GOP

Troy resident Charles Snee says he has major concerns about the Affordable Care Act, but he doesn’t believe shutting down the government will do anything other than sag down Republican poll numbers. He writes:

It's been disheartening to watch this deplorable spectacle unfold in Washington. There seemed to be a ray of hope earlier this week, when Boehner and the House Republican leadership began pivoting away from trying to defund the Affordable Care Act as a condition for passing a continuing resolution to reopen the shuttered parts of the government.

Boehner asserted on ABC's This Week that he didn't want the United States to default on its debt obligations. This is reassuring, but Boehner continues to press for spending and other concessions that the president and his Democratic allies will only consider after the government is fully opened and the debt ceiling has been raised.

Based on Thursday's news, it seems Boehner is now trying a divide-and-conquer strategy, by proposing a six-week extension of the debt ceiling, while still keeping the government partially closed. The intent, according to some of the more conservative hard-liners, is to couple taxes, entitlement reform and so on to the debt-ceiling debate, while linking the shutdown debate to the Affordable Care Act.

If that is the intent of House leadership, then Boehner ought to be forthright with the American people and say so.

This political trench warfare serves no useful purpose. At this point, I am still proud to be an American, but I am ashamed of my government. Mr. Speaker: It's time to dispense with the political brinkmanship and lead the nation out of this fiscal morass.

Obama ‘derogatory and dismissive,’ while Boehner rightfully stands pat

Julie Wallace of Butler County, which is north of Cincinnati, says she’s not a registered Republican, but she usually votes for the party. She opposes the Affordable Care Act and says she doesn’t believe it will have a positive effect on health care and insurance costs. She writes:

At no time in my life would I expect the type of shenanigans going on in Washington to be going on in Washington.

Speaker Boehner and the Republicans have said repeatedly that they do not agree with the Affordable Care Act. Speaker Boehner has made it clear that he and tea party Republicans in the House want spending cuts. Speaker Boehner and tea party Republicans speak for a large percentage of Americans on these issues. Yet, President Obama refuses to address or give value to their views, other than to say the government won't be held hostage. His public responses to these demands are derogatory and dismissive. Meanwhile, Speaker Boehner's tactics are the only way to get concessions.

On Thursday, he announced a new plan to address the debt ceiling. Again, he asks that the president and Senate Democrats come to the table. Earlier that day, the White House indicated the president would not fully negotiate with Republicans until the debt ceiling was raised and the government was reopened:

""Once Republicans in Congress act to remove the threat of default and end this harmful government shutdown, the president will be willing to negotiate on a broader budget agreement to create jobs, grow the economy and put our fiscal house in order.""

So basically what the White House is saying is, “Once I get everything I want, then I will be willing to talk.” What would be left to talk about? What leverage would be there to encourage negotiations?

It’s not just Boehner; it’s the government system, too

Chris Stevens, a 24-year-old Oxford resident, has voted against Boehner on every ballot. He says he realizes he’s not in the Republican majority in his town, and his dislike for Boehner — and Obama, too — has grown. He writes:

John Boehner is an arrogant, self-righteous, and selfish human being and politician. His actions are what is wrong with this two-party democratic system and his flaws are surfacing that feeling among Americans throughout the country.

The House of Representatives are divided and, as the Speaker of the House, Boehner has proven he cannot sit down and negotiate with anyone who doesn't agree with him. I admit I voted for President Obama in both elections, yet I have been thoroughly disappointed in how he has handled the divide as well.

After the shutdown is finished and when Boehner is up for re-election, again, I hope he is voted out of office. But when I look around and I see the type of people who have voted for him and have kept him in office, I know that will never happen. Boehner has played his cards so well … in this area that no matter what he says or does, he will come out ahead.

The issue here is not only Boehner, but the government system itself."
http://news.yahoo.com/morris-cat-runs-mayor-mexican-city-170928886.html,,[],Morris the cat runs for mayor of Mexican city,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — This mayoral hopeful in Mexico promises to eat, sleep most of the day and donate his leftover litter to fill potholes.

Morris, a black-and-white kitten with orange eyes, is running for mayor of Xalapa in eastern Mexico with the campaign slogan ""Tired of Voting for Rats? Vote for a Cat."" And he is attracting tens of thousands of politician-weary, two-legged supporters on social media.

""He sleeps almost all day and does nothing, and that fits the profile of a politician,"" said 35-year-old office worker Sergio Chamorro, who adopted the 10-month-old feline last year.

Put forth as a candidate by Chamorro and a group of friends after they became disillusioned with the empty promises of politicians, Morris' candidacy has resonated across Mexico, where citizens frustrated with human candidates are nominating their pets and farm animals to run in July 7 elections being held in 14 states.

Also running for mayor are ""Chon the Donkey"" in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, ""Tina the Chicken"" in Tepic, the capital of the Pacific coast state of Nayarit, ""Maya the Cat"" in the city of Puebla and ""Tintan the Dog"" in Oaxaca City, though their campaigns are not as well organized as that of Morris.

Politicians repeatedly rank at the bottom of polls about citizens' trust in institutions. A survey last year by Mitofsky polling agency ranking Mexicans' trust in 15 institutions put politicians and government officials among the bottom five. Universities and the Catholic Church were the top two, respectively.

Morris' cuteness, the clever campaign and promises to donate money collected from the sales of campaign stickers and T-shirts to an animal shelter has attracted cat lovers, but Chamorro said most of his supporters are citizens tired of corrupt politicians and fraudulent elections.

""Morris has been a catalyst to show the discontent that exists in our society,"" Chamorro said. ""Our message from the beginning has been 'if none of the candidates represent you, vote for the cat' and it seems people are responding to that.""

Story continues

Xalapa, a university city of 450,000 people, is the capital of the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, where residents have in last two years been beleaguered by drug violence, corruption scandals and the killings of at least nine reporters and photojournalists.

During last year's presidential election, a video posted on social networks showed a massive warehouse in Veracruz stuffed with election give-away groceries. Authorities also seized $1.9 million in wads of cash found when police decided to search passengers of a private plane arriving from Veracruz to Toluca, the capital of the home state of now-President Enrique Pena Nieto. Officials later said they had found no wrongdoing and the money was returned.

Giovanna Mazzotti, a 48-year-old university professor from the city of bright colonial buildings and steep streets, said she supports Morris' campaign and plans to go to a party for him being held Friday. The candidate is not expected to attend.

""In this state there is no rule of law, there is no respect for human rights, there are no institutions,"" Mazzotti said. ""It's great that this campaign is showing the fiction in our elections. Every three years politicians laugh at us, it's good to laugh at them a bit, too.""

Morris has a website, a Twitter account and a Facebook page with more than 115,000 'likes,' that makes him more popular in social networks than the five human mayoral contenders. Americo Zuniga, the candidate for the ruling party who is leading in election polls, had 33,000 Facebook 'likes' as of Friday.

His website has a collection of memes that picture Morris yawning while describing his ""ample legislative experience,"" an image that mirrors photographs of lawmakers sleeping during congressional sessions.

Morris' campaign managers are asking supporters to write-in 'Morris' or draw a cat's face on the ballot to send a message to authorities, who are not taking the cat's growing popularity lightly.

Members of the Electoral Institute of Veracruz this week called on voters not to waste their vote on a cat.

""We are asking for people to participate by voting for those citizens registered on the ballots,"" electoral institute president Carolina Viveros told local media this week. ""Everything else is part of expressions happening in social media and I respect that, but you have to vote for the registered candidates, please.""

Morris also has international supporters.

On Friday, the animal-welfare group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals wrote Morris congratulating him for his campaign.

Stubbs, a cat that has been the honorary mayor for more than 15 years of the sleepy Alaska town of Talkeetna, has shown support for Morris by posting his fellow feline candidate's spot campaign on its Facebook page.

Now the runoff between Garcetti and Wendy Greuel is well into the home stretch, and the candidates have been able to focus a bit more on their plans and programs, and on their critiques of each other. Garcetti remains our choice.

That’s based in large part on the records both candidates have compiled in city government over more than a decade, and less on the statements, charges, claims, counterclaims, missteps, outrageous mailers, misleading ads, high-profile endorsements and spending reports that have emerged in the course of the campaign. In theory, political campaigns can boil down candidates to their essences and put voters in a better position to distinguish among them and to make their choices, but it rarely turns out that way. In this race, as in so many others, the campaigns have produced more heat than light, more diversion than focus.

ENDORSEMENTS: Los Angeles City Elections 2013

Does the independent expenditure campaign underwritten by the union representing Department of Water and Power workers really mean that Greuel is “bought and paid for,” as Garcetti charges? Does Garcetti’s $1.25 per year in royalties from a petroleum lease at Beverly Hills High School really make him an oil tycoon who profits at the expense of children’s health? Did Greuel really propose an irresponsible police hiring binge that the city simply can’t afford? Was Garcetti, as council president, any more responsible than was Greuel, as city controller, for the rising unemployment rate in Los Angeles during the mortgage crisis and recession? Is Greuel a political climber who covered up her Republican past to be viable in an overwhelmingly Democratic town, and Garcetti a trust fund baby who has latched on to liberal causes for their cachet?

Oh, please. Enough already.

Cast aside the campaigns and look closely at their records, and both candidates emerge as earnest, ambitious and talented politicians, each of whom has made some good moves and some bad ones over the course of their careers, each of whom could have done a better job crafting city policy and safeguarding city resources.

WATCH: Garcetti video interview | Greuel video interview

But Greuel disappointed as city controller. It’s not that she didn’t do her job; she did, performing audits, unmasking some problems on her own, responding to others as they emerged, offering appropriately conservative estimates of revenue and careful critiques of spending. As a city employee, she earned a grade of “meets expectations.”

But she didn’t earn a promotion. Controller is a poorly named and loosely defined job in city government that nevertheless allows the woman or man holding the office to propose far-reaching revamps of policies and processes. In a government without political parties, the controller could and should be the loyal opposition, the gadfly in chief, the public advocate. Greuel always seemed to grasp the political value of purporting to find waste, fraud and abuse in City Hall but never was able to outline for Angelenos the larger narrative of what was going wrong or how things could be better. She found a contract that she believed should be renegotiated or a program that should be better supervised, but she didn’t tell the city, in essence, “Here is why building inspectors are being indicted, this is the reason the Housing Authority gets away with wasting money, here is how the mayor is mismanaging city departments and how the council members are failing in their oversight duties, and here’s what can be done about it.”

Garcetti, as council president, had a different role, but he did a better job with it. He was late to deal with the budget crisis, but he got there and, importantly, he then got his reluctant colleagues there as well, overseeing difficult budget cuts and taking the first tentative steps toward resolving the city’s pension problem. At the same time, he remade his district with innovative programs to deter gang crime, erase graffiti, house the homeless and provide shelter for the addicted and those in need of mental health services. He guided Hollywood to a renaissance and helped make it, once again, a geographic destination rather than merely the description of an industry headquartered across the city limits in Burbank.

Perhaps most important, Garcetti has demonstrated the capacity to grow, learn and improve his performance. He admits mistakes, such as his vote in favor of a settlement allowing, for a time, virtually unregulated digital billboards. Neither candidate has the executive experience one would like to see in a mayoral candidate. Greuel’s response, tellingly, is to cite her role helping to manage a small family construction business and to assert, and perhaps to believe, that it is sufficient.

Selecting a mayor may sometimes seem just as random as (and a lot less fun than) picking a winner on “American Idol,” but in the end it’s a hiring decision. Of the applicants, who is best suited to the job? Neither candidate is ready, but Greuel seems like a completed project that falls short of what’s needed, while Garcetti comes off as a creative work in progress with potential to meet the challenge. That makes the choice easy. It’s Garcetti."

I honestly don't know how to feel about this.

No Boehner, no Cantor. I honestly don't know how to feel about this.

Speaker John A. Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the House’s two most senior Republicans, were invited to speak at the 50th anniversary of the historic March on Washington — but declined. […] “They asked a long list of Republicans to come,” [civil rights activist Julian Bond] continued, “and to a man and woman they said ‘no.’ And that they would turn their backs on this event was telling of them, and the fact that they seem to want to get black votes, they’re not gonna get ‘em this way.”

Cantor, meanwhile, was asked 12 days ago to participate in Wednesday’s event commemorating Martin Luther King Jr.’s delivery of the famous “I Have a Dream” speech, according to an aide. The Virginia Republican, however, is currently traveling in North Dakota and Ohio, touring energy sites with Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., and participating in “nonofficial events,” according to an aide.

Conservatives complaining that the March on Washington anniversary celebration seems awfully partisan should note that they have only themselves to blame. Boehner instead spoke at a small Congressional ceremony. Eric Cantor's reason for not being there, though, is rather odd:Hmm. You know, when someone asks you to participate in the anniversary celebration of one of the most important inflection points of modern American history, you should generally say yes. You certainly shouldn't blow them off to tour North Dakota fracking sites, or whatever the hell he's claiming was more important.

That said, I disagree with Bond. I think declining a speaking spot was a perfectly appropriate choice on the part of conservative leaders, or at least the more intellectually honest one. Efforts to portray conservative reaction to the civil rights movement as anything less than hostile at the time (and hostile now) are insultingly dishonest, and having the community organizers, activists, spiritual leaders and labor leaders of that time putatively honored on the same spot by people like John Boehner or Eric Cantor, people who have open contempt for many of the goals expressed by those same leaders even now, might have been a bigger sin than any pretense at modern fluffy nonpartisanship could justify. Hooray that they were politely asked; hooray that they politely said no.

If Eric Cantor believes that it is more important to wander rural North Dakota in self-imposed exile than to show up to honor the 50th anniversary of one of the great moments and movements in American history, I am not about to argue with him. If only the rest of the conservative movement had even half as much self-restraint.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) won the Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll on Saturday, marking an early indicator of conservative support ahead of the next presidential election in 2016.

Paul topped the list and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) came in second, according to Ian Bishop.

Former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) came in third place this year, with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- who was notably not invited to this year's conference -- coming in fourth.

Paul received 25 percent of the vote, with Rubio in a close second with 23 percent. Santorum received eight percent, and Christie took seven percent of the vote.

The Hill's Alexandra Jaffe reports 2,930 registrants participated in the straw poll this year.

The annual straw poll came at the conclusion of the high-profile conference, which featured dozens of notable conservative speakers over three days at National Harbor near Washington, D.C.

Last year, Mitt Romney came out on top in the CPAC poll, foreshadowing his eventual nomination as Republican presidential candidate.

Former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas), a Libertarian favorite, took home the title in 2010 and 2011.

Reines has been known to defend and protect the former First Lady in his role as spokesperson and adviser to Clinton. But as the New York Times reports, that defense has extended to Abedin in recent weeks as revelations about her husband, former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), and his recurring sexting scandals came to light.

When a crew from People magazine came to the Weiner residence for an interview and photo shoot last summer, Reines was present. And minutes before Abedin was to appear at a nationally televised press conference, Reines was on the phone with her.

When Reines learned that Weiner had continued sexting after resigning from Congress over a conference call, he said he would ""reach through his phone"" to ""pull out"" his throat, the Times reports.

Abedin, an aide to Clinton since the former First Lady's White House days, has been in the spotlight as she stands her husband in his New York City mayoral campaign.

""Anthony has made some horrible mistakes, both before he resigned from Congress and after,"" Abedin said last week. ""But I do strongly believe that that is between us and our marriage. We discussed all of this before Anthony decided to run for mayor.""

Abedin recently returned to Washington, DC, where she has been spotted out with Reines. On Wednesday, hours after the New York Post reported that comparisons between the Weiner and Clinton scandals had the former first couple ""livid,"" Abedin and Reines were seen dining together.

Reines told the Times that he's known Abedin for over a decade.

“I’m not sure there’s anyone I’ve spoken to or spent more time with over that period,” he said."

Tea party leaders predicted that the shutdown strategy would result in a mass uprising against Obamacare, forcing the political establishment to defund or delay it. In fact, Republicans were broadly blamed for overreach and the law became (in some polls) more popular.

The reagent was added to the test tube. The reaction did not occur.

Conservatives who are not sobered are not serious. And those who insist that just a little more fortitude in the Senate would have turned the tide — causing at least six Democratic senators to switch their votes and the president to meekly accept defunding — have chosen to live in a pleasing political world of their own creation.

This is a serious setback for Republicans. It is not, however, the political apocalypse. The broader debate over Obamacare is favorable to its critics. Implementation problems increasingly seem structural, not technical. Americans are being compelled to join a system that was hastily designed, poorly tested and remains persistently dysfunctional.

And President Obama’s recent political victory was largely empty of substance. The Republican Party conducted a nervous breakdown in public — and the president won the status quo, with a four-month extension of the sequester.

Yet recent Republican problems are not temporary or cosmetic.

It is now clear that there is no functional majority in the House of Representatives. In the 1996 budget confrontation, Speaker Newt Gingrich was capable of making mistakes, but he was also capable of making decisions and setting Republican strategy. Speaker John Boehner, without the reliable support of perhaps a third of his caucus, has been unable to do the same. On some issues, including rational budget measures, a majority can be constructed only with Democratic votes.

Some Republicans blame Boehner’s passive leadership style. But the problem is not a lack of firmness or charisma. Recent divisions represent an escalation of tea party rhetoric and ambitions — not just an attempt to block Obamacare but an accusation that conservatives who oppose their approach are supporting Obamacare.

This is a strategic and tactical debate rather than a policy disagreement. But the result is no less bitter. Both sides of the GOP want to get rid of an unpopular law. One side believes in building a legislative majority and electing a president to overturn it; the other believes in making preposterous demands and blaming their Republican colleagues when these demands aren’t fulfilled. Tea party ideology involves questioning the character of Republican leaders — presenting them as cowards or coopted by the establishment or deceptive about their actual views. Republican leaders, in turn, naturally view the tea party caucus as politically irrational and irresponsible. Boehner has not bridged this gap. Perhaps no one could.

Will the tea party be chastened by recent defeat? Not likely, or not for long. Because tea party leaders inhabit an alternative political reality — sheltered in safe districts or states, applauded by conservative media, incited (or threatened) by advocacy groups, carried along by a deep current of anger and frustration among activists — they have no incentive to view defeat as defeat. In fact, turning against tactical radicalism would involve serious political risk. So every setback is interpreted as a need for greater purity and commitment.

This conflict is certain to bleed over into the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. The influence of a highly committed minority is exaggerated in small electorates. All the conditions for volatility will be present: voters embittered by recent defeats, a growing infrastructure of tea party institutions, a campaign finance system easily influenced by ideologically eccentric billionaires.

The trends that helped elevate a series of politically unserious Republican candidates in 2012 — including Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann — have grown only stronger. It is instructive how easily Sen. Ted Cruz has gotten to the right of Sen. Rand Paul. Who will be able to gather momentum to Cruz’s starboard? Ben Carson? Allen West? Republican primary voters tend to make more sober political choices in the end. But the process itself creates a durable image of radicalism and instability.

This leaves Republican governors as the most functional element of the party — and many are not only functional but impressive. They have the best prospect of making a tough critique of Obamacare while proposing a credible alternative. But the longing for a great leader is also a form of confession: that a divided party is in need of saving.

Koch said his only shock was that it happened so soon, citing Obama’s nomination of former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel to be defense secretary, according to The Algemeiner newspaper.

Is it true? Did Koch really say that?

“I did say it,” he told me Tuesday, adding he was making a point about why he had endorsed Obama, despite such misgivings.

“People don’t really change when you get to his age,” the former mayor said of Obama. “So I had no doubt that with the course of time, his new strength would weaken.”

[pullquote]

Still, he insists, “I don’t regret supporting him. I believe it bought time . . . I’m just sorry it was so short-lived.”

Now it was my turn to be shocked. Not over the fact that Koch thinks Hagel is a disaster for America and Israel. I agree. Rather, I’m shocked that Koch is shocked at Obama.

How could he not see that the betrayal would be instant?

Except during his two campaigns, Obama consistently tilted away from Israel and toward its enemies. His uncertain policy toward Iran, which has threatened to wipe Israel off the map, has unnerved many Israelis and Americans, and his antagonistic attitude toward Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sealed the impression of hostility.

Koch is no stranger to Obama’s history, but takes a more pragmatic view, one leavened by the president’s personal charm in a private meeting they had.

“He’s not anti-Semitic, he’s not anti-Israel,” Koch told me. “He has a philosophy of getting Islamic nations close to the US, even if it means creating tension with Israel.”

He believed Obama would win re-election and that support would earn his views a hearing. He also credits Obama for rejecting full Palestinian statehood at the United Nations, and for helping Israel during its fight with Hamas.

“He stood like an oak in support of Israel,” Koch declares.

Or maybe that was the price Obama had to pay for support in the campaign. My view is that, now that he’s got four more years, with about 65 percent of the Jewish vote, Obama’s free to stop pretending—and to nominate Hagel.

Obama didn’t pick him despite Hagel’s dovish views on Iran, hawkish views against Israel and eagerness to cut our military. He picked Hagel because of those views.

Remember what Obama told the Russians — he would have “more flexibility” once he never again had to answer to voters. Well, welcome to the Mideast Reset.

Similarly, Obama’s choice of John Brennan to head the CIA isn’t a clumsy breach of liberal faith. The Bush administration’s use of water boarding on three murderous detainees was deemed torture by Obama, and Brennan, who was part of the Bush team, got his job in the Obama White House by claiming he had opposed water boarding.

Whatever the truth, under Obama, Brennan blessed the drone killing of hundreds of foreign fighters. So, he went from fake drowning to fatal droning, and is now considered Grade A to leftists who called Bush a Nazi.

It’s all part of the Obama double standard, where down is up — if he says so.

Elections have consequences, none more than this one. With Obama free from voter accountability and blessed with weak and divided opponents, America better be prepared for even more radical policies, sweetened with semantic fakery.

Take his priceless introduction of Hagel. “Chuck represents the bipartisan tradition that we need more of in Washington,” Obama said. That sounds like one thing but means another, because Obama’s definition of bipartisanship is when Republicans agree 100 percent with him.

Hagel, by endorsing Obama in 2008, fits the definition. Ergo, he’s bipartisan and, by picking him, Obama is, too.

And both are friends of Israel.

Story highlights New York Times issues mayoral endorsements Primaries are Sept. 10 General election winner will replace Bloomberg

(CNN) —

The New York Times on Saturday endorsed Christine Quinn, a Democrat, and Joseph Lhota, a Republican, ahead of the primary elections to determine who will run to succeed New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The endorsements by the renowned newspaper could have substantial influence on the September 10 primary elections for each party.

Quinn, the City Council speaker and one of seven Democrats in the primary race, “offers the judgment and record of achievement anyone should want in a mayor,” the newspaper said.

“She has shepherded through important laws protecting New Yorkers’ health, safety and civil rights, including measures banning public smoking, protecting tenants and small businesses, and battling slumlords. She sponsored the sweeping 2007 legislation that made the city’s exemplary campaign-finance laws even stronger,” the Times endorsement said.

The newspaper gave credit to two other Democratic candidates, Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, and former comptroller William Thompson Jr., but said the editorial board had already been set to endorse Quinn even before what they believed was her impressive performance in a debate Wednesday.

“We are honored to have the endorsement of the New York Times. The endorsement makes clear that Christine Quinn hasn’t just talked about being a progressive, she has a long record of fighting for New York’s progressive values and she has delivered results every step of the way,” said Mike Morey, spokesman for the campaign.

According to the latest NBC 4 NY/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey released on August 16, de Blasio and Quinn are currently tied in the polls. If no candidate obtains the required 40% of the vote, the top two will hold a runoff on Oct. 1.

The crowded Democratic field includes former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner.

The Times called Republican candidate Joe Lhota, once right-hand man to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former chairman of the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority, “the best qualified of the three men seeking the Republican nomination for mayor.”

“Few people know better than Mr. Lhota how city government works. He was an expert budget director for Mr. Giuliani, and then became deputy mayor for operations,” the Times said.

“In 2011 and 2012, he ran the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which, under his leadership, recovered amazingly quickly from the damage done by Hurricane Sandy,” the paper said.

CNN’s Greg Botelho contributed to this report."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/06/harry-reid-nuclear-option_n_3029000.html,2013-04-06 00:00:00,"['Deputy Managing Editor', 'Breaking News']",Harry Reid: 'Nuclear Option' On The Table In Judicial Nominations,"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Friday that he will consider enacting the so-called ""nuclear option,"" or changing Senate rules by a simple majority vote, if judicial nominations do not start moving through the Senate, Roll Call reports.

During an interview with Nevada Public Radio, Reid warned that he was willing to make drastic changes to Senate rules if action is not taken on the ballooning number of stalled judicial nominees.

“All within the sound of my voice, including my Democratic senators and the Republican senators who I serve with, should understand that we as a body have the power on any given day to change the rules with a simple majority, and I will do that if necessary,"" Reid said.

""If the Republicans in the Senate don’t start approving some judges and don’t start helping get some of these nominations done, then we’re going to have to take more action.""

The ""nuclear option"" was floated by Reid during filibuster reform talks earlier this year. If taken, the simple majority vote would override the precedent of requiring a two-thirds supermajority to change filibuster rules. However, Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) instead agreed to a scaled-back reform deal in January after Republicans pushed back on Reid's threats.

""No party has ever broken the rules of the Senate to change those rules. I'm glad such an irreparably damaging precedent will not be set today,"" McConnell said in a statement in January.

However, Reid's latest comments signal that the precedent may be broken if action is not taken soon on the stalled judicial nominations. As The Washington Post reported earlier this week, 15 nominations are currently awaiting a vote on the Senate floor, including 13 nominees who already cleared unanimous committee votes.

In the Nevada Public Radio interview, Reid also pointed to Republican obstruction of Richard Cordray's nomination to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“We have not been able to confirm a person for that job. They refuse to allow us to bring that up, and -- and he was recess-appointed. Now, we have the Republican-dominated D.C. Court of Appeals who have said, 'look, the president can’t even do recess appointments now,'” Reid told NPR in January of Cordray's nomination. “So, we’re left with few alternatives, and we’re going to have to move forward and do something to change that.”"

The decision, with its lopsided vote, is not an indication that the court will always be sympathetic to claims of voter suppression. Its decision on the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is expected by the end of the month, and it may limit what its supporters say is an important tool in protecting minority voters.

Nor has the Supreme Court been uniformly hostile to Arizona’s efforts to address what lawmakers there say is a crisis in illegal immigration. Last year, it upheld one part of a tough 2010 state immigration law even as it endorsed broad federal power over immigration. In 2011, it sustained a different law that imposed harsh penalties on businesses that hired illegal workers.

On Monday, Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority in Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, No. 12-71, said a federal law requiring states to “accept and use” a form displaced an Arizona law requiring various kinds of proof of citizenship.

The law, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, allows voters to register using a federal form that asks, “Are you a citizen of the United States?” Prospective voters must check a box for yes or no, and they must sign the form, swearing under the penalty of perjury that they are citizens."

It was nearly 11 p.m. when Terry McAuliffe took the podium to deliver his victory speech. With 99% of precincts reporting, McAuliffe had captured 47.4% of the vote. His challenger, Republican Atty. Gen. Ken Cuccinelli, a tea party favorite, won 45.5% of the vote.

A week ago, a Washington Post poll showed McAuliffe with a 12-point lead.

Democrats had hoped the election would strike a decisive blow against the tea party, sending a message to the GOP that ideologically extreme candidates were not electable in swing states. Instead, the takeaway is murky.

Cuccinelli was outspent nearly 2 to 1. Some Republicans are sure to argue in coming days that he could have won if only he had a little more support from GOP donors.

PHOTOS: Election Day 2013

Voters were not particularly enamored with either candidate as both campaigns put most of their effort into launching attacks. McAuliffe joked in his victory speech, “I think every single person in Virginia is glad the television ads are over.”

McAuliffe, a former national Democratic Party chairman, had positioned himself as a moderate in the campaign. He focused his remarks on the need for bipartisanship and for making “Virginia a model for pragmatic leadership that is friendly to job creation.”

But both his speech and Cuccinelli’s concession, which preceded it, highlighted how divided the battleground state is likely to be for some time on major national issues.

Cuccinelli referred to Obamacare as an “out-of-control healthcare law” that he would continue to fight. “This battle is not over with this race,” he said. “It goes on and it will continue to go on.”

McAuliffe, for his part, highlighted his plan to aggressively implement the healthcare law in Virginia, with a major expansion of the state’s Medicaid program.

“It was perhaps the clearest issue voters had in this election,” he said. “We need to accept the Medicaid expansion and bring the Virginia taxpayers’ money back to Virginia.”

Mitch McConnell, and to begin unveiling her own positions in the high-profile Kentucky Senate race.

With an icy smile, the 34-year-old Grimes scoffed at the notion that she was philosophically or politically close to President Barack Obama, who is so unpopular here that he is mentioned by Kentucky Democrats fewer times than Voldemort ever was at Hogwarts.

“The president and I disagree on a lot of things,” she said. “Sen. McConnell will use the same tactics that the GOP has used in other red states, and try to claim that I was a cheerleader for President Obama.

“Well, I am as much a cheerleader for President Obama as Sen. McConnell is a Chippendale dancer.”

It was funny -– and definitely not nice. Even the thought of the doughy, 71-year-old McConnell in a dancer’s outfit might be enough to cost him a sixth term.

In a wide-ranging, half-hour interview, Grimes, the Kentucky secretary of state and presumptive Democratic Senate nominee for 2014, told me that she was pro-choice down the line on abortion, and that she would delay the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that small businesses provide medical coverage to their employees.

The two statements were her first substantive comments on policy matters. Until now she has spent most of her time attacking McConnell as the embodiment of all that is corrupt and unproductive about Washington.

The interview took place on the eve of the 133rd annual Fancy Farm Picnic, a church-sponsored day of politicking and speechifying on a rural expanse in the far-western Purchase region of Kentucky.

Grimes is one of five daughters in a devout Catholic family in Lexington. “I am a practicing Catholic,” she told me. “But I’m also for separation of church and state. I am supportive of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. And I think that this is the kind of choice that has to be up to the woman, her God and her doctor.”

On the Affordable Care Act -– Obama’s signature legislative measure -– Grimes was cautiously critical. “I am troubled by some of the provisions,” she said, and for the first time said exactly which one.

“There are 700,000 businesses in Kentucky and I am concerned that especially the smaller ones are overburdened,” she said.

Her suggestion: delay the imposition of the coverage mandate on small business, as the president already has done for larger corporations.

“The mandate will not work for many small businesses in Kentucky,” she said, “so I believe that a delay is the right course so that changes can be made.”

She also blasted McConnell for wanting to abandon the law altogether, pointing out that the state’s health ratings are among the worst in the nation, and that other provisions in the law will extend coverage to an estimated 600,000 more Kentuckians.

“Unlike Sen. McConnell, I don’t want to throw the baby out with the bath water,” she said. Of course McConnell is being blasted by tea party conservatives for his refusal -– so far -– to sign a letter that would force the issue by tying the next budget and debt-ceiling bills to the “defunding” of the ACA.

“He has a tightrope to walk,” Grimes observed, not sympathetically.

Her opening gambits on the issues are revealing for what they show about her beliefs and the strategy -- disagree with Washington Democratic orthodoxy when she can; hew to it when it is useful.

A pure pro-choice view is a must in the Democratic Party, if for no other reason than so many women activists are motivated to vote for –- and work for -– the party because of their strong belief in that view.

Grimes clearly wants to tap the fast-growing power of women in the Democratic Party, a phenomenon with a surprisingly long history in Kentucky politics.

She stressed the female mentors in her life -– a teacher who taught her rhetoric, her mother and grandmothers, her four sisters. She proudly stated that she is the “youngest female secretary of state in the nation.”

It sounded like a rather obscure claim when she made it at the Marshall County Bean Supper in nearby Kentucky Lakes on Friday night.

But it drew a big round of applause -– even bigger than the one Marshall County Judge/Executive Mike Miller got when he auctioned off a donated “whole hog” for $350.

Her speech was primarily sound-bitten attacks on McConnell. It was well received, if only because Democratic loyalists deeply despise McConnell.

But to win -– she is in a dead-heat in some recent polls –- she will have to come of age on the fly in the midst of a grueling, 15-month race from here to November 2014.

Nobody really knows who she is or what she really stands for, but she began the process of saying so Friday night.

http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/30/how-immigration-reform-and-demographics-could-change-presidential-math/,2013-04-30 00:00:00,['Nate Silver'],How Immigration Reform and Demographics Could Change Presidential Math,"A bill to allow unauthorized immigrants to gain citizenship carries electoral risks and rewards for the Republican Party. On the one hand, if the bill were passed, some of those immigrants would eventually vote. Roughly 80 percent of illegal immigrants are Hispanic, and about 10 percent are Asian — groups that voted heavily Democratic in the last two elections.

On the other hand, such legislation could plausibly improve the Republican Party’s brand image among Hispanics and Asian-Americans, perhaps allowing the party to fare better among these voters in future elections. Which of these effects would outweigh the other?

The answer is not necessarily obvious. As Harry J. Enten of The Guardian points out, such immigration reform is unlikely to create an electoral “bonanza” for Democrats, as some faulty attempts to analyze the question have concluded. But whether the legislation could be net-beneficial to the Republican Party depends on the assumptions you make.

So, I’ve designed a tool, in the form of an interactive graphic, that allows you to make different sets of assumptions about immigration reform, population growth and racial voting patterns. Although the graphic contains a number of simplifications, we hope it will be useful to experiment with.

The graphic begins with 2012 voting results as a baseline. In each state, and the District of Columbia, I’ve estimated the vote for Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in the five racial categories (white, black, Hispanic, Asian and “other”) that are tracked in exit polls.

Because the exit poll data is incomplete — 19 states did not have exit polls last year, and the polls often did not break down the results where a racial population was small (for instance, Asian-Americans in Montana) — I had to rely on various forms of extrapolation and interpolation to fill in the missing data points. My research suggests, for example, that the share of the Hispanic vote going to Mr. Obama in each state was modestly correlated with the share of the white vote he won in those states, while his share of the vote among African-Americans and Asian-Americans was not correlated with the white vote and instead was relatively constant from state to state.

The estimates are slightly more speculative in states where no exit polling was conducted in 2012. But because a complete set of exit polls were conducted in 2008, it was reasonably easy to extrapolate the results forward based on the overall shift in the vote in each state from 2008 to 2012, and the changes in national voting patterns among the different racial groups. The estimates are calibrated, however, so that the whole matches the sum of the parts: if you add up the estimated voting results among the five racial groups in each state, the results should exactly match the overall vote totals for Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney last year.

The interactive graphic then allows you to make three sets of assumptions to consider how the vote might change going forward.

Step 1: Population Growth

Immigration reform is being contested against a background of an increasingly nonwhite electorate. Seventy-two percent of voters were white in 2012, down from 74 percent in 2008 and 81 percent in 2000.

The graphic allows you to consider the effects of further population changes by entering growth rates for the five major racial groups. As a default, it assumes that the number of white voters will grow by 0.5 percent a year, the number of black voters by 1 percent a year, the number of Hispanic and “other” voters by 3 percent a year and the number of Asian voters by 3.5 percent a year. These figures represent a rough consensus of various population growth estimates.

Note that these changes are measured on an annual basis, rather than per election cycle, and that the changes will compound over time. If the number of Hispanic voters grows at 3 percent a year, for example, the total increase in Hispanic voters would be 12 to 13 percent by 2016.

The graphic also allows you to select the year in which the hypothetical election would be contested — population growth will have a larger impact the further you go out in time. (As a default, I’ve chosen 2028, which would be the first presidential election after the proposed 13-year path to citizenship.)

The calculation assumes that the growth rate among each racial population will be the same in each state — that is, if the Hispanic population grows by 3 percent a year nationally, it will grow by 3 percent a year in California, by 3 percent a year in Alabama, and so forth. However, because fast-growing racial groups represent a larger share of the population in some states, these states may grow faster over all. The graphic will automatically reapportion electoral votes based on these population growth estimates. (We may introduce the ability to make more sophisticated assumptions about population changes in future versions of the analysis.)

Step 2: Unauthorized Immigrants

The graphic also allows you to consider the effects of legislation that would introduce new citizens to the electorate. These changes are assumed to have a one-time effect: that is, they would affect the status of the roughly 11 million unauthorized immigrants who are already in the United States, but not future groups of immigrants. The calculation assumes that this impact is separate from the long-term changes in the voter population evaluated in the previous step.

The graphic requires you to estimate what percentage of that 11 million would become citizens under the new legislation, and what percentage of those new citizens would vote. Based on the research cited by Mr. Enten, we use 50 percent as a default value in each case. That is, half the unauthorized immigrants would become citizens, and half of those new citizens would vote, meaning that 25 percent of unauthorized immigrants would eventually become voters. But these assumptions can be changed.

You can also choose how to allocate the new citizens among the five racial categories. A majority of immigrants here illegally are Hispanic, but not all of them are. Instead, based on a variety of sources, I estimate that 80 percent are Hispanic, 11 percent Asian, 5 percent white, 2 percent black and 2 percent other races. The graphic assumes that once these immigrants became citizens, they would vote Democratic or Republican in the same proportions as other members of their racial group.

Step 3: Changes to Racial Voting Patterns

Finally, the graphic allows you to evaluate the effects of changes in the share of votes going to each party from each racial group. The changes are assumed to be uniform across states. So, for example, if your assumption is that the G.O.P. does five percentage points better with Hispanics nationally than it did in 2012, the Republican share of the Hispanic vote is assumed to grow to 44 percent from 39 percent in Florida, to 23 percent from 18 percent in Illinois, and so forth.

Note that the graphic can be used to evaluate the effects of any of these three steps independent of the others. For instance, if you are interested in seeing how the G.O.P. might have done in 2012 had it performed significantly better among Hispanics, but without considering the effects of population growth or immigration reform, you can set the election year to 2012 and zero out the values for the number of illegal immigrants who would become citizens.

One Potential Scenario

The most interesting application, however, is in seeing how the various positive and negative effects for Republicans might play out against one another.

Suppose, for example, that the voter population grows in accordance with the defaults assumed in the model. This would produce a net of 6.3 million new votes for Democrats by 2028.

And suppose that 25 percent of the immigrants currently here illegally gain citizenship and vote by 2028. The model calculates that this would provide another 1.2 million votes for Democrats.

But suppose also that, as a result of immigration reform, the Republicans go from winning about 28 percent of the Hispanic vote and 24 percent of the Asian vote (as they did in 2012) to 35 percent of each group by 2028. That would shift about 4.8 million votes back to the G.O.P. — about four times more than it lost from the immigrants becoming citizens and voting predominantly Democratic. However, it wouldn’t be enough to outweigh the Democratic gains from long-term population growth.

Different assumptions, naturally, will yield different results. In general, however, you should find that population growth and changes in racial voting patterns will have much larger effects than how the current group of unauthorized immigrants is treated.

The high-stakes question, in other words, is whether immigration reform would really allow Republicans to improve their vote share substantially among Hispanics and Asians, without costing them too many votes among white voters. If so, that is where the electoral “bonanza” might lie."

At various points, some of the participants even got a little testy.

Basketball legend Magic Johnson backed Greuel, saying that he selected the city controller because of her broad range of experience in the public and private sectors, her longtime ties to the African American community and the historic nature of her candidacy to be the city’s first female mayor.

“We love this woman because she loves us. We love this woman because she’s been in our community many, many years and the fact that she’s going to get the job done,” Johnson said, standing alongside a broad cross-section of religious, civic and elected leaders at a church on Crenshaw Boulevard.

“Wendy, I am in your campaign ready to go door-to-door with you,” he said. “We want to make sure you are the next mayor. We’re going to make history like we did for President Obama.”

Garcetti, meanwhile, picked up the backing of City Councilwoman Jan Perry, who said she chose her fellow council member because of his track record — and to send a message to special interests that spent millions of dollars supporting Greuel in the primary.

“There has been and there will be a tremendous amount of money donated to one candidate in this race from various special interests and I believe that we need to take a stand to let everyone know that the city of Los Angeles cannot be bought,” said Perry, who unsuccessfully ran for mayor this year.

Although Perry did not mention Greuel by name in her remarks, she could not hide her disdain for the controller as she took questions from reporters. During the primary, Greuel slashed at Perry’s personal financial background in the closing days of the race. Greuel called her after the primary, and Perry said she did not return the call. She paraphrased poet Maya Angelou in explaining why: “Dr. Angelou says, ‘Thank you for letting me know who you are.’ So I’m clear. I understand. I got the memo. It was clear to me that I didn’t need to engage in any false pretenses because that’s not who I am,” Perry said.

“The memo says I do not respect you and that I respect you so little that I would delve into your personal background and then mischaracterize it to boot and then buy time with my own campaign money and put it on websites all over the country,” Perry said. “Instead of dealing with substance, she went to the personal. That was not necessary.”

Greuel brushed off the criticism.

“We are public figures. Everything we are doing is [an] open book as people are making choices about the future,” she told reporters after her news conference. “I received a lot of blows during this campaign, during the beginning. This is for the public to decide.”

Earlier, while thanking Johnson for his endorsement, she flubbed the sport played by the former Lakers point guard who is now part-owner of the Dodgers.

“It is so important to me be endorsed by Magic Johnson, who has been giving back to this community all his life,” she said. “We know a lot of celebrities come and go. This celebrity, this leader has been a person who has stayed in this community and given back.”

“I grew up, Magic, watching you play baseball,” Greuel said, as the crowd interrupted to correct her that Johnson had played basketball.

“You did everything right, I thought baseball too. See, I was thinking Dodgers today. Yay Dodgers!” she said, clapping her hands. “He can do everything. So five NBA championships, new ownership for the Dodgers, millions invested in our community, and an inspiration for Angelenos all across Los Angeles on dealing with the issue of AIDS. And [he has] been an amazing friend, particularly here in South Los Angeles. You have never forgotten.”

Garcetti said he was “so very proud” to receive Perry’s nod, saying that the councilwoman brought a strong independent voice to the mayoral primary and the two shared a passion for revitalizing communities block by block.

“There’s a clear difference in this race. While others are running on rhetoric, we’re a campaign of results. Voters can see the results themselves,” Garcetti said. “No matter how many attacks people made against Jan or me, just walk the streets of our districts, just see the jobs on the streets, the cranes downtown, the cranes in Hollywood…. That’s what Jan Perry and I are going to do together when I am mayor … in South Los Angeles and citywide.”

Perry came in fourth in the primary, receiving nearly 16% of the vote with heavy support among African American voters in South Los Angeles. If those supporters vote as a bloc in the runoff, it could place Garcetti or Greuel within grasp of victory.

Since the March 5 primary, the candidates have been heavily competing to roll out endorsements, with Greuel snagging former President Bill Clinton on Monday. Garcetti and Perry on Thursday questioned the value of Greuel’s big-name endorsers such as Clinton and Johnson, questioning what kind of influence they have with city voters — church groups, neighborhood councils and the like — as they make a decision.

“I admire Magic Johnson very much. He’s a great role model, he’s a tremendous athlete, he’s a great businessman, he’s a very wealthy man, a member of the Guggenheim organization. And, you know, I don’t know if I’d call that grass-roots, but it’s OK,” Perry said. “And I’m happy that he’s wealthy. I have a lot of love for him.”

Johnson bristled at this remark, saying that he has deep, long-standing ties to South Los Angeles.

“I’m not a celebrity. I’m a man of this community, and a businessman, and so people know that,” he told reporters. “I’m the one who started all this business. When you look on Crenshaw, I started that, with that Starbucks down there.”

“I’m the one who started redevelopment in South Los Angeles, not Jan Perry. I did it,” he said. “I love Jan. She’s a good person and she did a wonderful job with what she did downtown, but in L.A., South L.A., I’m the one.”

Late in the day, primary contender Kevin James — who finished third just ahead of Perry — emailed his backers asking them to recommend whom, if anyone, he should endorse.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/27/Ken-Cuccinelli-Is-Virginia-s-Libertarian-Choice-Too,2013-10-27 00:00:00,['Dr. Susan Berry'],"Ken Cuccinelli Is Virginia's Libertarian Choice, Too","Though Robert Sarvis is the announced Libertarian candidate who is reportedly pulling 10 percent of the vote in Virginia’s gubernatorial race, Republican Ken Cuccinelli likely has more to offer libertarians in the state than Sarvis. Libertarian Ron Paul and his son Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) think so, and both have endorsed Cuccinelli.

Political analyst Tim Carney of the Washington Examiner, who often espouses the libertarian viewpoint, wrote Friday that Cuccinelli “would arguably be the most libertarian governor in the United States if he wins on Nov. 7,” a point that contrasts sharply with the fact that libertarians are attacking him.

As Carney observes, Cuccinelli, as Virginia’s attorney general, was the first to challenge the constitutionality of ObamaCare’s mandates, taxes, subsidies, and infringements upon liberty.

As governor, Cuccinelli’s plan is to cut the state income tax rate by 15 percent for individuals and 33 percent for corporations, creating an environment that is ripe for the free market.

But libertarians should take note that Cuccinelli’s style is more “pro-economic growth” and less “pro-business,” as evidenced by the fact that his state’s business lobby has had its feathers ruffled by his stand against corporate welfare. Cuccinelli opposed the tax hikes that were sought by Northern Virginia developers to pay for roads and public services, and he pledged to cut the tax credits for special interest groups.

In addition, Cuccinelli fought, while a state senator, to protect second amendment rights and, consequently, has an “A” rating from the NRA. He also opposed smoking bans when serving as a state senator.

As Carney states, “Cuccinelli also often chooses government restraint over ‘law and order.'”

Not afraid to oppose his own party, Cuccinelli, was the only Republican to vote against an expansion of the death penalty in 2009, even during a competitive primary for attorney general.

Cuccinelli’s strong character was visible in his unwavering effort to exonerate Thomas Haynesworth, a black man who was wrongly convicted of rape and jailed for 27 years. Cuccinelli argued successfully to obtain a rare “writ of actual innocence,” which was possible because as a state senator, he had advocated for a law that would make such exoneration easier.

Carney questions why, with Cuccinelli having libertarian bona fides, Ed Crane, former president of the Cato Institute, and other libertarians are supporting Sarvis and spending $300,000 on his campaign?

He suspects, he says, that identity politics plays a role:

I asked Sarvis why a libertarian should oppose Cuccinelli, and the first words out of his mouth were “social issues.” Crane’s only critique of Cuccinelli when announcing the $300,000 buy for Sarvis: “Ken Cuccinelli is a socially intolerant, hard-right conservative with little respect for civil liberties.” Cuccinelli is undoubtedly conservative. He’s an observant Catholic with seven children and a home-schooling wife. He’s a hero to the pro-life cause and an opponent of gay marriage. Libertarians, as a rule, support gay marriage, and most libertarians are pro-choice. But pro-life views fit within the libertarian framework: If you believe an in utero baby is a person, and if you believe the government has a legitimate role in protecting the innocent from violence, it’s logical to restrict abortion. And Cuccinelli, while unwavering in his moral opposition to abortion, is a moderate among Virginia Republicans when it comes to government restrictions on abortion: He worked behind the scenes trying to remove a GOP-created requirement that women undergo an ultrasound before getting an abortion.

Carney gets to the crux of the matter, however, when he asserts, that “social liberals’ attack on Cuccinelli conflates his personal conservatism with his policy views.”

The fact is that, while Cuccinelli might not personally agree with a law, he knows his job is to uphold the laws in his state. So, when he prosecuted a 47 year-old sexual predator who had sex with a minor, he defended his state’s “Crimes Against Nature” law but did not attempt to “ban sodomy” or homosexuality, as his critics say. He also has never attempted to “ban contraception,” as Planned Parenthood and its minions have charged.

As Carney contends, Ken Cuccinelli may personally live a conservative lifestyle, but his record as both a state senator and attorney general is one that demonstrates that liberty is worth fighting for. Shouldn’t libertarians respect his choice to live as he does, while he also works to keep Virginians free?"
http://news.yahoo.com/new-book-details-how-obama-questioned-his-own-ability-to-run-for-re-election-191039012.html,,[],New book details how Obama questioned his own ability to win re-election,"After President Barack Obama’s mediocre first debate performance against Mitt Romney in 2012, he reportedly told advisers, “I just don’t know if I can do this,” when they urged him to turn around his re-election campaign.



In “Double Down,” journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann say that Obama followed up his presidential debate by conducting a “dismal” mock debate with then-Sen. John Kerry.

“If we don’t fix this, we could lose the whole f------ election,” Obama adviser David Plouffe reportedly said following the mock debate.

Obama’s advisers attempted to shift his tone and approach in advance of the second presidential debate, leading Obama to respond, “I can’t tell you that ‘Okay, I woke up today, I knew I needed to do better, and I’ll do better.’ I am wired in a different way than this event requires. … I just don’t know if I can do this.”

For her part, Michelle Obama reportedly did not suffer from the same reservations as her husband, telling a group of female Obama campaign donation bundlers that the president had lost the first debate only because “Romney is a really good liar.”

It was the second such detail revealed from “Double Down” in recent days. On Thursday, an excerpt from the book revealed that Obama advisers explored the possibility of replacing Joe Biden on ticket with Hillary Clinton.

And while that excerpt also detailed the continually strained relationship between Obama and Bill Clinton, Saturday’s excerpt details how the former president was brought in to help Obama prepare for his second debate with Romney.

At a fundraising debate four days after the first debate, Bill Clinton reportedly told Obama, “Don’t try to make up the ground you lost. … Just be yourself.”

Specifically, Clinton warned Obama to not try to compensate for his seemingly detached first debate performance by becoming too aggressive in the rematch.

Plouffe then tried to put the challenge in perspective for Obama.

“You’ve got basically 75 to 80 minutes left of doing this in your entire life. That’s less than the length of a movie!” Plouffe said. “I know it’s unnatural. But that’s all. That’s the finish line, you know?”"

A new HuffPost/YouGov poll suggests that Americans would be split over whether that was a good thing.

According to the poll, 40 percent of Americans would approve of the president nominating an atheist to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, while almost as many -- 38 percent -- said they would disapprove.

The suggestion that Breyer might be a nonbeliever was sparked by a remark he made last week during oral arguments in a case involving government-instituted prayer at public meetings. After Justice Antonin Scalia asked a lawyer in the case what would be the equivalent of prayer for a nonreligious person, Breyer interjected, ""Perhaps he’s asking me that question and I can answer it later.""

The poll found that 45 percent of Americans think a potential justice's religious beliefs should not be relevant during the nominations process, while 36 percent said the president should take those beliefs into account.

Republicans were especially likely to disapprove of the idea of nominating an atheist justice (56 percent to 26 percent), while pluralities of Democrats (49 percent to 34 percent) and independents (42 percent to 34 percent) said they would approve.

Republicans were about equally divided on whether the president should take religious beliefs into account when choosing a nominee: 43 percent said he should, 41 percent said he should not. Democrats, by 47 percent to 36 percent, and independents, by 46 percent to 33 percent, said he should not.

Born-again Christians were also especially likely to think religious beliefs should be considered during the nominations process (53 percent) and to disapprove of the idea of an atheist Supreme Court nominee (65 percent).

Americans' views about an atheist justice parallel their feelings on nonbelievers holding other public offices. By 40 percent to 34 percent, Americans said they would vote for a well-qualified atheist nominated by their party for president. By 42 percent to 35 percent, they said they would vote for a well-qualified atheist for Congress.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Nov. 8-9 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.

Voters don’t get to conduct a casting call or sift through hundreds of applicants until they identify the ideal candidate, but must instead choose from a field prescreened by the political and fundraising processes. This year that field fails to include a candidate who stands out as the obviously superior choice. The task for voters then becomes to scrutinize track records, eliminate the worst hazards and seek potential that can be forged, with the proper pressure and continued voter vigilance, into accomplishment.

The candidate with the most potential to rise to the occasion and lead Los Angeles out of its current malaise and into a more sustainable and confident future is Eric Garcetti.

Voters must be frank with themselves about Garcetti, who as a member of the City Council for nearly 12 years and its president for six must bear some responsibility for the city’s current fiscal problems, which were dramatically worsened when the council negotiated employee contracts that were unaffordable, leading to a budget too far out of balance, and leading, in turn, to deep cuts in services.

But frankness also requires scrutiny of Garcetti’s role in beginning to correct the problems. For the most part, he has performed well. As council president, he worked behind the scenes to awaken his colleagues to the depth of the city’s financial crisis and to take action they did not want to take, imposing layoffs and requiring those remaining in the workforce to shoulder more of the burden of their medical and pension benefits. At times when Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa should have been on hand to close difficult negotiations, the task was left to Garcetti, and he came through. He antagonized his allies in labor, not because he wanted to but because he saw that he had to. That fact undermines the too-common chatter that he lacks backbone.

His style as council president was not always satisfying to outside observers, who like to hear leaders talk tough or watch them crack heads. Garcetti used finesse. He knew who he was leading, he knew how to get from them what was needed and he knew how to count votes. He knew how to get the job done, and he did it — or at least as much of it as could be done at the time. Los Angeles will look in vain for its Ed Koch or its Richard Daley, because the job here simply isn’t tailored for that kind of swagger. Successful mayors of Los Angeles — like Tom Bradley — must be experts in the art of finesse. Garcetti is such an expert.

They also must be experts in using the tools at their disposal to create a vibrant and livable city. Voters should be inspired by Garcetti’s stewardship of Council District 13. His predecessors may have laid the foundation for the revival of Hollywood, but Garcetti closed the deal with creative land-use decisions and community outreach that returned an edgy spark to the neighborhood while attracting new business and providing new housing for families living on the margins. Under his guidance, Atwater Village has blossomed, Glassell Park is on the verge, Silver Lake and Echo Park are cultural touchstones, East Hollywood neighborhoods have claimed their identity. He added many acres of badly needed park space. He brought to his job a deft mixture of community organizing, development, outreach and leadership. He has not left everyone in his district happy, because he has made choices — and that’s a good thing. It requires a measure of courage, and is an indication of leadership. Along the way he championed programs in his district to deter gang violence and fight quality-of-life crimes such as graffiti, and they became models for citywide successes.

VIDEO: Interviews with L.A.'s mayoral candidates

Many of Garcetti’s achievements have parallels in the downtown and South Los Angeles district of Jan Perry, who is also running for mayor. Perry’s warnings about the budget and employee compensation were earlier and firmer than Garcetti’s, and her penchant for speaking her mind, no matter the consequences, is appealing. So why not Perry for mayor? In large part because her strengths are also her weaknesses, and they too often undermine her. The highest-profile example is her battle with Garcetti’s successor as council president, Herb Wesson Jr., a fight that by her own account resulted in her district being redrawn as the city’s poorest, encompassing only a fraction of the resource-heavy downtown it previously did. Voters need not shy away from Perry merely because she can be combative, but they must ask themselves whether that characteristic has helped or hurt. Perry is often right, but being right is not enough. Garcetti, if elected, is more likely to be an effective and successful mayor.

Controller Wendy Greuel is smart and ambitious, and she has enjoyed the built-in advantage of being city government’s official critic, making her the chief advocate for voters and taxpayers. To some degree she has been an able fiscal watchdog, insisting, for example, that the city build up a prudent reserve fund as council members sought to instead spend down the inadequate reserve to avoid layoffs. But she has failed to fulfill her office’s potential.

Four years ago, she asserted that because she was less abrasive than her predecessor, Laura Chick, she would be more successful in getting City Hall to heed her audits and follow her advice. She now acknowledges that City Hall has not been responsive but claims that she could, as mayor, do what she could not do as controller. That is not an argument that inspires confidence.

Nor has Greuel been as innovative as Chick, who saw the potential of her office beyond performing audits and critiquing the status quo. For example, as others in City Hall read and prepared to shelve a report from the Advancement Project’s Connie Rice on dealing with the city’s growing gang problem, Chick studied it, championed it and demanded that failed programs be dropped and a new one based on Rice’s blueprint be housed directly in the mayor’s office. In so doing, Chick forced City Hall to rethink itself and to discover new, effective partnerships and protocols for measuring success. She made her office count. She showed the type of initiative and creativity demonstrated on the council by Garcetti. In comparison, Greuel has been overly cautious and less effective than she could have been. It is hard to see how she would rise to the challenge as mayor given her record as controller.

Also running is entertainment lawyer and talk radio host Kevin James, who, when confronted with the poor management and stifling bureaucracy that have gotten City Hall into trouble, sees full-scale corruption. He sees transfers of money from special funds to create an adequate reserve as corruption rather than prudence; he sees generous contracts to city employees as corruption rather than lazy bargaining and bad management.

It’s an approach well suited to radio and no doubt appealing to listeners and many voters, who would like to believe that if only the rascals are thrown out and replaced with untainted outsiders, everything in Los Angeles will fall into place. But running a city is a complicated business. James is interesting and his words are riveting, but his critique is wrong. City Hall has been too long without someone who knows how to run it, and a lack of leadership, a lack of mission and discipline, have led to low-quality work being delivered by a high-quality workforce.

James is at his best when he drops the talk of corruption and zeros in on one major cause of the city’s troubles: the employee contract of 2007. But his prescription is overly simplistic: Change the players. The city has had mayors with too much “outsider” posturing and too little knowledge of how to run the place.

Emanuel Pleitez has made a name for himself in this race but is a long way from being ready to lead a great city. Like James, he relies too much on the argument that his “outsider” status, by itself, would be a cure for City Hall’s ailments. Those who are disappointed in Villaraigosa should remember that he ran as an outsider and had been on the council for only two years when he ran for mayor, and his lack of familiarity with City Hall — his lack of finesse — is part of what doomed his administration.

Voters at first embraced Villaraigosa because they saw in him the power to inspire. Garcetti has that too, but in a different, quieter fashion, and he backs it up with experience in City Hall, a share of troublesome mistakes and 12 years of achievement. If he avoids a tendency to be glib when he should motivate, and if he avoids the tendency to allow his finesse to give way to a desire to be all things to all people, he could be just what Los Angeles needs. At this time, out of this field, he’s the best choice for mayor."

A Bloomberg National poll released Wednesday found that 55 percent of Americans approve of Obama's performance, his highest rating in the poll since September 2009. The poll also found that 49 percent of respondents believe that the president's proposals to increase government spending in key areas are more likely to spur job creation than GOP-backed efforts to cut both spending and taxes.

Additionally, the Bloomberg poll found Republican popularity at a record low. Just 35 percent of respondents said they have a favorable view of the GOP, marking the lowest ratings for the party since the poll began three years ago. The Republican rating also marked a six point drop over the last six months.

The poll surveyed 1,003 adults between February 15 and February 18, with a three percent margin of error.

Obama's popularity has been on an upward trend in the months since his reelection. A Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted last month found that 60 percent of respondents had a favorable view of the president. In December, a CBS poll showed Obama's strongest numbers since the death of Osama Bin Laden in May 2011.

However, the Bloomberg poll wasn't all good news for the president. 55 percent of respondents said they disapprove of how Obama has handled the federal budget deficit, and 49 percent have an unfavorable view with how he has handled the economy.

HuffPost Pollster's chart, which tracks all publicly available polls, currently finds Obama approval rating at 52.7 percent."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/05/21/WaPo-ABC-Poll-Obama-Lying-About-Benghazi-IRS-Targeting-Inappropriate-Media-Still-Distrusted,2013-05-21 00:00:00,['Warner Todd Huston'],"WaPo/ABC Poll: Majority Distrust Obama, Media in Various Scandals","A new poll conducted jointly by The Washington Post and ABC News revealed some interesting trends. Among other findings, more Americans feel that Obama and his administration are lying about Benghazi. A majority feel that the IRS acted inappropriately by targeting conservative groups. The media are still distrusted, with a majority feeling that the Justice Department’s seizure of the AP’s phone records was justified. Despite all this disapproval, Obama’s approval rating is still just over 50 percent positive.

An important metric in the ABC/WashPost poll was the question of whether or not government is doing more to protect or threaten our rights. 54% felt that the government had become a threat to our rights while only 34% said that the government was acting properly to protect our rights. The American people’s faith in government is at a low ebb.

This distrust is echoed when the poll turned to the specific cases of Benghazi and the IRS.

55% said that they feel that Obama is trying to cover up what happened during the terror attacks on our facilities in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012. Only 33% felt he was honestly disclosing what he knew.

This doesn’t seem to have helped the GOP too much though. 45% still felt the GOP was just engaging in political posturing by criticizing Obama’s actions on that fateful day. 44% felt the GOP was raising legitimate concerns.

Granted this close 50/50 split tends to shadow how the nation feels about Obama, Congress and the two parties.

As to the IRS scandal, a large majority felt that the tax agency was inappropriate in its targeting of conservative groups. 74% said it was inappropriate while only 20% said that it was appropriate. Further, 37% felt the IRS acted illegally with another 32% said they felt it was inappropriate but maybe not illegal.

Also, 56% felt that the IRS was acting in a partisan manner, deliberately trying to harass conservative groups, and 45% feel that Obama is trying to cover up the facts about that targeting.

The other most recent scandal in the news was Obama’s Justice Department seizing the personal and business phone records of some 100 reporters from the Associated Press. It appears that the media are still not well liked by these respondents.

52% said that the DOJ’s spying on the phone calls of the AP reporters was justified. Only 33% said it isn’t justified. Worse for the media, most respondents weren’t concerned at all that the DOJ might be improperly intruding on the freedom of the press. 32% said they were very concerned that freedom of the press was being trampled upon, but 37% said they were only somewhat concerned, and an additional 29% said they weren’t concerned about it. In a blow to the media, here, more are not very concerned about the AP phone records scandal than are.

Finally, despite that a majority of 57% feel the country is on the wrong track, Obama is still hovering around the break even line in approval. More respondents approved of his work as president (51% to 44%), he split even on his handling of the economy (48% to 48%), and in the matchup between Obama and the Republicans, 46% felt he was handling the economy well compared to only 37% who thought that the GOP was handling it better.

The GOP is not succeeding in getting their message across, clearly.

As to Hillary Clinton, she is still enjoying a relatively high approval rating. 62% of respondents felt she handled her job as Secretary of State well, while only 28% disapproved of her actions.

The poll, conducted in the middle of May, was taken among respondents that self-identified as 33% Democrat, 22% Republican, with 38% self-identifying as independents."

When Citizens United came down, bingo—no more serious restrictions in the 60 days before the election. However, the 501(c)(4) loophole is not supposed to be as wide and deep as it has become. There are two types of 501(c)(4)s—those that are genuine social-welfare organizations that also do some lobbying or direct policy-advocacy work, and a relatively small group that were set up to subvert or evade disclosure laws and requirements so that donors could pour in money to shape and influence elections anonymously. It is the latter group that the IRS has had trouble with—and that was behind the efforts to single out highly charged categories. The law says 501(c)(4)s have to be “exclusively” involved in social welfare. Ridiculously, inexplicably, the IRS regulations changed “exclusively” to “primarily,” never specifically defined the term, and then passively accepted the rough rule of thumb proposed by pols and lawyers that anything over 50 percent of the money expended would qualify. Into this huge loophole rode Karl Rove, whose American Crossroads, a political organization that required donor disclosure, established in 2010 a sister, Crossroads GPS, a 501(c)(4), explicitly to court donors for political campaigns who did not want their identities disclosed. The idea that Crossroads GPS, or the American Action Network, or Priorities USA, or a host of other organizations engaged in partisan campaigning on both sides are “social welfare organizations” is nonsense. Bloomberg’s Julie Bykowicz recently pointed to another example to show the farce here. Patriot Majority USA, run by a Democratic operative, told the IRS its mission was “to encourage a discussion of economic issues.” It spent $7.5 million in ads attacking Republican candidates in 2012—and then virtually disappeared, with Bykowicz unable to reach the group by e-mail or phone. “Social welfare?”

In the IRS case, many prominent Washington lawyers say Ruemmler made the sensible legal call. She protected her client — Obama — by distancing him from a politically sensitive problem and ensuring that he could not be accused of meddling in an inquiry.... But Ruemmler and McDonough’s careful plan for the IRS was upended on May 10, when Lois Lerner, a senior official at the agency, broke the news by admitting that the IRS had given extra scrutiny to conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Senior White House officials were stunned to see the IRS trying to get ahead of its own story — and in doing so, creating a monstrous communications disaster for an administration that appeared not to know what its agencies were up to.

Best IRS journo story to date on what actually happened from WaPo (aka when doing the right thing everywhere else—not interfering with a probe— looks bad in DC because an IRS official wants to CYA):See David Petraeus and Benghazi.

Greg Sargent:

As you know, Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee last night yanked provisions out of the immigration reform bill that would extend immigration rights to gay married couples, angering the gay rights community. But this battle is not necessarily over. What comes next could get quite interesting from a strategic and political standpoint.

Whenever the world of Washington seems hopeless, someone will point out that the Senate Judiciary Committee did a good job on immigration reform. That’s it? Yeah, pretty much.

Republican Bradley Byrne sailed to victory in a special election for an Alabama seat in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday.

Byrne defeated Democrat Burton LeFlore, claiming about two-thirds of the vote when the race was called by The Associated Press, with 64 percent of precincts reporting.

Speaking to supporters at Moe’s Original BBQ in Mobile, Ala., Byrne promised to work for ""change in Washington.""

“Not fight and not name call, but to get real results,” Byrne said. “Fight hard against the Washington establishment holding our nation back. We are a great country, but we are not acting like a great country in Washington.”

(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)

WASHINGTON -- While the swearing-in ceremony might have been the main draw for many on Inauguration Day, plenty of people turned out early along the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route between the Capitol and the White House.

As Willie Geist of NBC News reported on Monday morning, some of the most sought-after spots were near the Navy Memorial at 7th Street NW, opposite the National Archives. It was around that location where President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama got out of their limousine and started walking along the processional route four years ago during the president's first Inauguration.

And sure enough, for their second Inauguration, the president and first lady left their limousine around 9th Street NW and walked for approximately three blocks before getting back in their motorcade. They arrived in the vicinity of the White House around 4:10 p.m. where they later gathered to watch the remainder of the Inauguration parade from the official review stand opposite Lafayette Park.

The parade took a momentary pause as the first family, Vice President Biden and his family and their guests made their way into the review stand just before 4:45 p.m.

Story continues after slideshow ...

PHOTO GALLERY Inauguration Parade 2013

The parade was originally scheduled to start around 2:30 p.m. but was delayed by the Inauguration luncheon in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, which was also behind schedule.

The procession, which included 59 groups and 8,800 people, started to leave Capitol Hill around 3:15 p.m., went west along Constitution Avenue to Pennsylvania Avenue and ended at 17th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House.

Among the groups featured in the parade were the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment, Boy Scout Troop 358 from Philadelphia, the Boston Crusaders Drum & Bugle Corps, the Georgia State University Marching Band, the Lesbian and Gay Band Association of St. Louis, Military Spouses of Michigan, the Navajo Nation Band of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, the University of Maryland Mighty Sound Marching Band, the Virginia Military Institute Marching Unit and the Palmview High School Mariachi and Folkloric Group of La Joya, Texas, among many more.

Some of the most recognized landmarks in the nation's capital sit along the processional route.

The president passed the U.S. Department of Labor, the Canadian Embassy, the Newseum, the National Gallery of Art, the Federal Trade Commission, the National Archives, the Navy Memorial, the FBI headquarters, the Justice Department, the Old Post Office Pavilion, Freedom Plaza, the John A. Wilson Building and the Treasury Department, among other buildings, memorials and statues.

There were some protesters along the route, including members of the Westboro Baptist Church, who received a permit to demonstrate at John Marshall Park near 4th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue.

At the John A. Wilson Building, the seat of the District of Columbia government, local officials had a protest banner on full display decrying the lack of full and equal congressional representation for residents of the nation's capital.

Washington (CNN) - Hillary Clinton has the early edge in a key battleground state, should she choose to run for president in 2016.

Iowa voters picked her as their choice for commander in chief above top potential Republican contenders including Senators Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, in a new survey released Friday.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

The Quinnipiac University poll showed Clinton would defeat Rubio by 11 percentage points, 48% to 37%, if the election were held today and would beat Paul by four percentage points, 46% to 42%. She was helped by her strong support among women.

The speculation over a Clinton presidential run is never ending, helped by her consistently high approval ratings, the perpetual campaign cycle and speculation from political operatives and journalists.

While top Democrats, including her husband former President Bill Clinton and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, have encouraged her to run for president again, Clinton herself has consistently said she's focused on enjoying her life after years in the public eye and traveling the world.

Vice President Joe Biden has not been as careful and often jokes about another run at the White House.

But Biden did not fare as well in the same poll. He fell behind Rubio by one percentage point, 39% to 40%, and trailed Paul by five percentage points, 39% to 44%, among Hawkeye State voters. He was hurt by his lack of support among independent voters.

President Barack Obama's win over Clinton and Biden in the 2008 Iowa caucuses helped catapult his White House bid. He went on to win the swing state in the 2008 and 2012 general elections. But Bill Clinton was victorious in the state during both of his presidential elections, in 1992 and 1996.

The poll, conducted between May 15 and May 21, surveyed 1,411 registered voters by telephone and had a sampling error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points."

http://news.yahoo.com/big-crowd-high-spirits-2nd-obama-swearing-153950715--politics.html,,[],"Big crowd, high spirits for 2nd Obama swearing-in","WASHINGTON (AP) — Declaring ""our work begins today"", President Barack Obama vowed to ""finish what we started"" four years ago as hundreds of thousands of inauguration-goers gathered on the historic National Mall in anticipation of his oath-taking for a second term.

""Let's go,"" Obama tweeted Monday morning as he began the day of inaugural celebrations.

The president was cheered in the streets as his motorcade slowly made its way down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House and arrived at the Capitol. At midday, he was to speak to a huge crowd on the Mall and millions more watching on television, hoping to set an optimistic tone for a divided nation seeking solutions to economic woes at home and conflict overseas.

The fanfare is extending across the nation's capital, including the traditional inaugural parade and a pair of glitzy formal balls.

Obama, along with his family and Vice President Joe Biden, began his day with a church service at St. John's Episcopal Church. Known as ""The Church of the Presidents"", St. John's is located just across from the White House on the other side of Lafayette Park. Pew 54 is known as ""the president's pew"" and is reserved for the commander in chief whenever he attends.

The centerpiece of Monday's festivities is Obama's inaugural address. The president will be urging lawmakers to find common ground and will preview his second-term goals, including immigration reform, stricter gun-control laws and an end to the war in Afghanistan.

Obama is also facing fresh concerns about terrorism in North Africa. In the midst of the inaugural celebrations, a U.S. official said two more Americans died in Algeria, bringing the U.S. death toll from a four-day siege at a natural gas plant to three. Seven Americans survived, the official said.

Washington largely shelved its partisan fighting for the three days of inaugural celebrations. Obama, perhaps seeking to start fresh with lawmakers in his second term, invited several members of Congress to the White House before his swearing-in, including the Republican leaders he has been at odds with for the past four years: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.

Story continues

""This is a great day for all Americans to celebrate and to remember that the Capitol belongs to all,"" Cantor wrote on Twitter.

Pressing matters await the president and Congress once the celebrations subside, including three looming fiscal deadlines. Obama will also need help from a reluctant Congress if he hopes to fulfill his promise to sign comprehensive immigration reform and tighten gun laws in the wake of last month's school shooting in Newtown, Conn.

The mood surrounding Obama's second inaugural is more subdued than it was four years ago, when the swearing in of the nation's first black president drew 1.8 million people to the Mall. Still, organizers were expecting up to 700,000 to attend Monday's events, which would make it the largest second-term inaugural in history.

At least one public viewing area on the National Mall was full two hours before the president's swearing-in, and the crowd spread from the Capitol to the Washington Monument.

The weather forecast was encouraging, to a point. High temperatures were predicted for the lower 40s during the day, with a slight chance of rain and snow showers in the afternoon and flurries later.

Security was tight across Washington, with several streets near the White House and Capitol Hill closed off. Humvees and city buses were being used to block intersections. Volunteers fanned out near the Mall to help direct the crowds.

Lawmakers and other officials slowly trickled onto the platform on the West Front of the Capitol where Obama was to be sworn in. Former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were in attendance, along with former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn.

David Richardson of Atlanta and his two young children were among the early crowds heading to the National Mall Monday even before sunrise.

""We wanted to see history, I think, and also for the children to witness that anything is possible through hard work,"" Richardson said.

Wendy Davis of Rome, Ga., was one of thousands of inaugural attendees who packed Metro trains before sunrise headed for the Capitol and parade route. Davis came four years ago as well but was among the many ticketholders who couldn't get in because of the massive crowds. She was determined to get in this time.

""I thought I was early last time but I obviously wasn't early enough,"" she said.

By 8 a.m. thousands of people were also waiting in security lines that stretched a block to gain access to the spots along the parade route that were accessible to the general public without a special ticket.

The cold weather was easily tolerated by Marie-France Lemaine of Montreal, who received the trip to the inaugural as a birthday present from her husband. She headed up an Obama advocacy group in Quebec that cheered on the president from north of the border.

""The American president affects the rest of the world,"" she said.

The president was officially sworn-in shortly before noon on Sunday, in keeping with the Constitution's mandate that presidents begin their new term on Jan. 20. But because inaugural ceremonies are historically not held on Sundays, the public celebration was pushed to Monday, coinciding with the birthday of late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

Condoleezza Rice, who served as secretary of state under former President George W. Bush, called on Obama to put electoral politics aside in his second term if he hopes to accomplish those objectives.

""It requires now a kind of humility and a reaching across the aisle,"" Rice said on CBS ""This Morning. ""And reaching across the aisle, by the way, means reaching out to Americans who may not have voted for him.""

Following his swearing-in, Obama will attend the traditional luncheon with lawmakers before joining marching bands and floats in the inaugural parade, which winds its way from Capitol Hill to the White House.

The president and first lady will then slip into formalwear for two swanky inaugural balls. That's far fewer than the 10 they attended after the 2009 inauguration, though this year's events are still expected to draw up to about 40,000 people.

The centerpiece of Monday's activities was Obama's inaugural address. Aides said he would make the case that the nation's founding values can still guide the country through changing times. He is not expected to outline specifically policy proposals, saving them instead for his Feb. 12 State of the Union address.

Some Americans, weary after four years of shaky economic news, implored Obama to focus on patriotism, not politics, in his remarks.

""I'm just hoping for a nice eloquent speech that makes people feel good about being an American,"" said Sean Payton, a 32-year-old Democrat from Highland Ranch, Colo.

Monday's celebrations bring to a close three days of inaugural fanfare across Washington, including a day of service, a wreath-laying at Arlington National Cemetery, and a concert honoring military families.

The quirk in the calendar meant Obama would end up being sworn in for his second term twice. Sunday's ceremony was an intimate gathering at the White House, with only a dozen family members on hand to witness Chief Justice John Roberts administer the oath of office.

Obama placed his hand on a Bible used for years by Michelle Obama's family. On Monday, he'll take the oath using two — one owned by King and one by Abraham Lincoln.

Vice President Joe Biden was also to be sworn in for the second term a second time Monday. Biden took the oath of office Sunday at the Naval Observatory in northwest Washington. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, appointed by Obama as the first Hispanic to serve on the Supreme Court, administered the oath to Biden, who placed his hand on a Bible his family has used since 1893.

Ahead of his swearing-in Sunday, Obama, along with Vice President Joe Biden, solemnly honored the nation's fallen soldiers during a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. On a crisp, sun-splashed morning, Obama and Biden placed a large wreath adorned with red, white and blue ribbon, in front of Arlington's Tomb of the Unknowns. Holding their hands over their hearts, the two leaders stood motionless as a bugler played taps.

You can be sure that Republicans are sharpening their talking points for the upcoming campaigns. We’ll likely be hearing all about a supposed lackluster economy, tepid employment picture, and that demonic “Obamacare.” Now is the time, therefore, for Democrats and progressives to hone their arguments and talking points to counter those of the Republicans and, better yet, to drive the conversation from the get-go. Here are three words to use against the Republicans:

“They Did Nothing.” It’s that simple. The Republicans on the economy? “They did nothing.” On jobs? “They did nothing.” Rebuilding America’s crumbling roads and bridges to help businesses move their products? “They did nothing.” Immigration? “They did nothing.” Bringing American jobs back home instead of shipping them overseas? “They did nothing.” Keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill? “They did nothing.”* The list goes on and on. And to be clear, the Democrats must articulate their positive agenda. In fact, President Obama has taken to the road to do just that. Saying the Republicans did nothing only makes sense if Democrats clearly explain what solutions they stand for and on which the Republicans should work, with some compromise and cooperation by both sides.

Surely, you say, Republicans and conservatives will argue that their lawmakers have done something, and we need to be prepared for that defense. Okay, here’s what Republicans in Congress have done: abortion bills. Votes to repeal “Obamacare.” Phony ""scandals."" Budgetary hostage taking. Filibustering and blocking even the basic functions of our democracy. That’s during the few days in between their lengthy taxpayer-paid vacations when they’re even in session. And if you want to see what the extreme Republicans (yes, ""extreme"" should be used frequently to modify ""Republican"") do when they have the votes, look no further than Republican-run states like Texas.

So feel free to begin the 2014 election argument. You have a good one to make.

*If you use the phrase out of context, such as on a bumper sticker, simply replace “They” with “Republicans.”

Instead, the vanquished Republican nominee spent the day at home in La Jolla, out of sight if not quite out of mind.

Former campaign aides said they had no details on how Romney spent his day, or whether he was among the millions of TV viewers who watched the events in Washington from afar.

But his absence from public view was consistent with the low profile Romney has kept since being soundly defeated by President Obama in both the Electoral College and popular vote.

The former Massachusetts governor surfaced soon after the election, telling a group of donors that Obama had won reelection thanks to “gifts” the administration had given to blacks, Hispanics and young voters. (Romney was apparently unaware that reporters were listening in on the conference call.)

QUIZ: How much do you know about presidential inaugurations?

Since then, there have been occasional Romney sightings: pumping gas in San Diego, visiting Disneyland with family members — one photo captured the former candidate in a rollercoaster car hanging on in a seat behind sons Craig and Josh; taking in a screening of the new “Twilight” movie in Del Mar, and stocking up on paper towels, wrapping paper and V8 juice in early December.

Appearing in a more formal setting, Romney stopped by for lunch at the White House in late November, joining the president for a private conversation over white turkey chili and grilled chicken salad. Romney left without speaking to reporters.

He has also been largely absent from the social media sphere. Romney’s last tweet, to more than 1.6 million followers, was on Nov 10, thanking supporters and saying he would be “forever grateful to every one of you.” On Christmas Day, he posted the photo from his family Christmas card of himself and his wife, Ann, surrounded by their 18 grandchildren, the girls in hot pink dresses and the boys in teal polo shirts.

While Romney lay low Monday, his former running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, congratulated the president via Twitter, saying he joined the country “in celebrating this American tradition.” He offered a more expansive posting on his Facebook page.

“We may disagree on matters of policy,” Ryan wrote. “But today we remember why we take those matters so seriously — because we seek the public good. It’s our highest duty — one that we share — and one for which we’re grateful.”

Within hours, Ryan had accumulated more than 200 “likes.”

He's giving as many as eight speeches over the next couple months, with one on infrastructure in Florida on Thursday. In his speech in Illinois, Obama made clear why he was doing it. It takes two to legislate, and the House of Representatives refuses to budge. The risk Obama faces is that Americans don't really seem to want to dance, either. 2013 is no 2012.

RELATED: Obama's Favorite Word: 'Frustration'

Over the weekend, the president's advisors started pitching Wednesday's speech at Knox College. On Sunday, Politico reported, Obama's communications chief Dan Pfeiffer sent an email to White House reporters with subject line, ""I don't normally do this.""

Hey everyone, I don't usually write emails like this … But I just finished reading the draft of a speech the President plans to deliver on Wednesday, and I want to explain why it's one worth checking out.

Perhaps that draft speech differed from the one that was delivered, but the verdict on the speech itself was largely that it trod well-worn ground. The Washington Post put it well: ""You could be forgiven if you thought you had heard President Obama’s speech on the economy today before. Because you have. For most of the 2012 campaign."" Which, as we pointed out, was part of the point: get people refocused on Obama's campaign goals.

RELATED: How the GOP Wants Obama to Cut a Deal with the GOP

With a heavy dose of bashing Republican obstructionism. If the thinking is that an appeal to the people can somehow stir Republicans to action, it's not clear how a rehash of 2012 arguments at a lower temperature will do the trick. Even in the best of times, as Jonathan Chait wrote in May, the ability of a president to bend the world to his will is limited. Doing it with the same rhetoric, lower approval ratings, and less attention seems like a doomed proposition.

Story continues

RELATED: Can Obama Sell Universal Preschool to the GOP?

And with a weakened campaign infrastructure. Organizing For Action, meant to provide the sort of off-year infrastructure that Obama enjoyed during his reelection, has struggled to find its feet. This August, the group plans to launch a series of actions meant to spur Obama's slumbering base into action. As the group's own map shows, however, its strength is largely in areas that already support the president and his agenda. A few OFA actions and an Obama speech seems unlikely to convince voters in Mississippi to rail against their Congressmembers.

RELATED: Everyone Still Really Hates Congress, but Democrats Can Make the GOP Look Good

Politico's Glenn Thrush and Carrie Budoff Brown think part of the idea is just to re-energize Obama himself.

Obama has embarked on this week’s series of policy speeches to improve his own ambiguous frame of mind and take a comforting spin in the way-back machine, like a veteran chart-topper revisiting smaller, friendlier haunts on a comeback tour.

It's not clear what this means. That the Obama who sold out Shea in 2012 will play CBGB in 2013 just to stay fresh? Who knows. If the president thinks it will take a few shows at a suburban Houlihan's to get the cobwebs off, this permanent campaign thing may not work out that well.

RELATED: The Key Demo for Obama's Economic Speeches: Republican Senators

Obama is giving another speech today, by the way. The Hill explains:

President Obama will push for new infrastructure projects and investments as he hits the road again Thursday, traveling this time to Jacksonville, Fla., for his third consecutive speech on the economy. … The White House chose the port as the site of the speech because it is home to two projects — a container terminal and a rail yard — that the administration expedited last year as part of a broader infrastructure push.

Perhaps this is the speech that can do the trick, can energize the people to force the House into action on the president's priorities. But don't be surprised if it, too, sounds familiar. After all, the president has made similar infrastructures pitches before. Like in March. In Florida.

Markey enjoyed robust support from allied groups and surrogates throughout his campaign. President Obama and Vice President Biden each traveled to Massachusetts to campaign with him in the closing weeks. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Kerry endorsed his candidacy a day after he announced it. And a Democratic super PAC made a seven-figure investment on television ads.

“We began working late last year with numerous partners, in Massachusetts and nationally, to prevent another sneak attack that allowed Scott Brown to win,” said Craig Varoga, a senior strategist at Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic group.

Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Executive Director Guy Cecil wrote in a memo that ""the lesson from Scott Brown’s accidental win in 2010 was that Democrats must never take a race for granted.""

Turnout was anticipated to be very low on Tuesday, an oppressively hot day in the Bay State. The race attracted little attention over the last few months, and few voters tuned into the televised debates between Markey and Gomez.

Gomez drew some early comparisons to Brown, but it became clear late in the race that he wasn't going to repeat his success. The first-time candidate, a former Navy SEAL and the son of Colombian immigrants, cast himself as an independent voice with an outside-the-beltway perspective. But he never really broke through; polls showed him trailing Markey throughout the race.

Many Republican groups and donors were not convinced Gomez was worth a major investment. The National Republican Senatorial Committee says it spent nearly $1 million on the race, but American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, GOP-aligned groups that often enter the mix in Senate contests, were nowhere to be found. Nor was the Chamber of Commerce. And one pro-Gomez super PAC didn't raise very much money.

The decision to remain on the sidelines could set off a new debate in GOP circles about how best to deploy resources, coming off a tough cycle for Republicans, who lost some key Senate races in red states last year. During the campaign, Gomez allies publicly urged Republicans to join his cause.

“Do conservatives have nerve to try & win?” tweeted Gomez campaign consultant Brad Todd in late May. “Will [the] mod[erate] R donor class put its money where mouth is? Is this a party or therapy session?”

Republicans must pick up five seats to win back the Senate majority this cycle. That number is expected to climb to six later this year when New Jersey voters elect a replacement for appointed Sen. Jeff Chiesa (R-N.J.). Newark Mayor Cory Booker (D) is the front-runner in the blue state race, in which Republicans were unable to land a major recruit.

In a memo to supporters, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) pointed to the fact that Democrats had to spend big, despite the state's Democratic-tilt. And he signaled that Gomez could be back.

""Today marks the end of the first mile in the marathon to permanently fill the Massachusetts Senate seat. Gabriel Gomez is well prepared to win that marathon over the next 16 months,"" Moran said.

Nearly four decades after winning his first congressional campaign, Markey campaigned for the Senate as a champion of liberal values. He ran to the left of fellow Democratic Rep. Stephen F. Lynch in the primary. In the general election, Markey sought to tether Gomez to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) throughout the course of three televised debates.

Markey repeatedly slammed Gomez over his stance on guns, women’s issues and entitlement spending. His campaign also raised questions about the Republican's work in the private equity sector and criticized Gomez for a tax break he took on his home.

For his part, Gomez sought to pitch himself as a moderate alternative to Markey and contrast his career outside politics with Markey’s decades-long tenure in the House. “You are the poster boy for term limits,” Gomez told Markey at their first debate.

Brown helped Gomez behind the scenes. But he didn't campaign in person with Gomez until hours before polls opened.

Markey will replace Sen. Mo Cowan (D), whom Gov. Deval Patrick (D) appointed as an interim replacement for Kerry. A close Patrick confidant and former chief of staff to the governor, Cowan is the only black Democrat currently serving in the Senate.

Markey won’t have long to celebrate his win before he must return to campaign mode. He will face reelection in November of 2014, when he will be vying for a full six-year term.

2012 Republican VP nominee says party must avoid internal squabbles.

Paul Ryan told conservatives Saturday they must show they have better ideas.

Could include rejecting the President%27s ideas or recasting them to make them better.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee said Saturday that the party needs to stick together and pick its fights during President Barack Obama's new term as it seeks to rebound from a second straight presidential loss.

In a speech to conservatives, Rep. Paul Ryan said Republicans should reject some White House proposals outright and try to infuse others with conservative principles. He warned that Obama would attempt to divide Republicans.

""We can't get rattled. We won't play the villain in his morality plays. We have to stay united,"" Ryan said at the National Review Institute event. ""We have to show that if given the chance, we can govern. We have better ideas.""

The Wisconsin congressman outlined a pragmatic approach for a party dealing with last November's election defeats and trying to determine whether to oppose Obama's agenda at every turn or shape the president's proposals with conservative principles.

With a surging minority population altering the electorate, Republican leaders have discussed the need to attract more women and Hispanics while at the same time standing firm to the values that unite conservatives.

How the party moves forward was a major theme of the three-day meeting of conservative activists who also heard from Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Govs. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Bob McDonnell of Virginia were scheduled to address the conference on Sunday.

The theme also dominated the Republican National Committee's winter meeting, which ended Friday in Charlotte, North Carolina.

With a surging minority population altering the electorate, Republican leaders have discussed the need to attract more women and Hispanics while at the same time standing firm on the values that unite conservatives. Republicans said despite the losses, the party could return to power by projecting optimism and attracting new voters with a message of economic opportunity.

Walker, a star among conservatives after surviving a union-led campaign to recall him from office in Wisconsin, said government needed ""brown-bag common sense,"" a reference to his frugal practice of packing his own lunch of ham-and-cheese sandwiches every day. Qualities like optimism, staying relevant to voters and showing courage in tackling big problems would be rewarded at the voting booth, he said.

""We've got to learn to be more optimistic. We've got to learn to give a viable alternative to the voters,"" Walker said.

Cruz said Republicans needed to use upcoming fights over the budget and the deficit as ""leverage points"" to tame long-term spending and debt. Projecting an upbeat outlook for the party, he said Obama's policies would drive many voters to Republicans just as many Americans turned to Ronald Reagan after the economic turmoil of the late 1970s.

""We're on the verge of a rebirth of conservativism,"" Cruz said.

Looking ahead, Ryan rejected the notion that Republicans were ""in the wilderness,"" noting that the party controls the House of Representsatives and most statehouses. But he said Obama's victory over Mitt Romney meant that Republicans would need to recalibrate their approach to deal with the new political realities.

""If we want to promote conservatism, we'll need to use every tool at our disposal,"" Ryan said. ""Sometimes, we will have to reject the president's proposals - that time may come more than once. And sometimes we'll have to make them better."" He said Republicans should have two main goals for the next four years, namely ""to mitigate bad policies"" and ""to advance good policy wherever we can.""

Ryan acknowledged that ""we all didn't see eye to eye"" on the recent ""fiscal cliff"" vote to deal with a combination of spending cuts and higher taxes that were set to take effect at the start of the year. He defended his support for the bill even though it raised taxes on the wealthiest Americans, saying it was the only way to avoid sweeping tax increases and prevent the economy from going into a free-fall.

As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Ryan said Republicans needed to guard against a debt crisis for the country that would undermine the economy. He said he would promote changes to Medicare and Medicaid - the government programs that provide health care coverage to the elderly and poor - and would propose a budget ""that will balance and pay down the debt.""

But November's election results still linger. Ryan said he was ""disappointed"" by the outcome, saying he had been ""looking forward to taking on the big challenges"" while living at the vice president's residence. ""My kids were looking forward to having a pool,"" he joked."

Reclaim America, Rubio's political action committee, began selling a reusable ""Rubio"" water bottle after the Florida senator's awkward moment of thirst, CBS News reports.

""If you donate $25 or more today, we’ll send you a Marco Rubio water bottle. Send the liberal detractors a message that not only does Marco Rubio inspire you…he hydrates you too,"" the PAC's website claims.

Two thousand water bottles have been sold since Reclaim America sent an email announcing the new item on Wednesday night, according to CNN.

The official fundraising solicitation sent out by Reclaim America told supporters that the liberal media was taking out their attacks on the GOP's message by picking on Rubio for his awkward incident.

""The liberals and the pundits flocking to Twitter and blanketing MSNBC can't stop talking about what it means that Marco stopped and took a drink of water in the middle of his speech,"" the solicitation said. ""Why would they be so focused on a man reaching for water instead of on what he said?

Rubio's water break went viral even before his speech ended Tuesday night. It spurred discussion, GIFs and tweets that commented on everything from Rubio's lunge to the water bottle itself.

Is Proud to Announce an Expansion,"“Look, I am not going to take any clients that conflict with OFA. What I want to do with my work is just work with people and causes that I believe in. And OFA will be the most important thing that I do.”

-- Jim Messina, campaign manager to President Obama, talking to Politico for an article rolling out his new firm.

So, the president is not disbanding his campaign, and in fact will be continuing to raise money for what was a billion-dollar effort last year. Big donors will reportedly be able to get face time with the president for helping finance the ongoing effort.

Now we learn that the president’s campaign manager will be keeping his position at OFA, previously known as Organizing for America and Obama for America, now called Organizing for Action, but taking on other like-minded clients.

The sitting president will have a permanent, personal, well-funded campaign arm that peddles access to the commander in chief and deploys those funds to help the president win ongoing political fights ahead of the midterm elections. And now, the campaign manager will be able to open up side ventures with corporations, campaigns and groups who he believes share the president’s aims.

What could possibly go wrong?

This evolving story about access, influence, the permanency of campaigning and the diminished role of the president as a dealmaker in Washington is fascinating in many ways. But two things stand out: What it says about the bias of the political press and what it says about the failure of the U.S. campaign finance system.

Imagine, if in 2005, Karl Rove, George W. Bush’s top strategist, or Ken Mehlman, his re-election campaign manager, had announced that rather than disbanding the campaign, it would be kept alive in perpetuity. Renamed Better County instead of Bush/Cheney, the new entity would help the president pressure Congress to allow private Social Security accounts, school choice, domestic oil drilling and a host of other favored topics of the re-elected president.

When oil CEOs, conservative activists, Wall Street investment moguls and others showed up with checks to fund the enterprise, lured by the promise of face-time with the president, how would those articles have looked?

When Rove or Mehlman announced that they would also be working directly with Halliburton, the NRA, the Christian Coalition and pro-Iraq war groups would a Politico write-up sound the same as it did for the launch of Messina Inc.?

When Hollywood, big bankers, big labor, green energy subsidy seekers, technology firms and other Democratic stalwarts drop checks on Obama and hire Messina will it sound the same as if Bush Inc. had done the same with traditional Republican funders?

“Partnering with stakeholders” or “Selling influence?” The answer depends on what you think of the aims of those doing the partnering or buying.

It is seemingly inconceivable to many in the political press that to a big chunk of the electorate the green, gun controlling, union organizing, Big Gulp banning, insurance mandating, bank bail-outing side of things is just as scary as the war, oil and investment side of things was to John Kerry supporters post-election. That’s because most of the reporters were Kerry supporters.

Bush, of course, didn’t do anything like what Obama is doing now and mostly played by the post-Watergate rules that steered politics in America for a generation. Rove stayed in the White House and Mehlman went over to run the Republican National Committee. Both men were trying to do the same thing for the president as Messina is now: win policy fights and Midterm elections. But Rove and Mehlman were doing it inside the confines of ethics and campaign fundraising rules, oftentimes ineffective or cockamamie but always tricky to navigate.

Mehlman, especially, had to deal with those rules but he also had to worry about what all of the members of the Republican National Committee and all of the Republican office holders wanted. He was Bush’s man at the RNC, but he was still at the RNC.

Messina has a constituency of one: Barack Obama, who not coincidentally, is the product Messina is selling. Obama is blowing off the Democratic National Committee, which will have to do the work of surviving midterm elections with little help from the incumbent president. And donors who want the biggest bang for the buck will quickly realize that it's better to be able to write unlimited checks for direct access than fuss with all those annoying old campaign laws. As the Clintons and Al Gore learned, those rules may seem toothless but can still deliver an unwelcome bite.

[pullquote]

The funniest part of the Politico write-up is the assurances that Messina will not be a lobbyist. Why on earth would anyone serious about peddling influence register as a lobbyist?

Registering as a lobbyist is required for those folks who trudge through Capitol corridors working on minutiae in legislation. It’s required to meet congressional ethics rules. But to pedal access to the president and access to his political machine? No registration required. Never has been.

Registering as a lobbyist would be stupid since it would force the administration to again crawfish on access to lobbyists. Unregistered, Messina will be free to float between the funders and the president without any icky labels or ethics troubles.

But the Politico article on the Messina rollout still assures readers that he will not become a lobbyist. Phew.

Whether this new arrangement will work at anything other than enriching Messina and helping Democratic donors stay plugged in is an open question. Will a permanent campaign based on community organizing principles deliver policy victories and an all-Democratic Congress for Obama or will Americans quickly tire of a lame-duck president who keep saying the same things? Time will tell.

What is clear, though, is that the campaign finance and ethics rules that politicians have been gaming so artfully since the late 1970s are kaput.

The reporters murmuring their admiration for the bold innovations of Obama and Messina in shucking the rules and refusing access to the press ought to bear that in mind as they consider the future. Now broken, the old rules will not be resurrected. What comes after this will be more egregious.

And how would they feel if the next bold innovator is a President Rubio or a President Paul and the “stakeholders” are Wayne LaPierre, Rex Tillerson and David Koch? And what if that same Republican president declined to answer questions on the subject saying he preferred to Tweet his opinions rather than be interviewed?

Excusing behaviors in presidents they like and trust paves the way for even worse conduct from those they dislike and distrust. Having taken a pass on Democratic misbehavior it will be impossible to raise the alarm when the Republicans come back around.

And Now, A Word From Charles

“And what all of this is about creating enough revenue, increasing American taxation, so he can have an entitlement state in Europe which requires the European levels of taxation. He is not interested in debt or cutting or deficits. He wants to spend because he wants expanded state. That is what all of this is about.”

Former Alaska governor accuses Obama of failing to lead

She says the GOP needs to turn away from Washington consultants

Palin reprises her folksy%2C down-home %22hockey mom%22 theme

OXON HILL, Md. — Former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin mocked President Obama, GOP consultant Karl Rove and the mainstream media in a folksy speech to a gathering of conservative activists outside Washington Saturday.

During her address to the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, Palin accused Obama of failing to lead, instead maintaining a permanent campaign approach of demonizing the opposition.

True leadership, she said, means ""ending the poisonous practice of treating members of different social, ethnic and religious groups as different electorates, pandered to with different promises."" If all men are created equal, as the Declaration of Independence states, Palin said, then there are ""no Hispanic issues or African-American issues or women's issues — there are only American issues.""

The former Alaska governor also mocked Obama's proposals for stricter gun rules, tying the issue to conspiracy theories about the president's own citizenship. ""More background checks? Dandy idea, Mr. President — should have started with yours.""

But Palin also turned on Republican leaders such as Rove, who President George W. Bush once called the architect of his electoral victories. Rove has recently said Republicans need to choose candidates who are more ""electable"" and less ideologically contentious.

""The last thing we need is Washington, D.C., vetting our candidates,"" Palin said. ""The architects can head on back to the great Lone Star state and put their names on some ballot.""

Palin's speech was full of the kind of down-home humor and references to her life as a ""hockey mom from Wasilla"" that made her a star during the 2008 election season. Her biggest applause line Saturday was a double-entendre about the Christmas gifts she exchanged with her husband, Todd. She said he bought her a gun locker to put on a truck, and she bought him a gun. So, ""he's got the rifle, I've got the rack,"" she said.

While the crowd stood and cheered at the line from a country song, Palin took a Big Gulp soda from behind the lectern and sipped from a straw, noting that it was OK since New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was not around. Bloomberg, an independent, has tried to ban the sale of large-size sugary sodas in the Big Apple, a move that drew outrage from the soft drink industry and civil libertarians who charged it was an overreach of authority.

Palin's selection as the GOP vice presidential nominee in 2008 ignited the Republican base, and her speech at the Republican convention — her first major national appearance — made her an instant hero to conservatives. But during the campaign she appeared at times confused or unprepared, and Democrats pounced on her gaffes.

After the campaign, Palin remained a force in Republican politics, and in several 2010 campaigns, her endorsement was critical in raising the public profile and the fundraising efforts of conservative candidates. Freshman Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who was scheduled to give the keynote address at CPAC Saturday night, introduced Palin on Saturday, saying, ""I would not be in the U.S. Senate today if it were not for Gov. Sarah Palin.""

In 2010, Palin signed on as a commentator with Fox News, but that relationship ended at the beginning of this year. She has since seen her public profile wane.

She toyed with the idea of a possible presidential campaign in 2012, but ultimately decided not to run.

Later, the top aide would participate in a postelection forum with Obama’s campaign manager. He told me (albeit, like a few people I spoke to, under the condition that he not be identified criticizing his party), “I remember thinking, when Jim Messina was going over the specifics of how they broke down and targeted the electorate: ‘I can’t play this game. I have to play a different game, so that I don’t look like an idiot in front of all these people.’ ”

But the problem for the G.O.P. extends well beyond its flawed candidate and his flawed operation. The unnerving truth, which the Red Edge team and other younger conservatives worry that their leaders have yet to appreciate, is that the Republican Party’s technological deficiencies barely begin to explain why the G.O.P. has lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections. The party brand — which is to say, its message and its messengers — has become practically abhorrent to emerging demographic groups like Latinos and African-Americans, not to mention an entire generation of young voters. As one of the party’s most highly respected strategists told me: “It ought to concern people that the most Republican part of the electorate under Ronald Reagan were 18-to-29-year-olds. And today, people I know who are under 40 are embarrassed to say they’re Republicans. They’re embarrassed! They get harassed for it, the same way we used to give liberals a hard time.”

It was not long after the election that elder statesmen of the G.O.P. began offering assurances that all would soon be right. But younger Republicans were not buying it. On Dec. 6, Moffatt addressed an audience of party digital specialists at the R.N.C.’s Capitol Hill Club. Moffatt spoke confidently about how, among other things, the Romney digital team had pretty much all the same tools the Obama campaign possessed. Bret Jacobson was shocked when he read about Moffatt’s claim the next day. “That’s like saying, ‘This Potemkin village will bring us all prosperity!’ ” Jacobson told me. “There’s something to be said for putting on a happy face — except when it makes you sound like Baghdad Bob.”

A few days after the Moffatt gathering, the R.N.C.’s chairman, Reince Priebus, announced that the committee would conduct a wide-ranging investigation — called the Growth and Opportunity Project — into the ways the party was going astray. To guide the investigation were familiar names, like the former Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, the longtime Florida operative Sally Bradshaw and the R.N.C. veteran Henry Barbour. Erik Telford, the 28-year-old founder of the RightOnline bloggers’ convention, told me that he found himself wondering aloud: “Do you want an aggressive investigation from people who’ve built their careers on asking skeptical questions? Or do you want a report from people who are symptomatic of what’s gone wrong?”

Equally galling to younger Republicans was the op-ed Stuart Stevens wrote in The Washington Post on Nov. 28. In it, Romney’s top strategist struck an unrepentant tone, proudly noting that the candidate “carried the majority of middle-class voters” and that the party therefore “must be doing something right.” From her office near the Capitol, Kristen Soltis Anderson, a 28-year-old G.O.P. pollster, tried not to come unglued. “But you didn’t win the election,” she told me she thought at the time. “I’m really glad you scored that touchdown in the third quarter, I am — but you lost the game!”

Anderson is a fantasy-football fanatic, with the rat-a-tat argumentative cadence that gives her away as a former high-school debater. Upon graduating from college, she became the lead singer of the Frustrations, a rock-ska group that folded, as only a D.C.-based band could, when one member decided to attend law school and another needed more time to study for the bar exam. Anderson, for her part, is now a pollster and vice president of the Winston Group. Like the Red Edge partners and virtually every other young Republican with whom I spoke, she regards herself as a socially tolerant, limited-government fiscal conservative. (Today Republicans of all age groups strenuously avoid describing themselves as “moderate,” a term that the far right has made radioactive.) Camera-ready and compulsively perky — she has twice appeared on Bill Maher’s ”Real Time” panel as a token conservative — she nonetheless lapses into despondency when talking about her party’s current state of denial. During one of the postelection panels, Anderson heard a journalist talk about his interviews with Romney staff members who had hoped to build a winning coalition of white voters. “That just stunned me,” she told me one afternoon over coffee. “I thought: Did you not see the census? Because there was one! And it had some pretty big news — like that America’s biggest growing population is the Latino community! Surprise, surprise! How have we not grasped that this is going to be really important?”

One afternoon last month, I flew with Anderson to Columbus, Ohio, to watch her conduct two focus groups. The first consisted of 10 single, middle-class women in their 20s; the second, of 10 20-something men who were either jobless or employed but seeking better work. All of them voted for Obama but did not identify themselves as committed Democrats and were sufficiently ambivalent about the president’s performance that Anderson deemed them within reach of the Republicans. Each group sat around a large conference table with the pollster, while I viewed the proceedings from behind a panel of one-way glass."

Story highlights Conservative Political Action Conference calls itself largest gathering of conservatives Most politicians considering a presidential run are appearing at the conference Last year's GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney will speak to conference on Friday

(CNN) —

Nearly a dozen Republicans who might be considering a run for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016 are auditioning in front of the Conservative Political Action Conference, which touts itself as the largest and oldest annual gathering of conservatives.

On Friday, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, will speak at CPAC. If Romney is the GOP’s past, then Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky are the GOP’s future.

Both men, considered leading 2016 Republican White House hopefuls, gave back-to-back and dueling speeches Thursday. Although different in style and with divergent plans to revitalize a party that’s lost the last two presidential elections, both men praised the conservative cause.

“We don’t need a new idea. There is an idea. The idea is called America, and it still works,” Rubio said to loud applause.

Paul said that for the Republican Party to win, “liberty needs to be the backbone of the GOP.”

Texas Gov. Rick Perry spoke a few hours later. His 2012 bid for the GOP nomination crashed and burned, but he is considering another run in 2016. Perry used his address to criticize Romney and Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee.

“The popular media narrative is that this country has shifted away from conservative ideals, as evidenced by the last two presidential elections. That’s what they say,” Perry said. “That might be true if Republicans had actually nominated conservative candidates in 2008 and 2012.”

On Friday, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a conservative favorite who battled Romney deep into last year’s Republican primary calendar, is scheduled to make several appearances. Santorum could make another run for the White House in 2016.

Big CPAC surprise: Jeb Bush not on ballot

Later in the afternoon Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who is also considered a possible presidential hopeful, will address the crowd. So will House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, the congressman from Wisconsin who was Romney’s running mate. And Friday night former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who lately has openly discussed 2016, will keynote a CPAC dinner.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin will appear on Saturday. Cruz was born in Canada to an American mother and Cuban father; his eligibility for president has been subject to debate.

Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos said there’s a reason White House hopefuls come to the conference.

“CPAC is where all 2016 candidates need to go to pass the conservative litmus test: Are they for freedom, or for something less,” said Castellanos, who is spearheading a new super-PAC called the NewRepublican.org to refocus the party’s messaging and policy goals.

Paul, Rubio provide competing glimpses of a revamped GOP

GOP strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro said CPAC is a must-do for anyone remotely thinking about the nomination.

“There’s not many other events where they all accept the invitation and are happy to parade one after the other, modeling in their swimsuits and evening gowns hoping to be amongst the finalists,” she said.

The conference, which draws tons of attention, has been increasingly critiqued as more political carnival than conference. Regardless, the confab will once again end with its GOP presidential nomination straw poll, which is considered by many as a key gauge of conservative sentiment and garners much media coverage. But there’s also been plenty of criticism in recent years that the CPAC straw poll is not the indicator it once was.

“It’s a more an anecdotal measurement than an empirical one. Its relevance as a prediction of grassroots strength within the party has waned over the last few years. It can, however, give someone who isn’t well known a shot of adrenaline so that they’re more prominently featured in any of the chatter about 2016,” said Kevin Madden, a GOP strategist who served as a senior adviser to Romney in both his 2012 and 2008 presidential campaigns. “Folks shouldn’t read too much into the results. Straw polls are kind of like political junk food. You know it’s all empty calories, but some folks eat it anyway.”

CPAC straw poll list shows wide array of 2016 potential

GOP analyst Rich Galen says the poll means nothing three years out from the election and it represents only part of the party.

“If we’ve learned anything from CPAC it’s that the conference does not represent mainstream GOP thinking. The poll is routinely hijacked by whomever wants to spend the money to get the eight hours of attention,” said Galen, who advised actor and former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson during his 2008 GOP presidential bid and is author of Mullings.com, an online column.

“Last year we not only did a straw poll but also had a national poll we announced simultaneously,” said Al Cardenas, chairman of the American Conservative Union, the organization that puts on the conference. “The outcomes were identical. The same order of top three finishers in the straw poll were the same order as the top three finishers in the national poll, and so to those skeptics who were concerned about the accuracy of the straw poll, the national poll provided empirical evidence that it was a pretty good representative sample of what’s going on.”

Romney finished first in both polls, ahead of Santorum and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

This time around there are 23 names on the straw poll ballot, including some who were not invited to CPAC.

Among those on the ballot who won’t be speaking is Chris Christie, the tough-talking New Jersey governor who is considered a leading prospect for the 2016 nomination. While popular in his party, Christie angered some on the right after praising President Barack Obama for the federal response to Superstorm Sandy, which devastated parts of the Garden State just days before the November election. Christie also criticized House Republicans for temporarily holding up federal aid following the storm.

Major conservative conference comes at crucial time for GOP

Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell also may have designs on the White House, but he is not addressing CPAC. Earlier this year he pushed through a transportation plan that included tax increases, considered heresy among fiscal conservatives. Though he doesn’t have a keynote speaking role, he is part of a panel session at the conference.

Others on the ballot without speaking spots include New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez; former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, who now heads Purdue University; and Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a major Romney surrogate last year.

Neurosurgeon Ben Carson interestingly appears on the poll – the only one on the list who’s never been elected to public office. He generated buzz in conservative circles after he advocated conservative policies on taxes and health care in front of President Obama while keynoting the national prayer breakfast last month.

There’s one glaring omission from the 23 names on the straw poll ballot: Jeb Bush, who asked not to be on the list.

Christie dismisses lack of CPAC invite

“It was our request to Mr. Cardenas when he extended the invite for Gov. Bush to speak. We asked not to be included, as Gov. Bush has said repeatedly, it is too early to think about 2016,” Bush spokesperson Jaryn Emhof told CNN chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper.

For many conservative activists attending CPAC, the straw poll is fun, but they don’t take it too seriously.

“I don’t put much weight on it. It’s a fun way of getting to see opinions, but it doesn’t predict anything,” said Ryan Robertson of Reston, Virginia.

“I did it for fun. Why not? But there’s so much time between now and then,” said Shelby Vest, a recent University of Florida graduate and first time straw poll voter.

Teresa Ferguson of Albertville, Alabama, sees a value in the straw poll.

“We’ve got to start thinking about someone, don’t we?”

She said the results may reflect the hopes and dreams of some, but added that the straw poll is “a popularity contest.”

By Kevin Murphy

KANSAS CITY, Kan. Oct 8 (Reuters) - Milton Wolf, a Tea Party activist and distant cousin of President Barack Obama, will challenge three-term Kansas U.S. Senator Pat Roberts in the 2014 Republican primary election, Wolf's campaign said on Tuesday.

Wolf, 42, a radiologist, will make the formal announcement on Tuesday evening, according to his website. Campaign manager Ben Hartman confirmed his candidacy.

""If you think that the career politicians in both parties have failed America, join us,"" Wolf said on his website. ""We are building the Wolf Pack - an Army of Davids to defeat the Goliaths...""

Wolf did not respond to a call or email seeking comment.

Wolf said on his website that he is related to Obama through the president's mother, Ann Dunham, who was born in Kansas. Obama's grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, who had a major role in raising the president, is Wolf's mother's cousin, he said.

Roberts, 77, is the latest Senate Republican incumbent to get a challenge from the right in the primary campaign. The others are Michael Enzi of Wyoming, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Enzi's challenger is Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.

Roberts is ranked by several groups as one of the most conservative senators and he is ready to run on that record, Leroy Towns, his executive campaign manager, said on Tuesday.

""It will be pretty hard for anyone to get on the conservative side of Pat Roberts,"" said Towns.

Roberts' reelection campaign has already raised about $2 million, Towns said. Although Wolf has no experience in politics, Towns said Roberts will take the challenge seriously.

Wolf said he is proud that America elected its first black president in 2008, but that he has ""profound differences"" with the president.

""Tragically, he misunderstands the greatness of America and believes it is founded in our bloated bureaucracies and government regulations,"" Wolf said on his website. ""He believes America suffers because our government is too small. I believe our greatness is found in our free people and a free market.""

http://news.yahoo.com/presidential-term-limits--necessary-and-right--or-bad-for-democracy-192726518.html,,[],"Presidential term limits: necessary and right, or bad for democracy?","The time has come to end presidential term limits, because continuing the restrictions on how long one can serve in the country's highest office is bad for the United States, a university professor argued this week.



In an opinion piece published in the Washington Post, Jonathan Zimmerman, a history and education professor at New York University, says deciding whether a president deserves a third, fourth or more terms should be left to the American people, not the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, which placed a two-term limit on the position. As background, here's an excerpt from the amendment, ratified in 1951:

""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.""

The amendment came into being a few years after Franklin Roosevelt was elected to the fourth of his White House terms. Known to Americans as the president during the final years of the Great Depression and most of World War II, Roosevelt, a Democrat, died in office before completing his last term. After the war, Republicans made a successful bid to install a two-term maximum for future presidents. But, according to Zimmerman, they limited not only the president's time in office, but also ""democracy itself.""

With President Obama's job-approval numbers down sharply, Zimmerman indicates that the nation's chief executive is perhaps being hampered by the fact that he's in his final term, giving GOP opponents and even Democrats little incentive to support him on issues that might hurt their own re-election chances.

To illustrate his point, he uses two topics in the headlines: the implemention of the new health care law and the nuclear agreement with Iran.

He writes:

""Many of Obama’s fellow Democrats have distanced themselves from the reform and from the president. Even former president Bill Clinton has said that Americans should be allowed to keep the health insurance they have. Or consider the reaction to the Iran nuclear deal. Regardless of his political approval ratings, Obama could expect Republican senators such as Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.) to attack the agreement. But if Obama could run again, would he be facing such fervent objections from Sens. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.)? Probably not. Democratic lawmakers would worry about provoking the wrath of a president who could be reelected. Thanks to term limits, though, they’ve got little to fear.""

Zimmerman adds, ""Nor does Obama have to fear the voters, which might be the scariest problem of all. If he chooses, he could simply ignore their will. And if the people wanted him to serve another term, why shouldn’t they be allowed to award him one?""



On this last point, he invokes George Washington, the first president of the United States. Washington, he says, stepped down after his second term, but not because he was required by law to do so. Zimmerman says Washington didn't support enforced term limits, citing one of his letters. ""I can see no propriety in precluding ourselves from the service of any man who, in some great emergency, shall be deemed universally most capable of serving the public,"" Washington wrote. By leaving office, however, he did establish a precedent that would be followed for more than a century.



In his ""Presidential Term Limits in American History: Power, Principles, and Politics,"" Michael Korzi, a professor of political science at Towson University, cites the first president's remark, stating that Washington departed voluntarily after his second term ""more for personal reasons than for reasons of philosophy.""



Even so, the Founding Fathers had different opinions on whether to impose a mandate on term lengths, researchers indicate. (U.S. senators and representatives don't have term limits.) Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the U.S., felt a maximum had merit. In ""Jefferson Himself: The Personal Narrative of a Many-Sided American,"" edited by Bernard Mayo, Jefferson referenced his dislike of the idea of an entrenched leader:



""That I should lay down my charge at a proper season is as much a duty as to have borne it faithfully ... . These changes are necessary, too, for the security of republican government. If some period be not fixed, either by the Constitution or by practice, to the services of the First Magistrate, his office, though nominally elective, will in fact be for life; and that will soon degenerate into an inheritance.""



As for the present, Zimmerman's idea isn't new, and in fact, rumor-researching website Snopes.com notes multiple proposals in recent years to repeal the 22nd Amendment. Republicans and Democrats alike have raised the issue, but none of the attempts have gotten too far. .



You tell us: Do you prefer to have presidential term limits? Or would you rather a president be able to run as many times as they want?"
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/28/obama-dc-circuit-nominees_n_3983733.html,2013-10-28 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Reporter'],Senate Inches Closer To Major Battle Over Obama's Judicial Nominees,"WASHINGTON -- The Senate is inching closer to a knock-down, drag-out fight over confirming nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit -- a top priority for President Barack Obama that some Republicans are determined to sink.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) filed a procedural motion on Monday to begin debate on one of Obama's three nominees to the court. Specifically, Reid filed a ""cloture"" motion on D.C. appellate lawyer Patricia Millett, which sets her up for a confirmation vote later this week.

A top Senate Democratic aide who requested anonymity in order to speak candidly predicted ""a big fight"" once the D.C. Circuit nominees hit the floor, but said the ""word is that we and [the White House] are ready to fight hard."" Reid has said that Democrats are focused on getting at least one more judge confirmed to the court, and has hinted at changes to Senate rules if Republicans stage a filibuster.

The court currently has four Democrat-appointed judges and four Republican-appointed judges, with three empty slots and three Obama nominees waiting on the sidelines. Two of the nominees -- Millett and Nina Pillard -- cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee months ago and have been awaiting floor votes. The third nominee, Robert Wilkins, is set for his committee vote on Thursday.

While partisan scuffles over Obama's nominees are nothing new, his picks for the D.C. Circuit are particularly key to his legacy. The court has broad power to review federal regulations and is considered second only to the Supreme Court in terms of its stature. The D.C. Circuit has also been a launching pad for the Supreme Court: four sitting Supreme Court justices once served on it.

Senate Republicans routinely argue that there's no need to fill the vacancies on the court. The court isn't busy enough, some say, to warrant having all 11 of its seats, and thereby should lose those slots waiting to be filled. Others have falsely accused the president of ""court-packing."" Earlier this month, GOP senators repeated those arguments to The Huffington Post.

""We do not need these judges. It's just plain as day,"" said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""They have, by far, the lowest caseload per judge. They take the summers off.""

""It's clear they're trying to pack the D.C. court,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), also a member of the committee. ""It's probably the most important appellate court in the country ... so there's a matter of great concern.""

Both predicted Republicans will use any procedural or tactical means that they can to block the nominees.

""I'm going to fight as hard as I can,"" Sessions said.

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) reiterated his party's complaints last week in a FoxNews.com op-ed.

""Republicans should remain united in blocking Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s attempt to pack the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is America's second-most-influential judicial body,"" Cornyn wrote.

But GOP charges of ""court-packing"" are factually incorrect. The term is used to describe an attempt to increase the number of judges on a court with the goal of shifting its political balance, not to fill existing vacancies. One could even make the case that GOP efforts to prevent Obama from filling empty court seats, thereby keeping those courts from having judges appointed by a Democrat, are instances of ""court-unpacking.""

Plenty of other notable voices make the case for filling the court. Patricia M. Wald, a retired judge who served on the court for 20 years, highlighted the court's particularly complex and time-consuming caseload in a Washington Post op-ed. Sid Shapiro, an administrative law expert and Center for Progressive Reform member scholar, said the average number of cases before the court is actually up, from 1,152 cases during the Bush administration to 1,362 under Obama.

Also an advocate of filling the court's empty slots: Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. He signed off on an April 5 report by the Judicial Conference of the United States that recommends keeping the court at 11 seats. Sessions, for one, hadn't heard about Roberts' recommendation.

""I want to see that quote. Where'd he say that?"" Sessions asked, jumping out of an elevator he'd just hopped into. When HuffPost cited the April 5 report, Sessions grumbled about Roberts not being a real Republican.

""He's always advocating the court. He wants pay raises for staff,"" he said. ""Otherwise, he's supposed to be conservative."""
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/03/15/Rush-Limbaugh-Caddell-Blew-Lid-Off-of-CPAC-with-Blistering-Attack-on-GOP-Consultants,2013-03-15 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],Rush Limbaugh Mocks 'Brainiac' GOP Consultants over Pat Caddell's CPAC Rant,"On Friday, conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh praised Pat Caddell, the frustrated Democrat who has often spoken out against the political establishment, for his thunderous speech at CPAC on Thursday condemning the Republican consultant class.

Caddell accused GOP consultants of caring more about money than winning elections or principles and engaging in acts that could border on racketeering.

Limbaugh said Caddell “launched both barrels at CPAC” and let the Republican consultant class “have it” while blowing “the lid off of CPAC” with what Limbaugh described was a message that “the Republican consultant class is taking the party down the tubes, that they’re making filthy amounts of money–$150 million a campaign–whether the candidate wins or loses.”

“In my party we play to win. We play for life and death,” Caddell said at a panel in a room that was only one-third full when it started and was standing room only once word spread throughout CPAC that Caddell was blistering the Republican elite. “You people play for a different kind of agenda…Your party has no problem playing the Washington Generals to the Harlem Globetrotters.”

Caddell said this mentality infected Romney, whose campaign consultants thold him to “back off” toward the end of the 2012 election and failed to realize that “you must also get your base” while courting independents.

He then blasted the “CLEC–the consultant, lobbyist, and establishment complex,” which he said was a “self serving interconnected network of individuals and organizations interested in preserving their own power far more than they’re interested in winning elections.”

“I blame the donors who allow themselves to be played for marks,” Caddell continued. “I blame the people in the grassroots for allowing themselves to be played for suckers….It’s time to stop being marks. It’s time to stop being suckers. It’s time for you people to get real.”

Limbaugh read these quotes on his radio show and wholeheartedly endorsed them, for Limbaugh told his listeners that for years he has warned of consultants who claim they have the secret formula for winning over so-called “independents” at the expense of conservatives, and the “candidates fall for it year after year after year” and lose.

“They’re all moderates. None of them are really conservative,” Limbaugh said of the GOP consultant class. “They say they are, and they think they’ve got the recipe to win.”

Limbaugh said the consultant class thinks “people in the middle, these great moderate independents, aren’t conservative. And furthermore, they think that conservatism scares these people” and they “make no effort to educate or inform or correct that impression.”

The conservative radio show host said he has always been confused by consultants who think Republicans will turn off independents by getting aggressive because “Democrats are the meanest, most extreme, insufferable” people and, “there’s nothing nice about them.”

“Somehow that doesn’t scare the independents,” Limbaugh said.

Case in point: Romney’s 2012 loss to Obama.

“He won the independents, just like these brainiacs said,” Limbaugh said. “But four million conservatives sat home and didn’t vote.”

Limbaugh noted that Caddell was right to know that consultants get advertising commissions whether the candidate wins and the GOP leaders threaten candidates they will not receive institutional support if the candidate does not hire their cronies from a list of “approved” consultants and strategists.

He said this was the “foundation for Caddell’s speech at CPAC” and consultants who led the charge of, “The era of Reagan is over,” are not big fans of him or conservatives. He emphasized that he has always been confused about why Republicans have the two Reagan campaigns as blueprints for how to win majorities by running on core beliefs and principles and fail to use them.

Limbaugh said Caddell’s speech about the CLEC was “really important” because it explains why Republicans continue to lose national elections because the consultant class just wants to be liked by the liberal Washington mainstream media and ecosytem.

“You’re happy to be walked all over. You’re just happy to be in the game. You’re happy to be acknowledged,” Limbaugh said of the permanent political class. “I really believe the pursuit to make everybody like you is the greatest prison you could put yourself in.”

Limbaugh said Republicans who want to get liked “cease being” who they are and then “you end up not even knowing who you are.”

Limbaugh blamed Romney’s consultants for telling Romney to “back off” on critical issues like Benghazi and not attack Obama in the final days of the campaign because they did not want to be disliked by their liberal peers in the mainstream media and Washington’s permanent political class.

“You try to be all things to all people, and that can’t be done,” Limbaugh said, noting that the mainstream media wants Republicans to be content with being “perennial losers” who know their place. “This effort to make themselves liked never gets anywhere. They never gain respect.”"

Dionne at the Washington Post offers some advice to the president in Obama needs to ask himself why even his supporters are growing impatient:

Well, sure. To pretend that the president can magically get an increasingly right-wing Republican House and Senate contingent to do his bidding is either naive or willfully misleading. The GOP really does hope that blocking whatever Obama wants will steadily weaken him. But the president also needs to ask himself why even his supporters are growing impatient. His whole budget strategy, after all, is directed almost entirely toward gently coaxing Republicans his way, without any concern as to whether what he is doing is demobilizing the very people he needs on his side now.

President Obama sounded genuinely outraged last week when he talked about the Kafkaesque situation at the Guantanamo prison camp, where the United States has been holding 166 men without trial for terms that are, at this point, officially endless. ""It's not sustainable,"" the president thundered. ""I mean, the notion that we're going to continue to keep over 100 individuals in a no man's land in perpetuity?"" But at least some of Obama's anger should be directed at himself, because his own silence and passivity on Guantanamo are part of the problem.

For nearly a quarter century, Howard Kurtz has served as hall monitor for Washington’s conventional wisdom, handing out demerits to independent-minded journalists who don’t abide by the mainstream rules. So, there is some understandable pleasure seeing Kurtz face some accountability in his ouster as bureau chief for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. However, the more salient point is that Kurtz, who continues to host CNN’s “Reliable Sources” show, should never have achieved the level of influence in journalism that he did. Throughout his career, he has consistently—and unfairly—punished journalists who had the courage to ask tough questions and pursue truly important stories."

Just do it, Harry.

“I’m going to make sure he’s going to have a vote next week, and then we’ll see what happens after that,” Reid told a small group of reporters in his Capitol Hill suite Wednesday morning. [...] “I’m not going to do anything now, precipitously,” he said. “But I’m looking at this very closely…. We’re going to fill that job. Cordray is there now. He’s going to get a vote.” Reid wasn’t able to explain why he believes (or claims to believe) Cordray will ultimately be confirmed. But he alluded to the possibility that he may pursue a rules change mid-session. “Whether it’s Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton that’s the next president, I don’t think they should have to go through what we’ve gone through here,” Reid said. “People better watch.”

Does Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid mean it this time? Is he really setting the stage for doing filibuster reform mid-session? We've heard the threats plenty of times before, but he seems to be pushing a tiny bit more this time, by scheduling a vote on Richard Cordray's nomination to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for next week. This could be interpreted as his effort to make the case for going nuclear to his caucus.The Cordray nomination is a good one to use if Reid wants to make a point. It's the most high-profile and public and egregious of Republican filibusters. The vast majority of the GOP caucus, 43 senators, signed a letter to President Obama declaring that they would oppose any nominee he might put forward for the job because they don't think the agency should exist. With this filibuster, they are in essence nullifying a chunk of Dodd-Frank that they disagree with, that is nonetheless the law of the land.

That's a big deal, a very big deal. It should be enough to make 51 Democrats in the Senate say ""enough,"" and convince them to finally act.

Please send an email to your Democratic senator(s) telling them to re-open filibuster reform so that we can have a functioning Senate and government."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/30/virginia-governors-race-remains-tight-closely-watched-as-window-into-midterm/,2013-10-30 00:00:00,[],"Virginia governors' race remains tight, closely watched as window into midterm, 2016 contests","Virginia voters are going to the polls Tuesday to elect a new governor in a race that has readily fulfilled its billing as the marquee 2013 contest -- smashing fundraising records and providing a window into next year's congressional races and beyond.

The top candidates -- a quintessential Democratic insider and a Tea Party-backed Republican -- have engaged in an old-school political brawl that has include go-rounds on such issues as ObamaCare, gun control and women’s rights, while attracted more than $43 million in campaign donations.

Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe leads GOP nominee Ken Cuccinelli by roughly nine percentage points in the once-reliable Republican state that voted for President Obama in 2012 and 2008 -- marking the first time since 1964 that a Democratic presidential nominee had won the state.

Virginia's evolving status as a swing state is largely the result of the changing demographics of Northern Virginia, across the Potomac River from the nation’s capital and home to a gowning number of immigrants and liberals who largely vote Democrat.

Political analysts and strategists are closely watching the race in hopes of gleaning insight about next year’s midterms and the 2016 White House Race.

“Nationally, the implications will be obvious,” says Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “If Republicans continue to nominate hard-right candidates, they will probably continue to lose a state once thought to be part of their Electoral College base.”

He also argues that a McAuliffe win “guarantees"" close friend Hillary Clinton “a Southern base of operations” should she run for president in three years.

In the race's closing weeks, McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairman and prolific Clinton fundraiser, brought in the former first lady and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to help close a contest in which he has held a small lead since mid-summer.

Meanwhile, Cuccinelli, the state’s attorney general, has brought in his own heavy hitters, including Tea Party-favorite Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, and has gotten major financial support from such powerful and deep-pocketed groups as the National Rifle Association and the Republican Governors Association, which has given $4 million.

Not everybody agrees that the race results will be a bellwether.

David Heller, a Democratic campaign strategist and president of Main Street Communications, thinks the race is too awash in money and political stardom to serve as a model for upcoming ones. And he doesn’t think the takeaway for Republicans, should Cuccinelli lose, will be that strong conservative candidates are unelectable.

“Show me a Tea Party guy worried about losing a primary,” he said. “Over and over again, we’ve seen Tea Party candidates who challenge the establishment and either win or come really close. I don’t think Republicans will say Cuccinelli losing means we have to have a more moderate candidate next time.”

The wild card in the race is Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis, who has attracted voters dissatisfied with both candidates. Though Sarvis has attracted just 9 or 10 percent of the vote, political analysts think he will cut into Cuccinelli’s totals by 2 or 3 percentage points.

Whoever wins the race has already eclipses previous fundraising for a Virginia gubernatorial race – with Cuccinelli having raised $16.8 million to McAuliffe’s $26.3 million, according to a report late last week from the Virginia Public Access Project.

The nonprofit group also reports that roughly 70 percent of that money has come from outside the state, marking the first time in which Virginia gubernatorial candidates have raise more than half of their money outside the state.

McAuliffe has gotten money from some of the country’s most wealthy liberals including Hollywood moguls Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who each gave $5,000, and President Clinton who gave $100,000.

Moreover, the 56-year-old businessman has also gotten major support from Planned Parenthood, which has helped him with women voters, including those who believe Cuccinelli is anti-abortion.

His campaign platform has been based in large part of such progressive ideals as the environment and gun control. However, Democrats have also tried to connect Cuccinelli to the recent federal government shutdown, his views on global warming and a donor scandal involving Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, despite an ethic probe clearing Cuccinelli.

Meanwhile, Republicans have tried to tie McAuliffe’s interest in a struggling, electric-car company to a federal investigation purportedly about visas for investors and his Clinton-era fundraising scheme to rent out the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House."

Given the basic political will to take on the problem at all, this really shouldn’t be that hard. The problem, of course, is that such political will is lacking in the country that must lead on this issue: our own."
http://news.yahoo.com/why-republicans-aren-t-giving-white-folks-081158720.html,,[],Why the Republicans Aren’t Giving Up on White Folks,"It seemed that Republicans had a singular message for themselves after Election Day 2012: Befriend minorities. The Grand Old Party’s popularity with Latino and black voters had dwindled to modern-day lows, and leading GOP lights publicly vowed that the work to remake the party would begin immediately. If they failed, the argument went, last year’s debacle would metastasize into political irrelevance.

But fresh hope among party strategists of retaking the Senate has bumped that existential crisis to the background in favor of a campaign plan aimed, yet again, at winning white voters.

Indeed, an early examination of the party’s 2014 efforts shows that Republicans have yet to begin writing new pages for their old playbook. Efforts to expand the map by fielding candidates in diverse states have so far been stymied. And, in any case, those races have been relegated to the second tier in favor of more-lucrative opportunities. The GOP’s midterm strategy will rely heavily on whites, especially those without a college education, and particularly in rural states where its presidential candidates win easily.

It’s not just recruitment, either. The congressional GOP’s message and agenda during the first half-year of President Obama’s second term speak to a party that—with the exception of immigration reform—seems content to regain power by focusing on red, not purple, states.

Because of a midterm map that tilts the party’s way, the strategy will likely succeed. But the short-term gain risks diverting Republicans from long-term reforms, making it a dangerous gamble for a party that by its own admission needs an overhaul. Irrelevance won’t come next year, but it very well might arrive by 2016. Even if Republicans manage to retake the Senate majority this cycle, they’ll likely lose it in 2016 when minority turnout increases and the Senate map shifts to a deluge of blue-state elections.

The most glaring example of the party’s struggle is in Senate recruitment. Here, the GOP has watched itself scramble to find strong contenders in states with a high Latino or African-American presence—in some cases, they haven’t had anyone of note emerge at all. In Virginia, for example, a state Obama won twice thanks in large part to its multiracial makeup, no serious Republican has stepped up to challenge Sen. Mark Warner. The reluctance could be chalked up to the popular Warner’s own formidable standing in the Old Dominion, but the dynamic has repeated itself elsewhere.

Story continues

Infographic

New Mexico, which President George W. Bush won less than a decade ago, is all but off the playing board for Republicans. And in Colorado, which like Virginia is one of the country’s preeminent presidential battlegrounds, Republicans are openly aghast at the lack of options after Rep. Cory Gardner last month passed up a chance to take on Democratic Sen. Tom Udall. “I have never seen a situation like this where an incumbent looks so vulnerable with no activity on the Republican side,” Dick Wadhams, a Republican consultant and former state party chair, told National Journal.

The trio of states have something in common: Whites there made up less than 80 percent of the vote in 2012. More generally, the GOP has also seen recruiting failures in Iowa, Michigan, and Minnesota, three states that, while not particularly diverse, suggest that the Republican Party is struggling to convince candidates they can win outside of deep-red states.

It’s common for parties to lack a lineup of strong recruits 18 months before the general election. They could yet emerge—the National Republican Senatorial Committee has vowed to expand the map of competitive races into otherwise blue states. But the failures stand out largely because they’re so distinct from the GOP’s success in red states.

Republicans, who are targeting all seven red-state seats currently represented by Democrats, have already found strong contenders in South Dakota (former Gov. Mike Rounds), West Virginia (Rep. Shelley Moore Capito), and Louisiana (Rep. Bill Cassidy). They’re likely to find another one in Arkansas, where Rep. Tom Cotton is expected to run.

To many Republicans, targeting those races is exactly what they should be doing. Concerns about the GOP’s long-term viability are secondary, they say, to the straightforward goal of retaking the Senate. “The NRSC is doing the job it needs to, which is focusing on this cycle and finding a path to get Republicans back to the majority,” said one senior Republican strategist, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. “The long term for them is 2014.”

It’s not just the Senate where Republicans are zeroing in on heavily white populations. The House GOP’s top targets include an array of longtime Democrats representing largely rural areas, such as Reps. Nick Rahall of West Virginia, Collin Peterson of Minnesota, and John Barrow of Georgia. That these races lead the GOP target lists can explain, at least in part, why the party has pursued an agenda largely aimed at its base. The GOP’s primary messages to date have been to repeal President Obama’s health care law, assail the president for the scandals that have gripped the White House, and oppose any gun-control expansion—issues that rouse the conservative base but fail to attract most minority voters.

The strategy could lead to success next year because of the favorable map and a midterm turnout dynamic in which older, white conservatives traditionally make up a larger percentage of the vote. But it could deceive the party into thinking that last year’s election was a fluke. “If the Republicans do reasonably well in the 2014 elections, that will be seen as further evidence they don’t need to move to [the] center,” said Guy Molyneux, a Democratic strategist. “The dynamics of an off-year election and a particularly good map for them could yield a lot of strong outcomes even if they do move to the right. That will be seen as vindication of the idea that going right is really the best electoral strategy.”

In other words, what will work in 2014 could end up costing the GOP soon thereafter."

Story highlights NEW: Michelle Obama wears a floor-length, custom, red gown designed by Jason Wu NEW: She and the president dance to Jennifer Hudson singing ""Let's Stay Together"" ""Today is the day for all of us in this country to come together,"" says a GOP leader A civil rights veteran struggles ""to keep from crying"" as Obama takes oath on MLK Bible

It was a seemingly wistful moment at the halfway mark of his presidency, before the celebratory parade and the evening’s galas.

Shortly after exhorting the United States to continue its “never-ending journey” to live up to the ideals of its founders, on his way off the platform at the West Front of the Capitol, President Barack Obama stopped to drink in the scene before him.

“I want to take a look one more time,” he told those surrounding him. “I’m not going to see this again.”

And so, with his oath of office taken – again – and the speech delivered, the president stood aside for 24 seconds on the chilly Monday afternoon, letting the crowd that had joined him for his formal, public second inauguration file past.

It was one of the few quiet moments on an otherwise jam-packed day. Obama stole another such moment with his wife, at the first of two official inaugural balls they were scheduled to attend Monday night.

Obamas party with 30,000 close friends

Following performances by Alicia Keys, Brad Paisley and the Mexican rock group Mana, the first couple danced as Jennifer Hudson sang the classic song, “Let’s Stay Together,” by Al Green.

First lady Michelle Obama wore a floor-length, custom, ruby-colored chiffon and velvet gown designed by Jason Wu, the same designer behind her 2009 inaugural dress.

The celebrations came a day after Obama was sworn in on the constitutionally required date in a low-key ceremony at the White House. The flag-waving crowd that watched Monday’s event was noticeably smaller than the throng that turned out for his first oath in 2009 but still packed the National Mall for blocks.

The waving flags, the red-white-and-blue bunting and the heralding trumpets marked the 57th such ceremony in the history of the nation, with the peaceful extension of power based on last November’s election that returned Obama to the White House.

The best Inauguration Day tweets

The Sousa marches, the ceremonial guns and the voices of James Taylor, Kelly Clarkson and Beyonce having faded away, Obama headed into the Capitol for a luncheon with members of Congress. Then he led the traditional parade up Pennsylvania Avenue, stopping near the White House to walk a few blocks of the route with the first lady to the cheers of those lining the sidewalks.

“You’ve got to come out for this,” said Nick Pignone, a Washington resident. “Everyone’s excited – good vibes right now.”

Also publicly sworn in for a second term was Vice President Joe Biden, who, like Obama, also took his official oath Sunday. Justice Sonia Sotomayor performed the honors for Biden at his home at the Naval Observatory in Washington, where the vice president’s extended family and a few Cabinet officials gathered to watch the ceremony.

Biden and his wife, Jill, also took some time to walk part of the parade route, with a grinning Biden periodically jogging over to the sidelines to shake hands with people across the barricades. Once both couples and their families were seated at the White House reviewing stand, one of the first acts to pass was the marching band from Honolulu’s Punahou School, Obama’s alma mater.

What followed included dozens of military and school bands, Native American dance troupes whirling in traditional dress, war veterans, Civil War re-enactors, kilted firefighters blowing bagpipes and Montana’s governor and congressional delegation on horseback and in cowboy hats.

10 opinions: Explaining Obama’s speech

Obama, the first African-American president and the 17th to win a second term, used a pair of Bibles in Monday’s ceremony – one from Abraham Lincoln, the other from Martin Luther King Jr. His roughly 2,000-word inaugural address hearkened back to both.

“I did everything possible today to keep from crying,” said U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, a onetime lieutenant of King. He called the sight of Obama using King’s Bible “very moving, unreal – almost unbelievable.”

Monday is also the federal holiday commemorating the birthday of King, who was assassinated in 1968.

The loudest cheer of Obama’s address came when he said the nation’s journey remained incomplete “until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts,” and “until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.”

Obama embraces key social justice movements in inaugural address

Obama begins the second half of his presidency with the opportunity to make it more historic but facing some of the same challenges that he struggled with in the first four years.

Americans “have the power to set this country’s course,” he said, urging people to fulfill their citizenship by meeting “the obligation to shape the debates of our time – not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals.”

On the Mall, Carlos Arieta and his wife, Sharon, took in the scene after driving from Atlanta to witness history. The former Washington residents said it was the first time they had attended an inauguration.

Surprised by the throngs gathered a few hours before the speech on a clear morning with temperatures just above freezing, Arieta said “it’s nice to see all the different kinds of people.”

Even some of those who didn’t support Obama’s November re-election turned out to watch. Don King, 27, and his 21-year-old brother Matthew said they don’t agree with the president on taxation, debt and other fiscal issues but didn’t want to miss this bit of history.

“It’s the second inauguration for Obama, and it’s pretty amazing if you think back to the 1800s and later during the civil rights era, that we’re here,” Don King said.

Obamas, Bidens participate in National Day of Service

A new CNN/ORC International poll released Monday indicated less excitement this time than four years ago, when nearly 2 million people crowded the Mall despite frigid weather for Obama’s historic first inauguration.

In January 2009, nearly seven in 10 Americans questioned in a CNN survey said they were thrilled or happy that Obama was about to take office. Now, according to the new, that number is down 18 points, to 50%.

Back then, six in 10 saw Obama’s inauguration as a celebration by all Americans of democracy in action, with just 39% saying it was a political celebration by the supporters of the winning candidate.

Now, the numbers are nearly reversed, with 62% saying the second inauguration is a celebration by those backing the president, and 35% saying it’s a celebration of democracy.

“The thrill is gone, along with the hope that the start of a new presidential term of office will bring a divided nation together,” said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

Gergen: Obama 2.0 – tougher, wiser?

Reality of second-term presidencies

The smaller crowd this time around reflects the reality of second-term presidencies, when the novelty and expectations of a new leader have been replaced with the familiarity and experiences of the first act.

For Obama, that difference is even sharper. His historic ascendancy to the White House in 2008 came with soaring public hopes and expectations for a new kind of governance that would close the vast partisan gulf developed in recent decades.

However, a litany of challenges, including an inherited economic recession and repeated battles with congressional Republicans over budgets and spending, only hardened the opposing positions in Washington.

Obama’s signature achievements, including major reforms of the health care industry and Wall Street, became symbols of political division, with opponents constantly accusing him of hindering needed economic recovery.

Obama’s unfinished business and battles ahead

For his second term, Obama has vowed to press for an overhaul of the nation’s immigration policies and new ways to boost the sputtering economy, proposals that are bound to spark battles with his Republican rivals, and oversee the implementation of Obamacare.

And the shootings at a Connecticut elementary school last month put the divisive issue of gun control on his immediate agenda.

CNN polling released Sunday showed a majority of Americans – 54% – believe Obama will be an outstanding or above average president in his second term, while 43% said he’d be poor or below average.

And while overall, seven in 10 Americans hope the president’s policies succeed, only four in 10 Republicans feel that way, with 52% hoping that Obama will fail.

Obama’s second-term priorities

But House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, told CNN, “Today is the day for all of us in this country to come together.”

“I think the president did a fine job, certainly, laying out what he would like to see happen as far as the future of the country,” Cantor said. “There are areas of disagreement, but there are also some things fundamentally we agree on, and that is this country is one of opportunity. And sort of the way we get there to help everybody, there are some differences. Hopefully, we can bridge those differences.”

Four other priorities for the next four years

I love going to 270towin just to scroll through the maps and see the trends over the years. New York used to be quite the swing state, don't cha know? One day when I was perusing the maps, I noticed the seeds of our current map being planted in 1988. The 84 election was virtually a shutout for Reagan and the elections before that were from the era before the solid Republican South. 1988 was the year Iowa, Oregon, and Washington in particular, which had been consistently Republican, switched to reliably Democratic (aside from IA in 04). The only Dukakis state which has not become a part of our coalition is West Virginia. While Clinton won WV both times, we have not won the state in any of the last four elections. Clinton's victories in the south were the last gasp of that previous era combined with a spoiler factor, but in the rest of the country he was able to consolidate and expand on Dukakis' kernels of strength, leaving us essentially with the map we have today.

With Clinton's unusual circumstances in mind, I looked at the four elections since he left office to see what state are actually ""swinging"". Its a short list. And it looks really good for us.

In all, 40 states and the District of Columbia have voted for the same party in each election from 2000-2012, 18 states plus DC for the Democrat, 22 states for the Republican. More importantly, our states have 242 electoral votes to their 180. With that map, all we need to do is win Florida and its over.

Five states have gone for one party three of the last four elections. New Mexico, Iowa, and New Hampshire for us, Indiana and North Carolina for them. Clinton won the three Democratic leaning states both times and lost the Republican leaning states both times, so I will put them in their respective categories. That gives us 257 to 206 with the Democrat in the lead.

That leaves Nevada, Colorado, Florida, Ohio, and Virginia which have split their votes in the last four elections. These are all states that Gore and Kerry lost and Obama won both times. Nevada was not really considered a swing state last cycle, but the rest I think will be competitive next cycle.

What strikes me is the way our strength has expanded and consolidated on those Dukakis states. We have been playing offense from the base he established in 1988. First we turned his toeholds in the Northeast, upper Midwest, and West Coast into regional dominance, then made forays first into the Mountain West then the upper South that seem to be gaining traction. Where we go from here is anyone's guess. If Republicans can cut the margins with Latinos, just to use an obvious example, we will have some trouble. Unforeseen events can change the landscape. But based on the trends I'm optimistic."

And it really can be done: states worth 132 electoral votes have already pledged to allot all of their EVs to the national popular vote winner if other states, adding up to 270 EVs, pledge to do the same. With 138 EVs to go, the electoral college would be overruled by the national popular vote by 2016.

According to the National Popular Vote Project, the following states have passed legislation to make the switch:

• California (55 EVs)

• Illinois (20)

• New Jersey (14)

• Washington (12)

• Massachusetts (11)

• Maryland (10)

• Hawaii (4)

• Vermont (3)

• DC (3)

These additional states now have Democratic governors and legislatures and can now pass an NPV law:

• New York (29 EVs)

• Minnesota (10)

• Colorado (9)

• Connecticut (7)

• Oregon (7)

• West Virginia (5)

• Rhode Island (4)

• Delaware (3)

Adding these states and their 74 EVs to the total would get us to 206 EVs with 64 to go. Rhode Island actually has a Republican-turned-independent governor, but they also have massive, veto-proof Democratic supermajorities in the state house and senate. West Virginia might be tough, given its preference for Republican presidents. And in New York, six Democrats in safe Democratic districts decided to give control of the senate to a Republican-independent coalition, even though Democrats have more senate seats. New Yorkers can debate in the comments the odds an NPV bill could pass there, or the odds the Democratic majority can retake control of the Senate in 2014.

To get the rest of the way to 270 will take ballot initiatives. Fortunately, polling shows Democrats, Republicans and independents all want to abolish the electoral college, by 66-30%, 61-30% and 63-29% margins, respectively. But we can expect Republican voters to change their minds once Fox News and the GOP echo chamber tell them it's an unconstitutional, undemocratic, anti-American liberal scheme. We can also hope Democratic and independent support rises once voters see what Republicans are plotting. Here, then, are states Obama won that have workable initiative processes and aren't listed above:

• Florida (29 EVs)*

• Ohio (18)*

• Michigan (16)*

• Nevada (6)

• Maine (4)

Asterisks denote states with Republican governors and legislators where a constitutional initiative would be necessary to prevent the legislature from overturning public will. Adding these states and their 73 EVs would total 279 EVs, 9 EVs past the goal.

There are also some long-shot states — red states with constitutional initiative processes — that we can fall back on in case some blue states prove intractable. Here they are, in order of narrowest 2012 loss for Obama:

• Arizona (11 EVs) -9% margin

• Missouri (10) -9%

• Mississippi (6) -12%

• Montana (3) -14%

• South Dakota (3) -18%

• North Dakota (3) -20%

• Nebraska (5) -22%

• Arkansas (6) -24%

• Oklahoma (7) -34%

So here's what needs to be done. The quick band-aid fix is to pass winner-take-all constitutional amendments in Florida, Ohio and Michigan to block the Republican strategy. These amendments would simply declare that all of the state's electoral votes must go to the winner. That obvious and simple proposal should be popular enough to win relatively easily, and could possibly foil the national GOP plot all on its own. The next step is to pass NPV initiatives in Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Nevada and Maine.

We also need to contact the governors, legislatures and state Democratic parties in New York, Minnesota, Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, West Virginia, Rhode Island and Delaware and not only get them on board but find powerful champions for the cause to make sure NPV laws pass. Alternatively, NPV initiatives can be passed in Colorado and Oregon.

We also need to contact the DNC to get them organizing with the states on NPV. Also, forward this info to your favorite local and national progressive blogs, columnists, TV and radio talk hosts, political leaders and advocacy organizations.



TALKING POINT: Hi! As you may know, the national Republican party has endorsed a scheme to make it all but impossible for Democrats to win the White House, by splitting up the electoral votes of states Obama won. Under the plan, Obama would have lost to Romney last November despite winning 5 million more votes. ( tinyurl.com/gopscheme ) But there's one way to prevent this from happening, which is to switch from the electoral college to a national popular vote. Several states have already made the switch to a national popular vote. ( tinyurl.com/npvplan ) I'm urging you to please read about and support a switch in order to prevent Republicans from exploiting loopholes in the electoral college. Thank you very much!

I've added(4) to the list of states that can act legislatively. Though they have a Republican-turned-independent governor, Democrats have massive supermajorities in the state house and senate that can override any potential veto."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/26/Karl-Rove-s-Crossroads-Reloading-Against-Tea-Party,2013-12-26 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],Karl Rove's Crossroads Reloading Against Tea Party,"Even though Karl Rove’s American Crossroads brand has been damaged after the group declared war against conservative candidates, the group will reportedly try to influence the 2014 midterm elections by bullying campaigns and creating groups that, on the surface, do not seem to be affiliated with them.

According to the New York Times, Crossroads “appears to be testing” its “new approach” in Kentucky. The Conservative Victory Project, the group formed to take on conservative candidates, has stayed out of Kentucky’s Senate primary between Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Tea Party challenger Matt Bevin. Instead, a group called “Kentuckians for Strong Leadership” is curiously backing McConnell while getting most of its cash from Crossroads donors. It is “legally separate from Crossroads;” but Stephen Law, the president of Crossroads, sits on its board, and the two groups share a treasurer.

Crossroads may set up “similar groups in races in which its brand may be less appealing to voters or donors.” The Times notes that this is an approach Crossroads may have to take because Rove’s organization has been so tarnished among the conservative base that candidates fear donors will not contribute to any group associated with him.

In other races, Crossroads has been threatening Senate candidates, saying the group and its affiliates will not support them if they accept support from other super PACs. According to the Times, Law warned a Republican West Virginia Senate candidate (Rep. Shelly Moore Capito) that if her campaign formed its own super PAC, Crossroads would not offer it support.

Other Republicans said they were “unwilling to let Mr. Rove and his colleagues decide which Senate candidates get the most support.” “You don’t want someone playing God above you saying, ‘You don’t need any more money in your race. You can win by a few less points,'” a Republican told the Times.

Crossroads and its affiliated groups spent nearly $450 million during the 2012 election cycle with no wins to show for it. Law said the group had good financial controls in place so that its money is not wasted."
http://news.yahoo.com/happens-no-one-wins-presidential-election-110211060.html,,[],What happens when no one wins a presidential election?,"We don’t talk a lot about the 12th Amendment at the National Constitution Center, but today marks a milestone that is an important part of the Constitution: It allows Congress to settle disputed presidential elections.

The first test of the 12th Amendment came on December 1, 1824, when the period for choosing electors for the Electoral College ended, and it became clear that a candidate wouldn’t have a majority of the votes needed to become president.

The 12th Amendment was ratified 20 years earlier to put a clear procedure in place after the tumultuous election of 1800.

The Constitution’s original provision for electing a president and vice president didn’t last more than a decade. The bitter 1800 election between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams left Jefferson in an election tie—with his own running mate, Aaron Burr.

Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution required electors in states to cast two ballots. There wasn’t a separate vote for vice president, and it was up to the political parties to coordinate among their electors to make sure vice presidential candidates had at least one fewer electoral vote than presidential candidates.

The Federalist Party did just that, making sure one elector voted for John Jay and ensuring that Adams had the most votes from his party. Jefferson wasn’t as attentive, leaving him in a tie with Burr.

The contingent runoff election between Jefferson and Burr was a true constitutional crisis. Jefferson ultimately won the House election on the 36th ballot after a week of voting. Alexander Hamilton, Jefferson’s long-time enemy, supported Jefferson instead of his old rival from New York, Burr.

And the 12th Amendment quickly followed. It was written, approved in Congress and ratified within three years, so that it was in effect for the 1804 election. The next amendment to the Constitution wouldn’t be ratified until December 1865.

The 12th Amendment made sure separate ballots were cast in the Electoral College for president and vice president; the House would settle an election without a majority winner with a contingent election featuring the top three vote getters; and the House would determine rules for conducting the election.

Story continues

Twenty years later, Congress found itself in position to settle another presidential election that involved an Adams.

In this case, it was John Quincy Adams, who was one of four candidates who received electoral votes in a bitterly contested 1824 election much like the 1800 race involving his father.

During the eight years prior to the 1824 race, political partisanship was at an all-time low. In the “Era Of Good Feelings,” President James Monroe ran basically unopposed for re-election in 1820.

But the unity inside the Democratic-Republicans, the one remaining political party in the United States, crumbled as the issues of slavery, states’ rights, regionalism, and the economy drove wedges between former comrades.

Two of the candidates had been in Monroe’s nonpartisan cabinet: Secretary of State Adams and Treasury Secretary William Crawford. Andrew Jackson was the hero of the War of 1812, while Henry Clay of Kentucky was the powerful speaker of the House of Representatives.

In the general election, Jackson led on December 2, 1824 with 99 electoral votes, but he needed 131 to win the presidency. Clay came in fourth with 37 electoral votes, which was enough to cost Jackson the election.

Under the provisions of the 12th Amendment, the election in the House involved the top three vote getters: Jackson, Adams, and Crawford (who also had suffered a stroke during the election campaign).

A lame-duck Congress was left with the task of selecting a new president over the next two months. (A vice presidential candidate, John C. Calhoun, has easily won a majority of ballots.)

It was Clay, like Hamilton in 1800, who interceded to decide the House election, in favor of the New Englander, Adams. Clay secured enough votes for Adams to win on the first House ballot on February 9, 1825, despite Jackson’s wide lead in the popular vote.

The 12th Amendment worked. It allowed the House to adopt rules about conducting the vote that became a precedent, and a winner was selected on the first ballot. Each state had one vote in the process.

But what happened next had a longer-term effect on the American political system.

Adams appointed Clay as Secretary of State, which was the second-highest position in 1824 politics, and the usual job held by the favorite to become the next president.

The anger of Jackson and his supporters about the “corrupt bargain” led to the official formation of the Democratic Party, with Jackson as its leader. Jackson won the 1828 presidential election and the two-party system that dominates current American politics was born.

After Jackson’s re-election in 1832, the remaining political factions united to form the Whig Party, to oppose the Democrats.

In an interesting footnote to history, the 1824 election wasn’t the only contest settled by the 12th Amendment. In 1837, Martin Van Buren won the election to replace Jackson as president, but there was dissent within the Democratic Party about the vice presidential candidate, Richard Mentor Johnson. During the Electoral College voting, 23 faithless electors refused to vote for Johnson.

According to the 12th Amendment, a contested vice presidential election is decided by the Senate. In February 1837, the Senate chose Johnson over a Whig rival, in a runoff election.

The Cuccinelli campaign has put its hopes for a come-from-behind victory in energizing base Republican and conservative voters. Walker and Paul both have unique appeal with voters Cuccinelli needs on Tuesday.

Walker will attend two rallies for Cuccinelli on Saturday, appearing in Spotslyvania and Woodbridge, two Northern Virginia suburbs were the Republican needs a strong vote. Ron Paul will attend an evening rally on Monday, the eve of the election in Richmond.

Libertarian candidate Richard Sarvis has unexpectedly polled strongly in the race, attracting around 10% of voters. According to polls, Sarvis is drawing more support away from Cuccinelli than Democrat McAuliffe. Ron Paul has a very strong following among Sarvis supporters and his appearance with Cuccinelli is meant to stem the tide of defections from the Republican.

For most of the campaign, Cuccinelli ran a very conventional race. He downplayed his conservative positions and focused on more narrow Virginia-specific issues. After an exceptionally negative campaign, both he and McAuliffe have high negative ratings with voters. With turnout expected to be low, Cuccinelli is returning to conservative themes to energize grass roots turnout.

On a conference call with reporters on Friday, Cuccinelli, at least twice, mentioned he was the “pro-liberty” candidate. He reiterated his early opposition to ObamaCare. He stressed that Obama’s campaigning this weekend for McAuliffe made the election a “referendum” on ObamaCare. Cuccinelli is, at last, trying to nationalize the election.

McAuliffe’s decision to campaign with President Obama is risky. It is also a sign that the Democrat is worried about his supporters’ enthusiasm. While he has slightly more support among Democrats than Cuccinelli has among Republicans, his high personal negatives could dampen turnout of voters he needs.

Cuccinelli does not hold a lead in any public poll. McAuliffe has held a small, but steady, lead in the polls for several weeks. A Cuccinelli victory on Tuesday would be a big upset, but one that is possible given the expected low turnout.

Scott Walker and Ron Paul excite key segments of the voters Cuccinelli needs. We’ll know Tuesday if it is enough."

I don't mean to alarm anyone, but if we don't pass a reasonable budget by the end of the month the folks at the National Zoo say they're going to have to let all their animals go, and they're threatening to personally drive them to my office before releasing them.""

No luck, though. The House GOP is so hamstrung that they've devolved into legislative thumb-twiddling:



The inability to find unifying principles is sometimes in plain view: House Republicans spent two days last week passing legislation that extended the authority of the government’s helium reserves, which Democrats would’ve allowed them to pass by unanimous voice vote.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/13/alison-lundergan-grimes_n_3592323.html,2013-07-13 00:00:00,['Global Editorial Director'],Alison Lundergan Grimes Wows Democratic Donors,"WASHINGTON -- Alison Lundergan Grimes stumbled out of the gate in Kentucky earlier this month when she announced that she would run against five-term incumbent Republican Mitch McConnell in next year's Senate race.

The 34-year-old Democratic secretary of state has the right blood lines: She's the daughter of the former Democratic Party state chairman. But though she is well-schooled in the basics -- firm handshake, straight-ahead manner and careful talking points -- Grimes launched her campaign without a website, position papers, staff or much of anything else.

Team Mitch unloaded with derision and precision, posting an online video portraying Grimes as Barack Obama's dancing partner (the president isn't popular in Kentucky) and a tree-hugging foe of the state's powerful coal industry.

But a Senate race is a long-distance affair, especially in Kentucky, where polls show that McConnell, the Senate minority leader, is weak, at a time when voters everywhere despise Congress and Washington. And now in the second furlong, evidence is beginning to emerge that Grimes may turn into a surprisingly formidable foe for a man who is more than twice her age.

In her first major appearance before national party leaders, Saturday on Martha's Vineyard, Grimes wowed Democratic senators, Senate candidates and donors alike at the party's annual private summer fundraising retreat.

Each year the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee invites top donors to schmooze with senators, especially those up for reelection, and inspect the merchandise of challengers who will take on Republican incumbents.

Grimes spoke to the group Saturday morning and brought the jaded and normally undemonstrative crowd to its feet in wild applause, said one top donor, who had been deeply skeptical of the idea that McConnell could be knocked off by anyone. He and another attendee spoke to The Huffington Post on the condition that their names not be used.

Grimes' feisty talk, the sources said, mixed a commitment to a Democratic job-creation agenda with a pedal-to-the-metal attack on McConnell.

""I've been going to these for years, and I have never, until this morning, seen a candidate get a standing O,"" said the donor, who is among the top 100 contributors to the committee over the last five years. ""It was amazing.""

Clearly, dislike of McConnell -- a shrewd, remorseless combatant in the Senate and in GOP circles nationally -- is one reason why Grimes was so well-received in Martha's Vineyard. It's also well-known that former President Bill Clinton, who is close to Grimes' father, encouraged her to enter the race.

But another reason that she was a hit, an attendee said, was that she exceeded expectations with a good speech, strong presence and youthful appeal. ""She's attractive, by the way,"" the donor said. ""Doesn't hurt."""

Of the $17.5 million collected so far to support mayoral hopefuls Wendy Greuel and Eric Garcetti, roughly one-third — a record $6.1 million — has gone into independent political action committees that can accept contributions of any size.

The rise of the parallel campaign finance system, awash in five- and six-figure donations that dwarf the limits approved by voters, has watchdogs of political influence sounding alarms.

“This is not the system that the reformers envisioned,” said Benjamin Bycel, who was executive director of the city’s Ethics Commission in the 1990s. The surge in independent campaign spending, he said, “essentially guts” laws setting contribution limits.

Many of the outsized PAC donations come from interests with a financial stake in City Hall decisions, including public employee unions looking to protect pay and benefits that have long used their financial might to elect political allies.

But increasingly, other donors — developers, entertainment moguls, philanthropists — are utilizing the system of limitless donations to promote their favored candidates.

The rise of the super PAC in L.A. city elections is another byproduct of U.S. Supreme Court rulings that have gradually diluted federal, state and local efforts to limit campaign contributions and spending. Los Angeles’ ethics laws cap individual and company contributions in mayoral contests at $1,300 during the primary election and another $1,300 in a runoff, if one occurs.

For decades, the high court has held that unlimited spending by independent campaign groups — and unlimited donations to those entities by individuals and companies — is constitutionally protected free speech. The only real restriction: The advertising, polling and get-out-the vote activities funded by the PACs can’t be coordinated with campaign operations controlled by the candidates.

Independent expenditures first became a significant factor in L.A.'s mayoral elections in 2001, when $1.9 million was spent by unions, billboard companies and other business interests in the contest between James Hahn and Antonio Villaraigosa. In a rematch four years later, the number jumped to $4.3 million.

A watershed came in 2008, when organized labor spent more than $8.5 million to elect state lawmaker Mark Ridley-Thomas to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. That was nearly nine times what Ridley-Thomas raised for his own campaign.

With mixed success, labor groups have been seeking to replicate that winning formula at City Hall and, this year, some prominent business interests have joined their efforts.

In the current mayor’s race, two candidate super PACs — Working Californians for Wendy Greuel and Lots of People Who Support Eric Garcetti — have received the biggest share of the unlimited money, taking in five- and six-figure donations from unions, contractors, developers and others.

Garcetti is also getting help from the Committee for a Safer Los Angeles, created by Obama campaign fundraiser Samantha Millman. And Greuel has been assisted by a committee created and financed by EMILY’s List, a Washington, D.C.-based group that backs Democratic women who favor abortion rights.

McCourt Group, headed by former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, has given $50,000 to Working Californians for Greuel, which is headed by officials with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the union that represents Department of Water and Power employees. McCourt is expected to develop property near the team’s Chavez Ravine stadium.

Petrochem Manufacturing, which produces road resurfacing materials for the city, gave $10,000 to Working Californians. Construction management firm AECOM, which regularly seeks city contracts at the airport and harbor, gave $25,000 apiece to PACs backing Greuel and Garcetti. And Meruelo Enterprises, a company involved in real estate, banking and media, spent $34,500 to help Garcetti.

The biggest super PAC donations by far have come from organized labor. The DWP union, which is looking to negotiate a new contract, has put at least $1.45 million into Working Californians for Greuel. Another private-sector branch of the same union, which is pushing for a law allowing new digital billboards in Los Angeles, gave the committee $250,000. So did the city firefighters union, which opposed Garcetti’s vote to reduce staffing at stations during a budget crisis.

“The bottom line is, we would have given the same amount of money whether it was Wendy or whether it was Eric,” said Frank Lima, president of the United Firefighters of Los Angeles. “The members didn’t go with Eric based on the cuts.”

Unions have spent so much on Greuel — $3.5 million in unlimited donations, or more than nine times the amount for Garcetti — that their spending has threatened to become a drag on her campaign. In a USC Price/Los Angeles Times poll conducted last week, voters named Greuel as the candidate who cares more about unions representing city employees than about Los Angeles as a whole.

By comparison, organized labor, mostly private-sector unions, had given $382,000 in uncapped contributions to efforts to elect Garcetti. The Teamsters and longshore workers at the Port of Los Angeles contributed $100,000 each, and the supermarket clerks union, which is fighting a Wal-Mart supermarket in Chinatown, kicked in $50,000.

The flow of uncontrolled money has come on top of more than $11.3 million collected directly by the Greuel and Garcetti campaigns through thousands of small donations at or under the $1,300 limit.

Entertainment interests led the way, with studios, producers, directors and others providing at least $955,000 for Garcetti and at least $555,000 to Greuel, an analysis by The Times found. Not far behind were real estate, development and construction interests, which gave at least $809,000 to Greuel and at least $666,000 to Garcetti. Lawyers and law firms came in third, giving Greuel slightly more than Garcetti.

Garcetti took $14,700 from employees of Jamison Services, which leases office space to various city agencies. He received $8,400 in contributions from employees of McCormack Baron Salazar, a firm that recently completed a 90-unit affordable housing project with $12.3 million in city funding.

Greuel received a combined $9,600 from eight employees of Tutor Perini, parent company of the firm that won a $266-million contract to rebuild a runway at Los Angeles International Airport. At least $6,500 came from executives at Fifteen Group, which is looking to raze and rebuild one of the city’s largest apartment complexes in Boyle Heights.

By complying with the city’s spending limits, Greuel and Garcetti also secured a combined $2.9 million in taxpayer funds for their campaigns. That was another voter-approved reform intended to widen the field of City Hall candidates and encourage those who lack personal wealth or backing from well-heeled special interests to run for office.

The growing reliance on unlimited money has spread to other races. Backers of city controller candidate Dennis Zine, including the LAX police officers’ union, have been funding the Committee to Control Wasteful Spending. Supporters of City Atty. Carmen Trutanich, who is in a tough reelection fight, created L.A. Residents for Accountability. Independent campaign operations also have sprung up in an array of City Council races.

Jaime Regalado, professor emeritus of political science at Cal State L.A., said this year’s campaign is stark evidence that unlimited donations to super PACs are beginning to eclipse sums gathered from a broader cross section of average citizens, undermining the spirit of “one person, one vote.”

“The more a role that large money plays in politics,” he said, “the less democratic [the system] becomes.”

http://news.yahoo.com/virginia-new-jersey-election-republican-lessons-200258255.html,,[],"After Virginia and New Jersey, voters offer GOP advice for 2014","Tuesday told a tale of two campaigns — and perhaps provided two lessons for 2014.

In New Jersey, GOP Gov. Chris Christie sailed to victory by 21 percentage points in the Democrat-dominated state.

In Virginia, meanwhile, Republican Ken Cuccinelli couldn’t eke out a win over Terry McAuliffe, a candidate who occasionally received voter approval ratings south of 30 percent and who was dubbed either “cancer” or “a heart attack” by ""The Daily Show."" How does Cuccinelli lose to a candidate voters dislike so widely?

For sure, he and Christie are different. Cuccinelli’s low approval ratings in Virginia mirrored McAuliffe’s. The New Jerseyan, on the other hand, boasts bipartisan appeal — note his high-profile post-Sandy bromance with President Barack Obama — and is perhaps that rare blue-chip candidate whom Republicans can’t realistically place on every ballot.

Do these two high-profile gubernatorial elections furnish the GOP a strategy going forward? Who better to ask for a plan than the voters? Yahoo News invited Republicans and conservatives in each state to perform a postmortem on Tuesday’s results and also to look forward to future campaigns: What did their party learn that it can apply across the nation in 2014, 2016 and beyond?

Here’s advice voters offered the morning after. Click their names to read their full thoughts.

Abandon social conservatism

Annie Tobey, 53, votes for Republicans in most Virginia elections. But on Tuesday, she backed Libertarian Party candidate Robert Sarvis, who received 6.6 percent of the votes. She writes:

Increasingly, the Republican Party is influenced by the tea party, which is controlled by religious fundamentalists. Cuccinelli is a sterling example of this religious domination, especially controlling a woman's body and depriving gays and lesbians of equal rights.

Increasingly, as in the 2013 governor's race, I find myself called upon to choose between financial slavery and personal slavery: The Democrats want to hijack my purse, while the Republicans want to control my personal life. I'd rather give up my money.

Story continues

Until the Republican Party can promote both social and economic liberty, I will not be able to give them my support, in 2014 or beyond.

Hammer away at Democrats’ support of the Affordable Care Act

Jeff Dunsavage, 51, is a lifelong New Jerseyan and lives in Dunellen. He has voted Republican in nearly every election since he first registered. He writes:

The next Democratic presidential candidate will reap the grief or glory of Obamacare. If President Obama and the Democratic leadership can bring this beast to heel, the party will have something to crow about. If not, the ACA may well be the vehicle that carries a Republican into the White House.

Right now, Christie seems the most likely beneficiary. But a lot can change in a few years.

Robert Peterson is a 36-year-old conservative voter in Sterling, Va. He writes:

McAuliffe's biggest weakness in my opinion was his full-sell mentality regarding the ACA, and it wasn't until late in the election that the Republicans advertisements focused on the effect that ACA would have on the Virginia budget and Virginian businesses that are shouldering new requirements of the health care law. If ACA fails, it should be the Republicans’ prominent lead in 2014 and 2016.

Stop being such a politician

Arrivanna Brooks, 28, lives in Clifton, N.J., and has voted Republican in elections since she was 18. She writes:

Christie's campaign teaches us that politicians need to be, well, non-politicians. In other words: Be more honest, reach across the aisle, commend the other side, don’t always say no just to say no. That resonates. Christie does not mince words, but he stands up for what he believes in. Republicans often say one thing and then distance themselves if they field a lot of blowback. Say what you mean. Stick by it. Voters want that loyalty.

Make campaigns more about issues and less about the party

Ashley Raybourn has been a registered voter and Republican in Virginia for 10 years, but cast a Democratic ballot for the first time. She is 28 and votes in Hampton.

The race for governor in New Jersey turned out quite differently; Christie won by a landslide. As colorful a character as he is, I think the Republican Party could stand to learn a lot from him. He wasn't afraid to point fingers at his own party when federal disaster relief was held up by House Republicans and he worked with a Democratic president in Sandy's aftermath. Some Republicans, such as myself, are fed up with members in our own party and he showed that it's OK to call them out and even reach across the aisle in the best interest of his constituents.

And take heart: It’s not all moonlight and roses for Democrats, either

Lyn Brooks, 45, lives in rural southwest Virginia near Roanoke. She writes:

Results show McAuliffe beat Cuccinelli by fewer than 55,000 votes statewide. That number is hardly a ""clear mandate"" that shows approval of Obama, Obamacare, or even a clear repudiation of the recent government shut down, threat of default, or the tea party.

Would a more socially moderate Republican have defeated McAuliffe? The narrow victory margin certainly suggests this.

The fact that McAuliffe beat Cuccinelli by such a small number should concern Democrats as the 2014 midterm elections draw near. To me, this narrow victory implies that Democrats face strong headwinds, and there is still time for Republicans to repair the fallout from this year's government shut down. If issues continue to plague the roll out of Obamacare, and if millions of Americans continue to receive cancellation notices in the mail from their insurers due to Obamacare, Democrats will pay the price in 2014 for Obama's lie: ""If you like your plan, you can keep it,"" just as President George H.W. Bush paid the price for his infamous falsehood, ""Read my lips: no new taxes."""

WASHINGTON -- After a record-setting Inauguration in 2009, President Obama's second time around later this month is expected to be a bit smaller affair. In fact, there will be just two official inaugural balls that the president and first lady are anticipated to attend.

The Commander-In-Chief’s Ball, started by President George W. Bush, is for members of the U.S. military. The Inaugural Ball is for the general public.

Both events will be held throughout the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on Mount Vernon Square. The public can request tickets for the Inaugural Ball at the event's official site. The tickets are priced at $60 and requesting tickets does not guarantee entrance to the event.

Although Obama will attend the lowest number of official inaugural balls since Dwight Eisenhower, there's no shortage of State Society Inaugural Balls and other celebrations, from the Black Tie & Boots Ball to the Kentucky Bluegrass Ball to the North Carolina Society's big party at Nationals Park.

Joe Biden is going to Iowa.

Let us now explicate.

The vice president (that’s Biden) is scheduled in September to attend Sen. Tom Harkin’s annual steak fry, which is what you do for a presidential race even if you have no taste for steak. Biden knows that merely by attending he is suggesting that he might enter the Iowa Democratic caucuses, which, as usual, will be the lead-off contest for the 2016 presidential election. If he does so, Clinton will be his likely opponent. Will she say she’s been to Togo?

Will she say she’s been to where no secretary of state had ever been before — the Cook Islands, for instance? Will she echo the constant refrain from her State Department tenure — that she traveled more than any secretary of state in history, an astounding 956,733 miles, which is 38.42 times around the world and which, you have to concede, is a lot? Iowans may be impressed, but being First Frequent Flier is not enough to get them out on the forbiddingly cold night when the caucuses will be held. Clinton, as my Post colleague Dan Balz points out, needs a message.

At the moment, her only one is that she is a woman. Becoming the first female president is a worthy goal, but it kind of falls into the category of miles traveled and countries visited. It is an achievement, even a stunning one, but it is not a stirring trumpet call. Even now, her statistics-laden tenure has been somewhat eclipsed by her successor at State. John F. Kerry has already managed to bring Israelis and Palestinians together to resume peace talks. If these talks produce an agreement (not likely, but still . . .), then all this talk about miles traveled is going to sound awfully silly.

Clinton is undoubtedly the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 2016, but then she is always the front-runner until something trips her up. The last time out — 2008 — it was her own dismal campaign and, of course, the emergence of one Barack Hussein Obama, a junior senator promising “hope.” To counter that, Clinton had no real message of her own. Instead, there was a fustiness about her, a familiarity that was both good and bad. She was — remains — Bill Clinton’s wife, and that, as we all know, is both good and bad.

Now, just as Kerry is strutting his stuff as secretary of state, comes the revolting Anthony Weiner, whose association with Clinton through his wife, Huma Abedin — a Hillary Clinton intimate — has the Clintons running so fast the other way she may well revisit Togo by the time this is over. Once again, the Clinton past proves to be toxic. What she needs is a present — an emphatic now.

There are few people in public life as smart as Hillary Clinton. A conversation with her is always instructive. She’s also a good person and — almost as important — she knows how to laugh. But if she is to run for president at the age of 68, she must rediscover her youth. She has to revert to the brave and inspiring woman who was the first student to deliver the commencement address at Wellesley College (a seven-minute ovation) and made her a national figure overnight. In other words, she has to lead.

If Biden runs — he will be 73 in 2016 — he will do so as a vice president. As did George H.W. Bush, he will seek office as a continuation of the previous presidency. At the moment, Gallup gives Obama a healthy approval rating of 80 percent among Democrats. He does less well among the public at large — 44 percent in the most recent poll — but it is Democrats who vote in the Democratic caucuses and primaries. It can’t hurt to be Obama’s vice president.

The 2016 presidential nomination is Hillary Clinton’s to lose. Already, a group called “Ready for Hillary” has raised money on her behalf. Emily’s List, the formidable organization dedicated to the election of women, has virtually endorsed her — and she has, to mangle a word, the vastest network of friends and supporters of any American politician. She can probably raise $1 billion with the snap of a finger. All she lacks is what she has always lacked — an overriding, stirring message. Lots of people are ready to march, but they need to know in what direction.

House Democratic leader says the party is coalescing behind Hillary Clinton for 2016

She calls Hillary Clinton better qualified than her husband or Obama when they look office

Pelosi stayed officially neutral in Clinton%27s 2008 nomination battle with Obama

WASHINGTON — House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday the Democratic Party was coalescing behind Hillary Rodham Clinton as its presidential nominee for 2016, and she urged the former secretary of State to get in the race.

In an interview on USA TODAY's ""Capital Download,"" Pelosi stopped just short of formally endorsing Clinton.

""I'm not making endorsements right now, because I don't think that's appropriate,"" she demurred. ""But I am gauging, I'm gauging. I'm encouraging people to think about it, so in case she asks us, we have something to say to her.""

Does she think the party is coalescing behind Clinton?

""I think so; I think so,"" she said. ""There's a great deal of excitement about the prospect that she would run.""

The California congresswoman, herself a groundbreaker as the only woman to serve as speaker of the House, made it clear what her advice would be: Do it. ""I don't know why she wouldn't run,"" Pelosi said. ""She's prepared. She's well-known. She's highly respected. She knows she could do the job very, very well.""

In 2008, Pelosi was House speaker and stayed officially neutral in the primary battle between Clinton and Barack Obama. She drew ire from Clinton's campaign with a comment that it would be ""harmful"" for unelected ""superdelegates"" to determine the nomination. At that key moment, support from superdelegates was seen as the only way Clinton might prevail.

Pelosi describes Clinton as historically well-qualified to be commander in chief, noting she has served as first lady, a New York senator and a member of the Senate's Armed Services Committee as well as head of the State Department.

""If Secretary Clinton were to run — and we think if she ran, she would win — I believe that she would be the best-prepared person to enter the White House in decades, in decades,"" Pelosi said, ""with all due respect to her husband, present company and other presidents.""

In early polling, Clinton leads the 2016 field, but there are other prominent Democrats who have expressed interest in running, among them Vice President Biden. In a Quinnipiac University Poll released last month, Clinton was supported by 65% of Democrats for the nomination, trailed by Biden at 13% and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo at 4%."
"http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-cap-bribery-20131107,0,6758018.column",2013-11-07 00:29:00,"['Capitol Journal Columnist', 'Political Columnist George Skelton Has Covered Government', 'Politics For Nearly Years', 'For The Times Since']",Political money needs a tighter rein,"SACRAMENTO — In politics, there’s sleaze that can send a slimeball to prison. There also is legal bribery. Lots of it.

“Campaign contributions provide a fig leaf for legalized bribery,” says campaign finance expert Robert Stern, who helped write California’s political reform act four decades ago.

“Ninety percent of campaign money comes from people who want something from government. And often they get it. Nobody gives campaign money to incumbents who have no real [reelection] competitors without thinking they’re getting something in return. Nobody wastes their money.”

Legal campaign donations, however, do not equate to sleaze.

Putrid sleaze is what state Sen. Ronald S. Calderon (D-Montebello) is alleged to have wallowed in during an elaborate FBI sting, according to a federal affidavit disclosed last week by the Al Jazeera America cable network. In the affidavit, the FBI alleged that Calderon took $88,000 in bribes, most of it from undercover agents.

Calderon has not been charged with any crimes and, through his attorney, has denied wrongdoing.

Nevertheless, Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) did the right thing Wednesday. He took steps to remove Calderon from his Senate committee assignments, including chairmanship of the coveted Insurance Committee, a “juice” panel that attracts generous campaign donations.

The allegations against Calderon “cloud any interactions the senator might have with colleagues, [lobbyists] and the public,” Steinberg said, calling the accusations “the most serious breach of the public trust.”

True. And I’m not saying that legal bribery is as odorous as smelly sleaze. But it does tend to emit a stench.

Campaign money actually gets a bad rap, to one degree. It costs a fair amount to run a competitive race.

If the public is unwilling to finance the campaigns of state politicians — and public financing has become impractical anyway, because of U.S. Supreme Court rulings — then the political funds must come from some other source. A very wealthy candidate might be willing to finance his own campaign, but normally the funding is supplied by favor-seeking special interests.

One problem, however, is that money in a campaign account doesn’t have to be spent on running for office. It also can be spent on goodies — such as four-star dinners and boondoggle trips — as long as it “reasonably” relates to a legislative or governmental purpose. For example: educating oneself on high-speed rail in Japan or the wine industry in France.

So campaign contributions can significantly enhance a politician’s lifestyle.

And a campaign fund is only one of several pots that special interests can fill to ingratiate themselves to officeholders.

There are “officeholder” accounts, which are especially important to incumbents who are not seeking reelection and are therefore barred from raising campaign money. Unless, as many do, they create a phony account ostensibly to run for another office.

They can dip into those officeholder pots for so-called legislative and governmental purposes — taking the staff to Morton’s for a dinner meeting, for instance, on the special interests’ dime.

Business execs dine lavishly, of course, but the company pays.

I’d require all legislative junkets to be paid for by the company — the government. If an officeholder’s fancy meal or trip truly has a governmental purpose, it ought to be paid for by the taxpayers. And if it can’t be justified, then it shouldn’t happen.

“You and maybe 5% of the people think the public should pay,” Stern says. So the special interests gladly do.

The interests — labor, business, casinos — also donate to politicians’ pet charities in their names. Those contributions are called “behested payments.” It’s a three-fer: the interests curry favor with the politicians, they earn tax write-offs and — probably their last concern — they help the charity.

Advertisement

Behested payments only need to be officially reported if they exceed $5,000 per year from a single interest. Even so, $2.3 million has been reported in the names of legislators this year.

And roughly $3 million has been reported on behalf of Gov. Jerry Brown, practically all of it for two charter schools he created in Oakland while mayor.

Legislators can also solicit special interest money for a legal defense fund. In case they get snagged in a sting. Unlike a campaign fund — for which there’s a $4,100 contribution limit per election, or $8,200 total for the primary and general — there’s no donation cap for a legal kitty.

“There’s a common thread that ties every single one of these” pots, says Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC and a former chairman of the state Fair Political Practices Commission. “That thread is a Capitol culture that is overwhelmingly focused on fundraising.”

Advertisement

A culture of hitting up special interests practically 24/7.

Schnur would ban fundraising while the Legislature is in session. “This would give legislators back five or six hours a day to do the job they were elected to do,” he says.

Steinberg won’t go that far. But the Senate leader says he does intend to introduce legislation to limit the amount of money that can be raised in a non-election year. “Probably $50,000.”

That would help a little. But I’d also limit what the money could be spent on — no gourmet dinners, no boondoggle trips.

Advertisement

The Legislature will never do that. It’ll require some moneybag reformer to finance a ballot initiative.

Meanwhile, spare me the spin from politicians that they aren’t influenced by any of these special interest investments. That’s like saying a dog isn’t influenced by petting.

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']","Dana Milbank: Big tent, with an asterisk","The Republican National Committee released a report Monday charting the party’s road to revival — only for RNC Chairman Reince Priebus to give its most important recommendations the Grand Old Punt.

Tucked into the 100-page document — mostly a compilation of prosaic suggestions such as “reinstitute field finance team structure” and “develop a surrogate list of women” — are a few crucial sentences about policies Republicans must embrace for the party to remain viable: a path to legal status for illegal immigrants and more acceptance of gay rights.

Republicans “must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,” it concludes. “If we do not, our party’s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.”

Further, the report concludes, Republicans “need to make sure young people do not see the party as totally intolerant of alternative points of view. Already, there is a generational difference within the conservative movement about issues involving the treatment and the rights of gays — and for many younger voters, these issues are a gateway into whether the party is a place they want to be.”

But in his 27-minute speech at the National Press Clubannouncing the report, the words “immigration” and “gay” didn’t cross Priebus’s lips. Questioned by the moderator about whether there is “a need to shift some basic positions on some of the issues,” he asserted that there is not. “No,” he said, “I think our policies are sound.”

After the event, reporters surrounded Priebus to ask him about the report’s call for “comprehensive immigration reform” — shorthand in Washington for a policy that includes legalization. “To some people, that means securing the border; to some people, that means E-Verify,” he said, referring to workplace checks of immigration status. “To some people, that means a pathway.”

Politico’s Jonathan Martin pressed him on legalization, and the chairman bristled.

“You’re not going to bulldog me, buddy,” Priebus said.

Presumably, he meant “bulldoze,” but his response, a felicitous echo of “Don’t tase me, bro,” is an indication of how bullheaded the party remains on immigration reform.

The report’s authors had been assigned to diagnose mechanical problems in the party, not policy problems, but they recognized, correctly, that the hard line on social issues “will limit our ability to attract young people” and women, and that the hard line on immigration repels Latinos: “If Hispanics think that we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies.”

One of the report’s authors, Ari Fleischer, said before Priebus’s speech that the demographic gap “is a killer” for the party. “It’s going to be very hard for Republicans to win if Republicans don’t do better in many of these communities,” said Fleischer, a former spokesman for George W. Bush.

Priebus, giving the presentation on his 41st birthday, said that after November’s “wake-up call,” the Republicans were taking “a fresh start.” With commendable honesty, he acknowledged that “focus groups described our party as narrow-minded, out of touch and, quote, ‘stuffy old men.’ . . . The perception that we’re the party of the rich, unfortunately, continues to grow.”

“We know that we have problems, we have identified them, and we’re implementing the solutions to fix them,” the chairman said.

But he dismissed the notion that these problems could be related to positions the GOP has taken. “To be clear, our principles are sound,” Priebus asserted, moving on to read a flurry of numbered recommendations: “Nine, work with state parties, sister committees. . . . Third, I want to hold hackathons in tech-savvy cities.”

Many of the ideas are good, such as the calls for fewer debates and primaries rather than caucuses. But Priebus, in the Q&A, took pains to avoid offending the conservative orthodoxy that is antagonizing segments of the electorate that Republicans need if they are to win. He embraced voter ID laws (an irritant to many minority voters) and was cautious about GOP Sen. Rob Portman’s acceptance last week of same-sex marriage (“It’s not a matter of whether I support his decision. I support him doing what he wants to do as an elected person and as an American.”).

The chairman also declined an invitation to distance the party from inflammatory commentators on racial matters such as Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter. “I think our whole team is a blessing,” Priebus replied. “I welcome everyone into our party, no matter what spectrum in our party or wherever they’re at on the conservative, in that bandwidth, they’re welcome.”

All are welcome in the Republican Party — as long as they’re conservative.

There are five known manuscript copies of the Gettysburg Address, all written by Lincoln himself.

Politician Edward Everett delivered a speech just before Lincoln delivered his address that day. Everett later wrote to the president that his two-hour speech did not compare to Lincoln's two-minute speech.

The famous speech, which starts with ""Four score and seven years ago,"" was delivered four months after Union forces defeated the Confederacy at the Battle of Gettysburg. That battle was considered a turning point of the Civil War.

The crowd gathers for the dedication of the cemetery.

Lincoln gave the speech at the dedication of what is now called the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

A crowd gathers to hear President Abraham Lincoln deliver the Gettysburg Address on November 19, 1863. Lincoln is seen in the center, just to the left of the bearded man with a top hat.

Story highlights Lincoln didn't even get top billing at Gettysburg ceremony honoring Civil War dead Keynoter Edward Everett spoke for two hours at Gettysburg, Lincoln for about two minutes Obama answered a question at a Thursday news conference for six full minutes Modern speeches done by committee show how all writers want to get their points across

(CNN) —

It is a lesson from the ages: Lawmakers like to talk.

Even in this advanced age when thoughtlets, capped at 140 characters, are tweeted as discourse, politicians still tend to prattle on.

So here’s a cue from Abraham Lincoln: Cut it short.

When Lincoln took the stage, 150 years ago November 19, to offer a dedication at a cemetery for war dead in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the story goes that he wasn’t very popular. He didn’t even have top billing at the event. Lincoln had been asked to “please offer a few appropriate remarks.”

He settled on about 200 words.

Obama’s no-show at Gettysburg event: snub or smart?

The keynote address was given by Edward Everett, the Massachusetts statesman hailed at the time as one of the nation’s greatest orators. Ever hear of him today?

Everett spoke for more than two hours. Lincoln spoke for a little more than two minutes.

“The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here,” Lincoln said, ironically; the Gettysburg Address is now regarded as one of the most elegant, thoughtful and well-crafted speeches in American history.

The words are etched in stone next to his statue at the Lincoln Memorial.

150 years later, newspaper retracts editorial panning Gettysburg Address

That’s a strong case for brevity. And it’s a case Lincoln seems to have learned during the course of his very difficult presidency.

His first inaugural address, at 3,670 words, was delivered as he tried to keep the nation together. It was far longer than either of President Barack Obama’s.

But Lincoln’s second inaugural address, at 700 words, delivered after years of war, is considered by many to be the best inaugural speech in U.S. history, and is also one of the shortest.

It included one of the most important one-liners in history, with the South beaten but not yet surrendered, and as the nation started a very long and difficult healing process.

“With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.”

The shortest inaugural address in history was delivered by George Washington as he entered his second term. This one perhaps goes too far. It was just 135 words and didn’t include any talk of policy, just a promise to adhere to the oath of office.

But the longest is a cautionary tale against over-speechifying. William Henry Harrison spoke 8,460 words, caught pneumonia and died a month later.

Fast-forward 150 years from Lincoln’s 200 words in Gettysburg. When Obama took to the podium in the White House briefing room Thursday and took a question from CBS News’ Major Garrett – granted, it was a two-parter – he went on for a full six minutes before Garrett asked a follow-up. The news conference went on for about 50 minutes.

Love the president or hate him, you’ve got to admit he can talk.

It is hard to imagine a modern-day speech gaining the historical importance of something like the Gettysburg Address.

Ronald C. White Jr. is a Lincoln scholar who has paid particular attention to Lincoln’s speeches. He’s author of “A. Lincoln,” a biography of the 16th president.

Lincoln’s great short speeches, he argued, were different from modern-day addresses in a number of ways, not the least of which is the teleprompter.

“Speeches are meant to be said, not read,” White said. He feels Obama does better when he engages with an audience, speaking from the heart like when he’s campaigning rather than reading from a teleprompter.

“When he does that, I don’t think he’s nearly as effective as when he doesn’t,” White said of Obama. “He’s more engaged.”

Presidents’ best phrases are tweetable

He said Lincoln wrote the Gettysburg Address and had it memorized, although he took text out of his breast pocket before delivering it.

Another problem today, according to White: speechwriters.

“It’s almost like a committee where everyone involved in the writing process wants to get their points in.”

Speeches today also feel too crowded, he said.

“In the second inaugural, everybody expected Lincoln to talk about the policy of the government … he didn’t offer any policies. He gave a speech that offered the moral imperative. The policy would follow later.”

We know Obama takes great care in editing the speeches drafted by his speechwriters. There is a remarkable photo of all the revisions in his own hand on one sheet of a 2010 address to a joint session of Congress.

See it here

The Library of Congress has posted drafts of the speech, written in Lincoln’s hand, on its website.

See it here

White wishes today that speeches were printed in the newspaper so that people could actually read them and get at what the lawmaker is saying. After he watches a speech on TV, he said, the first thing he does is turn off the TV.

“We don’t read speeches anymore,” complained White, who is of the mind that instant analysis on TV keeps people from really digesting what was said.

But the largest problem for lawmakers giving speeches isn’t a shortening collective attention span or political pundits or teleprompters. It’s the lack of trust in politicians and the institutions of government.

“We’re cynical,” White said. “We’re cynical about speeches and about words.”

He Left The Post In April']",Republican Party could learn a lot from the Democrats of 1989,"The Republicans of 2013 look a lot like the Democrats of 1989 — shut out of the presidency, beholden to a shrinking base and on the wrong side of major demographic shifts in the country.

That’s the argument two longtime Democratic strategists — Bill Galston and Elaine Kamarck — make in an essay titled “The New Politics of Evasion” in the fall edition of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas. For any Republican hoping to win back the White House in 2016, it’s an absolute must-read.

What Galston and Kamarck set out to do is revisit a famed essay they wrote in 1989 about their own side’s political and policy failing, titled “The Politics of Evasion: Democrats and the Presidency.”

In that first essay, Galston and Kamarck write, “we debunked the views of our Democratic colleagues who hoped, as do so many Republicans today, that their fortunes would start looking up when a popular two-term President passed from the scene, and we laid out the kinds of changes the party would have to embrace if it wished to regain its competitiveness in presidential elections.”

The diagnoses and proposed prescriptions the duo outlined for Democrats almost a quarter-century ago also apply to Republicans today.

First, what’s wrong. Galston and Kamarck broke the Democrats’ problems into three basic “myths”: the myth of “liberal fundamentalism,” the myth of “mobilization” and the myth of “the congressional bastion.”

The first myth centered on the idea that Democrats had come up short at the presidential level in 1980, 1984 and 1988 because the candidates they had nominated — Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis — were insufficient adherents to liberal orthodoxy. If only the party had nominated a “true liberal,” the argument went, they would have won. Sound familiar? The critique from many within the GOP over the past two elections is that neither John McCain nor Mitt Romney were dyed-in-the-wool conservatives, and that had the party nominated someone like, say, Rick Santorum, it might have won.

The second myth — of mobilization — is all about demographics. In the 1980s, Democrats insisted that if only blacks and Hispanics would vote in numbers commensurate with their share of the population, the party’s nominee would win. They didn’t, and Democrats didn’t win. Fast-forward to today and some within the Republican Party are making that same losing argument about consolidating the white vote. “[T]he Republicans’ demographic problem is the mirror image of the one that Democrats faced a quarter-century ago,” Galston and Kamarck write. “Back then there weren’t enough minorities to make the Democrats’ electoral strategy work; today, there aren’t enough whites to make the Republican strategy viable. The same long-cycle trends that gradually helped Democrats are now hurting Republicans.”

This demographic myth is perhaps the most dangerous for Republicans as they seek a way back to the White House in 2016. Remember that the white vote as a percentage of the overall electorate has declined in every presidential election since 1992. As GOP strategist Pete Wehner has noted, if Romney had carried the white vote by 20 points — as he did in 2012— with the demographic makeup of the country as it was in 2000, he would be president today. But, he’s not.

The final myth is that of the “congressional bastion,” the idea that if the party out of the White House still controls a chamber of Congress and/or a number of state and local offices then it’s evidence that all is well and major change isn’t required. This is the most prevalent argument you hear from Republicans today; yes, the party has lost two presidential elections in convincing fashion, but the fact that it retains control of the House and has a chance to retake the Senate majority in 2014 are a testament to the continued strength of the GOP’s messaging. But, holding a House majority in a deeply gerrymandered set of districts is not the same as winning a national presidential election. And the 2012 election proved that the massive gains the GOP made in the 2010 midterms are more the exception than the rule.

The diagnosis by Galston and Kamarck of what ails the Republican Party is not new; Wehner and former George W. Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson wrote a terrific piece for Commentary magazine this past spring entitled “How to Save the Republican Party” that makes many of the same arguments.

The problem for smart Republican strategists is not figuring out what’s wrong, but developing a real and pragmatic plan to fix it. Democrats fixed their problems of the 1980s with one man: Bill Clinton.

“There’s no substitute for a leader with the guts to break with outdated party orthodoxy, as Clinton did on trade, fiscal policy, welfare and crime among other issues,” Galston and Kamarck write. “And he did more than that: In that famous Sister Souljah episode, he spoke out against a tendency in the party’s base that crossed the line from protest to extremism.”

The obvious analog to Clinton in the modern Republican Party is former Florida governor Jeb Bush. Bush, like Clinton, spent much of his formative life as a governor and, on issues ranging from education to immigration, has shown a willingness to break from Republican orthodoxy and the party’s base.

Unlike Clinton, who long signaled his plan to run for president in advance of the 1992 race, Bush remains an elusive figure when it comes to his future plans. If Bush decides against a bid, there is no other obvious figure who fits the Clinton-circa-1992 mold, although Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) probably has the most chance to remake the Republican coalition among those candidates expected to run.

History has a way of repeating itself. Republicans would do well to realize that the Democratic Party of 1989 has many lessons to teach the GOP of today. And they would do well to realize it sooner rather than later."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/24/Van-Jones-Obama-is-an-unabashed-Communitarian,2013-01-24 00:00:00,['Rebel Pundit'],Exclusive – Van Jones: Inaugural Address Proves Obama's a 'Communitarian',"After President Obama’s second inaugural address, Van Jones, former Obama White House “green jobs” czar, praised the speech, calling it “Djobama Unchained” (after the controversial movie Django Unchained, about a freed slave taking revenge). On Wednesday night, during a lecture at Loyola University Chicago, I asked Jones what he meant. He explained that while President Obama is not a socialist, he is, in fact, a “communitarian.”

After a long recapping of the first four years of the Obama’s presidency, Jones elaborated:

It’s very interesting to see him now, actually, free.

Watching this man for four years, for everything he’s done to try to reach out to the other side, and frankly neglect his base, has just been called socialism, and just been called divisive, no matter what he does.

I was happy to see him unleashed and unchained and just be able to speak from his heart.

And what he said was, similar to what I’ve been saying, there is a “New Patriotism.”

(The rest of Jones’s answer is here.)

Jones compared the president’s address to that of Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and recommended that the theater full of college students read Reagan’s “powerful” and “strong,” inaugurals, which he said were “rooted in American tradition and values,” but “unabashedly” and “unapologetically conservative.”

Following Jones’s comparison of President Obama to Ronald Reagan, the “unabashedly conservative” president, I pressed Jones further for some insight into what and who President Obama really is.

Jones replied: “He is a communitarian.” He then elaborated briefly: “I mean you always have individualism, communitarianism, as a part of the, American story, and I think we’ve overbalanced the individualistic direction and I think he’s trying to rebalance toward communitarianism.”

Later, when asked (off tape) to define “communitarian,” Jones was unable to answer or to point toward any source for a definition. He said there wasn’t really a way to look up “communitarianism.”

He did reiterate, however, that he saw communitarianism as a counterbalance to libertarianism, which he equated to “individualism.”

Jones declined an interview with Breitbart News following the lecture.

Bush than President Barack Obama, according to the latest Fox News Poll. But former President Bill Clinton is liked best of the three.

The poll finds 50 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of Bush, while 47 percent have an unfavorable view.

By contrast, Obama has a net negative rating: 46 percent have a favorable opinion of him, while 52 percent have an unfavorable opinion.

Views of Clinton are far more positive: 70 percent favorable vs. 26 percent unfavorable. That gives him a huge net positive rating (+ 44 points).

The two former presidents and President Obama attended the memorial service for South African leader Nelson Mandela on December 11, and Bush joined Obama on Air Force One for the flight to Johannesburg.

Obama’s favorable rating has been more positive than negative for almost his entire presidency. However, in the last few months, during the botched health care roll-out, opinion of Obama has reversed.

At the end of Bush’s second term he had a 34 percent favorable rating (December 2008), but that’s been increasing the last few years during his retirement.

There’s a large partisan gap in views of Obama and Bush; for example, there’s an 80-point difference in Obama’s favorable rating among Democrats and Republicans. And there’s a 60-point gap in Bush’s positive rating from the two parties.

Eighty-five percent of Democrats have a positive view of Obama, while just five percent of Republicans feel that way.

Likewise, 85 percent of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Bush, while just 25 percent of Democrats agree.

Fully 93 percent of Republicans rate Obama negatively. In contrast, Bush’s unfavorable drops to 74 percent among Democrats.

Presidential Job Performance Comparisons

President Obama ends his fifth year in office under water on his job rating by 12 percentage points: 41 percent of voters approve of the job he’s doing, while 53 percent disapprove.

President Bush ended his fifth year in office in negative territory too, by nine points: 42 percent approved of his job performance and 51 percent disapproved in the Fox News poll conducted mid-December 2005.

Obama’s average approval rating for 2013 is 44 percent, just slightly below the 2005 average approval of 46 percent for Bush.

The Fox News poll is based on landline and cell phone interviews with 1,027 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from December 14-16, 2013. The full poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points."

(You can analyze them all in PPP's PDF.) But there's absolutely no good news in here for Chafee, which in a way is too bad, since Raimondo, the state treasurer and Democratic front-runner, seems to occupy ideological space to Chafee's right. She's made her mark cutting union pensions and is at the forefront of the austerity movement, even encouraging the creation of a shadowy ""pension overhaul"" group called EngageRI that won't release the names of its donors.

Providence Mayor Angel Taveras seems like the more progressive choice, and in a primary matchup without Chafee, he trails Raimondo 44-35, with former state Auditor Ernie Almonte at 9. So while Raimondo is tight with big-money interests, these numbers suggest Taveras could pose a real threat to her if he makes the race.

P.S. There's been strong movement in favor of gay marriage in Rhode Island, with voters now supporting it 57-36. To show you how fast the issue has moved, when PPP asked two years ago, the margin was 50-41 in favor. Hopefully these numbers will buttress marriage equality supporters as legislation to legalize same-sex marriage makes its way through the legislature (it's passed the House but conservative Democrats in charge of the Senate are making things very uncertain).

Senate:

• KS-Sen, -Gov: Republican Secretary of State Kris Kobach says he'll seek re-election to his current job in 2014, which is noteworthy only because it means he won't be issuing a primary challenge to either Gov. Sam Brownback or Sen. Pat Roberts, both of whom go before voters again next year.

• MA-Sen: Well, blargh. After hemming and hawing and even contradicting published reports saying he'd run for Senate, conservative Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch finally launched his campaign in the special election to succeed John Kerry. And Lynch's preferred campaign message is exactly as chip-on-the-shoulder as you'd expect. Indeed, seeing as he begins the race way behind in the polls against fellow Rep. Ed Markey, Lynch's only hope is to go negative. He's off to a fast start:



""It will be an uphill fight for me, but the fight is worth fighting. Shame on us to allow someone to clear the field, box out all the other candidates, and buy the election,"" said Lynch, in an apparent reference to Markey....

In addition to attacking Markey, Lynch undoubtedly will try to run to his right. Here's the first taste:Never mind that Elizabeth Warren handily beat Scott Brown without trying to clone his most cloying attributes, as Lynch prefers to do. In any event, the person Lynch is appealing to most right now is Brown himself, since the Republican former senator has to be licking his chops at the prospect of a nasty primary between the two Democrats. Brown still hasn't announced a decision, but surely this development can only make his entry more likely.

So what should Markey do now? Fortunately, he has two advantages: He's got a lot more money than Lynch, and he's got a terrific progressive profile. I don't think he necessarily has to respond in kind to Lynch. Rather, he can and should tout his credentials loudly in order to lock down the liberal vote, which still constitutes the majority of the primary electorate, despite what Lynch may believe. Lynch of course will have his union allies, but in a statewide primary like this, there are lots of votes out there for Markey to unearth.

Oh, and put up your freakin' website already. That would help.

P.S. Lynch also picked up the endorsement of the Iron Workers union—but seeing as he once was an iron worker himself, this is like Rudy Giuliani endorsing the Yankees. Still, it'll be worth watching to see whether any labor groups back Markey (this is the first union endorsement in the race), or whether Lynch will lock them all up.

• NJ-Sen: There was nothing in Al Capone's vault... but it wasn't Geraldo's fault. However, if the gasbag TV clown actually follows through and runs for Senate in New Jersey, it most definitely will be his fault. The most amazing thing? Geraldo, long berated as a lunatic liberal by FOX News types, wants to run as a Republican!

Gubernatorial:

• WY-Gov: I have to admit that while I can probably name the governors of all 50 states, I struggle to remember the name of the guy in charge of Wyoming. But (god bless Wikipedia) that would be Republican Matt Mead, elected in a landslide in 2010. Assuming he runs again, will he be re-elected next year? In ruby red Wyoming, you'd have to bank on it—unless, of course, he faces a primary challenge. And it looks like he's just earned one, though it's hard to tell how serious it is.

It turns out Mead just signed a bill that strips State Superintendent of Public Instruction Cindy Hill ""of leadership of the state Department of Education, reassigning those duties to a person appointed by the governor."" Hill is challenging the move in court, but I'm guessing the fact that Mead was able to shunt her aside via legislative maneuvering means Hill doesn't have a whole lot of friends in the establishment.

Other Races:

• OH-Treasurer: It's the news you've all been waiting for: DKE's least-favorite Republican of the 2012 cycle, Josh Mandel, says he'll seek re-election as state treasurer next year. Mandel, of course, was solidly thumped by Sen. Sherrod Brown, despite being the beneficiary of eleventy-zillion moneys spent on his behalf by outside groups. Of course, after first winning his current post in 2010, Mandel promised he wasn't looking for an immediate promotion, so I definitely won't trust his current pronouncement until the filing deadline passes. Hopefully we'll get to beat him again, though!

Grab Bag:

• DCCC, NRCC: Despite being deep in the minority, House Democrats outraised their GOP counterparts by a wide margin in the 2011-12 cycle: The DCCC took in $184 million versus $156 million for the NRCC. That probably helped the Democrats pick up seats, though of course the majority remains as elusive as ever. In any event, both parties started the year with $1.5 million in cash, while the D-Trip had slightly higher debt ($13.5 mil vs. $12 mil).

• Polltopia: If you're a careful poll-watcher, you've probably noticed what I've noticed over the last couple months, which is Rasmussen putting up strangely positive numbers for the Democrats, on presidential approval and especially on the generic House ballot. As far as the latter is concerned, they've been putting up take-back-the-majority type numbers with Dem leads in the high-single-digits, usually notably better than what other pollsters like PPP are finding. Well, Harry Enten has noticed too, and he takes Rasmussen to task for it.

You might be thinking that Rasmussen is consciously overcompensating for its overly-Republican results over the previous few cycles by putting a thumb on the scales in the Dems' direction, but it's not that simple; instead, it looks like they're just committing the same methodological problems that have always plagued them, but in the wake of a solid 2012 election for the Dems, that leads Rasmussen down the same screwed-up path but in the opposite direction.

Instead of weighting based on demographics using Census data like good pollsters usually do, Rasmussen continues to weight based on party ID in the last election (a bad idea, because party ID isn't an immutable characteristic but one that fluctuates easily based on who's up and who's down politically). Dems had a six-point edge in 2012 exit polls in 2012. So, now we've got a weighted sample in Rasmussen polls that's 38 D, 32 R: maybe right for a presidential election, but overly rosy for a midterm. (David Jarman)

• Texas: PPP has some Lone Star State miscellany, asking their usual gay marriage and sports questions. (Did you ever imagine there'd be a pollster with an equal interest in both topics? This is why Tom Jensen is awesome.) GOP Sen. Ted Cruz's first job approval ratings are pretty meh, at 36-30, but that actually gives him the highest net approval of any statewide elected official PPP's tested there. Meanwhile, as you'd expect, most Texans are opposed to same-sex marriage, by a 55-35 margin, but 61 percent support some form of legal recognition once you include civil unions."

Will Weatherford, speaker for the Florida House of Representatives, stands against his party's efforts to

skew the will of voters by rigging the electoral college to favor the GOP.

While Republicans ponder their plans to rig the system so that a Democratic presidential candidate who wins a state's popular vote in 2016 won't win a majority of the Electoral College votes in that state, two prominent members of the party in Florida are saying no way. If the system had been arranged in 2012 the way leading Republicans intend for the future, Mitt Romney would now be sitting in the Oval Office despite having lost the popular vote by nearly five million ballots.

Republicans in states where they hold majorities in the legislature but where President Obama won the popular vote, and thus the electoral college vote, want to award the latter's votes by how things went in GOP-gerrymandered congressional districts. If that system had been in place last year in the six target states—Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida, Virginia—it would have shifted as many as 64 electoral college votes, yielding a close victory for Romney. Republicans are most definitely not proposing to introduce the same plan in states like Texas. There Obama lost the popular vote but would have gained 12 additional electoral votes if the Republican congressional district plan had been in effect.

This isn't some phantom threat of election theft. It's been endorsed by many Republicans, including Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus. It's not the sleaziest ace-up-the-sleeve trick Republicans have ever played, but it ranks high on the list.

However, there are a few Republicans who think the plan reeks:



Virginia State Sen. Ralph Smith (R) has come out against a proposal to apportion electoral votes in the state by Congressional district, warning it could set off a chain reaction of similar schemes around the country. Smith sits on the closely divided Privileges and Elections Committee that is examining the bill, meaning his opposition likely ensures the proposal doesn't reach the floor for a vote.

""To me, that's like saying in a football game, 'We should have only three quarters, because we were winning after three quarters and the beat us in the fourth,'"" Weatherford [...] told the Herald/Times. ""I don't think we need to change the rules of the game, I think we need to get better."" [...] Not only is Weatherford opposed to the idea, fellow Republican and Florida Senate President Don Gaetz is decidedly cool to it. When asked about changing the way Electoral College votes are apportioned, Gaetz thought the entire system should be scrapped. ""I think we should abolish the Electoral College but nobody in Washington has called to ask for my opinion,"" Gaetz said. ""If James Madison had asked me, and I had been there, I would have said a popular vote is a better way to do it."" Gaetz said the electoral college shrinks the presidential campaign to a handful of states as it did in 2012.

And Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford doesn't like the idea , and he isn't alone among the state's party leaders who take that stand:

That puts Gaetz in line with what many progressives say. The National Popular Vote project takes a kind of backdoor approach to breaking the back of electoral college with a system in which state legislatures enact laws guaranteeing that the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote nationwide gets the state's electoral votes, too, if enough states sign onto the compact. So far, states with a total of 132 electoral votes have signed on. Once the project encompasses enough states to reach electoral 270 votes, the system is activated.

If Gaetz and Weatherford are serious about their views, they ought to propose it formally in the Florida legislature. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who has also spoken in favor of the popular vote approach, could encourage her state legislature to do the same. Together, those states would bring the National Popular Vote project up to 172, nearly two-thirds of its goal. Making the NPV a success would stop this crooked scam in its tracks and turn the electoral college into an anachronistic appendage.

Join us in supporting Interstate Compact on a National Popular Vote."

I want to be here. There are all kinds of people that think I should be in the U.S. Senate,"" Schweitzer told AP. ""But I never wanted to be in the U.S. Senate. I kicked the tires. I walked to the edge and looked over.""

Schweitzer aides did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The popular former governor had been widely expected to run since Sen. Max Baucus (D) announced his retirement. And as recently as this week, people close to Schweitzer were under the impression that he was about to enter the race.

With his exit, Democrats must find a candidate capable of holding another open seat in a red state. They are still seeking standard-bearers in two other red states where they have retiring Democratic incumbents: South Dakota and West Virginia.

Those three seats would go a long way toward Republican efforts to reclaim the Senate majority in 2014 -- a goal that requires the GOP taking six Democratic seats.

Democrats also must defend three other red states where incumbents are seeking reelection -- Alaska, Arkansas and Louisiana -- along with swing states in Iowa and North Carolina. About the only GOP seats that could conceivably be in play at this point are red-tilting Kentucky, where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) faces Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes (D), and an open-seat race in Georgia that is still taking shape.

Schweitzer's decision is expected to open the door for other Republicans to run, most notably freshman Rep. Steve Daines. Currently running on the GOP side are former state senator Corey Stapleton and state Rep. Champ Edmunds.

Republicans immediately sought credit for pushing Schweitzer out of the race.

“Just two days ago, Senate Democrats were quoted promising Brian Schweitzer tremendous resources to get in the race,” said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ""We did our homework and there was a lot of rust under Schweitzer's hood – a lot of rust.""

Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, insisted Democrats remain in position to hold their majority.

""We remain confident that Democrats can hold the Montana seat and the overall math still favors Democrats next year,"" Cecil said. ""Only three Democratic incumbents have lost reelection in the last decade. Our incumbents are positioned to win, we've already recruited a strong challenger to Mitch McConnell and Republicans have failed to expand the Senate map into blue and purple states.""

Among other potential Democratic recruits are state Supreme Court Justice Brian Morris, state Sen. Kendall Van Dyk, state schools superintendent Denise Juneau, state insurance commissioner Monica Lindeen and Stephanie Schriock, the president of the Democratic women's group Emily's List.

Schweitzer is thought to be interested in a potential run for president in 2016. He also recent accepted the chairmanship of a major mining company in Montana.

The Senate seems to be a tad less polarized since the female population rose from 17 to 20 this year. It’s also possible that there’s been more productivity since women got more power. For instance, the Budget Committee has a new chair, Patty Murray of Washington, and it has produced a budget for the first time in four years.

It’s conceivable that the committee was inspired by a rule that would have canceled the senators’ salaries if they didn’t deliver. But I’m hoping for a larger picture.

“Women tend to listen to what everybody’s needs are, rather than just saying: ‘I’m the only bright person in the world and you have to listen to what I say,’ ” suggested Murray in a phone conversation from her home state, where she was inspecting a spectacular bridge collapse. We will all stop here to envision the moment in the State of the Union address when President Obama called for more bridge repair projects and John Boehner failed to applaud.

The Senate passed its budget two months ago, after 50 hours of debate and an all-night series of 70 amendment votes. The next step was to send members to a House-Senate conference committee, but the Republicans held that up, arguing that before the conference committee could work on an agreement, the Senate should decide what the agreement would say."

Christian Adams'],"53,000 Dead Registered Voters in Florida, Millions Nationwide","The Florida Secretary of State has discovered 53,000 dead voters registered to vote. The Secretary of State has also flagged thousands of potential non-citizens who are also registered to vote. This discovery is indicative of a wider national problem with dead and ineligible voters on the rolls heading into the Presidential election.

In the 2012 legislative session, Florida finally passed a law requiring the use of the Social Security Death Index (SSDI) to determine if dead people are registered to vote in Florida. Secretary of State Kurt Browning and then-State Election Director Don Palmer proposed this idea in the previous legislative session, but the bill did not pass.

Florida discovered the dead voters by matching voter rolls against the SSDI.

The SSDI is the list of Americans who have died and applied for death benefits. Because an application must be submitted by the next of kin and carries criminal penalties for false statements, it is considered the most accurate list of dead voters available.

Yet most states don’t use the SSDI. Instead, they use a hodge-podge of other information, usually compiled from the state bureaus of vital statistics. But state bureau reporting is slow and incomplete.

Three counties in Florida have reported more citizens registered to vote than people alive eligible to vote – St. Johns, Okaloosa, and Santa Rosa – according to the most recent Election Assistance Commission report.

Having dead people infesting the rolls is the first step to voter impersonation.

Federal law requires states to have a reasonable voter list maintenance program and gives the Eric Holder Justice Department the power to sue states that don’t. Not surprisingly, Holder’s DOJ has not brought a single case under the law to require states to clean up corrupted voter rolls. Indeed, when I served at the DOJ Voting Section, an announcement was made in November 2009 that this provision of the law would not be enforced. The political leadership was philosophically opposed to the law, and they said so.



Make no mistake, the problem of corrupted voter rolls is not confined to Florida. It extends to New Mexico, Iowa, Indiana, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, and other states. Judicial Watch has notified various states they are in violation of the law and will be filing lawsuits to force the sort of clean-up that Florida has now started.

Many resist cleaning up the voter rolls as directed by the Secretary of State. Brenda Snipes, the Supervisor of Elections in Broward County (Fort Lauderdale) is one.

“I’m feeling really uncomfortable about this,” Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes told officials with the state’s Division of Elections.

With the election just months away, the time for removing ineligible voters is now. Unfortunately, millions are on the rolls across the nation, and election officials from the DOJ to local offices are reluctant to act."

Ann and her eleventy billion houses and her fancy horse and her two Cadillacs will be just fine, thank you very much, but as for the rest of the country ... Ann weeps for you. A lot:Remember, those tears of self-pity, because it's very hard to lose, are not for her. They're for you, America. For you.She may be mostly dead, but she's nowhere near done whining about it:

Damn you, America! But at least she's not bitter. Not like, say, her husband:



MITT ROMNEY: The president had the power of incumbency. ObamaCare was very attractive, particularly to those without health insurance. And they came out in large numbers to vote. So that was part of a successful campaign.

I think they had a better ground game. And I think we were not aware -- you know, we certainly had the passion coming from our side, and I don't think we were as aware of the passion that was coming from the other side. I think we were a little blindsided by that.

Curse that sneaky president and his popular policies that made people want to vote for him instead of the guy who called them a bunch of deadbeat takers! Oh, plus, also having a better campaign that everyone except the Romneys could see:Yeah, it sure it surprising when all the polls turn out to be right and Karl Rove is wrong.

Also, Ann thinks the media and the Obama campaign were very unfair to her husband because he's a swell guy—no, really, he is!—and yet, for some reason, no one saw that.



WALLACE: Do you think the media was in the tank for Barack Obama? (LAUGHTER) ANN ROMNEY: I think that it's -- anytime you're running for office, you always think that you're being portrayed unfairly. And, you know, we -- of course, on our side believe that there's more bias in favor of the other side. I think that that's a pretty universal -- universally-felt opinion. WALLACE: What do you think of the campaign that Barack Obama ran? ANN ROMNEY: I think, obviously, it was a winning campaign. It worked. WALLACE: Do you think it was fair? ANN ROMNEY: No. WALLACE: In what way? ANN ROMNEY: Portrayal of my husband. He is an exceptional, wonderful person. (LAUGHTER) MITT ROMNEY: She's not biased at all. ANN ROMNEY: I'm not biased! And, you know, and he -- I mean, he really is a selfless person that really, truly cared about the American people. He truly cares about making a difference and about helping others. And for him to be portrayed in a very negative light in another way was very hard. He has enormous skill set in dealing with difficult issues and I totally believe at this moment if Mitt were there in the office, that we would not be facing sequestration right now.

If Mitt were president, there would be no sequester. Also, no war, no debt, no terrorism, no child would go to bed hungry at night, it would never rain on your wedding day, and everyone would have a pony. Two ponies! Because Mitt's that good. See what you're missing, America? DO YOU GET IT NOW?!?!?

Because Ann can't stop talking, Wallace then speaks with Mitt separately. He explains how Obama sucks because if Mitt were president, we wouldn't have the sequester, and also, Mitt totally worked with Democrats that one time he was governor, so, ya know. He woulda fixed all those problems by now. And as for all those awful things Mitt couldn't stop saying during the election? He didn't mean them anyway:



Yes, it was a very unfortunate statement that I made. It's not what I meant. I didn't express myself as I wished I would have.

Yup. That's the Mitt we all knew and despised—the guy who would say anything and then insist it's not what he meant anyway. Really a shame he's not our president now, isn't it?"

It was nearly 11 p.m. when Terry McAuliffe took the podium to deliver his victory speech. With 99% of precincts reporting, McAuliffe had captured 47.4% of the vote. His challenger, Republican Atty. Gen. Ken Cuccinelli, a tea party favorite, won 45.5% of the vote.

A week ago, a Washington Post poll showed McAuliffe with a 12-point lead.

Democrats had hoped the election would strike a decisive blow against the tea party, sending a message to the GOP that ideologically extreme candidates were not electable in swing states. Instead, the takeaway is murky.

Cuccinelli was outspent nearly 2 to 1. Some Republicans are sure to argue in coming days that he could have won if only he had a little more support from GOP donors.

PHOTOS: Election Day 2013

Voters were not particularly enamored with either candidate as both campaigns put most of their effort into launching attacks. McAuliffe joked in his victory speech, “I think every single person in Virginia is glad the television ads are over.”

McAuliffe, a former national Democratic Party chairman, had positioned himself as a moderate in the campaign. He focused his remarks on the need for bipartisanship and for making “Virginia a model for pragmatic leadership that is friendly to job creation.”

But both his speech and Cuccinelli’s concession, which preceded it, highlighted how divided the battleground state is likely to be for some time on major national issues.

Cuccinelli referred to Obamacare as an “out-of-control healthcare law” that he would continue to fight. “This battle is not over with this race,” he said. “It goes on and it will continue to go on.”

McAuliffe, for his part, highlighted his plan to aggressively implement the healthcare law in Virginia, with a major expansion of the state’s Medicaid program.

“It was perhaps the clearest issue voters had in this election,” he said. “We need to accept the Medicaid expansion and bring the Virginia taxpayers’ money back to Virginia.”

Neither did voters on Nov. 6.

Remember this shocking, game-changing revelation? Neither did voters on Nov. 6.

According to Nielsen numbers, Hannity lost around half of his audience in the weeks after the election, while his Fox News colleague Bill O’Reilly — who steadfastly refuses to identify himself politically as a conservative — retained around 70% of his audience. So what happened to Hannity? The going wisdom is that viewers who basked in his preelection anti-Obama rhetoric tuned him out when they were stunned to wake up on Nov. 7 and discover that the President had won a second term — a scenario that Hannity had all but promised could never happen.

“The right-leaning outlets like Fox News and Rush Limbaugh’s show are far more intellectually closed than CNN or public radio. If you’re a rank-and-file conservative, you’re probably ready to acknowledge that ideologically friendly media didn’t accurately inform you about Election 2012. Some pundits engaged in wishful thinking; others feigned confidence in hopes that it would be a self-fulfilling prophecy; still others decided it was smart to keep telling right-leaning audiences what they wanted to hear.”

The election left a little tarnish on the crown of the Clown Prince of Conservative Entertainment Complex™. New York Daily News: The NYDN quotes Conor Friedersdorf from The Atlantic for some perspective:For what it's worth, the more left leaning and centrist pundits, Rachel Maddow on MSNBC and Anderson Cooper on CNN, have seen little audience erosion. Maddow lost little and Anderson virtually none.

I'd certainly like to think that it reflects a permanent dispiriting that would signal a major realigning of the goals and tactics of the Conservative Entertainment Complex™. I'd like to think they'll wake up and recognize that constantly catering to the basest instincts of the Republican Party—however divorced from reality they might be—is not ultimately a good strategy. I'd like to dream of a world where the unmitigated bullshit the Conservative Entertainment Complex™ spews becomes their own undoing when the populous decides to seek out better sources of information.

But Conservative Entertainment Complex™ appears to have learned nothing from the election results.

I really think it's a cyclical blip. The Conservative Entertainment Complex™ won't see the light that easily, and their viewers haven't realized Hannity is feeding them a pack of lies. They're basically just dispirited and depressed and want to avoid all the bad news. They want to avoid having their nose rubbed in their fail during this very sensitive time. And, of course, they're all at guns shows stocking up. They have bunkers to build, dammit.

The fact that the lefter-leaning media is untouched indicates people who are able to cope with information from the reality-based universe are still interested and engaged in politics, and those who can't are just hiding out.

But the need Fox News' crowd feels to escape from reality and make their own alternative universe will not go away overnight.

And, by the time midterms roll around, Hannity will continue to feed his viewers lies and distortions and ridiculous hyperbolic nonsense. And his audience will sense—in their gut—that ""this time will be different!"" And they will follow him right over the Conservative Entertainment Complex™ cliff once again. Whatever charlatan Hannity and company will anoint as the savior of the conservative movement, they'll rally around them. There will be 2014 version of Romney, Mourdock, Cain, Akin, O'Donnell, Angle and Palin ... (or maybe those actual people, past failure is never a disqualifier).

Whoever it is, they will have finally found their ""true conservative"" and this time, the perfect conduit for the message! They'll find a silver bullet, be it Benghazi or the birth certificate or some new fabricated poutrage, and that one will really make the voters finally see the ""truth.""

And so it will continue.

Which is not to say we shouldn't savor this sweet moment of schadenfreude. Happy New Year! Please enjoy."

Although over time both Romney and Obama were perceived as moving farther away from the average voter, Romney was still closer to this voter on Election Day. The candidate who would have benefited most from a shift to the center was Obama.

So, Romney was always going to lose, even though they had all convinced themselves (even Romney!) of their impending victory. Hence, if you expect to lose, don't change anything! Just keep doing the things that made you expectedly lose.Republicans don't need to shift to the center. Democrats do! And the evidence is some YouGov chart that proved that Obama should've talked to the center. Instead, he didn't. And unfortunately for him (and lucky for Republicans!) Obama won.

If only he had shifted, all of this could've been avoided!



It is certainly true that Americans are moving left on some issues—most notably same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization. But Obama did not win the election because America is becoming more liberal, he won it despite the fact that America has become more conservative [...] Far from ushering in a liberal majority, the Obama administration has presided over a shift among Americans toward preferring less government, not more government. Obama has helped to increase the overall conservatism of the American public more than Reagan ever did, ironically enough.

Go down every single issue—every one!—and Democrats lead Republicans. Yet this unskewer takes data from a single model to claim that America has become ""more conservative"" because they want smaller government.

After Ronald Reagan's second term ... George H.W. Bush got elected. If Reagan made America ""more liberal"", America had a funny way of showing it. And if Obama made Americans more conservative, it only stands to reason that they'd reelect him again, right?

Fact is, the Democrats remain firmly in the American majority on every issue of note. So, if conservatives want to argue that some random chart proves that America is with them, they can knock themselves out. In the real world, things look a lot different.



The GOP will also benefit from what political scientist Alan Abramowitz calls the “time for a change” factor: only once since the 22nd Amendment limited the president to two consecutive terms has a party held the White House for more than two terms in a row.

perhaps we’ll realize that all this talk of a “liberal majority” or “Obama’s mandate” or even a “Democratic realignment” was overblown. And perhaps we’ll even remember that the exact opposite argument was made in 2004, when evil genius Karl Rove was supposed to have ushered in a Republican realignment and Democrats would never win another election unless they could appeal to “values voters.” Those predictions of a Republican majority were soon proved false.

Past performance is no indicator of future results. And that's doubly so in electoral politics, where the sample size is so small. I mean, the 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951, so we're talking a sample of just 16 presidential elections.Those predictions were false because they weren't rooted in data, but ideology. The GOP didn't win in 2004 because of value voters, but because of warmongering. The ""ideas"" that people assumed drove the American public were bullshit—even then, big majorities of Americans believed in sensible gun restrictions, higher taxes for the rich and corporations, and protecting Social Security and Medicare. The only major social issue in which we were the minority was marriage equality, and even that's no longer the case.

Current discussions of the future electoral dominance of Democrats isn't based on ideology or perceptions of what the American people believe. Rather, they are based on the cold hard math of demographics. Our base groups are growing and becoming more Democratic. Theirs are dying off (even as they become more Republican). It's that simple.

So it's interesting to see that in an entire piece by a bunch of political scientists trying to convince us that 2012 didn't prove squat, there isn't a single mention of demographics. Not even in passing. That stunning omission is the written equivalent of putting your fingers in your ears and screaming, ""la la la I can't hear you!""

But hey, some random thing said America is more conservative and that Obama should've tacked to the center, so all's cool!

Washington (CNN) - In personal and biting terms, House Speaker John Boehner argued that President Obama's failure to find agreement with Republicans is a result of his lack of

""courage"" and ""guts"" to do what it takes.

""To do the kind of heavy lifting that needs to be done, I don't think he's got the guts to go do it,"" Boehner told a group of television reporters and anchors in a breakfast ahead of the president's State of the Union address.

He even doubled down on that accusation, when pressed.

""He doesn't have the courage to take on the liberal side of his own party. I'm sorry but it's just clear as a bell to me,"" said Boehner.

Boehner repeatedly talked about the president's ""liberal"" agenda he laid out in his inaugural address, suggesting it is a signal that the president's focus for the next two years will not be reaching across the aisle, but helping Democrats retake control of the House.

""I think he'd love to have Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Harry Reid as majority leader for his last two years in office. Go back to the inaugural address. He knows that all of that liberal agenda he laid out, he knows none of that is going to happen as long as we have a majority in the House,"" said Boehner.

IMMIGRATION: ""How about a little foreplay?""

The speaker offered mostly pessimism about striking any kind of compromise, whether on tax reform or the debt and deficit issue that tends to force the White House and Congress into crisis mode every few months. But he did sound optimistic about ongoing bipartisan immigration reform talks in both chambers.

He said he is reluctant to dive into specifics about the divisive issue for fear of messing things up.

In fact, when asked about whether he would support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Boehner responded with straight forward and saltiness he is often known for.

""Woah, woah slow down. How about a little foreplay,"" said a smiling Boehner, prompting some surprised and nervous laughter from reporters, and some red faces among Boehner aides.

Just like on economic issues, Boehner questioned the president's seriousness about getting something done on immigration.

""These bipartisan efforts in the House and Senate are the best shot we have at dealing with a big problem the thing I'm most concerned about is the president getting in the way. Sometimes I think he'd rather have an issue than have a solution,"" said Boehner.

SEQUESTER

Though Speaker Boehner said he certainly doesn't want the sequester – nearly $100 billion in deep cuts across the government to kick in on March 1, he also dug in deeply on the way around it: spending cuts and not new revenue, as Democrats are demanding.

""The president has gotten his revenue,"" was a line Boehner used nearly half a dozen times when talking about the sequester.

He also repeatedly threw the ball in Democrats court to find a way out of what he called ""the president's sequester,"" arguing the House voted last year on a bill to replace the mandatory spending cuts, which were designed to go deep enough and cause enough pain for force Congress to act on broad deficit reduction.

When asked whether the cuts will kick in, Boehner responded ""nobody knows.""

Boehner: ""I've gotten burned""

Speaker Boehner reiterated his vow to no longer try to negotiate wide ranging deals with the president, and instead work through ""regular order"" – let each body works its will, find compromise, and then send a bill to the president.

""I've tried repeatedly to come to agreement with the president. Every time I've gotten burned,"" said Boehner.

Later, Boehner said ""I've tried over the last two years non stop working with the president, working with the president, never got there.""

Boehner's hold on his speakership

Though Boehner had a rough ride, especially at the end of 2012, he said ""I certainly plan to be here for a while.""

""I have a job to do and I intend on doing it. I have no plans to leave. Period."""
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/08/conservative-leaders-urge-rnc-rule-changes,2013-04-08 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],Exclusive: Conservative Leaders Urge Reversing RNC Rules Power-Grab,"Monday morning, more than 60 leaders of conservative and grass roots organizations sent a letter to RNC Chair Reince Priebus, urging him to consider Rules changes that would reverse a power-grab by the national party at the convention in Tampa. In August, the RNC adopted a number of rules changes that stripped state parties of their control of convention delegates, among other changes. The rules changes further centralized control over the nominating process for the Presidency. They would give DC greater control over picking the GOP nominee.

Many of the changes to the RNC rules adopted in Tampa may seem innocuous, but their effect would shorten the presidential primary and strengthen the position of any front-runner at the beginning of the contest. They would eliminate the proportional allocation of delegates in early primaries and limit the candidates whose names could be offered at the convention for the nomination. It would also allow stripping state-elected convention delegates of their voting rights.

The letter reads in part:

Conservatism and the Reagan coalition that created the modern Republican Party represents the fusion of economic conservatives, social conservatives, and national security conservatives. Rather than allowing political consultants and other elite minorities to shed our principles in the name of political expediency, we must reaffirm our commitment to these timeless American principles and the work that it will take to again make them relevant to a majority of our citizens.

The signers of the letter cover the breadth of the conservative and grass roots base of the party. They seek to reverse the recently adopted rules at the upcoming Spring meeting of the RNC, to ensure that all voices in the party have a role in selecting its Presidential candidate.

Engaging and winning a competitive primary does not drain a nominee of resources or energy, as many in DC contend. Rather, it makes the nominee stronger, having been forced to build a broad coalition from all wings of the party. A candidate who is successful at that is well on their way to building a winning general election coalition.

Pollak'],The Tea Party Comeback,"Thousands of Tea Party activists will gather Monday at rallies across the nation to mark Tax Day, April 15–and to re-ignite a movement that had been written off as dormant by the media and the political classes.

After propelling the Republican Party to the majority in the House of Representatives in 2010–and likely for the next decade thereafter–the Tea Party seemed to retreat. It failed in its political aim of defeating President Barack Obama in 2012, largely because of its earlier failure to find an alternative nominee to Gov. Mitt Romney. It was tarnished unfairly as racist, extremist, and–especially after the Tuscon shooting of Jan. 2011–violent, and was blamed even by some Republicans for the debt ceiling impasse in mid-2011.

Yet the Tea Party also succeeded in stopping the rapid growth of federal spending and taxation. The Tea Party ensured that there would be no bailouts for profligate states and no large-scale tax increases. Though it had to swallow the tax increases of the “fiscal cliff” deal in the early hours of 2013, it essentially preserved 98% of the Bush-era tax cuts. And by shifting the national debate in favor of deficit reduction, the Tea Party laid the foundation for the budget sequester–a set of across-the-board spending cuts that the American public has largely tolerated, even in the face of President Obama’s attempts to create panic and outrage.

The Tea Party ought to be fading into the background. The issues that the Obama administration has placed on the national agenda–immigration, gun control, and gay marriage–are thought to be ones where the Tea Party is weakest, far from the fiscal agenda that gave it early momentum and prominence. And yet the Tea Party has new momentum as an opposition force. Without articulating clear policy positions on any of these divisive issues, the Tea Party has rallied opposition nonetheless, holding the line in Congress and the states.

The key has been the Tea Party’s continued stress on the Constitution–not just the Second Amendment, but also the fundamental principle of the rule of law, and the federalist structure that Washington has done so much in recent decades to erode. These general principles are enough of a foundation for a political stand–and broad enough to admit wide differences of opinion on the substantive underlying issues themselves.

Recent months have proved challenging for conservatives, especially as politicians once backed by the Tea Party have begun reshaping themselves as moderates–Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) on immigration, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) on gun control, and several governors on Obamacare funding for state Medicaid expansion. Yet the Tea Party appears set for a revival–partly because of the failures of Republican national leadership, partly because of the emergence of new leaders, but largely because the country needs the opposition that it provides.

In a system there the two parties find themselves unable to undo the worst aspects of policies in which they have often colluded, and the mainstream media no longer bother to hold Washington in check, only the Tea Party seems to have the potential to provide the spark for the country’s urgent renaissance."

Peters'],Obama Pick for Court Is 3rd in a Row Blocked by Republicans,"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans on Monday blocked President Obama’s third consecutive nominee to the country’s most powerful and prestigious appeals court and insisted they would not back down, inflaming a bitter debate over a president’s right to shape the judiciary.

By a vote of 53 to 38, the Senate failed to break a filibuster of Robert L. Wilkins, a federal judge who was nominated to fill one of three vacancies on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, falling seven votes short of the 60 needed. Two Republicans — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine — voted with the Democrats.

The impasse over Mr. Wilkins followed Republican blockades of two other candidates for the court since Oct. 31. Unlike previous fights over judicial nominees, the dispute is not as much about the judges’ individual political leanings as it is about the overall ideological makeup of the court. Republicans have raised few objections to the three candidates’ qualifications or legal positions.

Rather, Republicans are seeking to prevent Mr. Obama from filling any of the three existing vacancies on the 11-seat court, fearing that he will alter its conservative tilt. The court has immense political importance because it often rules on questions involving White House and federal agency policy."

She had amassed a huge political war chest, and independent campaigns were willing to spend millions more. She won the backing of the some of L.A.'s most powerful labor unions, but also of the Chamber of Commerce. Big names from opposite ends of the political spectrum — former Republican Mayor Richard Riordan and former Democratic President Clinton — would ultimately endorse her. She spoke inspirationally of becoming the city’s first female mayor.

But six months after emerging as the leading candidate to succeed Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Greuel’s campaign was handed a decisive defeat by her former City Council friend, Eric Garcetti. The portrait that emerges from interviews with campaign aides and analysts begins with a candidate who underestimated the strength of her opponents in the primary election and the importance of maintaining her brand as a trusted public servant. The slippage accelerated when Greuel’s efforts to promote past accomplishments and future goals drew new rounds of scrutiny and criticism. And attempts to take down her opponents fell short, according to the interviews with campaign operatives and outside experts.

MAP: How L.A. voted

The city controller and former City Council member who wanted to be ahead of the pack and run a positive runoff campaign highlighting her historic bid to become the city’s first female mayor found herself trailing and fighting a rear-guard action as voters went to the polls in March. After she finished 4 points behind Garcetti, key staffers departed, the financial advantages of employee-union backing became liabilities and her carefully cultivated reputation as a straight-shooting watchdog of the public purse suffered.

Greuel did not respond to a request for comment. But in recent days, reviewing the race with her closest advisors, she took solace in the fact that she fought hard for a job she had long coveted. Greuel repeated a quotation she had etched on her mother’s gravestone: “Unless a person sets out to do more than he can possibly ever do, he will never do all that he can.”

As she ramped up her campaign last year, Greuel believed that, as controller, she had built the perfect platform to run for mayor in a city that seemed perpetually in financial crisis, aides said. She would hammer at the $160 million in “waste, fraud and abuse” that the controller’s office calculated she had uncovered during more than 80 audits. She suggested she could use such savings to help balance the budget.

FULL RESULTS: L.A. election 2013

But Greuel’s team failed to delve deeply into the numbers buttressing the central theme of her campaign. Aides were caught off guard by the intensity of reporters’ challenges. The media wanted to know how much the candidate could recover for the city treasury, and her answers were vague.

Changing focus, Greuel rolled out an ambitious and costly plan to add 2,000 officers to the Los Angeles Police Department. Polls show strong voter support for public safety improvements, but prominent political and civic leaders attacked the idea, noting the city already had slashed services, including 911 medical response teams, to reach a 10,000-officer force.

Greuel then backed away from the proposal, stressing that adding 2,000 more cops was an “aspiration.” But the damage from questionable audit savings and criticism of her proposed police buildup had been done, said a source inside the campaign who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of discussing internal matters. “It just exploded the trust that Wendy had built with the voters.”

GRAPHIC: Contributions by special interest

Greuel and Garcetti appeared to be gliding toward a two-candidate runoff election from the start. But John Shallman, Greuel’s chief strategist, acknowledged last week that campaign officials underestimated the punishment their candidate was in for during the primary.

“We didn’t perceive Jan Perry or Kevin James as serious candidates in any way, shape or form,” Shallman said, referring to the strength of the veteran African American councilwoman and Republican former radio host. “That was a mistake.”

James, an attorney, was under-financed but particularly effective at withering sound bytes that attracted media coverage. He spoke with authority to conservative San Fernando Valley voters, who Greuel — a self-described “Valley girl” — long assumed would be a crucial pool of support. “Suddenly he became real,” Shallman said. “The more real he became, the more of a challenge it became for us to hold on to and compete for our base.”

James took the lead in warning voters of Greuel’s connections to city unions, particularly the one representing many Department of Water and Power workers, who spent nearly $1.7 million on an independent campaign to get her elected. The message appeared to stick, according to USC Price/LA Times polling.

Perry, meanwhile, launched a series of blistering mailers attacking Greuel, including one that accused her of being a closet Republican. (She had actually switched to the Democratic Party two decades ago.) Perry’s attacks appeared to be “almost a political suicide bombing,” Shallman said, more designed to take down Greuel than promote Perry’s candidacy. When Greuel retaliated with a mailer of her own — hitting Perry for a personal bankruptcy filing years earlier — women and African Americans accused Greuel of stooping to a lowly personal attack.

A string of nearly 50 debates before the March 5 primary also played away from Greuel’s strengths. She was charming and relaxed with small groups of voters, but she visibly stiffened going on stage for debates.

Garcetti was more polished, glib and less of a target than Greuel for the other primary election contenders, who saw more opportunity to siphon votes away from her.

Campaign aides began turning down debate invitations. But Greuel, determined to compete, would call back organizers and promise to participate.

A number of Greuel’s efforts to attack Garcetti failed to stick or blew up on her. She criticized him for taking taxpayer-funded trips, when she too had been on such trips. She attacked the number of city cars his office had, when as a council member her staff had the same number of vehicles.

To both insiders and political observers, the lack of precision had the hallmark of a low-profile race, such as an Assembly campaign, where press scrutiny is far less intense.

As the unexpected challenges of the primary election grew, trouble was brewing inside Greuel’s campaign. The bulk of her field team, responsible for identifying supportive voters and getting them to the polls, quit shortly after the March vote. Shifting to a new team left Greuel’s get-out-the-vote operation in catch-up mode.

Meanwhile, Shallman was clashing with Rose Kapolczynski, a veteran of Sen. Barbara Boxer’s campaigns, who had been hired early on to run day-to-day operations. Inside team Greuel, some saw Shallman as too aggressive. Others viewed Kapolczynski as too cautious. Kapolczynski decided she could no longer be part of the effort before the March primary, though she held off on leaving until after the March voting.

Raising the cash needed for a come-from-behind victory in the runoff became a major new obstacle after a USC Price/LA Times poll showed Greuel trailing Garcetti by 10 points.

The Greuel campaign took a gamble on a game-changing play that might close the gap, aides say. Greuel launched an early barrage of advertising, spending $1.7 million over two weeks in an effort to pull even. The airwaves were flooded with ads showing Magic Johnson, Riordan and Boxer singing Greuel’s praises. The move drained her coffers, but Greuel drew even with Garcetti in public and private polls.

But the flow of money did not return. In part, aides acknowledge, business donors were concerned by Greuel’s image as the candidate of city employee unions — and particularly the relatively high-paid workers at the city’s utility.

That left the Greuel campaign heavily dependent on the independent groups and “super PAC” committees that were backing her bid — and causing her problems in the polls and airing a muddy mishmash of ads on television.

Going into election day, Greuel staffers were nervous. Their early ad blitz hit just as voting by mail began. Greuel insiders figured they needed a five-point edge in the first big wave of mail-in ballots counted election night.

When the first tally appeared on a jumbo screen at Greuel’s election night party at a downtown nightclub, she was up by 2 points. Some guests cheered. But her campaign staff sensed where the night would end.

Garcetti gained ground with each new count, eventually winning by 8 points.

Greuel turned 52 two days after the election. She headed to Palm Desert, where she has spent every Memorial Day weekend since her teens with family and friends. She’d cut short her stay in recent years as she pursued her dream of being mayor. A friend said Greuel plans to enjoy the entire gathering this year.

“She can do the whole thing,” the friend said, “and she is having fun.”

Of course, this size disparity is an even bigger problem in the Senate, though Freeman's radical plan would remedy both—by redrawing the 50 states to make them all equipopulous.

You'll definitely want to click through to Freeman's site to see his impressive full-size map (and there's an even more detailed version that you can buy in poster form). Freeman also explains how he came up with these states:

The map began with an algorithm that grouped counties based on proximity, urban area, and commuting patterns. The algorithm was seeded with the fifty largest cities. After that, manual changes took into account compact shapes, equal populations, metro areas divided by state lines, and drainage basins. In certain areas, divisions are based on census tract lines.

As an added bonus, House districts (which also currently vary widely in size) would have equal populations, too.

Of course, a map this extreme would never come anywhere close to implementation; as Freeman himself says, this is an art project, not a serious proposal. But it's some very useful food for thought, in that it highlights just how unfair our existing state lines are. Indeed, the fact that few of Freeman's creatively named states even resemble any of today's shows just how out-of-whack our systems of governance are when it comes to respecting the true ideal of ""one person, one vote.""

But we aren't without hope: One genuine (if partial) remedy is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which would replace the electoral college with a true national vote, without the need for a constitutional amendment.

For now, though, we can have a little fun, so tell us which new state you live in. I'm still in the only one that doesn't get a name change: New York. How about you?"

Story highlights The pundits and comedians of Twitter weigh in on Monday's Inauguration Day events People commented on first-family fashion, TV anchor gaffes, president's speech NASA tweeted a link to a photo of the National Mall taken from space

Maybe it didn’t have quite the grandeur of President Barack Obama’s historic inauguration four years ago. But Monday’s Inauguration Day events showcased the pomp and circumstance of the U.S. government at its finest.

We may not have royal weddings in the States, but this is about as close as it gets.

And, where there is public spectacle, there is Twitter, the rapid-fire platform where the world’s online social critics record their musings. Twitter said its users sent 1.1 million inauguration-related tweets during Monday’s swearing-in ceremony, way up from 82,000 in 2009, when Twitter hadn’t yet been widely adopted.

From politicos to comedians to ordinary citizens, some offered heartfelt thoughts on the historical importance of the day, while others jockeyed for a cheap laugh and a few retweets.

Here are some of our favorites. (We’ll be adding to this list as the day goes on.)

Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. A golf game with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. A chance to mingle over breakfast with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Those are just a few of the offerings available to the powerful who donated to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney at a three-day gathering that the former Massachusetts governor is hosting next week in Park City, Utah.

Advertisement

Donors and former aides say Romney is not looking to take sides, or play kingmaker, for the potential Republican presidential candidates, but rather to connect all of the contenders with the expansive network of donors that propelled him to the Republican nomination, while letting his donors evaluate who – if anyone – they will back in the next round.

(For good measure, they can also get their fill of Democrats, among them a potential Democratic contender in 2016, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, outgoing Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and President Obama’s longtime strategist, David Axelrod.)

Next week’s gathering in Park City, a favorite spot of the family after Romney oversaw the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, comes as the Romneys are once again reentering the public eye. Romney told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Thursday that he wanted to bring together the members of his 2012 finance team for the “Experts & Enthusiasts” gathering to “update our thinking about where the world is headed and what the national agenda ought to be.”

The conference is being sponsored by Solamere Capital, the investment firm co-founded by his Romney’s son Tagg and his campaign finance chairman, Spencer Zwick.

Romney, who has rejoined Boston-based Solamere as the chairman of its executive committee, has emphasized that he does not intend to run for office again or try to be the standard bearer for the Republican Party — quipping to Fox News during his first post-campaign interview that “as the guy who lost the election, I’m not in a position to tell everybody else how to win.”

At the same time, he has not shied away from expressing disappointment in the current administration. During that March interview with Chris Wallace, Romney referred to President Obama as “Nero""—the Roman emperor who, as the expression goes, “fiddled” while Rome burned.

Advertisement

In his new interview with the Wall Street Journal’s Neil King Jr., Romney said he was disappointed by “the lack of any clear White House agenda” during the first 100 days of Obama’s second term.

His wife, Ann Romney, who was sometimes more blunt than her husband during the 2012 campaign, told CBS News in her first solo interview this week that the recent scandals in Washington had breached the trust between Americans and their government.

Advertisement

“We have to believe they are doing right for us,” she said on “CBS This Morning.” “Where do we turn to know what’s really true?”

Though some of Romney’s aides say he is unlikely to take sides in the 2016 Republican primary, the Romneys clearly feel a strong connection with Ryan, who got to know many of the Romney financiers as he helped raise money for the campaign last fall as the vice presidential nominee. Some of Romney’s supporters also remain convinced that Christie’s decision to appear with Obama and praise his performance after Superstorm Sandy hurt Romney at the polls in November.

Advertisement

Ann Romney told CBS that there were no hard feelings toward Christie -- “It’s all good” -- and called him a “great guy,” but she also indicated warm feelings toward the Wisconsin congressman.

“Mitt and I are partial to Paul Ryan, but we don’t even know if he’s going to run,” she said.

Some Romney donors will get a chance to take Ryan’s measure in this new phase — and assess his shooting skills — next week, so long as they’re not busy with Paul, Christie or Hickenlooper at the other “enthusiast” events.

""I'm not going to worry about how Chris was doing what he thought was best for the people of his state,"" Romney said. ""I lost my election because of my campaign, not because of what anyone else did.""

Romney, meanwhile, called his ""47 percent"" comment, in which he said at a private fundraiser that nearly half the country was reliant on government services and thus wouldn't vote for him, ""very harmful.""

""What I said is not what I believe,"" he said. ""Obviously, my whole campaign -- my whole life has been devoted to helping people, all of the people. I care about all the people of the country. But that hurt. There's no question that hurt and did real damage to my campaign.""

Romney and his wife, Ann, both said that they nonetheless thought they were going to win on Election Day.

“We were convinced that we would win,"" he said. ""We saw that the polls were close. But we knew that the energy and passion was with out voters, and my heart said we were going to win.”

Romney said his opinion changed when exit polls in Florida showed a close race -- his campaign expected to win there easily -- and that he knew he had lost by 8 or 9 o'clock that evening.

Ann Romney confirmed reports that she cried when they realized they had lost: ""I did, of course. Yeah. Very disappointed.”

She said she's not completely over the loss, but that she's ""mostly"" over it. But it was also clear that she harbors hard feelings over the campaign. When host Chris Wallace asked whether President Obama ran a fair campaign, she didn't hesitate.

""No,"" she said. ""Portrayal of my husband... He is an exceptional, wonderful person.”

She added: “I’m like a she-lion when it comes to defending Mitt. … And I mourn the fact that he’s not (president).”

Romney said it ""kills"" him to not be president -- especially given the failure by Obama to reach a deal on the sequester.

""It kills me not to be there, not to be in the White House doing what needs to be done,"" he said. ""The president is the leader of the nation. The president brings people together, does the deals, does the trades, knocks the heads together; the president leads. And I don't see that kind of leadership happening right now."""

Washington (CNN) - John Kerry was overwhelmingly confirmed Tuesday as the 68th secretary of state by his colleagues in the U.S. Senate.

The vote was 94-3, with Republican Senators John Cornyn, Ted Cruz and James Inhofe voting no. Kerry voted present on his own nomination.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Earlier in the day he received the nod of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The panel approved his nomination unanimously by a voice vote.

Kerry submitted his resignation letter to Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, saying he resigns his seat effective Friday at 4 p.m.

Kerry, the longtime senator from Massachusetts and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, has served on the committee for decades and was the panel's chairman the past four years.

President Barack Obama last month nominated Kerry to succeed outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as the country's top diplomat.

In a statement, he said, ""I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed John Kerry as our next secretary of state with overwhelming bipartisan support. From his decorated service in Vietnam to his decades in the Senate as a champion of American global leadership, John's distinguished career has prepared him to guide American diplomacy in the years ahead.

""John has earned the respect of leaders around the world and the confidence of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, and I am confident he will make an extraordinary secretary of state,"" Obama continued. ""I look forward to his counsel and partnership in the years ahead as we ensure American leadership in the world and advance the interests and values that keep our nation strong.""

Patrick, who will appoint a temporary successor to the seat, said in a statement that he thanks ""Senator Kerry for his decades of service to the people of Massachusetts.

""From his days as lieutenant governor to his nearly thirty years in the United States Senate, he has been our steadfast champion,"" Patrick said. ""I know that he will bring the dedication, intelligence, and passion to his new role that he brought to representing Massachusetts. We are sad to lose him as our senator, but excited about and grateful for his service to the nation on the international stage.""

Democrat Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts freshman who becomes the state's senior senator with his resignation, said, ""John Kerry is a true statesman, and he will be an extraordinary Secretary of State. His experience as a Navy lieutenant, veteran, prosecutor, Lieutenant Governor, Senator, and Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee uniquely qualifies him to represent the people of the United States around the world. I was proud to cast my vote – and I am excited to call him Mr. Secretary.""

Democratic Rep. Ed Markey, the only declared candidate so far for Kerry's seat, praised him, saying: ""Americans can be confident that John Kerry is the most qualified, knowledgeable, and passionate person to represent our interests around the world. Going from Hillary Clinton to John Kerry at the State Department is like the Red Sox going from Ted Williams to Carl Yastrzemski, both possessing hall of fame talent and passion for the job.

Kerry has served in the U.S. Senate since 1984.

Kerry's confirmation makes him the first new member of Obama's second-term cabinet to be installed. Obama has also nominated candidates to lead the departments of defense and treasury.

""We need to be in the event business. I think you're going to hear that from every broadcast network,"" said Bob Greenblatt, NBC Entertainment chairman.

Though Clinton hasn't announced her intention to seek the Democratic nomination for president, Greenblatt spoke as if her candidacy is expected.

""Hillary"" could air before Clinton announces her decision, but the timing has yet to be determined, he said.

The four-hour miniseries ""Hillary,"" starring Diane Lane as the former first lady and secretary of state, is one such bid for distinctive programming, Greenblatt said.

The goal is to woo viewers who are increasingly drawn away by cable TV's eye-catching, critically acclaimed fare like ""Mad Men"" and ""Breaking Bad"" and other media choices.

Broadcasting's audience is shrinking by 4 percent to 7 percent annually, Greenblatt told a meeting of the Television Critics Association.

""Anything that can shake up the landscape and say, `we have something special""' would be considered part of the varied group of event projects, he said.

At NBC, that ranges from the new fall game show ""Million Second Quiz"" to big-ticket scripted fare including ""Hillary"" and other projects announced Saturday: ""Rosemary's Baby"" a four-hour version of the Ira Levin novel that was adapted as a 1968 movie; an adaptation of ""Stephen King's Tommyknockers,"" and ""Plymouth,"" about the Pilgrim's journey and settlement in America.

A six-hour miniseries about Cleopatra is in development, Greenblatt said.

He didn't address how a Clinton miniseries, which will track her life and career from 1998 to the present, might affect the presidential contest.

The part of former President Bill Clinton has yet to be cast. Lane's credits include the feature films ""Unfaithful"" and ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" and the TV movie ""Cinema Verite.""

Other networks seeking to stem audience erosion are jumping on the event bandwagon, especially in light of the success of another King adaptation, CBS' summer series ""Under the Dome."" Announced plans include a Fox's remake of the ""Shogun"" miniseries based on James Clavell's novel.

Greenblatt argued that NBC, which finished the last September-to-May season in fourth place in total viewers, is in better shape when the entire year is taken into account, especially among advertiser-favored young adult viewers.

He credited the popular talent contests ""The Voice"" and ""America's Got Talent,"" as well as dramas ""Grimm"" and ""Hannibal.""

NBC has high hopes for the fall sitcom that brings Michael J. Fox back to TV but is prepared for a big tune-in for the debut episode that might not be sustainable, Greenblatt said."

Born In San Francisco', 'He S A Graduate Of Stanford University.']",McManus: President Obama 3.0,"We got a good long look at the second-term edition of Barack Obama last week, and he’s sounding more like Bill Clinton every day.

It’s not all that surprising. Over the last two years, Obama has turned repeatedly to Clinton for counsel. And Obama was a target of Clinton’s advice even before he asked for it. In a 2011 book and a series of public appearances, the former president laid out a polite but biting critique of Obama’s first-term stumbles.

Warning No. 1, coming from the man who proclaimed (in his 1996 State of the Union message) that “the era of big government is over,” was that Obama shouldn’t fall into the trap of defending big government.

TRANSCRIPT: 2013 State of the Union

Sure enough, in Obama’s State of the Union speech last week, we heard this: “It’s not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government.”

Obama’s rhetoric still aims high; he hasn’t given up all hope of transforming American politics. But his concrete proposals these days are smaller and more Clintonian, a necessary adjustment in the face of entrenched Republican opposition.

In his State of the Union address, Obama promised to revive manufacturing jobs, but the major details turned out to be modest: long-proposed tax changes to make “offshoring” more expensive and $1 billion to create “innovation institutes.”

He vowed to repair crumbling infrastructure but suggested that, with little money available, he’d settle for fixing the country’s most dangerous bridges.

He called for universal preschool education, but the programs he offered turned out to be not quite universal and mostly aimed at spurring states to act.

In a sense, we’re seeing the third version of the Obama presidency.

Obama 1.0 was the ambitious Obama of 2009, swept into office in a landslide amid economic crisis. That expansive Obama tackled everything at once — a giant economic stimulus program, a healthcare law and financial reform — and intended to pass immigration reform and climate-change legislation too.

But that agenda turned out to be too ambitious, even with both houses of Congress in Democratic hands. When the economy didn’t spring back to life in the ill-named “Recovery Summer” of 2010, voters revolted and delivered the House of Representatives to the tea party Republicans.

Obama 2.0 tried to draw lessons from those setbacks. If voters were worried about the deficit, he’d work on the deficit. He spent much of 2011 trying to negotiate a “grand bargain” over spending and taxes with House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), but they couldn’t find middle ground. Many Republicans didn’t want a compromise; they simply wanted to turn Obama out of office.

So, by the end of 2011, we began to see Obama 3.0: a more confrontational president bent on reestablishing a popular mandate for his core policies, beginning with tax hikes on the wealthy. That Obama, the Obama of last year’s election campaign, turned out to be pretty skilled at his job, winning convincingly in November.

Now, as the second term gets under way, Obama is still traveling around the country campaigning for modest new government programs and against Republican obstruction. Last week, he went to North Carolina to talk about manufacturing, to Georgia to talk about preschool education and to Illinois to talk about gun control and the minimum wage.

Does the president really expect to win a $9 minimum wage, universal preschool education and a ban on assault weapons despite the GOP-held House? No.

But those are proposals that please not only confirmed Democrats but many swing voters as well. Provoking Republicans into opposing them helps Obama cast the GOP as a party of cranky conservatives — another tactic at which Clinton excelled.

There’s an irony, of course, in the echoes of Bill Clinton that turn up in Obama’s strategy today. In the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, Obama not only ran against Hillary Rodham Clinton; he dismissed her husband’s tenure in the White House as unimpressive.

“Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America … in a way that Bill Clinton did not,” Obama said then. Reagan “put us on a fundamentally different path, because the country was ready for it,” Obama said, a circumstance he clearly thought was also the case in 2008.

But Obama 3.0 is a more practical man. He no longer talks brashly about transforming American politics, even though his 2012 campaign may turn out to have done so.

Bill Clinton’s second term wasn’t an unqualified success; he spent much of his tenure battling personal scandals and impeachment. (Somehow, Obama appears unlikely to follow that pattern.) But Clinton left office with a solid list of accomplishments, high popularity and a healthy economy. That kind of legacy is another thing Obama would like to emulate.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/30/virginia-governors-race-remains-tight-closely-watched-as-window-into-midterm/,2013-10-30 00:00:00,[],"Virginia governors' race remains tight, closely watched as window into midterm, 2016 contests","Virginia voters are going to the polls Tuesday to elect a new governor in a race that has readily fulfilled its billing as the marquee 2013 contest -- smashing fundraising records and providing a window into next year's congressional races and beyond.

The top candidates -- a quintessential Democratic insider and a Tea Party-backed Republican -- have engaged in an old-school political brawl that has include go-rounds on such issues as ObamaCare, gun control and women’s rights, while attracted more than $43 million in campaign donations.

Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe leads GOP nominee Ken Cuccinelli by roughly nine percentage points in the once-reliable Republican state that voted for President Obama in 2012 and 2008 -- marking the first time since 1964 that a Democratic presidential nominee had won the state.

Virginia's evolving status as a swing state is largely the result of the changing demographics of Northern Virginia, across the Potomac River from the nation’s capital and home to a gowning number of immigrants and liberals who largely vote Democrat.

Political analysts and strategists are closely watching the race in hopes of gleaning insight about next year’s midterms and the 2016 White House Race.

“Nationally, the implications will be obvious,” says Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “If Republicans continue to nominate hard-right candidates, they will probably continue to lose a state once thought to be part of their Electoral College base.”

He also argues that a McAuliffe win “guarantees"" close friend Hillary Clinton “a Southern base of operations” should she run for president in three years.

In the race's closing weeks, McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairman and prolific Clinton fundraiser, brought in the former first lady and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to help close a contest in which he has held a small lead since mid-summer.

Meanwhile, Cuccinelli, the state’s attorney general, has brought in his own heavy hitters, including Tea Party-favorite Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, and has gotten major financial support from such powerful and deep-pocketed groups as the National Rifle Association and the Republican Governors Association, which has given $4 million.

Not everybody agrees that the race results will be a bellwether.

David Heller, a Democratic campaign strategist and president of Main Street Communications, thinks the race is too awash in money and political stardom to serve as a model for upcoming ones. And he doesn’t think the takeaway for Republicans, should Cuccinelli lose, will be that strong conservative candidates are unelectable.

“Show me a Tea Party guy worried about losing a primary,” he said. “Over and over again, we’ve seen Tea Party candidates who challenge the establishment and either win or come really close. I don’t think Republicans will say Cuccinelli losing means we have to have a more moderate candidate next time.”

The wild card in the race is Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis, who has attracted voters dissatisfied with both candidates. Though Sarvis has attracted just 9 or 10 percent of the vote, political analysts think he will cut into Cuccinelli’s totals by 2 or 3 percentage points.

Whoever wins the race has already eclipses previous fundraising for a Virginia gubernatorial race – with Cuccinelli having raised $16.8 million to McAuliffe’s $26.3 million, according to a report late last week from the Virginia Public Access Project.

The nonprofit group also reports that roughly 70 percent of that money has come from outside the state, marking the first time in which Virginia gubernatorial candidates have raise more than half of their money outside the state.

McAuliffe has gotten money from some of the country’s most wealthy liberals including Hollywood moguls Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who each gave $5,000, and President Clinton who gave $100,000.

Moreover, the 56-year-old businessman has also gotten major support from Planned Parenthood, which has helped him with women voters, including those who believe Cuccinelli is anti-abortion.

His campaign platform has been based in large part of such progressive ideals as the environment and gun control. However, Democrats have also tried to connect Cuccinelli to the recent federal government shutdown, his views on global warming and a donor scandal involving Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, despite an ethic probe clearing Cuccinelli.

Meanwhile, Republicans have tried to tie McAuliffe’s interest in a struggling, electric-car company to a federal investigation purportedly about visas for investors and his Clinton-era fundraising scheme to rent out the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House."

Before Becoming An Editor', 'She Was A Reporter Covering U.S. Economic Policy', 'With A Focus On Efforts To Tame The National Debt.']",Senate passes bipartisan budget agreement,"Congress declared a holiday truce in the budget wars Wednesday, sending President Obama a blueprint for funding the government through 2015. But the next skirmish was already on the horizon: an election-year fight over the national debt.

The budget deal that passed the Senate on Wednesday amounts to a handshake agreement to avoid a government shutdown when a temporary funding measure expires Jan. 15. However, the accord does not address the need once again to raise the debt limit, setting up a potentially complicated confrontation in late February or early March.

That fight would come just months before midterm congressional elections, and the GOP is deeply divided over tactics to deal with the debt, a core issue for the Republican base. Some conservatives are calling for another showdown, insisting on an additional round of spending cuts in exchange for granting the Treasury Department more borrowing authority to pay the nation’s bills.

But GOP leaders, especially in the House, have no appetite for another Washington fiscal crisis that could destroy their popularity among voters, aides said. Instead, they are hoping for a more peaceful resolution modeled on the latest budget deal — a bipartisan compromise that solves small problems and aims to offend almost no one.

“Republicans kind of look at this election as probably the best opportunity we’ve ever had at taking control” of the Senate, said Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.). As a political message, threatening to default on the debt “hasn’t really worked all that successfully in the past,” he said.

As they rushed to finish work and leave town for a three-week Christmas break, senators were more inclined to bask in the glow of the budget deal than to plot strategy for the debt limit. The agreement draws to a close nearly three years of fighting over agency budgets — battles that repeatedly risked shutting down the government and actually did close parks, museums and federal offices for 16 days in October.

Congressional leaders appointed Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to negotiate a cease-fire. The resulting agreement would roll back sharp spending cuts known as the sequester over the next two years, sparing the Pentagon from more reductions and restoring billions of dollars for domestic programs.

The $62 billion cost would be more than covered by $85 billion in alternative policies, such as higher security fees for airline passengers, deeper cuts for Medicare providers and less generous retirement benefits for federal workers, including military retirees younger than 62.

The deal makes no effort to solve the nation’s biggest budget problem: a social safety net strained by an aging population. But it also would not raise taxes or reduce Medicare benefits, leaving each party’s core ideological commitments intact.

Last week, the deal sailed through the House and, on Wednesday, it easily passed the Senate, 64 to 36. Nine Republicans joined all 55 members of the Senate Democratic caucus in voting yes. Murray stood in the well of the chamber as the vote unfolded, accepting pats on the back from colleagues in both parties.

“The American people are sick and tired of the constant crises we’ve seen here in D.C. over the past few years,” Murray said on the Senate floor. “I am hopeful this deal can be a foundation for continued bipartisan work, because we have so many big challenges we need to tackle for the families and communities we represent.”

Afterward, senators voted overwhelmingly to end debate on a defense bill that sets Pentagon policy and military pay levels. A final vote to approve the National Defense Authorization Act was scheduled for Thursday, with hopes rising that the chamber also would approve several pending nominations and head home Friday.

Meanwhile, leaders of the congressional spending committees immediately began working on 2014 appropriations — the first in two years — to distribute about $45 billion in extra cash to federal agencies.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) was optimistic that she and her House counterpart, Harold Rogers (R-Ky.), could work through some minor disagreements and deliver an omnibus spending bill to Obama's desk by Jan. 15.

“I’m like a Raven: It’s the fourth quarter. There are seconds to go on the clock. And I’m ready to kick a 61-yard field goal,” said an exultant Mikulski, referring to Baltimore’s come-from-behind victory over the Detroit Lions on Monday Night Football.

Once that deadline is cleared, attention will turn to the national debt, which stands at $17.2 trillion. Enforcement of the debt limit has been suspended until Feb. 7, when Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said he will have about a month before he starts running short of cash to pay the nation’s bills.

On Wednesday, White House press secretary Jay Carney said the president will not negotiate over the debt limit, sticking to the stance he adopted earlier this year. Although Republicans won $2.1 trillion in spending cuts — including the sequester — in exchange for raising the debt limit in 2011, they suspended enforcement of the debt limit twice this year without significant concessions.

“The president’s position is unchanged. He will not negotiate over Congress’s responsibility to pay the bills that Congress has racked up,” Carney told reporters, adding that administration officials do not expect Republicans “to travel down this road again.”

Republicans have devoted little thought to the debt limit, said senior aides and lawmakers. “There hasn’t been any discussion of it in any of the caucuses or committees that I’ve been on. And I don’t think it’s very clear what might happen,” said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who served with Ryan and Murray on the special panel tasked with forging the budget deal.

This weekend, Ryan said that the GOP will demand something in exchange for raising the debt limit, but that party leaders had not decided what.

“We don’t want ‘nothing’ out of this debt limit,” Ryan said on “Fox News Sunday.” “So we’re going to meet in our retreats after the holidays and discuss exactly what it is we’re going to try and get for this.”

This week, Senate Republican leaders echoed that view. “The plan is no clean debt ceiling,” said Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. “We’re going to fight for some control on spending, and I predict we’ll get it.”

But even some conservatives were skeptical that party leaders would risk another economy-rattling standoff that could alienate voters so close to a critical election — especially after they proved willing to weaken the sequester to avert another shutdown.

“I think they’ll raise the debt ceiling and they’ll punt and try to win the election [by running against] Obamacare. But they’re not going to do anything useful to head off the bankruptcy of the country,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said of GOP leaders.

“The consensus is we gave up on budgetary restraint with this budget deal. And it doesn’t leave me any hope that all of a sudden . . . we’re going to have a spine on the debt ceiling.”

Tonight’s forecast calls for an aggressive Lhota.

With two weeks until Election Day, Joseph J. Lhota, the Republican, lags far behind his Democratic rival, Bill de Blasio.

The mayoral debate tonight, the second of three, will be one of Mr. Lhota’s last chances to reach a big audience and narrow the gap.

We asked Michael Paulson, the Metro political editor for The New York Times, what to expect from Mr. Lhota.

“A sharper edge,” Mr. Paulson predicted. “Gloves off.”

Look for Mr. Lhota to hit hard on crime, charter schools and what he deems Mr. de Blasio’s lack of experience.

Mr. Lhota is hoping to recover from his performance in last week’s debate, when he seemed blindsided by Mr. de Blasio’s sharp attacks.

For his part, Mr. de Blasio will probably just keep using the R-word.

“He seems to think the Republican brand is so damaged here in New York City that repeating that over and over is enough to prevent Lhota from picking up support,” Mr. Paulson said.

The debate, at the CUNY Graduate Center, will be on WCBS-TV, 1010-WINS and CBS-880 radio, from 7 to 8 p.m.

Here’s what else you need to know for Tuesday.

“It got struck by lightning, it was diseased, Sandy didn’t help,” she said.

Ms. Brantley, 33, left small white paper flags and a composition book in a clear bag beside the beech stump on Oct. 10.

Since then, people have posted nearly 50 of her flags on the tree’s roots. (See photo.)

“I miss this tree,” reads the inscription on them.

The composition book has filled with tributes.

“It had skin like an elephant and was wise,” one says.

Someone placed a chunky wooden sculpture on the stump.

It says, “I tried.”

The shrine is still there. You can stop by and pay your respects.

These children and grandchildren of prominent politicians went on to launch their own political careers.

These children and grandchildren of prominent politicians went on to launch their own political careers.

The two major parties here don’t agree on many things. One of them is that it is only a matter of time before Georgia goes from being a Republican stronghold to a state that is up for grabs.

In next year’s elections, Democrats will be looking to speed that process along with a couple of candidates who bring fresh faces and familiar names.

They are Senate contender Michelle Nunn, an executive who is also the daughter of former senator Sam Nunn, and gubernatorial hopeful Jason Carter, a third-term state senator who is a grandson of former president Jimmy Carter.

Nunn and Carter face tough odds, given that Georgia has not elected a non-incumbent Democrat to any statewide office since the waning years of the last century. But recent demographic shifts suggest a new electoral equation could be forming — and probably more quickly than in much-talked-about Texas.

The face of the state is being changed by an influx of African Americans and Latinos. Although whites accounted for 71 percent of Georgians who voted in the 2004 elections, that share had dropped by nearly 10 percentage points in 2012.

Last year, President Obama’s reelection campaign pretty much ignored Georgia, but he still got more than 45 percent of the vote. Of the states that Obama lost to Republican Mitt Romney, Georgia had the second-narrowest margin, behind battleground North Carolina.

Democrats say all they need now is more money, better organization and the right names on the ballot — the last of which they believe they have found in Nunn and Carter, who present themselves as affable consensus-builders willing to reach across party lines.

“Everybody said it could happen by 2018, but because of these two candidates and the excitement they bring, we’re going to do it in 2014,” said DuBose Porter, who took over in August as chairman of the troubled and underfunded Georgia Democratic Party.

Republicans see the same tectonic shifts at work, though they say the timeline is longer.

“In five or six or seven years, this will be a swing state, a real battleground. It will probably be the next Virginia or North Carolina,” GOP strategist Paul Bennecke said. “Our party, for longevity purposes, has to figure out a way to reach out.”

At a minimum, the prospect of Nunn and Carter on the ticket — both are expected to win nomination easily — has given Georgia Democrats a jolt of energy, enthusiasm and fundraising potential they have lacked in recent years. The state party raised $150,000 at a Nov. 20 luncheon in downtown Atlanta, at which Nunn and Carter were featured speakers.

Nunn collected an attention-getting $1.7 million in the first 10 weeks after announcing her candidacy in July. The money came from more than 6,700 individual donors, including some prominent contributors who normally give to Republicans.

Last month, former senator John W. Warner (R-Va.) attended a fundraiser for Nunn; his political action committee contributed $500 to her campaign.

Georgia is one of only two states where, at this point, Democrats have even plausible hopes of taking a Senate seat from Republicans in 2014. The other place where they are playing offense is Kentucky, against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

A centrist approach

Thus far, Nunn has taken a cautious, centrist approach. She says, for example, that she supports the Affordable Care Act but that she also agrees with Georgia’s junior Republican senator, Johnny Isakson, that penalties against individuals who fail to buy insurance should be delayed until the law is working smoothly.

“People are ready for some new leadership and new perspectives and qualities of leadership that are in short supply in Washington,” Nunn said in an interview. “That includes somebody who is a problem-solver and who brings civility and a spirit of collaboration and who is focused on getting things done. Georgia’s state motto is ‘wisdom, justice, moderation.’ ”

Of course, dynastic appeals such as Nunn and Carter represent, are nothing new in politics. The current U.S. Senate roster, for example, includes such political brand names as Begich, Casey, Landrieu, Murkowski, Paul, Pryor, Rockefeller and Udall (twice).

A famous political name means that “there will be some people who will be closed to us, and there will be a great number of people who will give us a second look because of it,” Carter said in an interview. “But at the end of the day, all you get is a second look.”

Although Nunn’s father is fondly remembered as a brainy and independent-minded senator, his name has not been on the ballot in Georgia since 1990. Michelle Nunn is running as a sort of anti-politician with a story of her own to tell as a founder and now the head of the nation’s largest organization devoted to volunteer service.

Among Georgia voters, however, she is still largely unknown.

Carl Fambro, 57, a Macon restaurant owner, recalls voting for Sam Nunn because the senator was a strong supporter of the military. “I didn’t know his daughter was interested in politics. I didn’t even know he had a daughter,” Fambro said.

Fambro and about a half-dozen other local busi­ness­peo­ple met with Michelle Nunn on Thursday morning around a table at his Francar’s Buffalo Wings restaurant. It was a low-key event, and Nunn mostly listened, jotting down their concerns and observations — about taxes, health care, burdensome regulations, difficulties obtaining loans — in a three-ring notebook.

Nunn didn’t even mention her Senate race until the session was almost over.

“I kind of like her. She seems energetic, friendly, really interested in what we had to say,” Fambro said afterward. “I’m sold.”

At least as important as anything Nunn brings to the race, she also stands to benefit from the disarray on the other side of the ballot. There are currently more than a half-dozen Republicans vying to replace retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a situation that promises a bruising, expensive primary and almost certainly a runoff.

Establishment Republicans worry that Nunn could have an opening, should the party nominate one of the more-far-right contenders, such as Rep. Paul Broun, who has described evolution, embryology and the big-bang theory as “lies straight from the pit of Hell.”

“If she could get to run against him, he could be the Todd Akin of 2014,” said University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock, referring to the Missouri 2012 Senate nominee, who lost what Republicans considered a likely pickup seat after he suggested that women could not get pregnant from “legitimate rape.”

Speaking of which, another GOP Senate contender in Georgia — Rep. Phil Gingrey, an obstetrician-gynecologist— revived that controversy this year when he said Akin had been “partly right” about rape.

A steeper climb

Jason Carter’s route to victory is even steeper than Nunn’s, given that he is challenging an incumbent, Gov. Nathan Deal. Carter announced that he is running on Nov. 7. An early test of his viability will be the fundraising numbers he produces at the end of December.

The state senator, 38, portrays himself as pragmatic, even on the ideologically fraught question of whether the state should accept federal funds to expand its Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act.

“The current governor has decided to import all that Washington politics into our health-care system,” Carter said in an interview. “Our federal tax dollars are going to expand and improve health care in New Jersey and Florida and other places with Republican governors, and Georgia is not getting those benefits. And that’s because the governor is just consumed by the Washington politics of Obamacare.”

Given his grandfather’ continued activism, Carter acknowledges that the former president’s name is likely to have little crossover appeal to staunch Republicans.

Just last month, the state senator emphasized his differences with his grandfather when Jimmy Carter called for an end to capital punishment. The younger Carter said he supports the death penalty in cases of “heinous crimes, and that won’t change when I’m governor.”

Jason Carter also noted that he has an A-rating from the National Rifle Association, an organization that the former president has criticized.

“Some super-partisan people will never vote for me, because I’m Jimmy Carter’s grandson, and that will be a barrier,” Carter said. “The vast majority of people think of him as I do, as a good person who has lived his life based on his faith.”

But Carter also insisted that the time is right, for himself and Nunn.

“This was the state that is sort of next in line as a national battleground, so we’ve got that to build on from a Democratic base standpoint,” he said. “It is a path that is going to require both me and Michelle to do what we’ve done in our lives, to reach out to independents and Republicans of all kinds and demonstrate that we can provide the kind of leadership the state needs.”"

His slogan ""Make America Great Again,"" became the central theme of his campaign.

Barack Obama (2009-2017) became the first African-American to hold the office of President. He took the oath of office amid the Great Recession, the biggest economic challenge since the Great Depression. Under the Affordable Healthcare Act, millions of uninsured Americans have gotten health insurance.

George W. Bush (2001-2009) is the son of former President George H.W. Bush. His presidency was largely defined by his response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In 2003, he ordered the invasion of Iraq on suspicion that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.

Bill Clinton (1993-2001) ran on the slogan, ""It's the economy, stupid."" Plagued by various scandals -- including accusations of sexual impropriety -- he was the second president to be impeached. He was acquitted in 1999.

George H.W. Bush (1989-1993) was a former CIA director and served two terms as vice president under Ronald Reagan. His approval rating at home soared after he led an international coalition to oust Iraq from Kuwait, and communism in Eastern Europe fell on his watch. But he lost his bid for re-election amid a sluggish economy and after reneging on a promise not to raise taxes.

Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) was the only actor ever elected President, and his talent as a speaker earned him the moniker ""the great communicator."" An affable Republican who wooed many Roosevelt Democrats, the staunchly anti-communist Reagan is seen as having played a large part in the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) brokered the 1978 Camp David Accords, the agreement that led to a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. At home, Carter's presidency was plagued by inflation and unemployment, and he lost his bid for a second term amid the hostage crisis in Iran.

Gerald Ford (1974-1977) had been appointed vice president by Nixon after Spiro Agnew was forced to resign. He then became President when Nixon himself resigned. Remembered mainly for his pardon of Nixon and his physical clumsiness, Ford was not elected to a second term.

Richard Nixon (1969-1974) became the first President to resign from office as he faced impeachment for his involvement in the Watergate scandal. Nixon made strides in domestic policy, proposing legislation that resulted in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. Abroad, he established relations with China and a détente in Soviet relations.

Lyndon B. Johnson (1963-1969) was vice president under John F. Kennedy and took the oath of office on a plane after Kennedy was assassinated. In 1964, Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, the landmark legislation that banned segregation and discrimination based on race and gender. The law was a cornerstone of Johnson's vision of a ""Great Society"" that also included a ""war on poverty.""

John F. Kennedy (1961-1963) was the first Roman Catholic President. He was assassinated in his first term, which was marked by the signing of the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, the creation of the Peace Corps, the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, and the beginning of military involvement in Vietnam.

Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953-1961) had been supreme commander of the European Allied forces during World War II, and he ordered the Normandy invasion on D-Day. His popular presidential campaign slogan was ""I like Ike!""

Harry S. Truman (1945-1953) served as vice president for 82 days before the unexpected death of Roosevelt. He authorized the use of two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-1945) was the only President elected to the office four times. During his 12 years as President, he championed numerous social programs and measures, including the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Civilian Conservation Corps and Social Security. Roosevelt contracted polio at age 39 and never recovered the use of his legs.

Herbert Hoover (1929-1933) was inaugurated on the year of the stock market crash that sent the country into the Great Depression. Although Hoover pushed for money to be appropriated for large-scale projects, he opposed federal relief payments directly to individuals. The national economy never recovered during his term, and the shantytowns that developed were nicknamed ""Hoovervilles.""

Calvin Coolidge (1923-1929) served as vice president until the death of Warren G. Harding. His 1924 campaign slogan was ""Keep Cool with Coolidge,"" and his nickname was ""Silent Cal"" because of his reputation as a man of few words.

Warren G. Harding's term (1921-1923) was cut short by his sudden death from a cerebral hemorrage. Harding captured 60% of the popular vote in 1920, marking the largest presidential landslide to date.

Woodrow Wilson (1913-1921) was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize for proposing and creating the League of Nations. But he was never able to convince the United States to join. Although he was first opposed to a federal amendment allowing women to vote, Wilson shifted his position during his second term and the 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920.

William Howard Taft (1909-1913) also served as the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court in his post-presidency years. During his re-election bid, he managed to win only eight of 531 electoral votes -- the poorest performance of an incumbent president seeking re-election.

At 42, Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909) was the youngest man to take the oath of office. A progressive reformer and environmental advocate, Roosevelt brought lawsuits against corporate trusts, taking on business giants to level the playing field for the working class.

William McKinley (1897-1901) led the country through the Spanish-American War, a three-month conflict that began with the sinking of the USS Maine and ended with Cuban independence. During the beginning of McKinley's second term, he was fatally shot by an anarchist.

Benjamin Harrison (1889-1893) signed into law the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which authorized the government to fine large corporations for price fixing and other corrupt business practices.

Grover Cleveland (1885-1889; 1893-1897) was the first and only commander-in-chief to serve two non-consecutive terms. He was also the first bachelor President to be married at the White House.

Just four months into his term, James Garfield (1881) was shot by a disgruntled lawyer who'd aspired to join the administration as a diplomat. The President was taken to the Jersey Shore, where doctors hoped the ocean air would help him recover. He died two weeks later.

Rutherford B. Hayes (1877-1881) promoted women's rights, signing legislation that allowed female lawyers to argue Supreme Court cases. He introduced the White House Easter Egg Roll as a spring tradition and established the first presidential library.

Tasked with unifying the country after the Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant (1869-1877) established the Department of Justice to protect the rights of freed slaves. He also authorized the military to fight the Ku Klux Klan and successfully lobbied for the 15th Amendment, granting voting rights to black men.

Andrew Johnson's (1865-1869) trial by impeachment in the U.S. Senate resulted in his acquittal by a single vote. History gives him a terrible performance review: His plan for post-war Reconstruction failed, and he had little support from Congress or the public.

Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865), purveyor of tall top hats and log cabins, preserved the Union during the Civil War and freed the slaves through the Emancipation Proclamation. He was assassinated by actor John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer.

James Buchanan (1857-1861) was the only President who never married. He failed to prevent seven pro-slavery states from seceding during his term.

Franklin Pierce (1853-1857) was the first President to not get his party's nomination for re-election. He signed the controversial Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed the people there to decide whether to allow slavery. This worsened the tension between the North and South.

Millard Fillmore (1850-1853) was the last President who was neither a Democrat or a Republican. He helped pass the Compromise of 1850, legislation that included the Fugitive Slave Act and California's admission to the Union as a free state.

Zachary Taylor (1849-1850), aka ""Old Rough and Ready,"" was a hero in the Mexican-American War. Mystery surrounds his actual cause of death from a stomach ailment. Did he just eat too many cherries, or was it murder? The 1991 exhumation of his body proved it wasn't arsenic poisoning at least.

James K. Polk (1845-1849) oversaw the greatest expansion of territory of any President in history. The expansion included what would become the future states of Texas and California. Polk also negotiated with Britain to establish the boundaries of the Oregon Country.

John Tyler's term (1841-1845) saw several presidential firsts. He was the first vice president to succeed office after the President died, he was the first to lose his wife while in office, and he was the first to marry while in office.

William Henry Harrison (1841) probably had only just finished unpacking his things at the White House when he died of pneumonia one month into his term. Harrison was the first U.S. President to die while in office, and he had the shortest tenure ever of any commander-in-chief.

Martin Van Buren (1837-1841) was the first President to be born a U.S. citizen. Previous Presidents were born before the United States was a country, making them colonists and, consequently, citizens of Great Britain.

Andrew Jackson (1829-1837) was the only President to serve in both the American Revolution and the War of 1812. He is also the only President to have been a former prisoner of war: Jackson was 13 when became a courier during the Revolutionary War, and he was later captured by the British.

John Quincy Adams (1825-1829) was the son of second President John Adams. He was the only President to serve in the House of Representatives after serving as President.

James Monroe (1817-1825) was the last of the Founding Fathers to be elected President. During his seventh State of the Union address, he outlined a foreign policy that warned European powers against further colonization of or meddling in the Western Hemisphere. This was later known as the Monroe Doctrine.

James Madison, the fourth President (1809-1817), was nicknamed the ""Father of the Constitution."" During his presidency, the first formal declaration of war was enacted -- the War of 1812 with Great Britain.

Thomas Jefferson, the third President (1801-1809), was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence. While President, Jefferson doubled the size of the United States by purchasing the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803.

The second U.S. President, John Adams, served from 1797 to 1801. He was also the first vice president of the United States, and he was the first President to reside in the White House, moving in on November 1, 1800, while the White House was still under construction.

George Washington was the first President of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797. He also served as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, and he has the distinction of being the only President unanimously elected by the Electoral College.

Story highlights George W. Bush goes on ""The Tonight Show""; Bill Clinton gets Medal of Freedom Julian Zelizer: The two are taking opposite approaches to managing presidential legacies Clinton takes initiative in pushing his view of how Democratic Party should act, Zelizer says Zelizer: Bush takes more passive role, letting his controversial record speak for itself

Editor’s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of “Jimmy Carter” and “Governing America.”

(CNN) —

Former President George W. Bush briefly jumped back into the national conversation Tuesday night with his interview on “The Tonight Show.” Bush told host Jay Leno that “I don’t miss the spotlight” and that he was thoroughly enjoying his post-presidential life. On Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton is in the news as he receives a Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama.

The two former presidents have taken a very different approach to their time after the White House. In an era when former presidents are often younger and healthier than in the past, the post-presidency offers a huge opportunity for them to help shape their legacies.

Larry Levanti Julian Zelizer

Former President Jimmy Carter raised the bar after he lost to Ronald Reagan in 1980. Rather than going into political hiding, the Georgian launched the Carter Center, which has been a hub of international diplomacy. Carter remained an important voice in discussions about foreign policy and has even played a role in resolving some tense diplomatic situations.

Clinton’s approach to life after the White House has reflected his general style of politics. Clinton has never been passive. As governor of Arkansas and as president of the United States, Clinton has believed it is essential to maintain an aggressive and proactive stance.

In an era when many Democrats felt defensive about their ideas, Clinton never let his opponents define him. He responded to every attack throughout his presidency by going on the attack and tried to influence the national conversation about how he was doing.

When Republicans shut down the government in 1995 claiming to be fiscally responsible, Clinton turned the tables on them by depicting them as politically reckless. When House Republicans moved to impeach him for perjury in 1997 and 1998, Clinton painted his opponents as partisan zealots who were using the constitutional process for crass political ends.

Since 2000, Clinton has continued to inject himself into the political arena. Understanding that presidential legacies evolve in real time, Clinton has remained a forceful presence in the Democratic Party. He has worked hard to strengthen his image as an effective partisan fighter who knows, and knew, how to make things work in a dysfunctional political period.

During the 2008 campaign, while supporting his wife’s candidacy he promoted a vision of Democratic politics that he said would be most effective in getting things done in Washington.

After Obama won office, Clinton made his peace with the President and in 2012 was one of the most effective advocates for the White House by articulating a powerful critique of Republican economic policies.

In recent weeks, Clinton spoke out on the health care program, urging Obama to honor his commitment for people to keep their insurance plans and aiming to shore up Democrats as they have struggled through the problematic rollout of the Affordable Care Act.

Not only does Clinton want to demonstrate his political skills, but he remains devoted to a Democratic Party that is strong and effective – which in his mind would be the best proof that his term in office helped to revitalize a party that had been politically devastated in the Age of Reagan. Clinton also would like his wife to be elected president so as to create a political dynasty of sorts.

Bush has taken a different approach, letting his record stand on its own. Bush left the White House hugely unpopular and controversial. Bush had little appetite for the toxic environment of Washington and has been remarkably quiet since leaving. Although Americans saw some of him following the release of his book and in relationship to the opening of his presidential library, that’s about it.

The strategy follows the kind of politician he was. Bush liked to call himself “The Decider” and in many ways he was. Bush preferred to make decisions and let them stick, regardless of how controversial or problematic they were.

We have seen the same strategy in his post-presidential career. Rather than being part of the political conversation and trying to shape his party in the years that followed, Bush has let the record speak for itself. By many accounts, he has watched as the GOP moved rightward despite his own inclinations about what would be best for the future of the party.

Each strategy carries its rewards and risks. For Clinton, his stance allows him to be part of the conversation and to try to make sure that his party remains in a strong position. He can paint himself in a good light as people examine what he was doing as president. The danger is that his actions make him a target of controversy and that by making himself so doggedly political he undermines the aura of a statesman that has been so beneficial to rebuilding the damaged image Americans often have of their leaders.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, criticism from the African-American community about his statements regarding Obama weakened some of the strong support that the community held toward his presidency.

For Bush, the benefit of his relative silence is that he avoids all of the pitfalls that face Clinton. As feelings about him start to soften simply because we are further removed from his presidency, he has created the space for more careful and rigorous analysis of what he did during the White House. By showing how difficult the political environment is regardless of whether he is in office, Bush can allow for more sympathy to develop of challenges he faced.

The dangers for Bush are twofold. By being so removed, he can convey a level of dispassion for politics that plays into criticism that it was never a job he was driven to do in the first place. He has also failed to play a forceful role as his party plunges in its approval ratings.

Presidential legacies are a tough thing to predict. Like the weather in New England, they change by the minute.

As the nation commemorates the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, we can see how presidential reputations fluctuate dramatically (historians often remember his failures as president, while many others recall his presidency in heroic terms). But in this day and age, former presidents have significant opportunities to shape how the nation remembers them and to influence the political world in which they will be judged during their lifetime.

As Obama reaches the final period of his presidency, he would do well to look at what his predecessors have done and start thinking through what his strategy will be in the years ahead.

Republicans will release the results of their post-election self-analysis next week, but a hint of the way forward may come from a meeting chairman Reince Priebus had Monday with African-American leaders in Brooklyn: A return by the national GOP to playing in local elections.

""We have to be a party that's community based, we can't just be a party that shows up three months before the election and expects to do well. We have to be an organization that embraces candidates at a local level,'' Priebus said in an interview Tuesday morning.

To do so may mean reviving the GOP's local election division, founded in the 1970s by then-Republican National Committee Chairman Bill Brock, to train local candidates and campaign staff, Priebus said. That would allow Republicans to begin ""building a bench of African Americans and Hispanics that are running for things like city council and school board.""

Priebus' visit to the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Monday was the last stop on his listening tour, part of the GOP's self-examination after losing the presidential election and failing to take a majority in the U.S. Senate last November.

The GOP has also acknowledged a big disadvantage in using technology to reach voters, track them and turn them out — and Priebus said local elections are good places to test new technology. ""One of the issues that we have to do a better job with is testing our technology and our data before a major election. You can use the local elections as a place to do testing,'' he said."
http://news.yahoo.com/scs-graham-shows-limits-tea-party-intimidation-185606487--election.html,,[],SC's Graham shows limits of tea party intimidation,"WASHINGTON (AP) — To gauge the limits of the tea party's ability to frighten re-election-seeking Republicans into a rightward panic, spend time with Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

One day he's blasting tea party hero Rand Paul on the Senate floor, calling the Kentucky senator's 13-hour filibuster — which criticized U.S. drone policy — wrong-headed and ""ill-informed.""

Another day Graham is at a groundbreaking ceremony in Greer, S.C., mixing jokes and politics in a fashion even his enemies have to admire. Citing a January CBS News poll showing Congress' approval rating at 12 percent, he asked: ""Who are the 12 percent, and what do they like?""

Three years ago, South Carolina Republican clubs were condemning Graham, calling him too moderate and too willing to cooperate with President Barack Obama and other Democrats. Nikki Haley, now the state's governor, supported the censures. Graham seemed a prime candidate for the type of tea-party-backed insurrections that ousted GOP senators in Utah and Indiana, and prompted other senators to steer hard right to save their jobs.

Today, even his critics say Graham is on track to win a third Senate term next year.

""His approval numbers are pretty high,"" said Lin Bennett, executive director of the Charleston County Republican Party, one of two major groups that censured Graham three years ago for supporting a bank bailout and for being too accommodating on immigration.

""He offers great constituent services,"" Bennett said. ""One unhappy county isn't enough.""

Graham calls himself a proud conservative. But he makes no apologies for sometimes seeking compromise with Democrats, which some tea partyers consider villainy.

""How do we get out of this mess?"" Graham asked the Greer crowd, referring to the nation's economic troubles. ""The same way the country has survived and thrived for the last 200 years: find common ground. Try to find a way to make everybody a winner instead of everybody a loser.""

Story continues

Graham's bipartisan talk contrasts with the recent tones of Senate Republican leaders Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and John Cornyn. Both men face possible GOP primary challenges from the right next year, and they have sharpened their criticisms of Democrats.

Graham didn't pass judgment on fellow Republicans. But he said politicians needn't kowtow to ideological groups if they visit their home districts regularly and explain their positions forthrightly.

""I've been fortunate enough to be judged by the body of my work,"" he said in an interview in his Senate office. ""I don't worry obsessively about my political re-election. And I've become a very good senator. If you don't overly worry about losing, you become hard to beat.""

All politicians and states are different, so Graham's lessons and luck may not apply elsewhere. But by any measure he's folksier and friendlier than the standoffish McConnell. He's far more visible in his home state than was Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, defeated in last year's GOP primary. And he seems unlikely to be caught off guard by hard-right insurgencies, as were Republican senators in recent years in Utah and Alaska.

Graham ""is a ferocious campaigner, especially when he gets back home,"" said Katon Dawson, a former South Carolina Republican Party chairman and a major Graham fundraiser. ""Lindsey doesn't have a lot of hobbies."" The Senate and politics are ""a lifestyle, and he works hard,"" Dawson said.

Some South Carolina tea partyers still hope to challenge Graham in next year's primary. But they lost perhaps their best prospect when state Sen. Tom Davis — a libertarian-leaning former top aide to Gov. Mark Sanford — declined to run.

Another state senator, Lee Bright of Spartanburg, might try. Graham's criticisms of Paul's filibuster ""kind of pushed me over the edge,"" Bright said.

But some South Carolinians see Bright as a fringe candidate.

Meanwhile, Graham has a formidable campaign fund of more than $4 million and rising. Assuming Graham survives the GOP primary, as expected, he is ""completely bullet proof"" in a general election against a Democrat, Dawson said.

Non-South Carolinians might be amused to hear Republicans debate whether Graham is conservative enough. Four years before being elected to the Senate he was one of 13 House managers for President Bill Clinton's impeachment. He sharply criticizes Obama at times, calling presidential budget plans ""a road map to disaster.""

Like his pal and mentor Arizona Sen. John McCain, however, Graham often carves an independent path. Despite conservative attacks on Republican senators who have voted to confirm Obama's judicial nominees, Graham says presidents should get their choices barring something that's clearly disqualifying.

""I don't know how to construct a world where we get all of our judges, and they never get any of theirs,"" he said.

Graham says he would consider higher tax revenues in exchange for serious changes to Medicare and Social Security. He says immigration reform must include a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Both stands are anathema to many conservative activists.

Graham most recently drew their fire for joining McCain in denouncing Paul's highly publicized filibuster. Paul — a libertarian Republican weighing a presidential bid — demanded White House assurances that unmanned aircraft will not be used to kill American citizens on U.S. soil and not engaged in combat.

Graham called the question groundless and defended Obama's use of deadly drones against terrorist suspects overseas. He shrugged off the resulting torrent of angry tweets and e-mails, saying he and Paul get along fine.

""Rand and I play golf together,"" Graham said. They differ on surveillance and other anti-terrorism policies, he said, ""but these differences have been around forever in the Republican Party.""

Graham supports a ""big-tent"" GOP, which is disdained by those conservatives who say Republicans have become too wishy-washy and too willing to compromise.

""Partisan ideas, on big issues, never fare well over time,"" he said. He cited Obama's embattled overhaul of health care as an example.

As for the nation's economic challenges, he said, ""the path off the road to becoming Greece is a shared path.""

If the Republican Party is to thrive, Graham said, it must have ""tea party libertarians, tea party conservatives, married up with traditional Republicans. That's the coalition of the future.""

So far, most South Carolina Republicans seem disinclined to punish him for that vision.

The new Senate rule clears the way for eight appeals court nominees who have already had confirmation hearings to win approval with simple majority votes, including three on the powerful Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which reviews federal policies and regulations. But it left unchanged the Senate’s “blue slip” custom, which allows senators to block nominees to judgeships associated with their states.

“It is hard to overstate the change’s importance for the D.C. Circuit, which has a disproportionate impact on the world, but it won’t have overwhelming impact elsewhere,” Kathryn Ruemmler, the White House counsel, said in an interview. “The blue slip rule for judges has been more problematic than the filibuster, in part because it is a silent, unaccountable veto.”

Twelve more appeals court seats are either vacant or will be by the end of 2014. All but one are in states with at least one Republican senator. As a result, Mr. Obama still lacks unrestricted power to swiftly appoint a flurry of more clearly left-of-center judges than he has done to date, despite the fears of conservatives and the hopes of liberals, specialists said."

He Left The Post In April']","If Hillary Rodham Clinton passes in 2016, which Democrats run? The Fix ranks the tiers.","Every conversation we have with any Democratic operative about the 2016 presidential race starts this way: “Well, I mean if Hillary runs . . .” Which, of course, is to be expected. If Hillary Rodham Clinton — the former secretary of state, former New York senator and 2008 presidential candidate — runs, then the Democratic race (and the general election, too) revolves around her.

But, of late, those conversations have an interesting addendum that goes like this: “Of course, if Elizabeth Warren wanted to do it, she’d have a case to make.” Yes, she would. We’ve long believed that the freshman senator’s hero status among liberals nationally and massive fundraising capacity would make her very formidable if she ran.

Warren (D-Mass.) has been adamant about her lack of interest in the race. But things change in politics. Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois was similarly adamant about his lack of interest in running for president in 2008 — and we know how that turned out.

The simple fact is that Warren’s beloved status among rank-and-file Democrats — and an elite group of very wealthy and very liberal major donors — means that if Clinton doesn’t run, Warren will come under a significant amount of pressure to reconsider. And Warren would have a built-in excuse to explain her past comments: “Well, I never thought about it seriously, because I expected Hillary to run. But now that she’s not . . . ”

Because of that upside — with apologies to NBA draft experts — we are moving Warren into our second tier of potential Democratic presidential candidates. Clinton remains as the lone candidate in the first tier — a space she will occupy until she announces whether she is running. Our breakdown of the field is below. The candidates within each tier are listed alphabetically.

Tier 1 (If she runs, the other tiers don’t matter)

Hillary Clinton: Everything we hear privately and everything we see publicly suggests that Clinton is running — or at least allowing those around her to put the pieces in place to be ready if/when she flips the switch. Does that mean she is definitely in? No. But it means that with every passing month, we become more and more convinced that the surprise announcement would be that she’s not running.

Tier 2 (If not Hillary, then . . .)

Joe Biden : Last week, the vice president called state Rep.-elect Brian Meyer (D) to congratulate him on his special-election victory a few days earlier. Why would the VP call a not-even-sworn-in-yet state legislator? Because Meyer is from Iowa. And that tells you everything you need to know about whether Biden is thinking about running for president in 2016.

Andrew Cuomo: Unlike some of the other people on this list — Martin O’Malley, we are looking at you — the New York governor is doing the do-as-little-as-possible-to-stoke-2016-speculation thing. (That may or may not be a thing.) Cuomo, the scion of a famous political family, knows that in a field without Clinton, he is a heavyweight given his name, fundraising abilities and résumé as governor of one of the most Democratic states in the country.

Martin O’Malley : The governor of Maryland is, without question, the candidate most open about his interest in running for president. “By the end of this year, I think we’re on course to have a body of work that lays the framework for a candidacy in 2016,” O’Malley told reporters in August. His travel schedule is heavy on trips to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, and O’Malley used his time as chairman of the Democratic Governors Association to build out his national fundraising network.

Elizabeth Warren: See above. There’s no one not named Clinton on this list who combines the star power and fundraising potential that Warren boasts. And, Warren has one thing that even Clinton doesn’t: a rabid following within the liberal base of the party.

Tier 3 (There’s a will and a way — sort of)

Kirsten Gillibrand: Gillibrand is a sneaky-good politician. Without all that much fanfare, the senator from New York has turned herself into a liberal champion. She’s also someone who has proved that she knows how to raise money; she took in $30 million between her 2010 and 2012 Senate campaigns.

Tier 4 (There’s a will but — probably — not a way)

Howard Dean: The former Vermont governor clearly looks back on his one-time front-running 2004 presidential campaign wistfully and wonders whether he could catch lightning in a bottle again. The answer is almost certainly no, but Dean, never someone who cared much about the party establishment’s opinion of him, might be the sort of person who would be willing to wage a campaign against Clinton from the ideological left.

Amy Klobuchar: The field above her is too crowded for the senator from Minnesota to take a flier on a presidential bid. But she has the résumé and the ambition to surprise people if things were to break just right."

Decker Left The Times In']","Poll shows Republicans losing ethnicity, age battle in California","Deep inside a new USC/Los Angeles Times poll are details that could make the California Republican Party, and by extension its cohorts elsewhere in the country, fear anew the march of time and demographics.

California right now is an extreme example of the nation, to be sure: more ethnically mixed and younger than most states, and riven for 20 years by a hobbling GOP civil war that now is surfacing dramatically elsewhere in the country. But if California is on the leading edge, as opposed to an outlier, the poll serves as confirmation that long-term problems loom for Republicans.

Take party registration: Among white California voters, almost four in 10 are Democrats and four in 10 are Republicans. But among Latinos 55% are Democrats and only 15% are Republicans. Among black voters, 76% are Democrats and 4% are Republicans. There were not enough Asian voters to accurately assess, but overall, minority voters are 54% Democratic to 14% Republican. (Just more than one-quarter of minority voters are registered independents, a group that generally votes Democratic in California.)

The collision between ethnicity and age is even more lethal. Six in 10 white voters are over 50, making them prized in the present but not dependable in future decades. The reverse is true for Latinos, 64% of whom are age 49 or younger. Overall, among all voters, 35% of those 50 and over are Republicans; of those younger, only 23% were.

Already those younger and minority voters — 38% of the voter pool — are propping up Democrats in California. Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown has a positive job approval rating of 55% overall. Among white voters the rating is 51%. Among black voters, it is 67%, Among Latinos, it is 61%.

Other poll findings suggest no end to that imbalance. Asked their political ideology, 31% of those ages 49 and younger describe themselves as liberal, to 29% who say conservative. That is close to the opposite of those over 50, only 26% of whom say they are liberal to 38% conservative.

PHOTOS: Best political moments of 2013

Personal experience, events and candidates can prompt change, of course; Arnold Schwarzenegger’s larger-than-life candidacy in the 2003 recall upended the usual ethnic and ideological breaks , as to a lesser extent did his 2006 reelection campaign.

But after he left the stage, normalcy returned. And apart from the unlikely chance of another Arnold-like candidacy, there are few dynamics that could alter the current trajectory.

At this point, Republicans in the state largely continue to weigh against immigration reform and Obamacare, two key issues that help to define candidates for minority voters. And there’s not much to remake the GOP from the inside: The growing numbers of Latino voters in their ranks have applied consistent policy pressure on Democrats, but there’s no parallel pressure on the overwhelmingly white Republican party.

WASHINGTON — President Obama starts his second term with a clear upper hand over GOP leaders on issues from guns to immigration that are likely to dominate the year, a USA TODAY/Pew Research Center Poll finds. On the legislation rated most urgent — cutting the budget deficit — even a majority of Republican voters endorse Obama's approach of seeking tax hikes as well as spending cuts.

The survey underscores the quandary for the GOP as it debates the party's message in the wake of disappointing losses last November for the White House and in the Senate.

Now just 22% of Americans, nearly a record low, consider themselves Republicans.

And those automatic spending cuts, known as the sequester, that are poised to take effect next week?

If no deal is reached to avert them, half of Americans say congressional Republicans will be more to blame. Less than a third would blame Obama first.

""On many of the issues, President Obama has staked out positions that seem to be closer to the public's thinking than the positions Republicans have staked out,"" says Michael Dimock, director of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The poll is the first in a new partnership between Pew and USA TODAY. ""The challenge for him is in building the public's sense of immediacy on some of these issues, particularly on climate change and guns.""

Republicans have the opposite challenge. ""Their focus on the deficit is in tune with the public's priorities right now,"" he says. ""Yet their positions are not quite in step with the kind of compromises that the public tells us they want to see.""

To be sure, Obama faces his own challenges.

His approval ratings for handling seven specific issues are no better than lukewarm, ranging from a low of 34% on the deficit to a high of 46% on the situation in Afghanistan. On the central issue of managing the economy, 40% approve and 56% disapprove. Americans also continue to be deeply unhappy with the country's direction. By 2-to-1, 64%-31%, they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the United States.

Even so, those surveyed say by narrow margins that Obama has a better approach than congressional Republicans for dealing with the deficit and guns. By double digits, they favor his plans on immigration and climate change, including limits on emissions from power plants.

The president's overall job approval rating is 51%, a bit higher than it typically has been for the past three years. The approval rating for Republican congressional leaders is a dismal 25%. Democratic congressional leaders stand in-between, at 37%.

The telephone poll of 1,504 adults was taken by land line and cellphone Feb. 13-18. It has a margin of error of +/–3 percentage points.

Since winning re-election, Obama has outlined bolder policies and taken a less compromising stance toward the GOP lawmakers he blames for frustrating much of his legislative agenda over the past two years. In his inaugural address and State of the Union speech, and at events across the country, he has focused more on generating public support for his proposals than on forging ties with Congress to negotiate them.

""I think there is a fresh start,"" says Sue Mohler, 60, of Nashua, N.H., who works in computer IT support. An Obama supporter, she was among those called in the poll. ""It's not as big a fresh start as we would like it to be, but I'm hopeful. I'm not as pessimistic as I was."" She says she's encouraged by signs that Republican leaders are ready to shift their stance on issues such as immigration.

For her part, Lynn Wright, 47, a homemaker from Richlands, N.C., doesn't appreciate Obama's more combative tone. ""I really feel like his feet are very, very, very buried in the sand,"" she said in a follow-up interview. ""I did not vote for him, but yes, he did win. But I just don't see how he can say, 'OK, this is my time now; you guys can't tell me no.' ""

Red flags on red ink

There is bipartisan agreement on this: Dealing with the budget deficit is urgent.

That's a change. When Obama took office in 2009, during a cascading financial crisis, Americans put deficit reduction in the middle of a list of policy goals in a Pew poll. Now it has risen near the top. Seven of 10 Americans (including not only 81% of Republicans but also 65% of Democrats) say it is essential for the president and Congress to enact major deficit legislation this year.

Just 4% say nothing needs to be done within the next few years.

In the wake of the Great Recession, the deficit as a percentage of the economy has spiked to its highest levels since the years following World War II. Now, after four years of topping $1 trillion, the shortfall this year is projected at $845 billion by the Congressional Budget Office.

When asked which of four issues was most pressing — the deficit, guns, immigration or climate change — 51% chose the deficit, three times that of any other issue. However, there were some significant differences by race and ethnicity. Hispanics were inclined to choose immigration as the most critical issue; African Americans chose guns.

""The biggest thing is the deficit,"" declares Rennie Woodhouse, 49, a foundry supervisor in Wellsboro, Pa. ""I just think we're getting further and further in the hole.""

To begin digging out, three of four Americans say a deficit plan should include both tax increases and spending cuts, akin to the ""balanced"" approach Obama backs. While there is stronger support to cut spending than raise taxes, only one in five say a deficit-reduction package should rely solely on spending cuts, the position embraced by House Speaker John Boehner.

By almost 3-to-1, 71%-26%, those surveyed favor Obama's proposal to raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour from the current $7.25. On this issue, as on some others, the GOP faces divisions in its ranks: Those who agree with the Tea Party movement oppose the idea by 2-to-1. Those who don't agree with the Tea Party support it by nearly as wide a gap.

For Ian Tate, 23, of Springfield, Ill., the threat of the deficit should take precedence over everything else even though he is himself unemployed and looking for work. ""It's kind of a stalemate, a Catch-22 kind of situation,"" he says, expressing concern that government job-creation programs would end up worsening the budget shortfall.

The potential impact on national security from Pentagon cuts included in the sequestration worries Travis Petry, 34, a courier who lives in Lafayette, La. ""North Korea, they're test-firing nukes, and the Middle East in general — it's always a problem down there,"" he says.

But he doesn't expect the president and Congress to succeed in reaching a deal to avoid the across-the-board cuts, scheduled to take effect March 1. ""Both sides are just hardheaded,"" he says. ""Neither is going to compromise. It's business as usual.""

Most Americans aren't paying much attention to the looming deadline despite dire warnings by Obama on Tuesday that jobs could be lost and communities hurt. Only about a quarter of those surveyed say they have heard a lot about it. That's half the number who had heard a lot about the debt-ceiling showdown at a similar point last summer.

If the president and Congress can't reach a budget deal by next week, half of Americans say they should delay the spending cuts. But a significant number, four in 10, say the cuts should be allowed to go into effect.

That attitude could reflect ""crisis fatigue,"" Dimock says. ""They've seen one crisis after another, and now they're told yet another one is coming. A pretty large share of them, even a third of Democrats, are saying, 'Just let it happen.' They're throwing up their hands.""

An immigration divide

A 51% majority of Americans say it's essential for the president and Congress to pass a sweeping immigration bill this year, and nearly everybody, nine in 10, say a major bill is needed within the next few years.

But to do what?

One in four want the bill to focus on better border security — that's down 10 percentage points from a year ago — and another one in four want the focus to be on creating a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants now in this country. Nearly half of those surveyed, 47%, say both should be equal priorities.

There is a predictable partisan divide on the issue: Democrats want a pathway to citizenship while Republicans back stronger security and enforcement of existing immigration laws. That could create problems for Republican leaders, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who are working on bipartisan bills that would include a path to legal status for illegal immigrants as well as border security measures.

By a wide margin, 50%-33%, Obama's approach to immigration is preferred over the GOP, and the president has seen his approval rating on handling immigration surge. During his first term, his disapproval rating on immigration was 20 points or more higher than his approval rating. Now, as many Americans approve of his work on immigration as disapprove, 44%-43%. Only his handling of Afghanistan ranks higher.

For Obama, having higher ratings than congressional Republicans doesn't guarantee passage of any legislation, given the polarization in a divided Congress. But it does put him in a stronger position to bring public pressure on lawmakers. And it complicates Republican efforts to unite a fractured party behind a message that will appeal to voters.

""Lots of things need to be passed in Congress, and it seems everything is a filibuster,"" says Jaime Cortez, 23, of Edinburg, Texas. ""I know a lot of strong, far-right Republicans, but I just think they need to ease up and listen to the public's opinion.""

While most Americans want action on the deficit and immigration this year, Obama faces a more difficult task in pressing two other priorities he's outlined, on gun control and climate change. His approach to the issues is preferred, but the public's sense of urgency is lower.

On climate change, only a third of those surveyed say action is urgent this year. Still, Americans do back stricter emission limits on power plants, a step Obama has discussed, by more than 2-to-1. By 54%-34%, they support developing alternative sources of energy over expanding production of oil and coal.

On gun control, 71% of Democrats say it's essential to pass legislation this year but only 19% of Republicans agree. Among independents, 42% want action this year.

A majority of Republicans say nothing should be done on guns now or later. That puts them at odds with Americans overall: 83% back mandating background checks for all gun buyers; 56% a ban on assault-style weapons; 53% a ban on high-capacity ammunition clips.

Monte Latham, 41, of Jacksonville, says the economy should be the top issue, but he ranks gun legislation close behind. A Navy veteran who is now studying nursing, he hopes supporters push for action while memories of the December shooting rampage in Newtown, Conn., are fresh.

""If gun control takes a back seat,"" he worries, ""it's just going to lose that momentum."""

There was no way, this theory ran, that core Democratic constituencies would turn out at the same rates as in 2008, when Obamamania was at its peak. Instead, 2012 was set up to be what the conservative writer Ben Domenech called an “undertow election,” in which reduced turnout among young voters and minorities would drag the incumbent down to defeat.

This expectation turned out to be wrong on two counts. First, Republicans faced an unexpected (though in hindsight, predictable) undertow of their own, as many conservative-leaning, working-class white voters looked at what Mitt Romney had to offer and simply stayed home.

Second, instead of declining as expected after the history-making election of 2008, African-American turnout may have actually risen again in 2012. When the Census Bureau released its turnout analysis last month, it showed blacks voting at higher rates than whites for the first time in the history of the survey.

If you believe Chief Justice John Roberts Jr.’s more overheated liberal critics, last week’s Supreme Court decision invalidating a portion of the Voting Rights Act is designed to make sure African-American turnout never hits these highs again. The ruling will allow a number of (mostly Southern) states to change voting laws without the Justice Department’s pre-approval, which has liberals predicting a wave of Republican-led efforts to “suppress” minority votes — through voter ID laws, restrictions on early voting and other measures."

Police Academy Director Appalled And Embarrassed At Video

SCRANTON – Former Scranton Police Chief Dan Duffy says a video gone viral online shows exactly what not to do as a police officer. ----- “This is exactly what a law enforcement officer should not be doing out there publicly, especially identifying himself as a law enforcement officer. It`s an embarrassment to us,” said Duffy.

He can call for an armed march but he'd be down beating skulls and pepperspraying kids if any sort of peaceful protest occurred.

As I have been saying since before Obama's re-election these fuckwits are gearing up for a spasm of violence fueled in part by paranoid delusions, the ongoing unfettered racism promoted by right wing media and Republican/Teabagger politicians.

Florida has the SYG (shoot your gun) law, encouraging aggressive and predatory conduct by persons with such personality defects, here we have a friggin Chief of Police going fully unhinged, Rush Limbaugh with a badge and a gun. Collecting a paycheck derived from taxpayer money.

He has a webpage dedicated to his dream of a violent uprising: Chief Kessler's Constitution Security Force

The guy is 'gun nut- a term I used judiciously - of extraordinary proportion. The screed there is total 2nd amendment paranoia, which I figure is rife with closeted racism.

This is open stochastic terrorism and this numbnut should be under surveillance, since we are paying out the ass for that. Goddammit N$A do something useful.

There was little on Google News referencing this imbecile.

Really - do we have to just wait for this guy or one of his delusional followers to harm people before he gets a talking to in the woodshed? His mayor has clearly indicated she is useless - and won't be doing a damned thing about it.

She Started With The Times In Washington', 'D.C.', 'In', 'Covering Money', 'Politics', 'She Also Covered State Politics', 'Government In Sacramento.']",Brown emerges from bill signings with a strong political hand,"SACRAMENTO — Gov. Jerry Brown emerged this week from a month of bill decisions with accolades for temperate lawmaking and fiscal prudence that could serve him well if, as expected, he runs for reelection next year.

There was something for everyone in his signings and vetoes. He liberalized some social policies, blocked some ideas that conservatives disliked and took the middle ground on many other matters.

And nearly a year after persuading voters to pass a $6-billion tax hike, he had the victory that may matter the most: an end to the state’s budget crisis.

As a result, the 75-year-old Brown appears virtually immune to an election challenge next year. And his political strength could help fellow Democrats in the Legislature — nearly all of whose seats will be on the ballot in 2014 — keep their slim two-thirds majority in each house.

Although the state’s fiscal tranquillity gives the governor new room for policy initiatives, Brown’s 2014 agenda is expected to be muted, without flashy proposals to dangle before voters.

“Politically, this is as good as it gets for Democrats,” said Jack Pitney, a former national GOP official and a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. “Why risk it by pushing too hard too fast?”

Democrats learned that lesson the hard way more than a decade ago, the last time they both held the governor’s chair and dominated the Legislature, albeit without a supermajority. As the economy roared during the dot-com boom, lawmakers and then-Gov. Gray Davis expanded social services and public employees’ retirement benefits.

Four years later, an energy crisis had gripped the state, deficits were rising and Davis was thrown out of office.

In a recent interview, Brown said he plans to stay his course. He’ll focus on the nitty-gritty work of implementing policies he has already signed into law — on education and prisons, for example — and will keep pushing for a state bullet train, he said.

He will also devote time, and political clout, to unclogging California water policy. The governor wants lawmakers to finish renegotiating a water bond measure, currently scheduled for the November 2014 ballot, to boost the reliability and safety of the state’s water supply.

He is simultaneously promoting a separate plan to build two massive tunnels to divert water around the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to the southern half of the state.

“I think the emphasis has to be on digesting and managing a lot of what we have — high-speed rail, the Delta project’s going to take several years even to get it ready to go, and this whole prison realignment — there’s a lot of work to do there,” Brown said. “This is a big ship to turn. It takes a lot of knowledge and a lot of time. So I’m doing that.”

The slow-and-steady approach could clash with the priorities of Democratic lawmakers, who for years slashed school funds and welfare programs to help rescue the state’s finances. They will almost certainly want to restore those cuts.

Lawmakers and Brown have “worked together to try to get the state’s fiscal house in order,” said David McCuan, professor of political science at Sonoma State. Expensive infrastructure projects “are going to be very difficult for many legislators to swallow” without more money for social programs.

Assembly budget Chairwoman Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley) said the minor boosts to social services this year, such as restoration of adult dental benefits in Medi-Cal, were “not as much as the need out there.”

Next year, Skinner said, there will be more focus on “those core safety-net things that really make a difference in someone’s ability to survive.” One priority, she said, will be a rollback of cuts to Medi-Cal providers, reductions that Brown demanded while the state was still mired in financial crisis.

Still, legislators know there are limits, especially in an election year. And the new class of lawmakers, who can serve all their time in one house under California’s new term limits, does not feel compelled “to solve all the state’s problems” at once, said Assemblyman Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood), who won his first legislative seat in 2012.

“We [have] a long-range view toward public policy,” he said.

If California’s economy continues to improve, Brown could restore enough social-service funding to keep Democrats happy, and do so without appearing incautious.

As long as he doesn’t find himself forced by the courts to release thousands of prison inmates to the streets, Republicans have little chance of prevailing against Brown at the polls next year, experts say. And no viable candidate has announced a run.

“There really isn’t much barring him from reelection,” said Bill Whalen of Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, who was an aide to former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. “He is just in this incredibly enviable position.”

New Egypt, New Jersey (CNN) - What does a candidate do if he's down in the polls, days from the election, and his opponent is a political celebrity?

Answer: Bring in his own celebrity.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

That's what Senate hopeful Steve Lonegan did this weekend, just days before he faces off against Democratic nominee and Newark Mayor Cory Booker in New Jersey's special U.S. Senate election on Wednesday.

His wild card? Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.

""Can the rest of America count on you to send Steve Lonegan to the United States Senate?"" Palin asked the crowd Saturday at a rally for Lonegan in Ocean County. It was her first appearance at a tea party rally in more than a year, when she stumped for Ted Cruz in Texas in July 2012.

Lonegan, former mayor of Bogota, faces an uphill battle against Booker, a man well known on the national stage.

""Don't be measuring the drapes there just quite yet,"" Palin said in a warning to Booker.

Palin and Lonegan paint the race as a national referendum on President Barack Obama's policies, including Obamacare.

""When we go to Washington on October 17 (the day after the special election), it's going to be Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid that are going to fold,"" Lonegan said at the rally.

Thanks in part to Lonegan's aggressive ad campaign, Booker's 28-percentage-point lead in August dipped to 12 points, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released last week.

That's not surprising to some voters in New Jersey, a state where Democrats greatly outnumber Republicans.

""There are a lot of people in the state that have conservative values and just don't know it,"" one woman, Alexandra Zazanis of North Arlington, said at the rally.

But another voter said he's not quite on board with Lonegan's policies.

""I'm a Republican, but I think Lonegan's a little bit too far to the right,"" Dave Munn said.

Krista Jenkins, Director of Public Mind At Farleigh Dickenson University, acknowledge that Lonegan has narrowed his gap with Booker, but added the Republican is still a longshot for the Senate seat.

""We're looking at a very blue state there's approximately 700,000 more registered Democrats than there are Republicans,"" she said. ""So anyone who runs, with the exception of Chris Christie right now, anyone who runs as a Republican, you know, for the Senate is certainly going to have a more difficult time than somebody who's a Democrat.""

And because Lonegan is a ""movement conservative,"" not a moderate Republican, his uphill fight is ""much steeper"" the Garden State, she said.

Lonegan is against abortion rights and same-sex marriage, but his views on Booker seem to be getting all the attention. Lonegan fired one of his top advisers, Rick Shaftan, Friday after that adviser gave a profanity-laced interview, ridiculing Booker for having a Twitter exchange with a stripper.

""I don't know, it was like what a gay guy would say to a stripper,"" the adviser said.

Lonegan said he can't be responsible for what one of his supporters says.

""I have hundreds of activists, volunteers, donors, people on this campaign and I can't be responsible for what all of them say, but I will take responsibility – so I terminated the gentleman for his inappropriate comment,"" he told CNN.

Lonegan was criticized for his own comments about Booker after the Newark mayor addressed questions about whether he was gay.

""People who think I'm gay, some part of me thinks it's wonderful,"" Booker told The Washington Post. ""Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I'm gay, and I say, 'So what does it matter if I am? So be it. I hope you are not voting for me because you are making the presumption that I'm straight.'""

Lonegan weighed in on Booker's comments during an August radio interview.

""It's kind of weird. As a guy, I personally like being a guy,"" he said.

Then there was the comment that Lonegan made during last week's debate: ""All that income tax and sales tax money gets poured into the big black hole of Newark.""

After facing some backlash from critics saying his remark was racist, Lonegan said Saturday, ""the liberal media is going to say what they want to say.""

Va. Democrats will remove racy posters used to drive turnout on college campuses

By Ben Pershing,

Sex sells. Even in governor’s races.

That appears to be what the Democratic Party of Virginia was thinking when it distributed racy posters to college campuses, looking to educate students about Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II’s (R) support for the commonwealth’s controversial anti-sodomy law.

As was first reported by the Hampton Roads TV station WAVY, two posters spotted last weekend at Norfolk State University say “Ken Cuccinelli wants to make oral sex a felony” and urge students to vote Nov. 5. One poster says, “Get your head in the game,” while another says, “Don’t let Election Day go down without you.”

Both posters say at the bottom that they were paid for by “Education Votes, a project of the Democratic Party of Virginia.” They were distributed to other campuses around the state, too, but DPV spokesman Brian Coy said the party has had a change of heart.

“While we feel Virginians deserve to know the truth about Ken Cuccinelli’s extreme social agenda, we apologize to those who were offended,” Coy said. “We’re working to remove these posters from the campuses in question and they will not be used again.”

Garren Shipley, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Virginia, called the posters “par for the course” for Virginia Democrats.

“Not only does it repeat this thoroughly-debunked Terry McAuliffe falsehood,” Shipley said, “but it manages to do it in an even more crass and tasteless way than before. ... Mailers and posters like this are what you get when your candidates have no record to run on. The Democratic Party of Virginia should be ashamed. But they’re probably not.”

The posters are a reference to Virginia’s “crimes against nature” law, which bans oral and anal sex. The U.S Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that laws which criminalize sexual activity between consenting adults are unconstitutional. Based on that decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled this year that Virginia’s statute was unconstitutional.

Cuccinelli has defended the anti-sodomy law as an important tool for prosecuting child predators and appealed that decision. But the U.S. Supreme Court said two weeks ago that it would not hear Cuccinelli’s final appeal. McAuliffe, Cuccinelli’s opponent in the governor’s race, has called for the law to be updated to comport with the 2003 Supreme Court ruling.

White House lists how looming sequestration cuts would affect all 50 states

The sequester -- %2485 billion in automatic budget cuts -- takes effect Friday

Obama to discuss budget with the nation%27s governors on Monday

The White House kicked off a week of warnings about the sequestration by issuing reports Sunday on how the looming $85 billion in automatic budget cuts will affect each of the 50 states.

Among the examples: A slowdown of Superstorm Sandy cleanup in New Jersey, teacher layoffs in Ohio, reduced ship maintenance in Virginia, fewer vaccinations in Georgia, military base cutbacks in Texas and California, and similar reductions in states across the country, said the reports.

With the automatic cuts set to begin Friday, President Obama is expected to cite the state reports as part of his effort to pressure congressional Republicans over the sequestration. Obama's schedule this week includes remarks Monday to the National Governors Association and a Tuesday visit to shipyards in Newport News, Va.

The sequestration threatens ""hundreds of thousands of middle class jobs,"" as well as ""vital services for children, seniors, people with mental illness, and our men and women in uniform,"" said an introduction to the White House's state-by-state breakdowns.

By releasing sequestration reports on 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, the Obama administration is hoping that local media outlets will spotlight the jobs and services that are threatened in their areas.

The reports list numerous cutbacks in federal programs that have big constituencies or political popularity, including Head Start, military readiness, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and Clean Air and Clean Water programs.

For weeks, Obama has proposed replacing the sequestration with a new debt reduction agreement that would include both targeted spending cuts and new taxes through the elimination of loopholes and deductions that benefit the wealthy.

Republicans said Obama got higher tax rates in the agreement that ended their last budget standoff – ""the fiscal cliff"" – and this deal should be spending cuts only.

In a statement, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said ""surely"" Obama can find a way to cut 2%-3% from a $3.5 trillion budget. ""Rather than issuing last-minute press releases on cuts to first responders or troop training or airport security, he should propose smarter ways to cut Washington spending,"" McConnell said.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on CNN's State of the Union that Obama needs to speak directly to congressional Republicans about avoiding the sequestration. ""The president should be calling us over somewhere -- Camp David, the White House, somewhere -- and sitting down and trying to avert these cuts,"" McCain said.

Obama and aides said debt reduction should be ""balanced"" between program cuts and tax revenues because middle-class Americans should not bear all the burden of reducing a national debt that exceeds $16 trillion. White House officials said Obama is willing to work with Republicans, but Republicans have shown no desire to give up tax breaks benefiting the wealthy.

""The Republicans are making a policy choice,"" said White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer.

In his weekly Saturday radio address, Obama said the cuts will slow the economy, eliminate jobs and ""leave many families who are already stretched to the limit scrambling to figure out what to do.""

Obama also pledged to work with Republicans on an alternative, and aides said he would do that right up until Friday's deadline.

""The president is an eternal optimist,"" Pfeiffer said."

http://news.yahoo.com/official-congress-hits-time-low-polls-112211763.html,,[],It’s official: Congress hits all-time low in the polls,"Amid weeks of reports about slumping polling data, the last major polling group that didn’t say Congress was at an all-time low in popularity confirms what we all know: Congress is in a slump.

The Gallup organization is the granddaddy of political pollsters, and even during the government shutdown, its approval ratings for the House and Senate stayed at about their historic low of 10 percent. That number was hit twice during 2012.

But in data released on Tuesday, only 9 percent of Americans approved of Congress in a Gallup survey taken last week. It is the first time that the Gallup congressional approval rating has hit single digits in the 39 years that Gallup has been asking the question.

And in a rare act of consensus, folks of all political stripes seem to agree with their opinions of Capitol Hill.

“Public displeasure with Congress is equally rampant across political groups, with Republicans (9%), independents (8%), and Democrats (10%) giving the institution similarly low approval ratings,” said Gallup.

Gallup is one of the last polling groups to show an all-time low popularity rating for Congress since the shutdown and debt ceiling crisis hit the headlines.

In September, CNN said its congressional approval rating hit 10 percent in a poll that dates back decades. Another poll from Harris Interactive put the approval rating at 7 percent.

An October poll from the Associated Press and GFK put the congressional approval rating at a rock-bottom 5 percent.

The Washington Post/ABC News poll in October had the approval rating of 12 percent, the lowest in that poll during the past 25 years.

And a late October survey from CBS News and the New York Times put the congressional approval rating at 9 percent—the lowest number in that poll since the question was first asked in 1977.

Other polling firms have equally dismal numbers for Congress. Rasmussen Reports has the approval rating at 7 percent, as of early November, which is the lowest number in the seven years the group has asked that question.

Story continues

And in a late October NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 63 percent of voters said they want to replace their own member of Congress, the highest percentage on record since that question was first asked in 1992.

In a similar trend, in a Pew survey about 74 percent of Americans wanted to see most members of Congress defeated if they ran for re-election. That is a record in the survey for data gathered back to 1990 about midterm elections. (The previous record was 57 percent in 1996.)

Republican Del. Richard L. Anderson’s turf includes Prince William County’s Coles District, a political bellwether in Virginia. Voters there aren’t happy. In interviews with more than 40 of them, only one expressed enthusiasm for either major-party candidate for governor.

Rich Anderson knocks on doors seven days a week, for at least two hours a day. He’s not selling anything. He’s listening.

After 30 years in the Air Force, he’s used to straight talk. But what Anderson, a Republican who represents 80,000 residents of Prince William County in the Virginia legislature, is hearing these days is blunt to the max.

Knock-knock: “I’m fed up with all of you,” says Tony Smathers, a retired research physicist at the Naval Research Lab.

Knock-knock: “It must really suck to be a Republican right now,” says a federal worker who, truth be told, is a Republican herself.

Knock-knock: “Lifelong Republican,” says the woman at the door, a senior executive in the military. “I’m sorry — I have to tell you, I’m not apt to vote for anyone in my own party this year. Can’t do it.”

These voters will help choose a new governor in two weeks, and they are gearing up to send a message about the most recent horror show in Washington.

At many doors, voters tell Anderson that they plan to hold his party and its candidate for governor, Ken Cuccinelli II, to account for the D.C. follies. Anderson winces and explains that Virginia does business differently from the jokers in Washington. Things get done, budgets get balanced, opponents work together.

At some doors, there’s a grudging nod, maybe even a thin smile. But at many, this genial state delegate is the convenient guy to vent at.

Thirty-five miles from downtown Washington, Richard L. Anderson’s turf includes Virginia’s most reliable political barometer, the ultimate bellwether: the Coles Magisterial District, which happens to have voted right — that is, for the winning candidate, no matter his party or philosophy — in a dozen statewide elections in a row. People here voted for Barack Obama, twice, for George W. Bush, twice, for gubernatorial candidates Robert F. McDonnell, Timothy M. Kaine, Mark R. Warner and James S. Gilmore II, and for Senate candidates Kaine, James Webb, Mark Warner and John W. Warner — winners all.

So the men who want to be governor — Cuccinelli, the state attorney general, and his opponent, Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman — need to know: What are they thinking in Coles?

Answer: They do not like you. They cannot stand you. They want you to go away.

In interviews with more than 40 voters in Prince William’s Coles District, one — one — expressed actual enthusiasm for either candidate.

View Graphic An analysis of previous Virginia governor elections

Coles voters are people of all walks, living in all kinds of settings. Prince William is part winding rural byways, part densely packed townhouse clusters, part cookie-cutter estate homes in developments that haven’t made it onto the road maps quite yet.

As more northerners, Asians, Hispanics and blacks have moved into new developments in Coles, the pattern of picking winners has persisted, a reflection of Virginia’s overall shift toward a more ethnically and politically diverse electorate. That change, which has turned a solidly Republican state into one with two Democrats in the U.S. Senate and two Democrats among the last three governors, is poised to alter the political lineup in Richmond, with Democrats in strong contention in all three statewide races this year.

(Coles is the northeast fringe of a vast congressional district represented by Rob Wittman, a conservative Republican from a tiny town 85 miles away.)

What unites Coles residents now is not any passion for particular candidates, but rather their desire to send a message that the elected representatives in Washington do not represent them. In their lives, you actually do the job you were hired to do.

There are no signs for Cuccinelli or McAuliffe in the Hunters Ridge development off the Prince William Parkway; the homeowners association doesn’t allow political signs in front of its 225 houses on large lots. But Delton Nichols, who has lived in Hunters Ridge for 14 years and spends two to three hours a day commuting to and from his federal job in the District, says there wouldn’t be many campaign signs on lawns even if they were permitted.

“People live here for a reason,” he says. (His house is adjacent to a stretch of thick forest; a sign at the curb says, “This Street May Be Extended in the Future.”) “You have a little more elbowroom, you work hard. The people here are informed and follow the issues. They’re people who believe we have to do all things in moderation. And then I look at this campaign, and I see one candidate far on the right and one on the left, and I don’t hear anyone excited about either of them. We’ve lost our way. Where is the moral courage? All this bickering is a waste of time.”

Nichols plans to vote for McAuliffe, largely because “I don’t like the hard line that Cuccinelli takes on those social issues. I’m a Christian, but God allows people the freedom to do things that maybe I don’t do. I agree that all life is sacred, but life is complicated.”

Similar conversations have taken place among Sheila Mitchell and her neighbors a couple of developments over from Nichols. Mitchell doesn’t work for the government anymore, but she spent nine years in the Air Force before starting a business that helps veterans navigate the benefits thicket. Many of her friends and neighbors, like a substantial portion of the Prince William workforce, have government connections, and she watched their struggles in recent weeks as they were told that because politicians couldn’t get along, they couldn’t work.

“We will vote, but we will cringe,” Mitchell says after discussing the election with her neighbors. “We’re looking at the governor’s race, and we’re going, ‘Yuck! What? Those are the choices?’ ”

Four years ago, when McAuliffe first ran for governor, Mitchell looked him over. “I thought, ‘God, he doesn’t look like you can trust him,’ ” she says. “Since then, research has shown I don’t think I can trust him. But then I look at Cuccinelli, and it’s, ‘Gosh, you don’t like women much, do you?’ ”

Mitchell is appalled by the Republican’s rhetoric on abortion and his proposal a few years ago to define “personhood” as beginning at the moment of fertilization, an approach that medical groups said could have limited women’s access to contraception.

All of that has Mitchell “leaning more toward McAuliffe but still juggling,” she says.

Both Nichols and Mitchell say they don’t define themselves by party, and both are avid supporters of their county supervisor, Martin E. Nohe, a Republican who has held the Coles District seat for a decade.

“We’re a true microcosm,” says Nohe, who runs a family-owned appliance store in Woodbridge. “I live in a nice, middle-class, older neighborhood, just down the street from a development I’ll never be able to afford. But the issues are all the same. We probably differ on the Affordable Care Act and whether we should fight in Syria, but on the things people really care about — reducing class size, protecting open space and the number one issue, how can we get our commutes shorter — we’re pretty much on the same page.”

Nohe has a Cuccinelli sign in his yard, but he shares his neighbors’ frustration that “on the bread-and-butter issues that people here care about, we haven’t heard much from the gubernatorial candidates.” Instead, what voters hear is attack ads from both sides about personal ethics and social issues.

Although Nohe shares Cuccinelli’s antiabortion position, the county supervisor notes that “no one is going to be persuaded based on social issues. People have their beliefs, and the candidates just use social issues to drive out their base.”

The one voter who expressed enthusiasm for either candidate was Desi Arnaiz — yes, his real name — who owns a small security and computer installation business. He and his wife live in Buckhall, a still-rural area where geese rest on wide fields, horses graze beneath white oaks and pickups sport bumper stickers that say, “I Don’t Believe the Liberal Media!” and “I Love Being a Bible Thumper!”

“We’re still mostly Republican where we are, because we’re in a pretty heavily protected area,” Arnaiz says. “We all have well water, and we all have septic tanks, and that protects us from development, and it separates the Republicans from the Democrats. The Democrats want government water and government sewage. We like it the way it is.”

Arnaiz, who is 76 and spent 25 years in the Air Force, likes Cuccinelli because “Ken’s very heavy up on pro-life, and where we are is heavily Catholic. Abortion, free love and same-sex marriage don’t sell well to us. McAuliffe is a frickin’ loser and a carpetbagger. Nobody here likes to be taxed. Nobody here likes to be pushed around.”

Although Arnaiz believes that Cuccinelli will prevail in Coles and across the state, he nonetheless agrees with neighbors of different ideologies that the issue that will decide the election is jobs. “My employees could care less about Syria,” Arnaiz says. “They’re interested in one thing: Do I have a job, and can I buy stuff?”

As Anderson moved from door to door, reminding constituents that he, too, is on next month’s ballot — running against Democrat R. Reed Heddleston, a financial consultant and retired Air Force colonel — he did hear about the economy. But mostly people wanted to talk about the dysfunction in Washington.

At Tony Smathers’s door, Anderson hears an earful about the shutdown and about Cuccinelli’s criticism of a University of Virginia professor’s research on global warming. “I don’t really know or care much about McAuliffe,” Smathers says. “I just don’t want Cuccinelli — strongly.”

Anderson replies: “This is a moderate district, and I’m a moderate guy. I believe when the majority has spoken, the issue is settled. We’ve got to find a civil way forward.”

Smathers isn’t hearing it. “You’re still one of them,” he says."

Republicans are defending 13 seats, Democrats 20. But the seats the GOP is defending are nearly all in their territory: ID, WY, NE, KS, OK, TX, AL, MI, GA, SC, TN, and KY. Only Maine is being defended on Blue territory.

Meanwhile, Democrats must defend tough seats in (among other places) AK, CO, MT, SD, IA, AR, LA, NC, WV, and NH—either Red or swing states.

Democratic pickup opportunities are currently severely limited. Maine is obviously top of the list, but only if Susan Collins follows her former colleague Olympia Snowe into retirement. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is surprisingly unpopular in Kentucky, providing an outside chance of a race. American Crossroads is clearly spooked at a Ashley Judd candidacy, already hitting her with this web ad. And then there's the open seat in Georgia, a state that is demographically moving in our direction. The threat of a teabagger challenge chased Saxby Chambliss into retirement, giving us the best chance to replicate Indiana next year.

Republican prospects are much rosier, even if ""rosy"" is relative when it comes to the modern broken GOP (remember, things were pretty darn rosy for Republicans in 2012, and they still ended up losing two net seats to the Democrats).

Mark Begich in Alaska is holding his own in the early polling, but it'll be close. Mark Pryor in Arkansas, Tim Johnson in South Dakota, Mary Landrieu in Louisiana, and Kay Hagan in North Carolina should all face serious and difficult reelection bids. Democratic retirements in Iowa and West Virginia will also be tough holds. Slot in Colorado and New Hampshire as GOP longshots, but they're on the map. Finally, Montana Democrats have been able to buck their state's Red lean during Senate races, and Max Baucus would have the slight edge, though Brian Schweitzer could lock it down (whether via primary challenge, or after a Baucus retirement).

What that all means is that Republicans are well within reach of the six seats they would need to control the Senate. The math makes that obvious. If there's a silver lining here, it's that the Red-state Dems on that list don't have to run with President Barack Obama at the top of the ticket, and won't have to contend with presidential-year turnout which would undoubtedly hurt most of them.

2016



But here's where it gets good. First of all, if a Democrat survived 2010 they can survive anything. That means their seats in CA, CO, CT, HI, MD, NV, NY, OR, VT, and WA are all safe. There's not a good GOP opportunity in that lot, even if retirements were to take place (and none are expected at this time).

Republicans, on the other hand, have to defend (in addition to their safe seats) FL, IL, IA, NH, NC, OH, PA, and WI. Furthermore, AZ, GA, and MO could be competitive if there were retirements, scandal, or teabagger primary victories.

Yes, Marco Rubio is the darling of the GOP and media establishments, but his Florida numbers are average at best. And in any case, he may be on the presidential ticket anyway. Mark Kirk in Illinois is toast. Iowa's Chuck Grassley will be 83 on Election Day 2016. Republicans are praying he doesn't retire.

As long as base turnout doesn't plummet, a la 2010, New Hampshire freshman GOPer Kelly Ayotte will face a tough re-election battle. North Carolina's Richard Burr is a longshot, but still on the map.

But the most fun will be teabagger troika in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, particularly in a presidential year when base turnout will be maximized: Scuttlebutt out of Wisconsin is that Russ Feingold wants a rematch against the joker Ron Johnson representing his state in the Senate. Pat Toomey won the Keystone State by just two points in a year when the Democratic base sat out. And while Rob Portman won his seat convincingly in the Buckeye State, again it was with depressed Democratic turnout.

Put Hillary Clinton on our presidential ticket, and you might even see Republican-held seats in Arkansas and Kentucky under pressure. And finally, Alaska presents an interesting scenario: Lisa Murkowski already lost a Republican primary and won election as a write-in independent. She would likely face a similar situation in 2016, and against another split field, a Democrat might be able to succeed (or push Murkowski out of the GOP).

Obviously, 2016 is a long way away, and much can and will happen before then. But no matter how bleak 2014 looks for us on paper, just remember that 2016 will be our reward for holding strong and limiting GOP gains next year."

The left wants to bruise GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell in a 2014 primary and make it easier for a Democrat to win his seat. The Tea Party wants to replace McConnell with one of their own.

It looks like Democrats are taking a page out of Sen. Mitch McConnell’s playbook.

The Republican Senate Minority Leader once said that his single most important goal was to make President Obama a one-term president. All GOP politicking, McConnell implied, would be aimed not at governing, but at ensuring the president didn’t win re-election. And now, Kentucky liberals seem as single-minded in their focus on beating McConnell, going so far as to work with Tea Party groups to succeed in their 2014 quest.

The strategy is simple. The left wants to bruise McConnell in the primaries and make it easier for a Democrat to win in the general election. The Tea Party wants to nominate one of their own members and catapult their nominee to Capitol Hill.

Shawn Reilly, executive director of liberal political action committee Progress Kentucky, told MSNBC.com that his group has been reaching out to Tea Party leaders in the state to see how they can work together. That includes the possibility of paying to run advertisements for Tea Party-backed candidates. (According to federal rules, the PACs can’t directly donate to the candidate.) And liberals are also planning to hold joint protests with Tea Partiers at McConnell events in the state to “make sure he knows the people of Kentucky are united against him.”

“We’re reaching out to Tea Party groups for support on issues where we can agree on,” he said.

And those issues are clear: Mitch McConnell must go.

Sarah Durand, president of the Louisville Tea Party, told MSNBC.com that one liberal organization offered to shell out up to $1 million to her group help defeat McConnell. Other Democratic donors and fundraisers—both in and out of the state—have also reached out with offers of monetary support.

Durand understands, of course, that liberals are “salivating” over the idea of helping a far-out conservative win a primary against McConnell, potentially allowing Dems to face off against someone like failed candidates Todd Akin or Richard Mourdock in the general election.

John T. Kemper, head of the United Kentucky Tea Party, also told MSNBC.com that he has received from Democrats who want to donate to one of the grassroots movement’s candidates.

“We have talked to some Democrats that would obviously like to see him go,” said Kemper.

Indeed, McConnell seems to be in trouble. According to a new Courier-Journal Bluegrass poll, just 17% of voters say they’ll cast their ballots for him in 2014. That includes only 34% of Republicans. Meanwhile, 34% of voters are against him, 44% are waiting to see who is running against him, and 6% haven’t made up their minds.

So far, no Republicans have announced that they would run against McConnell, who has the backing of Tea Party favorite Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.

McConnell, perhaps worried about his re-election, has tried to shore up support from the far right, recently warning supporters that “gun grabbers” on Capitol Hill are trying to do away with the Second Amendment and has been giving props to Paul.

Durand said there’s legitimate concerns that that the Tea Party might go as far as to vote Democratic if McConnell is the Republican nominee.

“A lot of people say the Tea Party would never vote Democrat. It’s really not true,” she said, adding if McConnell’s the nominee, members of her party will likely vote for another party “or just stay at home.”"

Here in the Dutch Reformed country of West Michigan, long a bastion of mainstream, mannerly conservatism, voters in 2010 handed the House seat once held by Gerald R. Ford to Justin Amash, a 33-year-old revolutionary and heir to the libertarian mantle of former congressman Ron Paul (R-Tex.). Amash was part of an attempted coup against House Speaker John A. Boehner (R- Ohio) and is a leader of the House tea party faction that helped force a government shutdown last week.

But within Grand Rapids’ powerful business establishment, patience is running low with Amash’s ideological agenda and tactics. Some business leaders are recruiting a Republican primary challenger who they hope will serve the old-fashioned way — by working the inside game and playing nice to gain influence and solve problems for the district. They are tired of tea party governance, as exemplified by the budget fight that led to the shutdown and threatens a first-ever U.S. credit default.

Similar efforts are underway in at least three other districts — one in the moneyed Detroit suburbs and the others in North Carolina and Tennessee — where business leaders are backing primary campaigns against Republican congressmen who have alienated party leaders. The races mark a notable shift in a party in which most primary challenges in recent years have come from the right.

“It’s a new dynamic, and we don’t know how far it’s going to go,” said Vin Weber, a former GOP congressman who is close to the House leadership. “All the energy in the Republican Party the last few years has come from the tea party.

But any move to take out a tea-party-aligned congressman in a Republican primary would be challenging, especially here in Michigan’s 3rd District, where grass-roots conservatives hold considerable sway. In the 2012 presidential primary, former senator Rick Santorum beat the eventual Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, in this culturally conservative district, even though Romney carried the state.

Some prominent business leaders are lining up behind investment manager Brian Ellis, according to several GOP operatives here. Ellis declined to grant an interview but wrote in an e-mail: “I am taking a hard look at running in the Republican primary” and “will make up my mind in the near future.”

State Sen. Mark C. Jansen, seen as a pragmatic Republican, also is weighing a challenge to Amash, said Deb Drick, his chief of staff. “We get frequent calls from people encouraging Senator Jansen to run,” Drick said. “There’s got to be a reason he’s being approached so much.”

Meg Goebel, president of the Paul Goebel Group, an insurance agency, said she is “really, really unhappy” with the leading role Amash has played in tying the health-care law to overall government funding.

“I don’t see him as a collaborator, and I think that’s a huge problem,” Goebel, a former chair of the Grand Rapids Chamber of Commerce, said. “People used to say, ‘I don’t like the Congress, but I like my congressman.’ I don’t think that’s the case anymore.”

There are similar sentiments 140 miles east in the tony Detroit suburbs of Oakland County, where businessman David Trott is waging a well-funded primary campaign to defeat Rep. Kerry Bentivolio (R), a former high school teacher and reindeer rancher now dubbed by fellow Republicans the “accidental congressman.”

After longtime Rep. Thaddeus McCotter’s reelection bid collapsed in 2012, Bentivolio was the only Republican on the ballot — and, in the GOP-leaning 11th District, he won.

Although Bentivolio aligns with tea party conservatives, he has not been as much of a thorn in the side of House leadership as Amash has; Boehner hosted a fundraiser for Bentivolio in the summer. But Bentivolio is struggling to prepare for reelection and has just $42,000 in cash on hand, according to campaign finance records. His spokesman did not respond to several requests for comment.

Trott, a longtime party donor and fixture, announced last week that he had raised $425,000 in the 26 days since launching his campaign. But Trott’s campaign is sensitive to any suggestion that he represents the establishment taking on the tea party. “This is not some establishment creation,” said Stu Sandler, Trott’s general consultant.

In Tennessee, tea-party-aligned Rep. Scott DesJarlais faces a GOP primary challenge from state Sen. Jim Tracy, who has won over donors and other supporters who abandoned DesJarlais after a series of personal scandals. In DesJarlais’s divorce records, released too late in the 2012 campaign to impact the result, the congressman revealed that he had multiple affairs with co-workers and patients while he was chief of staff at a hospital and that he counseled a mistress and his wife to get abortions.

In coastal North Carolina, Taylor Griffin, a former aide to George W. Bush who has backing from the Washington establishment, launched a primary challenge last week against Rep. Walter B. Jones, an outspoken iconoclast who has repeatedly antagonized Boehner.

Former Ohio congressman Steven C. LaTourette, who runs the Main Street Partnership, a group that helps promote moderate Republicans, said there is no coordinated effort to mount primary challenges to tea party allies.

“It’s people popping up organically in these districts,” LaTourette said. “The traditional governing wing of the Republican Party is fed up with this dysfunction, this ‘no’ to everything, this refusal to engage the other side to find solutions.”

Here in Amash’s Grand Rapids district, several well-known executives who are said to have promised their support to Ellis did not respond to requests for interviews. But Katie Packer Gage, a former senior aide to Romney and a Michigan GOP operative, said, “The business community in Grand Rapids has been completely disenchanted with Amash.”

LaTourette said some Wall Street donors called him after reading reports of a possible primary challenge to Amash and said they were “ready to go.” LaTourette noted that, before Amash, the district was represented by moderate Republican Vernon J. Ehlers, a former nuclear physicist. “It’s not bad ground for the center-right of the party, the governing wing of the party, to stake out its claim,” he said.

But the business establishment here is hardly united against Amash. One of the biggest names in this city, Douglas L. DeVos, president of Amway and son of the multinational corporation’s founder, is actively supporting the congressman’s reelection.

DeVos recently wrote a letter to Michigan business leaders urging them to give the maximum $5,200 to Amash right away. The donations, DeVos wrote, would help Amash avoid an “unnecessary and expensive challenge.” In the most recent filing, Amash had just $164,000 in his campaign account.

“I know all the power brokers here in town, and some people might consider me one,” said Dave Mehney, an Amash supporter and chief executive of Skytron, a medical equipment manufacturer. “They can put all the money they want into it and find somebody to run, but they won’t beat Justin because he’s got the grass roots.”

In 2012, Amash faced no primary opponent and won the general election 53 percent to 44 percent. His spokesman, Will Adams, said that Amash is regarded as “a principled conservative who gets things done” and that his high-profile stance this summer against the National Security Administration’s surveillance programs has been especially popular.

“We’re not worried,” Adams said.

Amash declined an interview request. “Because I do not fit neatly in the Republican box, some establishment Republicans and pundits think I am extreme,” Amash told Washington Post columnist George Will this year. But, he added, “I am moderate,” because “the point of the Constitution is to moderate the government.”

DeVos, who is neighbors with Amash’s parents and has known the congressman since his childhood, said in an interview that he is “developing very strongly.”

“You’ve always got to stand on principles,” DeVos said. “Without that, how can you ever negotiate or talk to people about anything?”"

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/09/Sen-Sessions-Jack-Lew-Must-Never-Be-Secretary-of-Treasury,2013-01-09 00:00:00,['Wynton Hall'],Sen. Sessions: 'Jack Lew Must Never Be Secretary of Treasury',"On Wednesday, the Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee Jeff Sessions (R-AL) said he plans to vigorously oppose President Barack Obama’s Treasury Secretary nominee Jack Lew.

“Jack Lew must never be Secretary of Treasury,” said Mr. Sessions in a statement. “His testimony before the Senate Budget Committee less than two years ago was so outrageous and false that it alone disqualifies.”

On Feb. 13, 2011, Mr. Lew appeared on CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley and said of Mr. Obama’s proposed budget:

Our budget will get us, over the next several years, to the point where we can look the American people in the eye and say we’re not adding to the debt anymore; we’re spending money that we have each year, and then we can work on bringing down our national debt.

During Senate testimony, Mr. Sessions blasted Mr. Lew’s false statement and said he was “flatly in error”:

Lew, who is a former director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has at times displayed a striking level of ignorance over how the budgetary process operates.

During the Crowley interview, Mr. Lew said that the reason Mr. Obama has failed to pass a budget in the Senate is because such bills can be filibustered. But as anyone familiar with the process knows, budgets are considered “privileged,” meaning they do not require a filibuster-proof majority 60 votes and can instead be passed with a simple majority.

Mr. Lew repeated the elementary error to NBC’s David Gregory. “One of the things about the United States Senate that I think the American people don’t realize,” said Mr. Lew confidently, “is that it takes 60 votes, not 50, to pass something.”

One would think the former head of OMB–the nation’s top budget post–would know how the budget process works. But apparently Mr. Lew does not.

Now, Mr. Lew has been nominated to become Treasury Secretary of the United States in the worst economy since the Great Depression. That, says Mr. Sessions, cannot happen:

It’s time for a Secretary of Treasury to look the American people in the eye and lay out an economic plan for America that will end our debt path that has endangered our future and which will find support among the American people and the world’s financial community. Far from being a positive force towards this essential good, Mr. Lew has given priority to the political interests of the President, in whose White House inner circle he has now served for several years. At this time of unprecedented slow growth, high unemployment, and huge deficits, we need a Secretary of Treasury that the American people, the Congress, and the world will know is up to the task of getting America on the path to prosperity not the path to decline. Jack Lew is not that man.

Questions have also emerged over a $950,000 bonus Mr. Lew received in 2009 in his role as chief operating officer of Citigroup’s Alternative Investments unit–a group that bet billions against homeowners paying their mortgages. Mr. Obama has previously railed against “obscene” Wall Street bonuses wherein “fat cats” get “awarded for their failure.” Still, Mr. Lew took the money.

In a letter to Mr. Lew, Sen. Chuck Grassley asked, “How is it in the public’s interest for you to receive a $1 million bonus on the eve of a massive $301 billion commitment to rescue Citigroup?”

Mr. Lew’s response: “My position at Citi was a management position. I was not an investment adviser. My compensation was in line with other management executives at the firm and in similarly complex operations.”

It is presently unknown whether Mr. Sessions plans to filibuster the Jack Lew nomination."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-cory-booker-ad-145955582.html,,[],Obama appears in campaign ad for Cory Booker,"With just two days left in the race and his lead in the polls shrinking, New Jersey Senate hopeful Cory Booker released a short campaign ad featuring a high-profile supporter: President Barack Obama.



""On Wednesday, voters in New Jersey have the opportunity to vote for a leader with uncommon character, Cory Booker,"" President Obama says in the one-minute ad endorsing the Newark mayor for U.S. Senate. ""New Jersey also has an opportunity to send a message to the entire country about what kind of leadership we expect from our representatives in Congress. We're better than the shutdown politics we've seen in Washington.""



The release of the ad comes two days after former Alaskan governor and tea party favorite Sarah Palin appeared at a rally in New Jersey to stump for Steve Lonegan, Booker's opponent in Wednesday's special election to fill the seat vacated by Sen. Frank Lautenberg's death in June.



A poll released last week by Quinnipiac University showed Booker's lead over Lonegan — which was 28 points in August — had been cut to 12 points. And according to a poll released Monday by Monmouth University, Booker's lead is down to 10.



Booker, Obama says, ""has spent his entire life bringing people with different perspectives together, regardless of party, to take on tough challenges. Take it from me: Now more than ever before, that's the kind of leader we need in the Senate.""



The Newark mayor was one of Obama's earliest supporters. But during the 2012 presidential election, Booker slammed an Obama campaign ad criticizing Mitt Romney's record as the head of Bain Capital and called for an end to ""nauseating"" attacks from both sides.



""I have to just say from a very personal level, I'm not about to sit here and indict private equity,"" Booker said. ""To me, it's just we're getting to a ridiculous point in America. Especially that I know I live in a state where pension funds, unions, and other people invest in companies like Bain Capital. If you look at the totality of Bain Capital's record, they've done a lot to support businesses, to grow businesses.""



Booker was forced to clarify his comments.



""I will fight hard for Obama to win,"" Booker wrote. ""But just as his '08 campaign did, I believe we must elevate [and] not denigrate. This is the Obama I know."""

President Obama and the Democrats have had, let’s face it, a bumpy few months. The debut of the Affordable Care Act was not quite the hair-pulling, garment-rending, world-historical disaster that some critics claim, but it was — and remains — messy enough to buff the shine on the GOP’s badly tarnished brand.

A CNN poll released Thursday found that 49 percent of those surveyed said they would prefer to be represented by a Republican in Congress, while 44 percent favored a Democrat. That’s not much of a margin, but it’s a big change from two months ago when 50 percent preferred a Democrat and just 42 percent preferred a Republican.

Such generic polls are of limited use in predicting what will happen in November. But the numbers do suggest that the GOP is back in the game. Voters appear willing to listen to what the party has to say.

If only the GOP had a message.

There is one proposition on which the party’s warring factions agree: “We don’t like Obama’s Affordable Care Act.” But there is a lack of consensus, to put it mildly, on how this visceral dislike of a president and his signature policy initiative should translate into concrete political action.

For Republicans — to invert a classic George W. Bush bon mot — Obamacare has somehow become a divider, not a uniter. In a year when the GOP may have a legitimate chance of capturing the Senate, several primary contests appear likely to devolve into bloody battles over Obama’s health-care reforms — not whether to oppose them, but how.

In Georgia, for example, one of the leading candidates to replace retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss is Rep. Jack Kingston. He has voted repeatedly — and fruitlessly — with his House Republican colleagues to defund the Affordable Care Act. But when he suggested recently that to “just step back and let this thing fall to pieces on its own” was not “the responsible thing to do,” opponents quickly attacked Kingston as some kind of quisling who was waving a flag of surrender.

In fact, Kingston was simply acknowledging reality. Obamacare is the law. Memories of the program’s incompetent launch will fade. Republicans are going to have to decide whether to collaborate in making the Affordable Care Act work better — or risk being seen as working against the nation’s best interests.

On a range of issues, this is the party’s essential dilemma. Ideologues want to continue the practice of massive, uncompromising resistance to anything Obama tries to accomplish. Pragmatists want the GOP to demonstrate that it can be reasonable and trustworthy, on the theory that voters want their government to function well and won’t put a bunch of anti-government extremists in charge of running it.

Keep in mind that despite the findings of that CNN poll, other surveys show the GOP still has a ton of work to do. A recent Wall Street Journal poll reported that 48 percent of respondents had “negative feelings” toward the Republican Party, as opposed to 39 percent who felt negatively toward the Democratic Party.

Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), took a giant step for pragmatism by negotiating a budget deal with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) — and the ideological wing of the party freaked out. House Speaker John Boehner, as rock-ribbed a Main Street conservative as you’ll ever meet, is routinely attacked on far-right Web sites as some kind of squishy moderate.

The question of how the GOP should proceed really should be a no-brainer. But after cynically taking advantage of the huge jolt of energy provided by tea party activists, the Republican establishment is finding that these true believers don’t necessarily listen when they’re told to go sit in a corner and shut up.

The no-compromises GOP base is fertile fundraising territory for potential presidential candidates, such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, and for pressure groups such as Heritage Action and the Club for Growth. So these provocateurs can be counted on to keep far-right anger and resentment at a rolling boil — and resist the establishment’s attempt to lower the temperature.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is expected to spend up to $50 million to ensure that the Republican Party chooses no extremist “loser candidates” for Senate races. As Scott Reed, the chamber’s chief political strategist, told the Wall Street Journal: “That will be our mantra: No fools on our ticket.”

He suggested that the only way for Republicans to avoid the rules change was to acquiesce to straight up-or-down votes on Tuesday on seven nominees in question and stop filibustering executive nominations in the future.

“I love the Senate, but right now the Senate is broken and needs to be fixed,” he said.

Republicans expressed outrage at the proposal and promised to retaliate. But for a Senate that has increasingly found itself tied in procedural knots, the decisions at hand were potentially momentous. Republicans to the last minute were preparing offers of compromise, but Democratic leaders said they had the votes and the wherewithal to pull the trigger on the most significant change since the early 1970s in the way the Senate operates.

Although Mr. Reid insisted that the change was extremely narrow, it had the potential to be the beginning of the end of the filibuster — and to eliminate the need for supermajorities to get anything done in Congress’s upper chamber.

Mr. Reid’s position could be a bluff to gain leverage to force the nominees through. Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, both Republicans, were in negotiations with two Democrats, Carl Levin of Michigan and Max Baucus of Montana, to find a way out. But most senators said it was now up to Senators Reid and McConnell.

“I want a solution,” Mr. Baucus said. “That’s by far better for everyone, by far.”

After the meeting, Mr. McConnell offered Democrats up-or-down votes on all seven contested nominations in exchange for a promise to drop the rule-change threat. Mr. Reid demanded a pledge not to filibuster future nominations. Both sides balked, according to aides familiar with the exchange.

Signs earlier on Monday pointed to Mr. Reid exercising a version of what has come to be known as the “nuclear option” — meaning that rather than the 67 votes usually needed to change the Senate rules, Democrats would do so with a majority, a move that could, in the short run, eviscerate what comity is left in the chamber, and, in the longer term, fundamentally change the institution.

“It’s almost hard to measure the ramifications that would emanate from such an action,” said Olympia J. Snowe, a former Republican senator from Maine who helped head off an earlier showdown over judicial nominees. “Once you go down that path, you cannot know how this will reverberate on the institution for generations.”"

On Saturday, Palin and her Tea Party Express bus rolled into New Jersey to stump for Steve Lonegan, the Republican Senate candidate running against Newark Mayor Cory Booker in Wednesday's special election to fill the seat vacated by Sen. Frank Lautenburg's death in June.



A poll released last week by Quinnipiac University showed Booker's lead over Lonegan — which was 28 points in August — has been cut to 12. According to the New York Times, Lonegan, a former mayor of Bogota, N.J., has surged ""by framing the election as a referendum on Mr. Booker’s celebrity.""



“My opponent, Cory Booker, was anointed by Hollywood,"" Lonegan said. ""He was anointed by Oprah.""



Yet it was Lonegan who called on Palin's star power on Saturday.



More than 2,000 people turned out at a racetrack to see the former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential candidate praise the GOP's stance against Obama's Affordable Care Act and bash the closing of war memorials during the shutdown.



“But Michelle Obama’s really groovy ‘Let’s Move!’ video is still up and running, because you can’t be chubby,” Palin said. ""And our government thinks they can shut down our memorials that honor our vets? For shame.""



Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Texas Gov. Rick Perry have both campaigned for Lonegan, but their popularity pales in comparison to Palin, who has a combined 4.7 million followers on Facebook and Twitter. The last time Palin appeared at a Tea Party Express rally was in 2012.



“Something big is happening here,"" Palin said of Lonegan's surge. “The country knows it, the media knows it.”



At one point, Palin compared the legality of Obamacare to the Prohibition-era ban on alcohol. “I believe now you can get a beer with your famous New Jersey pizza,"" Palin said.



On Sunday, Palin appeared at the World War II and Lincoln Memorials with Sen. Ted Cruz in Washington, D.C., where she continued her rant against the White House.



""We're here to show that the size of America's heart for our veterans is immeasurable,"" Palin said. ""But look around. Barricades to shut down our memorials? Is this how a commander in chief expresses his gratitude? This 'shutdown' priority proves a shameful lack of respect.""

Palin then quoted former President Ronald Reagan.

""Ronald Reagan said, 'Some people live an entire lifetime wondering if they ever made a difference in the world,'"" she said. ""You vets need never ask that of yourselves. You made all the difference. Our war memorials remind us of the cost to keep us free. You paid the price. Rest now. We will pick up the mantle. We won't let you down. We now take up the fight for freedom."""

The GOP picked up 63 seats in the House and six in the Senate. And that was horrible. But the real damage was done at the state level, where they picked up 680 state legislative seats and 29 of the 50 governorships, including in key states such as Ohio, Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania. They also held absolute control in half the state legislatures.

Thus, Republicans were able to not just solidify their control of the House, where they maintain a 33-seat advantage despite losing the House popular vote by one point in 2012, but they locked in control of myriad state legislatures. And you can just scroll down this site to see the damage those wingnut legislatures are wreaking across the country. Thus, we can't allow a repeat of 2020. Republicans are on the wane. The only way they can retain power is via voter suppression or gerrymandering. We must deny them both those options.

As you can see with this map, most states still redistrict via state legislatures, subject to a governor's veto. We have found the last few cycles that when a state deadlocks on drawing boundaries, a fair map designed by judges ends up benefiting Democrats, and even if it doesn't, fair is fair. So gaining the ability to merely block a map is generally a net gain for us.

Winning back heavily gerrymandered state legislatures is not always impossible, but is far more difficult than merely winning back governorships. So how are races in 2014 relevant to 2020? It's all about the power of incumbency.

“Latino groups are intensifying get-out-the-vote efforts in the Virginia governor’s race against a national backdrop of a congressional struggle over immigration reform,” NBC News Latino reports. “The groups said Thursday immigration reform is a critical issue on which candidates will be measured by Latino voters in the race.

As the groups work to have a strong showing of Latino turnout in Tuesday’s race, pressure has intensified on House Republicans to move immigration reform legislation in the waning days of this congressional year. That has helped keep the issue in the forefront as the Virginia candidates head to Election Day and groups try to turn out Latino voters in the state, home to the 16th largest population of Hispanic-eligible voters.”

NBC Latino quotes the National Council of La Raza Action Fund’s executive director Matthew McClellan who said his group and others are organizing 75,000 phone calls on behalf of McAuliffe and conducting door-to-door get-out-the-vote efforts, running ads in Spanish-language media and sending direct mail to more than 27,000 homes. “The Latino community is tired of talk and demanding action,” McClellan said. “Saying the right thing is not enough and we will be looking for action after is over.”

Labor Council for Latin American Advancement executive director Hector Sanchez called on Hispanics who want comprehensive immigration reform to show up at the polls for McAuliffe. “It’s very important for everyone to turn out to the polls, to analyze where those candidates are and make sure those candidates are representing Latinos on issues that are critical for the community,” Sanchez said.

They are specifically pushing DREAM Act proposals, ones that would grant amnesty to young illegal immigrants who crossed the border or entered or stayed in the country illegally before they became adults. Ken Cuccinelli, the GOP candidate running against McAuliffe, opposes amnesty and DREAM Act proposals.

No matter the result, these leftwing groups and others are likely to try to extrapolate the election results in Virginia to fit their national agenda, as both House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA) and House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) are from the Commonwealth. Cantor and Goodlatte are key players in the immigration debate, and both thus far remain publicly open to attempts from House GOP leadership to go to a conference committee to negotiate with the Senate and its “Gang of Eight” immigration bill. Cantor and Goodlatte remain open to such efforts despite the fact that the Senate bill’s key GOP sponsor, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), has publicly come out against such efforts"

Bush On Legacy: 'There's No Need To Defend Myself',"Former President George W. Bush steered clear of any detailed reflection on his legacy during a recent interview with USA Today, saying that his actions over eight years in the White House largely speak for themselves.

""There's no need to defend myself,"" Bush said in an interview published over the weekend, in anticipation of an opening ceremony for his presidential library at Southern Methodist University. ""I did what I did and ultimately history will judge.""

In the 30-minute interview conducted before last week's Boston Marathon bombing, Bush also urged people not to forget ""the lessons of 9/11,"" saying that it was still evident that ""evil exists still in the form of people who murder innocent people to advance a point of view.""

Bush will be in Dallas on Thursday when the doors of his presidential library officially open, along with his father, George H.W. Bush; President Barack Obama; and every other living president. He's spoken repeatedly over the past month about the presidency that facility is meant to honor and has left the impression that he is content with focusing on being a new grandfather, golfing and painting, while avoiding public scrutiny over his decisions.

Speaking with the Dallas Morning News recently, Bush addressed his leadership on the Iraq War -- one of the most highly criticized chapters of his presidency -- saying that he was ""comfortable"" and ""confident the decisions were made the right way.""

USA Today also caught up with close friends and family of the former president, who said that Bush ""feels totally at peace"" with his record. Former Bush strategist Karl Rove said that he ""has an inner confidence ... that what he did was right.""

And while Bush and some of his closest allies suggest that there is nothing about his legacy that needs defending, other sources close to the former president have suggested that the $500 million presidential library is an attempt to patch up his scarred reputation.

A longtime Bush counselor told National Journal in a piece published Monday that the former president was ""confident"" he could improve his reputation.

“How else could he be?"" the counselor said. ""But he’s got a ways to go to mending his record -- if it can be done."""

On Tuesday, the Washington Examiner reported that unnamed “key Republican operatives” were eager to enlist Robertson to run in a special election for the seat being vacated by departing Rep. Rodney Alexander (R-La.). The congressman represents Louisiana’s 5th district, which includes Robertson’s hometown of West Monroe.

But in a visit later that afternoon to Fox News’ “The Five,” Robertson shot down the rumor, which, regardless of its veracity, has popped up at a convenient time: “Duck Dynasty” returns to A&E for a fourth season Wednesday at 10.

“I heard today that I was doing that,” he said, regarding the supposed plan to get him to enter the race. “Interesting. It’s news to me.”

“I’m kinda busy right now,” he added. “I’ve got a lot of stuff going on.”

When reached for comment by The Times, Alexander’s office would say only that the congressman, who has met both Robertson and his Uncle Si, is a fan of the series and is “proud of the positive attention” it has brought to Ouachita Parish.

While Robertson may not have his sights set on a D.C. career just yet, he did not shy away from talking politics during his appearance.

He expressed his hope that Republican Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal would run for president in 2016, calling him “my guy.”

This is not the first time Robertson’s name has been floated in connection with politics: As an avid hunter and gun owner, Robertson was reportedly under consideration earlier this year for the board of the National Rifle Assn.

On “The Five,” he expressed support for background checks -- a viewpoint that might displease some members of the powerful gun rights group.

“I have a lot of weapons, and every time I have to fill out the paperwork,” he said matter-of-factly.

When asked, Robertson also said he had been offended by then-presidential candidate Barack Obama’s 2008 remarks saying some Americans in depressed areas “cling to guns and religion” in lieu of economic opportunity.

Ultimately, though, Robertson seemed more interested in striking a bipartisan note than in waging a political fight, pointing to the far-reaching success of his own show -- the most popular program in the history of A&E and one of cable TV’s biggest hits -- as evidence that Americans can still agree on some things.

“I see people more together. I see ‘em liking ‘Duck Dynasty,’ so that brings the country together. It really does, ‘cause this show, it’s funny, it breaks through all the demographics,” he said.

Paul Ryan (R-WI) told the Des Moines Register in Iowa that he thinks the GOP should focus on going into minority communities to seek votes.

“Go into inner cities, go into minority communities,” Ryan said in an interview with the state paper. “Go into communities that have not seen or heard from Republicans in a long time.” Ryan was in Iowa on Saturday for a fundraiser and birthday event for the state’s GOP Gov. Terry Branstad.

Ryan and Romney lost the presidential election last year by failing to turn out the GOP base. As Byron York pointed out in the Washington Examiner in May of this year, six months after the election, the GOP duo would have needed to get 73 percent of the Hispanic vote to have won the election by solely focusing on Hispanics–when Republicans have not, at any point in history, been able to even break 45 percent of the Hispanic vote. George W. Bush got 44 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004, the highest a Republican has ever gotten in a nationwide election.

“In 2012, President Obama famously won 71 percent of the Hispanic vote to Mitt Romney’s 27 percent,” York wrote. “If all other factors remained the same, how large a percentage of the Hispanic vote would Romney have had to win to capture the White House? What if Romney had won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote, the high-water mark for Republicans achieved by George W. Bush in 2004? As it turns out, if Romney had hit that Bush mark, he still would have lost, with 240 electoral votes to 298 for Obama.”

York presented several other “unrealistic” scenarios, such as Romney and Ryan winning 50 percent or 70 percent of the Hispanic vote–only to show that the numbers prove if they were somehow miraculously able to pull off such a feat, they still would have lost the election. York noted that Romney and Ryan would have needed 73 percent of the Hispanic vote to beat Obama–if all the other numbers, such as the low GOP base turnout, stayed the same.

“The most serious of those problems was that Romney was not able to connect with white voters who were so turned off by the campaign that they abandoned the GOP and in many cases stayed away from the polls altogether,” York wrote. “Recent reports suggest as many as 5 million white voters simply stayed home on Election Day. If they had voted at the same rate they did in 2004, even with the demographic changes since then, Romney would have won. Likewise, the white vote is so large that an improvement of 4 points — going from 60 percent to 64 percent of those whites who did vote — would have won the race for Romney.”

Nonetheless, Ryan still believes somehow that pushing certain policies like amnesty that pander to the left will somehow win the GOP minority votes. Ryan is currently in the process of writing a bill that would legalize the status of America’s at least 11 million illegal aliens.

As part of his interview with the Des Moines Register, Ryan praised New Jersey GOP Gov. Chris Christie’s re-election as evidence that the GOP can win minority communities in blue states.

“Absolutely,” Ryan answered when asked by the local paper if lessons can be learned from Christie’s re-election in New Jersey. “It shows that we have to go and campaign in non-traditional areas, non-traditional neighborhoods, and by showing up not just a few months before the election, but by being in these communities all year round, that will make a difference.”

“What Chris’s victory shows is that conservatives can win blue states if we focus on being inclusive and campaigning in every facet of this country, we can open up the electoral map, far more than where it has been,” Ryan added.

As part of the interview, Ryan pushed harder than he has in a long time in public for amnesty as well. Ryan said, in the words of the Des Moines paper, that pushing for amnesty for illegal aliens is “crucial.”

“When we get to it [amnesty], it’s not extremely clear,” Ryan said. “But there are many of us who still would like to see it happen in a step-by-step process before the end of the year. But if that doesn’t occur, we’ll still keep moving for it because, again, the status quo is unacceptable.”

Ryan is at odds with the entire rest of the House GOP leadership–and the GOP base–when it comes to immigration legislation. House Minority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has publicly promised there will be no immigration legislation voted on in the House of Representatives for the rest of 2013, something Ryan does not agree with as evidenced by this interview he did with the Des Moines paper. McCarthy, House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), House Speaker John Boehner, House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and scores of other Republicans and conservatives have publicly come out in opposition to ever going to a conference committee with the Senate “Gang of Eight” immigration bill. Ryan is on record as being supportive of a conference committee, and refused to join the rest of House Republicans save for a few outliers who also support amnesty in denouncing any effort to save the Senate bill via conference after Speaker Boehner publicly promised last week there would never be a conference.

Ryan has taken a beating in polls for his support for amnesty. Ryan and Senate Gang of Eight GOP frontman Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)–who has since expressed regret for supporting the Senate bill and publicly opposed conference committee in a Breitbart News exclusive—combined for less than 10 percent of the total support from GOP base voters in the straw poll at the recent Values Voter Summit. Those GOP base voters are the same people who York noted did not show up to vote for Romney and Ryan at the polls last November–the real reason the GOP lost its shot to unseat incumbent President Barack Obama in November 2012."

USA TODAY

Both candidates say current Virginia governor should consider calls to resign

Democrat McAuliffe says Republican has radical agena

Republican Cuccinelli calls Democrat an influence peddler

HOT SPRINGS, Va. — Both Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli and Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe said the Virginia officeholder they are battling to succeed, Gov. Bob McDonnell, should consider calls to resign in the wake of federal and state investigations into his ethics.

But both tread carefully on the scandal that has shadowed their contest, declining to say that they personally believed he should resign. Cuccinelli said it wouldn't be appropriate for him as the state's sitting attorney general to make such a call, and McAuliffe said McDonnell ""shouldn't be tried in the newspapers.""

""He should consider it, but he knows the facts,"" McAuliffe said, adding, ""Let's not prejudge.""

Cuccinelli said: ""It is appropriate to ask him to think about it.""

At their first debate, the two men were wearing gray suits, starched white shirts and subdued ties, but they might as well have pulled on boxing gloves for a combative 90-minute encounter that signals the TV ads they will run and the attacks they are likely to make for the next three months of the campaign.

McAuliffe hammered Cuccinelli as a rigid right-wing ideologue with a radical agenda on social issues including abortion and homosexuality. Cuccinelli portrayed McAuliffe as an unprincipled influence peddler with no experience in state government.

The debate, held at the Omni Homestead resort in southwest Virginia, was moderated by Judy Woodruff of PBS' NewsHour and hosted by the Virginia Bar Association.

Nearly an hour had passed before McAuliffe raised the name of Jonnie Williams, businessman at the heart of the McDonnell scandal. Williams, the CEO of a nutritional supplement company called Star Scientific, gave $145,000 in gifts to McDonnell, his wife and sister. He also gave $18,000 in gifts to Cuccinelli.

""Instead of taking him to court, he was taking you to New York City,"" McAuliffe said to scattered laughter. ""He was buying you $1,500 turkey dinners. You know, that's a lot of turkey.""

Cuccinelli blasted McAuliffe for choosing to locate a manufacturing plant for his company, GreenTech Automotive, in Mississippi rather than Virginia. ""So you picked Mississippi. So run for governor of Mississippi,"" he said, adding, ""Terry isn't about principles or good policy. He's about deals, influence-peddling deals.""

Cuccinelli, who has gotten headlines as attorney general for his fervent opposition to abortion, said he wouldn't make that issue a priority as governor. ""I do not expect to use the political capital of the governor's office to be moving those pieces of legislation,"" he said.

When asked directly whether he continued to believe, as he once said, that homosexuality was ""against nature"" and ""harmful to society,"" Cuccinelli said, ""My personal beliefs about the personal challenge of homosexuality haven't changed."""

LOUISVILLE, Kentucky, Nov 20 (Reuters) - After a string of setbacks and losses, the insurgent Tea Party movement is at a crossroads, between learning to live within the Republican Party or pursuing its fight against those it sees as not conservative enough.

The choice is an easy one for Tea Party activists, who vow to keep up their campaign to vote out of office those Republican politicians they say have betrayed the tenets of the conservative cause - smaller government and less federal spending and taxes.

Voters nationally blame October's partial government shutdown on Republicans, and particularly the Tea Party, which lost elections earlier this month in Virginia and Alabama.

With important mid-term congressional elections coming in November 2014, the Tea Party is under pressure from within the Republican Party to call off their insurgency and focus on the end game of defeating Democrats, rather than bruising primaries to clobber Republicans, some of whom could be in close contests to keep their seats.

Republican strategist Ford O'Connell said the Tea Party movement needs to decide its long-term strategy.

""Are they interested in toppling Republicans or winning elections? If they don't win some elections they're probably going to die on the vine,"" O'Connell said.

A series of interviews with Tea Party activists preparing for 2014, mainly in southern states, produced a clear consensus of the path forward, with possibly unsettling implications for Republican incumbents.

While mainstream Republicans nationally see the crisis of President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul as their ticket to success next November, Tea Party activists see Republican leaders' decision to end the shutdown in October as a betrayal of the fight over healthcare reform, best met with primary challenges next spring.

""The Tea Party won the 2010 election for the Republicans,"" said Debbie Dooley of the Atlanta Tea Party. ""We took a back seat in 2012 and the Republicans lost. We're not going to make the same mistake in 2014.""

The national criticism of the movement is failing to change many minds in the movement, either.

""If we have to get hurt in the polls in order to save the country from financial ruin, so be it,"" said Ben Cunningham, a long-time conservative activist in Tennessee involved in efforts to find a challenger for Senator Lamar Alexander.

Tea Party-backed primary challengers are running in South Carolina against Senator Lindsey Graham, a frequent target of Tea Party ire for his ability to compromise, and Alexander in Tennessee. There are also right-wing challenges to Senator Pat Roberts in Kansas and Thad Cochran in Mississippi. The Senate seat in Georgia left open by the impending retirement of Saxby Chambliss has a field of candidates vying for the mantle of most conservative.

For many grassroots conservatives the main target is Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. McConnell is well known for vowing to make Obama a one-term president, but his record of brokering deals with Obama has incensed the Tea Party.

""There are many important races in 2014 that deserve attention,"" said David Adams, president of Kentucky Citizens Judicial, a group suing Kentucky's Democratic Governor Steve Beshear over the implementation of Obama's health care law. ""But in terms of taking off the head of the snake, Kentucky is it.""

In Kentucky and elsewhere, some of the Tea Party's challenges are perennial: they lack name recognition, the benefits of incumbency, and their rivals raise millions of dollars to their thousands.

What Tea Party activists have on their side is cheap get-out-the-vote technology, motivated volunteers, and enough past success to provide a roadmap for would-be candidates. In Kentucky, for instance, many Tea Partiers united early around a candidate, and started campaigning early, following the lead of Ted Cruz of Texas, who came from behind to win a U.S. Senate seat.

BACKING ONE HORSE

A national Quinnipiac University poll published Nov. 13 found 47 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view of the Tea Party, the highest percentage yet. Other national polls have also shown a drop in popularity for the movement.

But unlike the Republican Party's national structure, the Tea Party has become an increasingly regional phenomenon, at its strongest in Republican dominated states like Georgia or in a few battleground states like Ohio.

Of 80 Republican House members who wrote to John Boehner in August arguing the House Speaker should threaten a shutdown over the healthcare law known as Obamacare, 13 represent districts in Kentucky, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.

""There are parts of the country geographically and sociologically that continue to feed the Tea Party phenomenon,"" said James Henson, a politics professor at the University of Texas in Austin. ""I'd be surprised if recruitment wasn't up.""

While some senior Republicans in the U.S. Senate say House Republicans and senators Cruz and Mike Lee of Utah fought a useless, self-punishing fight over the government shutdown, conservatives say were close to victory undermining Obamacare when moderate Republicans undermined them.

The Tea Party also pins the narrow Nov. 5 defeat of conservative Ken Cuccinelli in Virginia's gubernatorial race on the refusal of the Republican establishment to back him.

The challenge is daunting in Kentucky, Tennessee and South Carolina where McConnell, Alexander and Graham all have a big advantage in raising money. McConnell, for instance, had $10 million cash on hand at the end of September. His opponent, moderately wealthy businessman Matt Bevin, had raised less than $900,000, more than two thirds of which was his own money.

McConnell had a 33 point lead over Bevin in one poll. The Senator has focused his campaign on Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes, with whom he was tied, according to polling.

Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia Center for Politics said it is hard to see the challengers in Kentucky, Tennessee or South Carolina being able to win, but that Cruz's long slog ahead of the Texas primary showed a challenge could develop late.

""The best you could say at the moment is the jury is out,"" he said.

INDIANA PLAYBOOK

Tea Party activists in Kentucky and Tennessee have carefully studied the playbook adopted by activists in Indiana in their successful bid to oust former Republican Senator Richard ""Dick"" Lugar in 2012. The key to primary victory involved getting behind a single challenger in state treasurer Richard Mourdock and going door to door for months ahead of the election -- well ahead of traditional campaigns.

Many Tea Party activists have rallied behind Bevin in Kentucky. Speaking at his home in Louisville in October, Bevin said he would have favored the government shutdown. McConnell's team says voters will favor politicians who get things done.

Bevin said his race against McConnell would be won ""from the bottom up"" by grassroots activists and compared his opponent to the emperor with no clothes, lacking real Republican values.

""If this naked emperor can be exposed, any one of them can be exposed. If we can do this at the ballot box, none of them are safe and we can send them home one at a time,"" he said, invoking other Tea Party challenges gearing up.

Activists are already going door to door for the primary election in May, using get-out-the-vote software provided free of charge by Kansas-based group the Madison Project, and Tea Partiers in Tennessee are using similar technology.

""The only energy in the Republican Party at the moment lies in the Tea Party,"" said Randy Keller of the Bowling Green Southern Kentucky Tea Party, a conclusion some political analysts reach as well.

""The lack of a ground game is a particular point of vulnerability for Republicans like Mitch McConnell,"" said Steven Schier, a politics professor at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. ""The question is can they compete at the ground level?""

BOON FOR DEMOCRATS?

With bruising primary contests likely in key states, one question is will the winner be able to win the general election.

In Indiana's primary last year, Mourdock beat Lugar but lost in the general election in a reliably Republican state.

In Kentucky's 2011 gubernatorial election, the candidate backed by Tea Party activists lost in a hard-fought primary, and many frustrated conservatives stayed home on election day, contributing to the re-election of Democrat Beshear.

The Bowling Green Southern Kentucky Tea Party's Keller is no fan of McConnell's but he worries that widespread dislike for McConnell among conservatives could favor the Democratic candidate on election day in 2014.

""I would really rather not see that happen because even a flawed Republican would be better than a Democrat,"" he said. (Editing by David Lindsey, Peter Henderson and Grant McCool)"

But the tech wizards at OFA forgot one important rule in today’s Internet world: Register all the iterations of your website address before someone else does.

Now Obama’s team is filing complaints against the folks smart enough to get the addresses before he did.

As Obama’s OFA made its debut, no one in his purportedly Internet-savvy campaign had obtained the corresponding .com, .net, .org or .us sites, nor did OFA register other names that are close to its official one, as is the sensible practice. In the case of the .net address, a fellow named Derek Bovard had already registered the .net address by the time Obama’s team took notice.

Bovard has routed his new site to the homepage of the National Rifle Association.

So, whenever anyone goes to www.organizingforaction.net they end up seeing the homepage of the NRA.

Naturally, Obama and his fellow community organizers were furious. So furious, in fact, that they have replied by filing complaints against Bovard–and, apparently, a variety of other people who had registered domain names that OFA now wants.

Obama’s group filed the complaints with the authority that governs website domain addresses, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The complaints were filed under Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) rules. Obama’s case number is 1483257 and was filed on Feb 6. UDRP cases are usually decided within one to two months after first filing.

Bovard told Breitbart that he feels he has a solid case that he owns the .net address fair, square, and legally.

“We have been granted ‘Service Mark’ #85838531 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the website as ‘Providing an on-line website featuring information on the United States Constitution and Conservative values’ and we were also the first to use it in ‘commerce.’ So I don’t believe they have any valid legal ground to stand on in regards to this website name. Before purchasing this site I had checked TESS (Trademark Electronic Search System) for any existing Trademarks or Service Marks and found none. I also searched for any existing companies called Organizing for Action and found none. So I bought it, legally.”

Bovard said he intends to use the site address to provide “information on the United States Constitution and Conservative values.”

“This site is going to be used strictly to discuss political views and ideas based on Conservative Values, the US Constitution, the Bill of Rights and Freedom of Speech in the USA which seems to be overlooked quite often. My partner and I are firm believers in not only the First and Second Amendment Rights, but in ALL Rights granted to us by our country, my country.”

Bovard also disputed several reports that he offered the address for sale to team Obama.

“I also want to make it perfectly clear that I have no intentions of selling this website name to Obama’s group nor did I purchase it with the intent of selling it to them or anyone else. It’s never been for sale, I’ve never solicited it for sale. I have indicated a personal opinion about it’s worth but that’s it.”

“We have taken what little action we could to contribute to the fight against anyone who attempts to defy or go against the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the rights contained within them. We are sickened by the mockery being made of our country and our government and then advertising this mess to our fellow citizens and the rest of the world,” Bovard said in an email."

http://news.yahoo.com/liz-cheney-challenge-enzi-echoes-gop-divisions-071228128.html,,[],Liz Cheney challenge to Enzi echoes GOP divisions,"CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — Liz Cheney says her GOP primary challenge to Wyoming's senior U.S. senator is about sending a ""new generation"" to Washington. But it has all the hallmarks of the same divisions that have roiled the Republican Party nationally for years.

While he's no moderate, incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi has shown he is willing to compromise occasionally with Democrats, such as when he supported a sales tax on Internet purchases.

But Cheney, the elder daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, suggests that such compromise often isn't good enough for a true conservative.

""I'm running because I'm concerned about the direction of the nation,"" Liz Cheney said Tuesday. ""I think it's time for us to say to ourselves, 'Can we continue to go along to get along in Washington?'""

Several Republicans senators elsewhere have faced tea party challengers questioning their conservative credentials. In Indiana, six-term Sen. Richard Lugar lost in a Republican primary last year to Richard Mourdock, who went on to lose to Democrat Joe Donnelly.

In Utah, tea party favorite Sen. Mike Lee ousted three-term incumbent Sen. Bob Bennett in 2010. And Sen. Orrin Hatch fended off a tea party challenger to win a seventh term last year.

The winner of Wyoming's Republican primary just over a year from now will be a heavy favorite to win the general election. Registered Republicans outnumber Democrats in Wyoming by a margin of more than 3 to 1.

Wyoming hasn't had a Democrat in its congressional delegation since 1979, the year Dick Cheney succeeded retiring Democratic Rep. Teno Roncalio to take the state's lone U.S. House seat.

Challenging any incumbent is a brazen move in Wyoming. At least until now, the state has shown considerable deference to those established in office.

Liz Cheney described herself as a tea party sympathizer. She called the movement favoring low taxes as a ""force for good in terms of getting people focused on fiscal issues.""

Liz Cheney, 46, is the older of Dick Cheney's two children, both daughters. Married with five children, she was a resident of Virginia until recently. She and her husband bought a home last year in the posh northwest Wyoming community of Jackson Hole.

Story continues

Asked why voters should oust Enzi, a powerful incumbent, in favor of a rookie, Liz Cheney said seniority isn't necessarily an attribute.

""I think that part of the problem in Washington today is seniority,"" she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. ""I think it's time for a new generation, for a new generation to come to the fore. I don't see seniority as a plus, frankly.""

Enzi announced he would seek re-election Tuesday, more than six months earlier in the political cycle than he has declared his bid in the past.

""Working behind the scenes — this is what I have been doing since I was elected, and this is what needs to be done,"" Enzi said by email through a spokesman.

He immediately won the endorsement of colleagues in the Senate, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

""Our support will be there for Mike,"" said the committee's chairman, Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas.

The other two members of Wyoming's congressional delegation, both Republicans, came out quickly in support of Enzi. Sen. John Barrasso and Rep. Cynthia Lummis praised Enzi for his long service and knowledge of Wyoming issues.

The race promises to be hard-fought. Enzi has had few serious Democratic challengers — much less Republican ones — since he was first elected to the Senate in 1996. He remains well-liked around the state as an affable former shoe salesman and mayor of the coal-mining city of Gillette.

Enzi, 69, takes pride in keeping a lower profile and remaining much less partisan than most of his colleagues. He often refers to his ""80-20"" rule — that opposing parties usually can agree on 80 percent of the details of any given issue — as a model for Republicans and Democrats to work together.

He handily won re-election in 2008 with more than 75 percent of the vote.

Liz Cheney's interest in the seat has been an open secret for months, dating at least to her purchase last year of a home in Wilson, a community in Jackson Hole, listed for $1.9 million.

She appeared onstage with her father at last year's state Republican Party convention. It was Dick Cheney's first public appearance since he underwent a heart transplant, and father and daughter have been working on a book together.

Since then, Liz Cheney has made frequent appearances at county-level GOP events in virtually every corner of the state. She also has been in the national public eye as a Fox News political commentator.

Wyoming political veteran Chris Rothfuss said Liz Cheney's candidacy might be a sign of the divisions that have roiled the national Republican Party for several years, with GOP officeholders being challenged from within their party if they are seen as too willing to compromise with Democrats.

Rothfuss, a Democratic state lawmaker who lost to Enzi in 2008, said Liz Cheney's challenge reflects ""everything that's wrong"" with partisanship in national politics.

""I would also say that the reason that Liz Cheney is running out of Wyoming rather than what in effect would be her home state of Virginia is because we're basically seen as a much cheaper option in trying to obtain a Senate seat,"" said Rothfuss, a chemical engineer.

But make no mistake, the Cheney family is well-established in Wyoming— an important qualification for anybody seeking major office in the state.

While Liz Cheney was born in Madison, Wis., her announcement pointed out that the Cheney family has roots that go back more than 100 years in Wyoming.

Liz Cheney holds a law degree from the University of Chicago and has worked as a lawyer for the State Department and the Agency for International Development.

Yet she said Wyoming always has been where her heart is.

""My sense is, as far the carpetbagger charge, is it's from people who don't want to talk about substance, don't want to talk about the issues,"" Liz Cheney said.

According to the survey -- conducted by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling on behalf of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Democracy For America -- Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky's Democratic secretary of state who officially entered the race on Tuesday, leads the longtime senator by one point, with 45 percent to McConnell's 44 percent. While her lead is within the margin of error, the poll also underscored some broader issues that McConnell is likely to face as he campaigns for a sixth term.

At 51 percent, a majority of Kentuckians say they disapprove of McConnell's job performance, while 40 percent approve and 9 percent are undecided. Those numbers are an improvement over an April PPP poll that showed him to be one of the least popular senators in the country, with a 36 percent job approval rating. His lagging numbers reinforce a longstanding problem that McConnell has had wrangling support for his reelection bid.

PPP surveyed 1,210 Kentucky voters for the first two questions, with a margin of error of 2.8 percent. PCCC reportedly plans to release additional findings from the survey at a press conference later on Thursday.

“It’s no surprise that Kentucky voters have had enough of Mitch McConnell’s partisan gridlock,” said Jonathan Hurst, senior adviser to Lundergan Grimes. “For thirty years, McConnell has been the embodiment of all that is wrong with Washington and has no problem turning his back on Kentucky’s middle class.”

""George Soros and the Obama Allies are up to their same old tricks,"" said McConnell campaign manager Jesse Benton. ""They have concocted another fictitious poll that has no basis in reality, held it for ten days, and released it at the perfect time in the news cycle to help their upstart liberal candidate. This poll has zero credibility and should be ignored out of hand.""

PPP's polling was lauded for its accuracy during the 2012 election cycle.

Previous polls by the firm, taken in April and May, before Lundergan Grimes officially kicked off her campaign, similarly suggested that the Democrat would be a viable threat to McConnell. A survey taken by Republican firm Wenzel Strategies last month had McConnell in better shape, leading Grimes 48 percent to 40 percent.

Potentially compounding matters for McConnell is the recent decision by Kentucky tea party activist and businessman Matt Bevin to challenge the five-term senator for the Republican nomination. Bevin was not included in the latest survey, though the Wenzel Strategies poll released in July suggested that McConnell had a strong lead over his challenger.

This article was updated to include comment from the McConnell campaign.

UPDATE: 7:23 p.m. ET -- A poll conducted by Grimes' campaign also showed the Democrat with a slight lead over McConnell, the Courier Journal reported Thursday. In that poll, Grimes led McConnell by two points.

The internal Grimes poll surveyed 750 Kentucky voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points."

Peter King, R-N.Y., walks towards the House Chamber on Capitol Hill, in Washington, Monday, Sept. 30, 2013.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)

Monday night's bicameral back and forth between the House GOP and the Senate ended in the way everyone saw coming: a shutdown of the federal government, owing to the House Republicans' refusal to simply send the Senate the ""clean"" continuing resolution that everyone knew would have ended the futile contretemps right then and there. As that didn't happen, reporters instead got to watch House Republicans smack a tennis ball into a brick wall, over and over again until everyone just hung it up for the night.

But there was a brief moment where everything threatened to actually get interesting.

I speak, of course, of Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), who is what passes for a ""moderate"" House Republican in this day and age. Days ago, King criticized the legislative meanderings of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and called Cruz a ""fraud,"" which ensured that King's office would spend the rest of the day fielding calls from Cruz's fanbase. Their comments featured ""vile, profane, obscene language,"" the likes of which King had never heard, and we remind you that he represents part of Long Island.

As a result, King went on ""Morning Joe"" and told their Zoo Crew, “I’m not saying Ted Cruz is responsible for all his supporters, but he has tapped into a dark strain here in the American political psyche here, and again, the most obscene, profane stuff you can imagine all from people who say they support the Constitution.""

So King was primed to be one of those ""mad as hell/not gonna take it anymore"" types as Monday's deliberations began, and as the sun set in the west, it looked for all the world like he was going to finally foment a revolt. As the National Review's Jonathan Strong reported Monday evening, ""Republican moderates have apparently had enough."" King wanted a ""clean"" continuing resolution, and he was going to damn well keep the rest of the GOP caucus from adding rules to the bill by leading a gang of moderate Republicans into the breach:

In what is by far their boldest stand since the GOP took control of the House in 2010, a group of them are threatening to bring down a vote on the rule for the government-funding bill scheduled for 6:30 p.m. New York representative Peter King is leading the charge, and his fellow New Yorker [Representative] Michael Grimm is close behind him. The group told leadership on Saturday they have 25 members who are willing to bring down the rule.

This was a significant rump, taking this ""boldest stand.""

As Politico reported, ""If no Democrats vote for the rule, [Speaker of the House John] Boehner can only lose 17 Republicans to sink the plan."" And so, the battle was joined, and as night fell across the District of Columbia, everyone who wanted the insanity to end turned their hopeful eyes to the vote count in the House. Would King bring 25 votes against dirtying up the continuing resolution?

As it turns out, King overestimated the number in his band of brothers by... you know, about 23 people:

The size of a bloc of GOP moderates ready to bring down a vote on the House floor over the government-funding bill shriveled from 25 lawmakers on Saturday to just two when the House voted just now to pass the rule. New York representative Peter King and Pennsylvania representative Charlie Dent, two key moderates, voted no, while four hardline conservatives, including Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, voted no because the bill didn’t draw a hard enough line against Obamacare.

Well done, lads. Ha, ha, remember that whole ""fellow New Yorker Michael Grimm is close behind him"" part? That was really neat.

There's not a whole lot to say about a plan that nobody should have believed was going to come to fruition anyway. But it's worth pointing out that when the political media holds forth on the ideological landscape of Congress, and games out what they believe is possible in terms of bargains and compromises, just about everything in their conceptual framework is premised on the notion that a lot of moderate Republicans exist, and that the resting state of Capitol Hill is ""center-right.""

As it turns out, all of those premises are wrong. There aren't a lot of ""moderate Republicans"" in Congress. And those who exist are very timid and nearly useless when the chips are down. The government is shut down right now, but the notion that ""moderate Republicans"" were capable of steering a debate somewhere sensible went by the boards a long time ago.

(Steve Helber/AP)

Virginia Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe began shaping his administration Monday, filling key administrative positions with veteran Democratic operatives with extensive experience he hopes will enable him to move his agenda forward.

McAuliffe (D) named Paul Reagan as his chief of staff; Suzette Denslow as deputy chief of staff; Ric Brown as secretary of finance; and Levar as the secretary of the commonwealth.

Reagan, Denslow and Brown all have long careers working for several top Democratic elected officials, including governors and members of Congress. Their collective expertise and many relationships in Richmond could help blunt criticism of McAuliffe’s lack of governing experience, which became an issue during his campaign against Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II.

And Brown, whose tenure as finance secretary will now span the terms of three governors, will bring crucial knowledge to a budget process expected to be squeezed by the continuing effects of federal budget cuts on Virginia’s economy.

McAuliffe, who has pledged a “mainstream, bipartisan” approach to governing, said during a brief news conference that the newly appointed members of his team will help him “find common ground with leaders of both parties around solutions that create jobs, grow our economy, and help navigate the uncertainty that we will face over the coming years.

“They are the ideal foundation for an administration that is devoted to building new bridges to compromise and erasing old partisan lines in the sand.”

Reagan has been involved in politics for more than 30 years, including serving as chief of staff to Rep. James P. Moran Jr. (D) and former Democratic senator Jim Webb. In Richmond, Reagan worked as communications director for former governor Mark R. Warner (D).

“There are few people in this commonwealth who can match Paul’s experience, practical knowledge of Virginia and administrative skills,” McAuliffe said. “Paul’s knowledge of this commonwealth and how we interact will be an invaluable asset to Virginia as this administration begins, as will his calm, collaborative and decisive leadership style.”

Denslow most recently served as chief of staff for Richmond Mayor Dwight C. Jones (D).

“Suzette’s talent, professionalism and knowledge of Virginia policy make her an invaluable asset,” McAuliffe said. “She has helped lead this city to a new chapter of economic growth, and I am thrilled she will bring her record of accomplishment to my administration.”

Previously, Denslow served as legislative director for both Warner and former governor Timothy M. Kaine (D). She was also deputy secretary of education for former Democratic governor L. Douglas Wilder.

Brown is the current secretary of finance. He has served the state for more than 40 years, working for 12 different governors, he said.

“It’s a privilege to be asked to stay,” Brown said. “I’m going to try to help as much as I can for as long as I can.”

McAuliffe said Brown has agreed to stay in the position at least through the first budget cycle. When Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) was elected, Brown said he planned to stay on for a short time. He remained in the post throughout McDonnell’s term.

McAuliffe said Brown’s appointment is crucial to bringing continuity at a time when the state faces fiscal challenges as a result of sequestration.

Republican leaders told him that if he could persuade Brown to join his administration, it would “probably be one of the smartest things you could do for the commonwealth.”

He said he enlisted help from Wilder and McDonnell to encourage Brown to stay.

“Secretary Brown has been a steady hand in a time of great uncertainty in our economy. He has contributed as much as anyone to helping Virginia weather the great recession and its fallout by protecting education, transportation and other key investments in Virginia’s economy,” McAuliffe said.

Stoney, McAuliffe’s deputy campaign manager, was described by McAuliffe as his “closest adviser” during the transition process and the “chief conduit to Virginia leaders from both political parties as we continue to prepare to take office.”

McAuliffe, who narrowly won the governor’s race two weeks ago, said Monday that he has spent the past two weeks meeting with elected leaders from both parties and working with his transition team to assemble his administration.

Reagan, Denslow, Brown and Stoney, “along with the rest of the team that we are working hard to put together during this transition process, will help me bring together people so that we are working on a common goal of job creation, diversifying our economy, improving education, reforming the [Standards of Learning test], fixing transportation and keeping our economy strong,” McAuliffe said."

After a presidency, what comes next? Not just for the president but also for the members of the administration, the president’s allies in Congress, his or her political party?

In the eight years of the George W. Bush administration, no hearty saplings were ever able to take root in the shade of that big tree. No one expected Vice President Dick Cheney to ever be a contender for the presidency — part of his effectiveness was his willingness to say and do very unpopular things. When he snapped at ABC’s Martha Raddatz, “So?” as she questioned him about public disapproval of the Iraq war, he wrote the perfect epitaph for his vice presidency.

But by the time the Bush era was winding down, the whole administration, including the president, was stewed in terrible, Cheney-level disapproval ratings. And now, almost no one who played a significant role in that administration is anywhere to be found in electoral politics, beyond the tertiary orbits of Punch-and-Judy cable news and the remains of what used to be the conservative “think tank” circuit.

That’s true even for former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who had no formal role in his brother’s administration but will probably always find the familial association an insurmountable obstacle to his own presidential hopes.

Though she insists she is not running for president in 2016 , many liberals hope she will provide a more progressive alternative to Hillary Clinton. Joshua Roberts/Reuters Wait 1 second to continue.

Unlike the Reagan administration, the first Bush administration and the Clinton administration, the George W. Bush presidency elevated precisely no one to the ranks of national leadership who wasn’t there before. The 2008 Republican presidential primaries were like some odd eight-year cicada hatch in which the candidates went underground in 2000 and then birthed themselves after Bush and Cheney were gone, as if the intervening years had never happened.

The 2000 second-place finisher, Sen. John McCain? You’re next in line for 2008! And four years later: second-place Mitt Romney? You’re next in line for 2012!

The unpopular presidency of George W. Bush has proved to be a blackball on the résumés of a generation of Republican leaders. Maybe Cheney’s daughter Liz will break the pattern next year with a successful Senate bid in Wyoming, but if you made it through that sentence without spitting coffee out your nose, you’re in rare company.

The fascinating turmoil in the Republican Party since 2008 is not just a personnel problem — it’s also ideological. If you were putting together a legacy to inspire the next generation of conservatives, you wouldn’t pick the Bush administration’s trailing ends of land wars, budget deficits, torture, a crusade against gay rights and a financial collapse to rival the Great Depression. The isolationism and libertarian iconography of the Ron Paul wing of the party really does appeal to young people more than Bush-Cheney Republicanism. Social conservatives really do feel backed into a corner and ready to fight against a country that is turning against them faster than most pollsters can keep up. There really is something ripe for renewal in Republicans’ self-conception as fiscal conservatives, when the clear pattern is that budget deficits grow under Republicans and shrink under Democrats. The Republican Party is a churning swirl of conflicting ideological currents, and that’s going to take some time to work out.

But part of the reason it may be taking so long already is those lost years: the period from 2000 to 2008 that effectively obviated the authority and the leadership potential of all of Washington’s Republican elites. The George W. Bush administration didn’t just cast too much shade on the next generation of leadership — it also apparently poisoned the ground.

The Obama administration’s ability to nurture and support the next round of national leadership in the Democratic Party is going to be a big part of its long-term legacy. Unless Vice President Biden’s presidential hinting suddenly takes a turn for the serious, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton is the obvious inheritor of the party’s mantle. But, as in 2008, the Beltway may be overstating her inevitability. The grass roots aren’t all with her, frankly, and it’s yet to be seen if she’s interested in trying to win them over. Mainstream press may buy big-dollar donors (and more mainstream press), but it can’t buy the passionate volunteers and activists and excitement that are the oxygen for a winning campaign and sustained, effective leadership.

The collapse of national leadership prospects for the Republican Party is one of the greatest political failures and most important legacies of George W. Bush. Barack Obama looks less likely to repeat that fate, but it depends on a strong grove of nationally viable Democrats starting to grow now. The crescendo of attention to Elizabeth Warren is a healthy part of that process, as is the growing national interest in such diverse Democrats as Sherrod Brown, Claire McCaskill, Cory Booker, Wendy Davis, Martin O’Malley, Deval Patrick, Andrew Cuomo and Amy Klobuchar.

Inside the White House, the task of growing one’s own successors must seem like one of the less pressing items on the president’s long daily to-do list. But the previous administration’s trail of scorched earth and exiles has curtailed the prospects for the Republican Party and governing conservatism more profoundly than almost anything that administration pursued in terms of policy. It is a cautionary tale that Democrats and the Obama White House should heed sooner rather than later. Grow your successors, nurture your legacy.

With 95% of precincts reporting, Booker was leading Republican opponent Steve Lonegan, 55% to 44%. The seat had long been held by Democrat Frank R. Lautenberg, who died in June.

Booker will be one of two African Americans serving in the U.S. Senate, joining Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina.

Booker spoke optimistically during a victory speech at the Prudential Center in Newark, thanking supporters for coming out to vote on a Wednesday in October at a time when many Americans are fed up with politics.

“Despite the cynicism and the negativity we often see on TV, despite a special election, New Jerseyans, hundreds of thousands, rejected all that and came out and voted,” he said. “But more than that, you didn’t just vote, but you believed that your voice and your vote mattered.”

Though Booker won, his margin of victory was smaller than some polls had predicted.

That’s partly because he didn’t engage enough with voters and spent weeks away from the state raising money elsewhere, said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.

That allowed Lonegan to raise an oft-repeated criticism of Booker: that he’s more concerned with his national reputation than with local voters.

“The margin could have been wider, but people really weren’t enthusiastic about Cory Booker, so they stayed home,” Murray said.

But Booker successfully argued that Lonegan’s tea party views were out of step with the state, which has not elected a Republican to the Senate since 1972.

The special election, oddly timed three weeks before another election in New Jersey, had the lowest turnout of any election for a statewide seat in the last century, Murray said.

Booker tried in the days leading up to the election to use the federal government shutdown to cast himself as a moderate who is willing to compromise. He was best known before this election as a mayor with famous friends -- such as Oprah Winfrey -- who went from Stanford to Oxford and back to the inner city.

Lonegan, a legally blind former mayor of Bogota, N.J., has not shied from his conservative positions. He spoke repeatedly about his support for the government shutdown and his opposition to the Affordable Care Act.

He was the state director for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group founded by the Koch brothers, and held a rally last weekend with Sarah Palin and the Tea Party Express.

He said he planned to return to the private sector after the election.

“Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the message we delivered together ... did not win the day,” he said to supporters in Bridgewater, N.J., according to the Associated Press.

Democrats have an advantage in statewide voter registration: One-third of voters are registered Democrats and 20% are Republicans. But pollsters said in preelection surveys that the election’s odd timing made predictions of voter turnout difficult.

Republicans may have fared better with a more moderate candidate, but Republican Gov. Chris Christie blocked anyone else from running, wanting GOP support focused on his reelection effort next month, Murray said.

“A lot of Democrats may decide to vote for Cory Booker and sit out on the losing gubernatorial campaign,” he said.

Booker will have to run again next year to defend his seat. Though party leaders will probably push the charismatic Booker to become a face of the Democratic Party, he’ll need to work hard to keep voters happy at home too, said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University.

“He’s going to have to keep his head down, do a lot of constituent service and build up more trust,” Dworkin said. “I don’t think we’ll necessarily see him gallivanting around the country.”

Perez has led the Justice Department%27s Civil Rights Division since 2009

He previously served as Maryland%27s labor secretary

Perez played a leading role in Justice%27s decision to challenge voter ID laws

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama is poised to select Justice Department official Thomas Perez to be the next labor secretary, according to two people familiar with the deliberation process.

Perez' nomination to the Labor Department could come as early as Monday, the people familiar with the process said Saturday. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the official announcement has not yet been made. White House spokesman Matt Lehrich declined to comment.

Perez, 51, has led the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division since 2009 and previously served as Maryland's labor secretary. He is expected to have solid support from organized labor and the Hispanic community, which is eager to have Hispanic representation in Obama's cabinet.

Perez was the first Latino elected to the Montgomery County Council in Maryland, where he served from 2002 to 2006. If confirmed, he would replace Hilda Solis, who resigned in January to return to her native California.

Perez would come to the Labor Department as Obama pushes a major immigration overhaul, which could include changes in how employers hire guest workers. Labor Department officials have also taken a prominent role in supporting Obama's effort to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 an hour.

At the Justice Department, Perez has played a leading role in the agency's decision to challenge voter ID laws in Texas and South Carolina that could restrict minority voting rights. A federal court later struck down the Texas law and delayed implementation of the law in South Carolina until after the 2012 election.

Perez was easily confirmed by the Senate for his Justice Department post, but since then, some GOP lawmakers have criticized his role in persuading the city of St. Paul, Minn., to withdraw a lending discrimination lawsuit from the Supreme Court. In exchange, the Justice Department declined to join two whistle-blower lawsuits against St. Paul that could have returned millions in damages to the federal government.

The St. Paul case had challenged the use of statistics to prove race discrimination under the 1968 Fair Housing Act, and Justice Department officials were concerned the court could strike down the practice.

A letter last year from four Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Rep. Darrell Issa of California, criticized Perez for a ""quid pro quo arrangement"" that potentially cost taxpayers more than $180 million."

City Council a hot destination for former state legislators,"The Los Angeles City Council experienced its biggest transformation since 2001 this week, with six new members taking their seats — all but two after serving in the state Legislature.

With seven out of 15 members coming from Sacramento, the hand-over has solidified the council’s reputation as a destination for professional politicians. By the end of the month, an eighth former state lawmaker could take office, depending on the outcome of a special election.

Advertisement

The arrival of so many former state lawmakers can be attributed in large part to term limits, said Councilman Paul Koretz, a state assemblyman from 2000 to 2006. Term limits, in place at both the city and state level, were “sold as a way to get citizen politicians” into public office, Koretz said.

“What it’s done in reality is almost eliminate them” at City Hall, he added.

Koretz, who won his council seat in 2009, said that when he started following politics in Los Angeles, the great local leaders were John Ferraro, Joel Wachs, Marvin Braude and Zev Yaroslavsky. None had held elected office before winning seats on the City Council, he said.

By 2003, term limits had swept out Ruth Galanter, Rudy Svorinich, Mike Hernandez and Hal Bernson, four others who had not served in public office until they joined the council.

These days, council members typically come to the job from one of three places: the Legislature, the Police Department or the staff of another City Council office. Key exceptions are Jose Huizar, who won his seat after serving on the school board, and Tom LaBonge, who came from the Department of Water and Power. But LaBonge had also spent 17 years as a council aide and four in the mayor’s office.

Galanter, who served from 1987 to 2003, expressed dismay about the changes, saying the arrival of so many state politicians, combined with the leadership style of Council President Herb Wesson — a former Assembly speaker — is already making council members behave like their counterparts in Sacramento.

Advertisement

Two decades ago, council members weren’t shy about disagreeing with one another — and often did so publicly, Galanter said. These days, council members much more frequently fall in line with Wesson, as lawmakers do with the party leadership in Sacramento, she said.

The council “now has the imperial speaker,” Galanter said, “and the obedient troops who know about rewards and punishments.”

On Tuesday, after winning another two years as council president, Wesson defended the council’s string of unanimous votes, saying there’s “nothing wrong” with building consensus. He also said he had been wrongly portrayed by critics as a dictator. “I don’t tell you how to vote,” he told his colleagues. “We build coalitions here.”

Wesson has already endorsed former Assemblywoman Cindy Montañez, who currently works at the DWP, to fill a vacant seat in a July 23 special election. He argued that the arrivals from the Legislature would bring talent to the lawmaking body. “Sacramento gets a bad rap,” he said. “They’re honest, hard-working people and very operational.”

Yaroslavsky, a county supervisor who served on the council for 19 years, said he fears that as the council takes on a greater number of professional politicians, it loses a diversity of viewpoints. That change, he said, can be traced not just to term limits, but to the huge sums spent by “independent expenditure” campaign groups — labor unions and others that have put $800,000 or more behind their chosen candidates.

Those groups “have made it very daunting and intimidating for community-based candidates to run,” he said.

“The pool of potential candidates who are community-based has shrunk. And because the pool has shrunk, the odds of a community-based candidate getting elected has also shrunk,” said Yaroslavsky, who was elected to the council in 1975 while running an advocacy group focused on the plight of Soviet Jews.

For veteran politicians, the attraction of a council seat is clear. Council members earn almost $180,000 per year, nearly double the money provided to members of the state Assembly. With roughly a quarter-million people in each district, council members wield enormous power. And, unlike state legislators, they will be eligible for pensions — something wiped out for Sacramento lawmakers in 1990.

The Sacramento arrivals should help the council by bringing experience with the legislative process, said Jaime Regalado, professor emeritus of political science at Cal State L.A. Those who are bothered by the presence of career politicians at City Hall won’t be nearly as excited, he said.

“For those who like term limits and don’t like their politicians to be around very long, this is probably the worst-case scenario,” he said.

The Sacramento transplants will face a steep learning curve, said Rick Taylor, a City Hall lobbyist who worked as a council staffer in the 1980s. They will go from dealing with “broad, global kinds of issues” to angry phone calls about graffiti, unfilled potholes, cracked sidewalks and weed-filled lots.

“Local government is about making sure communities are protected and services are delivered, and that’s a very different type of government,” he said. “It’s more hands-on. It’s more people-oriented. It’s definitely more time-consuming.”

Councilman Gil Cedillo, who served in both the Assembly and Senate and took office Monday, acknowledged that council members deal much more in details than their Sacramento counterparts. But he said his years as a top official with the Service Employees International Union prepared him to deal in specifics.

“I negotiated 22 collective bargaining agreements for 40,000 people — that’s detail,” he said.

In addition to Cedillo, the council has been joined by former Assemblyman Bob Blumenfield in the west San Fernando Valley, former Assemblyman Felipe Fuentes in the east Valley and former State Sen. Curren Price in South Los Angeles. Two other newcomers, Mike Bonin and Mitch O’Farrell, worked a decade or more for sitting council members.

Svorinich, who left the council 2001, said he thinks the bigger story is not the addition of lawmakers from Sacramento but the loss of council members who come from the business community. When Svorinich was elected in 1993, he was running a paint store in Wilmington.

Rand Paul accused both Republicans and Democrats of being ""guilty of spending too much"" in his tea party response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday night.

""It is often said that there is not enough bipartisanship up here. That is not true. In fact, there is plenty of bipartisanship,"" Paul said in a speech for Tea Party Express that streamed live on the group's website shortly after Obama's speech. ""Both parties have been guilty of spending too much, of protecting their sacred cows, of backroom deals in which everyone up here wins, but every taxpayer loses.""

Despite being an elected member of the Senate, the junior senator from Kentucky at times spoke as though he were an outsider—even using the word ""they"" when referring to other members of the institution to which he belongs.

Paul delivered his remarks after the official Republican response, given by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio from the Capitol. Paul joined Rubio in accusing the president of working to undermine the ""free market,"" but Paul's remarks also included a call for an amendment to the Constitution that would require the federal government to balance its budget every year, a tea party rallying cry.

""What the president fails to grasp is that the American system that rewards hard work is what made America so prosperous,"" Paul said. ""What America needs is not Robin Hood but Adam Smith.""

Paul advocated for term limits for members of Congress as punishment for not passing a budget and reining in spending.

""If Congress refuses to obey its own rules, if Congress refuses to pass a budget, if Congress refuses to read the bills, then I say: Sweep the place clean. Limit their terms and send them home,"" Paul said. ""I have seen the inner sanctum of Congress, and believe me there is no monopoly on knowledge there. If they will not listen, if they will not balance the budget, then we should limit their terms.""

The speech gave Paul, who has said he's thinking about running for president someday, an opportunity to brand himself as an alternative to the party establishment. Because being an outsider, of course, is what being a tea party lawmaker is all about."

Still considered one of the Republican Party's ripest candidates for president in 2016, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) appears to be fading among some Florida voters.

The Democratic-leaning firm Public Policy Polling released a survey Thursday, showing that 43 percent of 579 voters surveyed approve of Rubio, while 45 percent disapprove. Last September, PPP had him at 51 percent approval, compared to 33 percent disapproval, the release adds.

Earlier this week, Rubio also fell in a 2016 poll conducted by Quinnipiac University. That survey had him dropping seven points in the national picture since April.

As for the national 2016 GOP picture, Rubio continues to be a presence among an early, crowded preliminary field. HuffPost Pollster's latest compilation of 23 publicly available polls has Rubio in sixth place at 10.5 percent. He sits behind Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) / (15.9%) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) / (14.6%), New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) / (14.5%), Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) / (12.4%) and former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Fla.) / (11.4%).

Supreme Court decision gives imprimatur to tough new voting laws

Supporters say the laws will guard against fraud

Critics say they will make voting more diffiicult for minorities

WASHINGTON -- The 50th anniversary of the historic March on Washington is being commemorated amid moves by some states to impose restrictions on one of its central goals: the right to vote.

Two months after the Supreme Court declared a key section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act unconstitutional, Southern states that had been covered by the act are taking steps they say will guard against voter fraud — but which critics say will make voting more difficult for minorities.

The court's 5-4 ruling tossed out the formula Congress used to decide which states and municipalities had to clear changes in voting procedures with the federal government. The fallout has reached from the campuses of historically black colleges to the nation's halls of justice.

""This has been a really, really tough summer for race and civil rights, and people are really hurting,"" says Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ""As we approach the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic March on Washington, we are reminded that the fight for equal rights is far from history.""

Backers of a North Carolina law that Hillary Rodham Clinton said this month ""reads like the greatest hits of voter suppression"" argue, however, that the changes are needed to ensure the integrity of the election system.

""We think these are just common-sense reforms,"" says state Rep. David Lewis, who chairs the House Election Law Committee. ""It's never been our intent to restrict people from being able to exercise their right to vote.""

The North Carolina law, enacted two weeks ago, eventually will require government-issued photo identification at the polls, reduce early voting by seven days and end both same-day registration and a program that registers students ahead of their 18th birthdays. It has spawned three lawsuits already.

In Texas, one of the nation's toughest photo-ID laws was put into effect following the high court's decision, prompting Attorney General Eric Holder last week to file suit against the state and seek to put Texas back under the Voting Rights Act's pre-clearance requirement.

In Alabama, Mississippi and elsewhere, Republican state officials vowed to implement similar voter identification laws that had been awaiting federal approval. Officials from the National Conference of State Legislatures anticipate more voting restrictions once lawmakers return to state capitals in 2014.

Republican state officials defend the trend, as well as their right to run their states without federal interference.

""Eric Holder is wrong to mess with Texas,"" state Attorney General Greg Abbott said last week. ""All of this is really an effort by the Obama administration to circumvent the recent United States Supreme Court decision.""

The state-by-state skirmishes have spawned lawsuits by the NAACP, American Civil Liberties Union and others, charging that the new restrictions are racially motivated. Democratic lawmakers from several states have formed an alliance aimed at combating what Georgia state Rep. Stacey Abrams fears will be a ""contagion effect"" among states.

To veterans of the 1963 march who want Congress and the courts to step in, it's déjà vu.

""There are people out there trying to turn back the clock because they don't like the results,"" says Frank Smith, a marcher who now runs the African American Civil War Memorial and Museum in Washington. ""There is a direct correlation between these marches and demonstrations, and Congress passing remedial actions.""

The flurry of activity could have political as well as legal repercussions. Because restraints on voting tend to affect minorities, the poor and students more than others, they could aid Republicans and harm Democrats in the 2014 elections — and the next battle for the White House in 2016.

Clinton, one of the potential candidates in that election, denounced the trend away from expanded voting rights in a speech to the American Bar Association earlier this month.

""In the weeks since the ruling, we've seen an unseemly rush by previously covered jurisdictions to enact or enforce laws that will make it harder for millions of our fellow Americans to vote,"" she said. ""Anyone who says that racial discrimination is no longer a problem in American elections must not be paying attention.""

ACT'S SUCCESS LED TO DOWNFALL

The battle lines have formed because five of nine Supreme Court justices decided June 25 that the Voting Rights Act's toughest remedy against racial discrimination no longer is justified. Their decision suggested that the 1963 March on Washington and the many protests it spawned had accomplished its goals, and it was now time to move on.

The justices noted that the South has, in many ways, surpassed the North in terms of equality for African Americans. Black turnout exceeded white turnout nationally in the 2012 election, including in most of the states originally placed under federal oversight.

Moreover, about 12,000 blacks have been elected to political office nationwide, including some of the largest numbers in Southern states such as Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana, which have the largest black populations. That's partially because the Justice Department insisted on the creation of legislative districts with black or ethnic majorities.

""There is no doubt that these improvements are in large part because of the Voting Rights Act,"" Chief Justice John Roberts acknowledged. ""The act has proved immensely successful at redressing racial discrimination and integrating the voting process.""

So successful, in fact, that Roberts declared outdated and unconstitutional the law's geographic coverage formula, which penalized mostly Southern states with a history of racial discrimination. Within hours, officials throughout the South vowed to implement voter-identification laws and other policies that had been blocked by the federal government.

Abbott, a Republican, announced plans to implement a Texas voter ID law previously blocked by the Voting Rights Act. Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann said implementation of his state's voter ID law, which had been awaiting Justice Department approval, would begin immediately. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley said his state's new voter ID law no longer needed federal approval.

Other states also prepared to move ahead with legislation requiring new forms of ID at the polls, limiting early voting hours or restricting voter-registration drives. But no state acted as quickly and comprehensively as North Carolina.

The Tar Heel State's new law requires government-issued photo ID, lacked by a higher percentage of blacks than whites. It reduces from 17 to 10 the number of days for early voting, which also helped blacks more than whites in 2008 and 2012 — though it instructs local boards of elections to maintain the same number of hours and locations.

It eliminates same-day registration, requiring instead that registrants sign up at least 25 days before an election. And it eliminates a high school civics program that registers students ahead of their 18th birthdays.

""Photo ID has become a part of our everyday life,"" North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said in a YouTube video after he signed the state's new law, noting it's even needed to purchase Sudafed. ""Our right to vote deserves similar protection.""

McCrory criticized ""the extreme left"" for being ""more interested in divisive politics than ensuring that no one's vote is disenfranchised by fraudulent ballot.""

Lewis says North Carolina is simply catching up with other states that require photo ID. Eleven states have put into effect similar laws and eight others are awaiting implementation; included among them are Southern states such as Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi and Virginia.

Since the law was passed -- it will be phased in from 2014 to 2016 -- some county officials have sought to stop the widespread practice of allowing college students to vote on campus. The overall effort by Republicans prompted state Sen. Ellie Kinnaird, a Democrat, to resign her seat.

The lawsuits in North Carolina, like those in Texas, may be joined by the Justice Department. ""I do anticipate their involvement at some point,"" says Allison Riggs, staff attorney for the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. ""We intend to hold Attorney General Holder to his word.""

The broader concern among civil rights groups is that other states will follow North Carolina's lead in 2014. ""We're going to see more of this,"" predicts Dale Ho, director of the Voting Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, which has sued the state. ""North Carolina's a harbinger.""

'CONDEMNED TO REPEAT PAST'

The 1963 marchers who return to the nation's capital this week to mark the anniversary will have a new cause: pressuring Congress to fortify the weakened Voting Rights Act to eliminate what Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in dissent were ""second-generation barriers"" to voting.

""The court criticizes Congress for failing to recognize that 'history did not end in 1965.' But the court ignores that 'what's past is prologue,'"" she said, quoting William Shakespeare. ""And those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.""

What preceded the Voting Rights Act were a series of events no one wants to repeat: literary tests and poll taxes designed to block blacks from voting; beatings and jailings for those who defied racist authorities.

In his opinion, Roberts noted that two southern cities with particularly woeful pasts — Philadelphia, Miss., and Selma, Ala. — now have black mayors. Philadelphia Mayor James Young credited his election to the changes brought about by the Voting Rights Act.

""Due to the history, without the federal intervention, we would not have what we have today,"" he told USA TODAY in February. ""Whether it's overbearing now, I'm not here to judge. I'm just here to say I am a recipient of what fair-voting laws should do, and that is give every individual a level field.""

To the court's majority, Young's election and similar changes in the South are reason to declare a lasting victory for the Voting Rights Act. To civil rights veterans, continued federal vigilance is essential.

""North Carolina is the warning bell for what is to come,"" says Judith Browne Dianis, co-director of the Advancement Project, a civil rights advocacy group. ""State legislatures that have wanted to keep and maintain control through manipulating voting laws are doing exactly that. And now there's no check on it."""

Even conservatives want to leave the God stuff out of government.

FreedomWorks commissioned a national survey of registered voters last month, shared first with POLITICO, that finds 78 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents self-identify as fiscally conservative and socially moderate [...] The poll asked Republican voters what they are most interested in: 40 percent said “individual freedom through lower taxes and reducing the size and scope of government,” 27 percent picked “traditional values” and 18 percent chose a “strong national defense.""

Hmmm ...Freedomworks is pushing this poll in support of its ""defund the government if Obamacare isn't killed"" effort. Per their telling, Republicans want their elected officials to ""stick to their principles"" and not compromise with Democrats. But on social issues? Forty-one percent of Republicans don't rank gay marriage as a top-10 issue, and only a third rank abortion as a top-3 issue (another third ranks it top-10, and the last third doesn't give a shit).

It's one poll, but it seems to confirm trends inside the GOP's strife-torn tent. The neocons are on the outs. We first saw it with the sequester—where the $800 billion in defense cuts was supposed to prod the GOP to negotiate in good faith for a grand bargain. Instead, the bulk of the GOP nodded in approval and left the military-industrial complex slack-jawed, abandoned despite the mounds of campaign cash they shipped into GOP coffers. But their irrelevance has only been confirmed with the Syria debate, with war hawks grossly outnumbered even inside their own caucus. (Sure, support would be higher with a Republican administration, but that's cold comfort for a crew who exist to bomb shit in the Middle East.)

The Theocons are being marginalized by a society that left them behind a long time ago. And while the 2013 ""rebranding"" efforts have failed, they'll be back the next time Republicans lose a national election. And fact is, they're not going to get single women and youth voters without chucking the Religious Right's agenda overboard. It's inevitable. And if Freedomwork's poll is to be believed, doing so would actually be popular within the GOP.

The ""Jesus rode a dinosaur"" nuts may be loud but not loved, not even by their supposed allies."

Millett, who will come up for a vote as soon as Thursday, is the first of Obama's three D.C. Circuit nominees to hit the Senate floor. Nina Pillard cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee and is ready for a floor vote, while Robert Wilkins is set for his committee vote on Thursday.

Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) said that he, too, will vote to filibuster Millett and revealed why Republicans want to keep Obama's nominee from getting on the court. ""We're worried about that court being a significant bastion for administrative law cases on Obamacare,"" Kirk said.

As a reflection of just how brazenly political Republican opposition to anything President Obama wants to is, they've brought back the laughable assertion that Obama is attempting to ""pack"" the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

He's moving ahead with the nominations, and taking the nuclear option out of his back pocket and waving it around in front of Republicans, with some help from Sen.

Obama told donors the sight of Mt. Rainier illuminated by a setting sun was particularly special because it reminded him of his mother, who attended high school in the Seattle area. ""I feel the spirit of my mom,"" he said.

He also attempted to contrast himself with Republicans who control the House of Representatives, saying they are ""more focused on positioning themselves for the next election.""

""I'm not a particularly ideological person,"" he said, adding he still is passionate about giving people a fair shake, about the environment, and working for peace and national security. ""But I'm pretty pragmatic about how we get there.""

Money, star power and Hollywood awaited the president on this trip, which featured a bit of official business, but mostly fundraising for a Democratic Party eager to go on offense after a politically debilitating two months.

More On This...

Obama arrived Sunday evening in Seattle. He also planned stops in San Francisco and Los Angeles, raising money for House and Senate Democrats as well as the national party.

High-profile events on the schedule include a reception at the home of retired basketball star Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson and his wife, Cookie, in Beverly Hills, Calif., and one at the house of Marta Kauffman, co-creator of television's ""Friends.""

Accompanied by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California, Obama attended a reception and dinner Sunday at the home of former Microsoft executive Jon Shirley.

Though he professed he was not looking for the defeat of another party, he said the country needs Pelosi to be House speaker again.

The money raised — $32,400 per couple — went to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which benefits House Democrats.

""In the year before an election like this, I think the most tangible way that an incumbent president of either party, frankly, can benefit his party's prospects in congressional races is to try to help them raise money,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said earlier. ""And I would anticipate that the president's efforts on that front will continue into next year.""

The trip comes as Obama's health care law approaches a crucial Nov. 30 deadline for an improved insurance enrollment website whose catastrophic start Oct. 1 dealt a serious political blow to the White House. Also, the U.S. and other world powers just sealed a historic deal with Iran for a temporary freeze of its nuclear program.

In addition to a half-dozen fundraisers, Obama intended to use the trip to keep the heat on Congress to pass an overhaul of immigration laws. He planned to address that issue during a stop Monday at a Chinese recreation center in San Francisco, and to promote his economic agenda Tuesday at the DreamWorks Animation studio in Glendale, Calif.

In recent days White House officials have tried to draw attention back to the economy to avoid getting bogged down by the botched launch of the health care enrollment.

Lately, Obama has devoted time to raising money for the party, helping the Democratic National Committee reduce a massive 2012 debt and build up cash for House and Senate Democratic Committees.

The White House has been especially attentive to Senate Democrats to ensure that the party retains its majority in the chamber. The House is controlled by the Republican Party.

In addition to the dinner at Shirley's home, Obama also attended a Democratic National Committee event Sunday at the home of Tom Campion, co-founder of the clothing chain Zumiez. Unlike the dinner at Shirley's house, reporters were not permitted into the fundraiser.

The event attracted about 30 donors, the DNC said. Tickets also were $32,400 per couple, according to an invitation."

Let me finish tonight with this.

I said it before and am now saying it again.

There are too many people on the American right who hate the very notion of Barack Obama in the White House. It grates on them, just as it thrills – even now – tens of millions of others.

They hate not just his politics but him.

Think about all the days we have known him – from way back when he gave that breathtaking speech at the 2004 convention? Was there ever a time in all those days and weeks and months and years since that his haters on the right have stopped in their tracks and said, “Well, good for him. I liked the way he did that.”

Think hard. Have his haters ever stopped hating him?

When we got Bin Laden?

When the stock market doubled, doubling very 401K, making all those haters richer – twice as rich – as they were when Bush left us stranded with a dropping, scary economy? Did they ever look up and say, even hesitantly, “Well, I’ll give him this one?”

No.

No.

No.

You can discount it all. You can say it’s not about race or whatever. You can say it, but …

Think about this. In all the criticisms you’ve heard the haters say about African Americans all the years of your life – and think about this man’s life – about how hard he worked at school, how he achieved so highly at school, how he married so well and so faithfully, how he’s fathered two great daughters and kept them, protected them, been a truly great father to them, be a true partner in his marriage, treated his office with such respect and dignity – has never once let us down with his personal behavior and yet ….

They hate him. They really do and I don’t have to be the one to tell you.

We live in a country where a good chunk of the country hates its elected leader and won’t really – I mean really- tell you why.

It’s the same reason they spend their time thinking of clever gimmicks to keep so many people from voting. Anybody disagree?"
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/03/1206664/-Markey-leads-Gomez-by-just-4-in-Massachusetts-Senate-special-election-per-PPP,2013-05-03 00:00:00,"['Daily Kos Staff', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']","Markey leads Gomez by just 4 in Massachusetts Senate special election, per PPP","Gomez right now is more popular than Rep. Ed Markey, with a 41-27 favorability rating versus 44-41 for the Democrat. And he's keeping things close thanks to his 47-31 lead with independents, as well as the fact that he's drawing 21 percent of Democrats. Some of these may be folks who voted for Rep. Stephen Lynch in the primary who, as Tom Jensen puts it, may be ""a little reticent about supporting Markey in the general."" (Lynch did immediately endorse Markey, though, so hopefully he won't be reluctant to keep stumping on his behalf.) Jensen adds, though, that Brown held a 64-32 lead with independents in their final 2010 poll, so Gomez still has a lot of ground to make up if he's going to be the next Scott Brown.

In 2012, one aspect of PPP's Massachusetts polling continually stood out: Undecided voters were much more likely to favor Democrats than Republicans. That's why, even though the head-to-head matchups between Brown and Elizabeth Warren often appeared close, Warren had the edge, since those last few up-for-grabs voters had a strong predilection for Team Blue. The big difference between then and now is that Barack Obama was at the top of the ticket, drawing out lots of voters who won't show up for an early summer special election. Indeed, as Jensen notes, this sample is about 5 points more favorable to Mitt Romney than the 2012 election results were.

But even without Obama, Massachusetts is still a blue state. The undecideds in this poll went for Obama by an 18-point margin last fall, include more self-identified liberals than conservatives, and are over 60 percent female. Those are all positives for Markey, and if he can avoid stumbles and self-inflicted wounds, he should be able to win over the bulk of those undecided voters.

It's far from a walkover, though. Gomez may look like a proverbial fresh face, so Markey is going to have to make voters aware of his true ideology—and that a Gomez win would put Mitch McConnell and the GOP one seat closer to regaining control of the Senate. In other words, he's going to have to run a normal, competitive campaign and not simply coast in the belief that ""Massachusetts would never elect a Republican senator.""

The other question here is whether national Republicans will commit any money to Gomez. After all, this is only one poll, and while the GOP would love to torment Democrats in Massachusetts yet again, the NRSC may conclude that this race is fool's gold, and that they'd rather save their pennies for next fall. Indeed, whoever wins this seat would have to run again in 2014 for the full six-year term, which means Republicans would need to immediately defend this seat again. That wouldn't be an easy task, but it would certainly be easier than trying to wrest the seat from a Sen. Markey, which would probably be almost impossible.)

The biggest difference between now and the 2010 special that elected Scott Brown, though, is the general political environment—the backdrop, if you will. Three years ago, the economy still felt like it was in free fall to many voters, negative headlines about the Affordable Care Act were a daily feature, and conservatives were convinced that electing Brown would derail the ACA and bring the Democratic agenda to a dead halt. None of that is true today. Indeed, Jensen observes that Obama's job approval rating in Massachusetts stands at 53-41 now, versus 44-43 when Brown won.

And there's also the Martha Coakley factor, which is to say that Democrats are damn well determined not to get caught sleeping a second time. That just means, though, that Democrats know they have to work hard to make sure this seat stays blue. Markey may have a small edge, but from now until the special election on June 25, it's nose to the grindstone and absolutely no letting up."
http://news.yahoo.com/no-surprises-alexander-gop-incumbents-161209771--election.html,,[],No surprises for Alexander and GOP incumbents,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Faced with a potentially serious primary challenger, Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander was not about to sit back and wait.

The former two-term governor locked down endorsements, banked more than $3 million and linked arms with popular Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and former GOP presidential contender Mike Huckabee. When conservative state Rep. Joe Carr announced he would challenge Alexander, the senator's team was ready.

""I learned to count in Maryville City Schools,"" Alexander wrote in a recent op-ed in The Tennessean, recalling his East Tennessee hometown. ""So I know that if you only have 45 votes and you need 60 senators to get something important done like balancing the budget and fixing the debt, then you have to work with other people — that is, IF you really care about solving the problem.""

Call it the Revenge of the Incumbents: Alexander is the latest Senate Republican staring down a primary challenge with aggressive tactics aimed at blunting any early momentum from tea party-backed opposition. The early moves seek to avoid the fate of former Senate colleagues who were bounced by tea party challengers in 2010 and 2012.

In Kentucky, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has scorched challenger Matt Bevin with stinging ads accusing him of accepting government bailouts to help his family business and embellishing his academic background. Bevin, with help from tea party supporters, has responded with his own accusations, labeling the Senate leader ""Mudslinging Mitch"" and tarring him for supporting the Wall Street bailout in 2008.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has drawn criticism from conservatives for pushing immigration reform, has raised more than $6 million for his re-election and could be helped by a crowded primary field that includes three conservative opponents. Wyoming Sen. Mike Enzi has locked up support from Senate leaders and his Republican colleagues in the face of a challenge from Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.

The early tangling shows the degree to which some Republicans are trying to dispel critics who say they have been too prone to cut deals with Democrats and support the federal bailouts that marked the end of the Bush administration. With the public holding Congress in low esteem, they could face similar headwinds that derailed incumbents like Dick Lugar of Indiana, Bob Bennett of Utah and former Rep. Mike Castle of Delaware.

But they won't be surprised.

""They won't be caught asleep at the switch like Sen. Lugar,"" said Greg Strimple, a Republican pollster who advised John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.

In Tennessee, Alexander had already spent close to $1 million on his campaign before Carr entered the race. The senator has secured a list of endorsements from county chairmen and former state chairs. He also ran an ad in July highlighting his work with Paul to halt federal fishing restrictions in their states and appeared with the tea party favorite at an event in Nashville last month.

Since Carr's announcement, Alexander has broadcast TV and radio ads citing his 23 votes to eliminate President Barack Obama's health care laws and featuring an exchange with the president over the merits of the sweeping overhaul. It follows a radio spot by the Senate Conservatives Fund, an outside GOP group, that criticized Alexander for declining to join efforts to threaten a government shutdown over health care funding.

""We never expected not to have some opposition in this political environment,"" said Alexander campaign adviser Tom Ingram. He suggested that tough tactics will come if needed, saying: ""In politics you measure your opponents before you waste ammo. But when you fire, you do so very carefully and selectively. And you make sure you hit your target.""

Carr, who had previously planned to challenge Republican Rep. Scott DesJarlais, has likened his campaign against Alexander to the Biblical story of David vs. Goliath, and he has said Alexander's voting record had betrayed conservatives in recent years.

Political unknown Brenda Lenard, who has struggled to raise money, also is challenging Alexander. Tennessee tea party groups also are planning a series of events to determine their preferred candidate, and several others are considering a bid, including Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett and former Williamson County GOP chairman Kevin Kookogey.

But Republicans call Carr the most serious challenger so far, and they say he could be hurt by remarks he made at a Republican National Convention event last year in which he appeared to agree with Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin's statement that women have the biological ability to prevent pregnancy following a rape. Carr later tried to distance himself from the remarks.

Republicans say the two high-profile primaries — Tennessee and Kentucky — could hinge on whether the Senate Conservatives Fund and a separate group, the Club for Growth, pour money and advertising into the states to tear down the incumbents.

The Senate Conservatives Fund, which was founded by former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, spent about $16 million in 2012 and $8 million in 2010. The Club for Growth, an anti-tax group led by former Indiana Rep. Chris Chocola, spent about $18 million last year and about $5.5 million in 2010, a sign that it could shake up these races if they get involved.

Matt Hoskins, the Senate Conservatives Fund's executive director, said both Alexander and McConnell should be on notice.

""You really can't put lipstick on a pig,"" Hoskins said. ""You can surround yourself with as many endorsements as you want. If your record is liberal and people find out about that, there aren't enough endorsements in the world to cover that up.""

The Los Angeles Times credits elimination of the filibuster for judicial nominees to a new class of Democrats on the ascendancy in the U.S. Senate--the ""Elizabeth Warren"" wing of the Party as described by one observer. While Harry Reid tried to tamp down the enthusiasm after this week's historic action, these Democrats have made it clear they have only just begun to fight.

The Times calls them



[P]art of a new breed of Democrats emerging in the Senate. Mostly elected after 2006, these relative newcomers have only known a Democratic-controlled Senate and have little experience with successful bipartisan cooperation, due largely to the tea party's grip on the Republican Party. Now they are hoping to become a new power center in the party, nudging the old guard to adopt more aggressive tactics in pursuit of legislative goals and largely brushing aside Republican threats of retaliation and obstruction. They see the rules and traditions of the Senate as having stifled the will of the majority and stalled President Obama's agenda.

""There's a time to reach across the aisle and there's a time to hold the line,"" said Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.), the body's youngest member at 40, who was elected in 2012. ""And I think so far this year Democrats in the Senate have done a very good job of mixing across-the-aisle compromise with some heretofore unseen spine-stiffening."" The time has come for Democrats to take a harder stance against the tea party Republicans, he said. ""These folks have come to Washington to destroy government from within and will use any tool at their disposal,"" Murphy said. ""To the extent that we have the ability to take tools away from the tea party, we should do it. And one of the tools was the filibuster. Another was the belief that Democrats would cave in the face of another shutdown or debt default.""

What drives this ""new breed"" of aggressive, unabashedly liberal Senate Democrats? They've all had enough of the antics of the folks on the other side of the aisle. Here's Christopher Murphy, D-CT:When was the last time you heard about any Democratic Senator or Representative other than Harry Reid making the national news? While Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and the entire Tea Party caucus in the House have all transformed themselves into political Kardashians, constantly mugging for the cameras with their latest outrage du jour-- the Democrats--particularly those in the Senate who wield actual majority power--have for the most part sat quietly by for the last five years and endured this nonsense. Many of them, Jeff Merkley, Sherrod Brown, Tom Udall, were elected in 2006 and 2008; Elizabeth Warren and Chris Murphy, in 2012. By 2015 half of the Democratic caucus will have been in place since 2008. They represent a generational shift in the Senate that has known nothing but Tea Party intransigence--and ignorance--from the other side.

They're fed up and they're taking over the Party:



The senators' influence has already been seen in other fights, most recently in the 16-day shutdown, when new Democrats lobbied party leaders to stand up to Republicans — a tactic that seemed to shock many on the other side of the aisle, who were betting that Democrats would blink first.





Next on their agenda is extending the filibuster rule change from presidential appointments to legislation, which would enable the Senate to move on issues including gun control and climate change.

Filibuster reform for legislation may be a bridge too far for some in the Democratic caucus. But isn't it nice to have Democrats actually proposing it?

The Times article also credits the ""new breed"" of Senate Democrats with advancing Janet Yellen as opposed to Lawrence Summers to the Fed.



""The Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party definitely are showing that they have growing influence in the caucus, and in government in general,"" said Matt Wall of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group that works to promote progressive candidates and issues in Democratic primaries.

The shift among Democrats has at times confounded Republicans, particularly on the filibuster issue. Aides to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the third-longest-serving Republican, said they had felt that Reid's most recent moves telegraphing the nuclear option were a bluff. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday railed against the actions of ""uninitiated newcomers in the Democratic caucus,"" reminding them they had never served in the minority in the Senate. Those who have a longer memory ""should know better,"" he added.

Of course, all of this has flummoxed Senate Republicans used to seeing Democrats roll over and play nice. The very fact that the Democrats aren't falling all over themselves to apologize for their actions seems to unnerve them:McConnell should talk to his own caucus about ""uninitiated newcomers."" What he conveniently forgets is that these Democrats are simply the natural antidote to the poison his own Party brought into the chamber and peddled relentlessly these last five years. When the brilliant minds at Americans For Prosperity hatched the ""Tea Party,"" they should have kept in mind Newton's Third Law of Motion.

But that would require them to believe in science."

The Cuccinelli campaign has put its hopes for a come-from-behind victory in energizing base Republican and conservative voters. Walker and Paul both have unique appeal with voters Cuccinelli needs on Tuesday.

Walker will attend two rallies for Cuccinelli on Saturday, appearing in Spotslyvania and Woodbridge, two Northern Virginia suburbs were the Republican needs a strong vote. Ron Paul will attend an evening rally on Monday, the eve of the election in Richmond.

Libertarian candidate Richard Sarvis has unexpectedly polled strongly in the race, attracting around 10% of voters. According to polls, Sarvis is drawing more support away from Cuccinelli than Democrat McAuliffe. Ron Paul has a very strong following among Sarvis supporters and his appearance with Cuccinelli is meant to stem the tide of defections from the Republican.

For most of the campaign, Cuccinelli ran a very conventional race. He downplayed his conservative positions and focused on more narrow Virginia-specific issues. After an exceptionally negative campaign, both he and McAuliffe have high negative ratings with voters. With turnout expected to be low, Cuccinelli is returning to conservative themes to energize grass roots turnout.

On a conference call with reporters on Friday, Cuccinelli, at least twice, mentioned he was the “pro-liberty” candidate. He reiterated his early opposition to ObamaCare. He stressed that Obama’s campaigning this weekend for McAuliffe made the election a “referendum” on ObamaCare. Cuccinelli is, at last, trying to nationalize the election.

McAuliffe’s decision to campaign with President Obama is risky. It is also a sign that the Democrat is worried about his supporters’ enthusiasm. While he has slightly more support among Democrats than Cuccinelli has among Republicans, his high personal negatives could dampen turnout of voters he needs.

Cuccinelli does not hold a lead in any public poll. McAuliffe has held a small, but steady, lead in the polls for several weeks. A Cuccinelli victory on Tuesday would be a big upset, but one that is possible given the expected low turnout.

Scott Walker and Ron Paul excite key segments of the voters Cuccinelli needs. We’ll know Tuesday if it is enough."

[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

(CNN) – He flirted with a presidential run that never materialized in 2012, but Donald Trump is again making forays - serious or otherwise - into White House politics.

The real estate mogul and reality television host trekked to Iowa this weekend, along with other potential 2016 candidates Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, to speak at the evangelical Family Leader Conference.



And he told ABC News that he was willing to spend big on a presidential campaign - that is, if he decides to run for real this time.

“If I did it, I'd spend whatever it took,” Trump told ABC’s “This Week.”

Claiming a fortune of more than $10 billion, the magnate said voters would see a candidate who has “built a great company with a tremendous net worth.”

Many voters, however, still see Trump as the loudest backer of the “birther” movement, which questions President Barack Obama’s birthplace and thus his eligibility to serve as commander in chief.

Trump’s unfulfilled run for the 2012 Republican nomination included his demand that Obama make public his full birth certificate from Hawaii.

The president previously had provided a shorter version that serves as the public record in Hawaii, but amid the media glare on the issue raised in part by Trump's repeated questioning, the president released it in April 2011.

Noting he’s still not convinced the long form certificate is legitimate, Trump said in the interview Sunday that the “birther” issue wouldn’t disqualify him as a candidate, despite widespread condemnation of the issue from most Republicans.

“How does that make me not serious? I mean, I think that resonated with a lot of people,” he said.

During his address at the Family Leader event Saturday, Trump predicted a tough presidential contest in 2016, no matter the GOP candidate.

“Somebody is going to have to emerge who is really smart and really tough,” he said. “Because Obama should have been beaten. Hillary is going to be tougher to beat. And the Republicans have to do what's right. If they don't pick the right person, and I mean, it has to be the perfect person, they are going to get dropped in the 2016 election.”"

Obama was seen as “cool” in 2008, and his popularity spread like wildfire among young voters. Obama and his “Change we can believe in” slogan was a trend in 2008 to which many young Americans were attracted. In 2008 and again in 2012, the Obama campaign used young supporters as precinct captains and boots on the ground. They were enthusiastic voices bringing their friends and neighbors into the campaign. The RNC and Republican candidates need to establish the same network of committed young voters who will help spread our message.

This is not a unique take—the general view of Republicans is that Obama’s success with young voters is a product of some intrinsic “cool” he possesses. If the GOP can mimic that cool, the argument goes, then they’ll make inroads with young people."

“We have seen the character of this president, and the way that he does business,” said Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, explaining why he will oppose any measure.

A push to bring immigration legislation to the House floor, led by an unusual coalition of business executives, prominent conservatives and evangelical leaders, threatens to create another schism in the Republican Party and could have a noticeable effect on campaign contributions before the midterm elections.

“You wake up and it is 25 degrees, and a cow that is giving birth, and you have 400 cows to milk that day, and you don’t have the help you need — that stinks,” Mr. Jones said, citing a shortage of labor that he says could be eased through a new immigration law. “I bet not one of those legislators back there have been in that position.”

The contention centers on what to do with the illegal immigrants already in the country, which Democrats in both chambers say must be addressed in any final deal. Many House Republicans have already expressed support for proposals to strengthen border security and make it easier for high-skilled workers and farm laborers to get visas, all elements of the Senate package.

Pushing back against the pressure to act from within their own party, a core group of conservatives said in interviews this week that they would not be intimidated by corporate America or other outside parties, even though in this case that includes farmers, evangelical leaders and some prominent conservatives.

Steve King, who has characterized Latinos and Hispanics as dope dealers, their calves enlarged to the size of cantaloupes from lugging narcotics across the Rio Grande, will never support any serious reform of immigration policy. But his willingness to publicly disparage the President's character in such an insulting manner says as much about the GOP's prospects in 2016 and beyond as it does about King.The intense lobbying effort is spearheaded by 600 Republican big donors, among them ""conservative leaders in business, agriculture and religion,"" as well as executives of technology companies, all hoping to convince 80 or so Republican Congressmen to sign on to meaningful immigration reform. Some are threatening to shut off their cash spigot to Republican candidates if reforms are not passed. The primary motivation of these ""conservative leaders,"" however, is not to provide a ""path to citizenship"" for undocumented immigrants but to secure cheap labor and fatten their wallets. As one self-professed ""Tea Party"" supporter in the farming industry puts it:Mr. Jones is absolutely correct. Few if any of the rabid Tea Party House members have the experience of milking cows in 25 degree weather, and even fewer of their constituents have. What the Tea Party House members are experienced in, and what their constituents crave, is sticking it to the arrogant black President. Steve King's disrespect and contempt towards President Obama illustrates this beautifully.So Republicans are trapped. Their natural instincts are to jump when big business says jump. And big business is saying that. But the President and the Democrats hold the trump card -- any meaningful reform has to be accompanied by a path to citizenship and fairer treatment of undocumented immigrants. How to explain that to a base of voters that reacts violently to the slightest suggestion of compromise? In districts where (by and large) there is no meaningful Hispanic or Latino presence to drive the debate? The short answer is --you can't. The Tea Party has already demonstrated it has complete control of the Republican House's agenda. They shut the government down and brought the country to the brink of default over a hopeless effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the President's signature achievement. King's remarks about the President's ""character"" reflect the failure of that effort. The idea that they would support any type of legislation the President supports that hasn't even passed yet is simply laughable.We've already seen prominent Republicans laying the groundwork for their retreat on this issue with the lame excuse that the President's refusal to abandon his health care law undermined the prospects for immigration reform. They've even begun to commission artfully crafted polls to reassure themselves that there is no urgency on the issue. Of course, if the GOP were thinking rationally, the only factor worth considering would be Hispanics' and Latinos' increasingly hostile feelings towards their party

But they're not thinking rationally. They're thinking like Steve King, blinded by their own contempt for the President. And they've convinced themselves that they can keep kicking the can down the road:



A growing number of Republicans, however, privately say they see no political advantage for the party to move ahead on immigration legislation right now. They do not expect it to be a critical issue in the 2014 midterms — in fact, some House Republicans may be even more reluctant to take a tough vote on immigration during an election year — and they say it simply needs to be dealt with before the 2016 presidential election. Thus, they say, they are most optimistic about pushing through an overhaul in 2015.

They can tell themselves they'll pass something in 2015, but it's hard to understand how or why--or what. After all, even in 2015 the President will still be black."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/19/Hillary-takes-veiled-shots-at-Obama-in-McAuliffe-endorsement-speech,2013-10-19 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Hillary Takes Veiled Shots at Obama in McAuliffe Endorsement Speech,"FALLS CHURCH, Virginia — While giving a speech endorsing Democrat Terry McAuliffe’s Virginia gubernatorial bid at a small concert and theater venue just outside Washington, D.C., former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took several veiled shots at President Barack Obama and the way her 2008 Democratic primary opponent has run Washington since being first elected five years ago.

While Clinton never mentioned Obama by name, she used innuendo and some indirect references to try to separate herself from the president ahead of what is widely expected to be another run at the White House for her in 2016.

“I thought hard about what I wanted to say to Virginians today,” Clinton opened her remarks by saying. “I’ve been out of politics for a few years now. I’ve had a chance to think a lot about what makes our country so great, what kind of leadership is required to keep it great.”

Later in the speech, Clinton noted her work as Secretary of State and said she has come across leaders worldwide who divide and leaders who unite, a reference to Obama’s aloof and divisive style of politics and leadership.

“I’ve spent four years traveling across the globe, a great honor and privilege to represent all of you,” she said. “I’ve learned even more about what it takes to make the decisions, what it takes to bring people together to build the kind of future that we all want for our children and grandchildren. I’ve seen leaders who are divisive. And I’ve seen leaders who are unifiers. I’ve seen leaders who are exclusive. And I’ve seen leaders who are inclusive.”

A few minutes later, Clinton got even more direct in her criticism of current leadership in Washington, D.C., presumably a reference to both how Republicans and Democrats have handled ongoing policy battles.

“Now recently in Washington, unfortunately, we’ve seen examples of the wrong kind of leadership,” Clinton said. “When politicians choose scorched earth over common ground, when they operate in what I call the ‘evidence-free zone’ with ideology trumping everything else. We’ve seen that families in Virginia and across the country have felt the consequences, workers furloughed, businesses suffering, children thrown out of Head Start, poor mothers worried they won’t get the help they need to buy formula and food for their babies, that is not the kind of leadership we need in Virginia and America today.”

Clinton then touted bipartisanship, something that has been Obama’s weakest trait since being elected–a fact that has been on display even more so in recent weeks during the government shutdown and debt ceiling debate.

“Virginia has a history of getting it right, of electing problem-solving governors like Mark Warner and Tim Kaine,” she said. “We know well that both Mark and Tim reached across the aisle, focused on getting answers to the questions that Virginians had. That is the kind of leader Terry is. That is the kind of governor he will be.”

“For example, when Gov. McDonnell worked with the legislature to make historic investments in transportation that are vital to Virginia’s future, Terry supported him and the legislature every step of the way,” she explained. “Some might say: ‘Why would he do that? It’s a Republican governor and a Republican legislature.’ Well, there’s a simple answer: It was the right thing to do.”

Clinton also took a shot at people who are corrupted by ideology, by special interests, or both–another sideswipe at Obama. Much of the liberal base of the Democratic Party is upset that Obama has not been stricter with Wall Street and is similarly upset that he seems more consumed with ideology than with solving problems.

“If it’s only about yourself, if it’s only about you wanting to get a job and get the perks that go with it and, you know, have people stand up when you come into a room, that’s not enough anymore because it’s hard,” Clinton said. “Politics is hard, as the lieutenant governor and attorney general candidates know, because people are weary.”

“They’re wondering ‘Could I give this person my vote and will he then remember me? If I vote for him or her, will they do what I heard them say they will do? Will they get diverted by big money or ideology or power will they remember who put them into office?'” she continued. “I can tell you, you don’t have to worry about that with Terry McAuliffe.”"

That “self-censoring,” Palin said, meant a campaign where “we weren’t allowed to tell the truth about who the candidate was, Barack Obama.”

“What that got us, this kind of complacency and self-censoring of a campaign where we weren’t allowed to tell the truth about who this candidate was – Barack Obama – what it got us was a list of these scandals,” Palin said.

Palin held up a white piece of paper she dubbed “the redneck version of a whiteboard,” on which she had scrawled the titles of numerous Obama administration scandals – including Fast & Furious, Benghazi and IRS targeting.





Because writing them down somehow makes these 'scandals' worse.And what did the McCain brainiacs' silencing of her attempts to speak the truth about Obama get us? Things like reminding us about the 57 states gaffe? (The irony of Gaffemaster Palin bringing up this incident is rich).It got us scandals! Scandals I tellz ya!

So it's all John McCain and his brainiacs fault. If Sarah Palin had just been allowed to speak the truth, if only Americans knew Barack Obama had visited Bill Ayers in 57 states, she and McCain could have won that election!

Probably the one right thing John McCain did after the historic error of selecting Sarah Palin, half-term governor of Alaska, as his running mate was muzzling her immediately. She most likely was told not to talk about anything at all really. Thank you once again John McCain for giving us Sarah Palin in 2008, and thus Barack Obama."

Terry McAuliffe ekes out victory in Virginia

Democrat Terry McAuliffe won the Virginia governor's race, squeaking by Republican Ken Cuccinelli with the help of voters in the predominantly blue Washington suburbs. McAuliffe's victory in the key swing state was an affirmation of his strategy to portray Cuccinelli, the state attorney general, as a Tea Party champion who is too extreme for Virginia.

Christie wins re-election; seen as prelude to 2016

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie won re-election in a race seen mainly as the kickoff for the next one: the popular Republican is considered a good bet to run for president in 2016. Christie dominated in money, airtime and polls against his opponent, state Democratic Sen. Barbara Buono – but his real opponent may well be any other Republican considering 2016.

Christie's challenger blasts her own party

Democratic Sen. Barbara Buono used her concession speech to offer a blistering critique of her own party. She said: ""We rose above the political system that too often requires surrendering one's values. A system where backroom deals fueled by greed and self-interest are just the order of business. The Democratic political bosses, some elected and some not, made a deal with this governor despite him representing everything they're supposed to be against. They didn't do it to help the state. They did it out of a desire to help themselves politically and financially. But we did it our way and I'm proud of that.""

Bill de Blasio elected mayor of New York

Bill de Blasio was elected mayor of New York, signaling a new era for a city whose new leader promises to undo much of what Michael Bloomberg accomplished. De Blasio, who vowed to narrow the gap between the rich and poor and reform controversial policing tactics, is the first Democrat elected mayor of the nation's largest city since David Dinkins beat Rudy Giuliani in 1989.

Detroit elects first white mayor since 1974

Former Detroit Medical Center chief Mike Duggan consistently led Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon in polls. Duggan will be the first white mayor since 1974 in the majority-black city. He faces hefty problems, not the least of which is the city's $20 billion bankruptcy, and will have little power until the tenure of an emergency city manager ends.

Warning flags for Tea Party

The staying power of the conservative movement that burst onto the scene four years ago was called into question in this year's marquee contests. Tea Party nemesis Chris Christie swept to a landslide re-election as governor in New Jersey, a case study in how more moderate Republicans can carry even Democratic-leaning states. Tea Party favorite Ken Cuccinelli lost a closer race against Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor in Virginia, a contest establishment Republicans thought they could have won with a more mainstream candidate.

Colorado pot tax & secession

Voters approved a 25% tax on newly legal recreational marijuana to fund school construction. Opponents argued the tax rate would benefit black market sales.

Voters in at least six of 11 affected rural Colorado counties voted down a proposal night to secede from the state. Results were still being tallied.

Washington state rejects GMO labels

Washington state voters rejected 55% to 45% an initiative that would have required foods containing genetically engineered ingredients to be labeled. The initiative was part of an ongoing national fight by those opposed to genetically engineered crops to push for labeling. Food industry ads claimed that the initiative would raise food prices.

Houston Astrodome doomed

Texas voters rejected a plan to authorize bonds to turn the Houston Astrodome, the world's first multipurpose domed stadium, into a giant convention and event center and exhibition space. The outcome means the stadium is likely to be torn down.

New Jersey minimum wage increase

New Jersey voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment Tuesday to raise the minimum wage by $1, to $8.25 an hour, and add automatic cost-of-living increases each year.

Election Day oddity

In Takoma Park, 16- and 17-year-olds hopped in line to vote. In May, Takoma Park City Council voted to become the first city in the United States to lower its voting age from 18 to 16.

Cory Booker, the charismatic Newark mayor who won a national following via Twitter and his own heroics, was elected to the U.S. Senate Wednesday.

Booker, a Democrat, easily defeated Republican Steve Lonegan, the former mayor of Bogota, N.J., in a special election to fill the seat held by Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who died in June.

Booker is New Jersey's first African-American senator and the only elected black Senator in the upper house. Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina was appointed in January to fill the seat of Sen. Jim DeMint, who resigned.

""Thank you so much, New Jersey, I'm proud to be your senator-elect,'' Booker tweeted minutes after the Associated Press declared him the winner.

Addressing supporters at a victory party, Booker said he will go to Washington ""to engage in the kind of hard, humble service that reaches out to others."" He also paid an emotional tribute to his father, Cary, who died last week. ""Death can end a life, but it cannot end a love,"" Booker said.

The unusual date for the special election -- a Wednesday less than a month before the November legislative and gubernatorial election -- was set by Republican Gov. Chris Christie. The end of nine-week campaign, hard fought between Booker and Lonegan, coincided with 16-day government shutdown.

Booker, who is in his second term as mayor of the state's largest city, made much of his ability to cross party lines and reach compromise, often citing his experience working with Republican Gov. Chris Christie on education and economic development in Newark.

As he voted Wednesday, Booker called the election ""a chance to make a statement about what is going on in Washington.''

Voters who came to cast ballots at Firehouse #3 in Teaneck, N.J., in the northern part of the state, had the congressional stalemate on their minds. Leonard Hospidor, 42, an audio engineer, voted with one goal: ""Stopping the madness.''

Hospidor voted for Booker. But his vote was ""not just a partisan thing as it is so much trying to restore a little bit of sanity to the process,'' he said. ""It's gotten out of control, the crazy thing, and it's a little bit embarrassing.''

Lonegan, former state director of a Tea Party-supporting group, Americans for Prosperity, said he supported the government shutdown, calling it ""a good way to find out which government services are essential,'' and as a way to stop the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

Michael Diehl, 47, a computer technician who voted for Lonegan, said he also favored the shutdown ""If that's what it takes to get them to stop spending down in Washington,'' He patted his shirt pocket. ""I've got a mortgage (payment) check in my pocket right now,'' he said. ""I've got to make that money, I can't keep putting it on a credit card. I've got to pay my bills.''

The shutdown ""hurts my heart,'' said Glenda Hadnott, 60, a partner in an accounting consulting firm. ""How do you let this great country all of a sudden have no money to pay Social Security or the military because you're playing some game?"" she asked.

Hadnott voted for Booker because ""I do not want to see another Republican in there. I don't feel the Republicans care about the middle class and poor.''

""Besides, I love Cory Booker,'' she added. ""It's not because of his color,'' but because he is an ""open personality,'' said Hadnott, who is African-American. ""Cory will go out on the street and Cory will talk to anybody, and he won't put himself on a pedestal.''

Booker entered the race a heavy favorite: New Jersey has not elected a Republican to the Senate since 1972. With a big fundraising advantage, he largely ignored Lonegan until the final two weeks, when opinion polls showed the race tightening to low double-digits. Then Booker began returning Lonegan's fire, calling the Republican an ""extremist'' and pointing out Lonegan's opposition to abortion rights and same-sex marriage.

Long considered a rising Democratic star, Booker was able to call on President Obama, who carried New Jersey by nearly 17 percentage points last year, to make a last-minute video on his behalf.

Lonegan mocked Booker as ""a tweeter, not a leader.'' Booker's fondness for Twitter – where he has 1.4 million followers -- held through Election Day, when he tweeted at least 50 times, compared with about a dozen by Lonegan.

""I worry that he's too much hype and not enough substance,'' said Katie Norris, 47, a copy editor. A Democrat, she voted for Booker regardless. ""Compared with Lonegan – I was not a fan,'' she said.

But Denise Eberly, 38, a theater technician, said Booker is simply communicating in a way that's important for an elected official. Booker's high social media profile is to his credit. ""There's something to be said about being able to reach people and use the media that's available.''

When Booker replaces Sen. Jeff Chiesa, a Republican appointed by Christie to fill the seat vacated by Lautenberg, Senate Democrats gain an additional vote. That will widen their majority to 55, including two independents who generally vote Democratic, to 45 Republicans.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/26/elizabeth-warren-supreme-court_n_3997916.html,2013-09-26 00:00:00,['Reporter'],Elizabeth Warren: 'We Face A Clear Danger' In Campaign Finance Supreme Court Case,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) warned Thursday that a coming Supreme Court case that could ultimately eliminate certain campaign contribution limits is a ""clear danger"" that threatens to expand the influence of large and wealthy corporations on elections.

The case -- McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, set to be argued on Oct. 8 -- challenges the aggregate limit on campaign contributions that an individual donor can make in a single election. Currently, a donor may only give $123,300 in total, made up of sub-limits of $48,600 to candidates and $74,600 to party committees and PACs.

The plaintiff, Alabama businessman Shaun McCutcheon, hopes that the court will eliminate these limits, arguing earlier this year that the issue is ""a very important First Amendment case about freedom of speech.""

On Thursday, speaking at an event held by the Constitutional Accountability Center, Warren argued, ""If the court continues in the direction of Citizens United, we may move another step closer to neutering Congress' ability to limit the influence of money in politics and another step closer to unlimited corporate contributions given directly to candidates and political committees.""

Warren also endorsed the research of her former academic colleague, Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, on the framers of the Constitution's original definition of corruption and on the ways in which Congress has become warped by monied interests.

Lessig, who followed Warren Thursday with a presentation on his research, sought to frame the McCutcheon case, and the money-in-politics issue generally, in terms the conservative justices on the Supreme Court would respond to. Lessig and the Constitutional Accountability Center have filed an amicus brief in the McCutcheon case based on his research and arguments.

The Supreme Court -- most dramatically in the 2010 Citizens United decision -- has stated that the only type of corruption able to be regulated is quid pro quo, cash-for-votes corruption. But, according to Lessig, this is not the way the framers understood corruption and, thus, neither should the five conservative justices on the court.

Two chapters from the Federalist Papers are of particular interest to Lessig. In Federalist 52, James Madison writes that the federal government created by the Constitution should have at least one branch ""dependent upon the people alone."" In Federalist 57, Madison writes that the people on whom that branch depends should be ""not the rich, more than the poor.""

Lessig argued that the oversized reliance of members of Congress on their campaign donors is an institutional corruption of the dependence that Congress is supposed to have ""upon the people alone."" The foundation for his argument is a number of statements and writings by the framers concerning corruption of this nature -- evidence a constitutional originalist would take into consideration.

Lessig said he had found at least 325 specific instances in which the framers used the term corruption (collected here in a Tumblr blog). Of those, only six explained corruption as a trading of favors, while there were 29 mentions of corruption as an ""improper dependence."" He also found that 57 percent of the mentions of corruption were about institutions, rather than individuals.

This argument is designed to paint into a corner the five conservative justices, who commonly favor eliminating campaign finance limits, by suggesting that their efforts conflict with the original intent of the framers.

In the McCutcheon case, he argued, the elimination of campaign contribution limits would likely reduce the overall number of donors to campaigns and, thus, make Congress even more dependent upon an even smaller slice of donors, who are not representative of the people. Lessig used research done by National Institute of Money in State Politics executive director Ed Bender that shows that contribution limits expand the number of donors while the elimination of contribution limits reduces the number of donors.

""If you eliminate the cap on aggregate contributions, the number of funders in the system will fall even more than it has so far,"" Lessig said. ""And if the number of funders drop, then the dependence corruption within the system, as I've just described it, only gets worse.""

But Lessig said he is optimistic that the justices will look at the McCutcheon case and the original definition of corruption used by the framers and form a strong majority to uphold the aggregate campaign contribution limits."

Born In San Francisco', 'He S A Graduate Of Stanford University.']",Dance of the GOP governors,"Don’t look now, but auditions for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination are already underway in Washington. And the flavor of the moment is — governors.

First came Chris Christie, the pugnacious governor of New Jersey, who won reelection by a landslide last month and almost immediately headed to the nation’s capital for a burst of speeches and television appearances.

Days later, a less pyrotechnic (but equally combative) chief executive arrived to do the Washington media rounds: Scott Walker of Wisconsin. His message was the same: “If we can do it in Wisconsin, we can do it anywhere, even in the nation’s capital.”

The point wasn’t subtle. As broken as Washington is, the next president should be an outsider, a hardworking governor, say, who has managed to tame a rebellious legislature and balance his budget.

Advertisement

It’s a message likely to play well with American voters (and not only Republicans) who have long believed that executive experience is a better qualification for aspiring presidents than time in the windy halls of Congress.

Barack Obama was the first legislator elected to the White House in almost half a century, and his wobbly performance managing the launch of his own Affordable Care Act could affect other senators’ chances for years.

Neither Christie nor Walker has announced that he’s running for president, but — refreshingly — neither pretends to be uninterested either.

To many Republicans, yearning for a primary contest less chaotic than the messy epic that produced Mitt Romney in 2012, that field looks decent already: two successful governors — a relatively moderate conservative from the Northeast and a more orthodox conservative from the Midwest.

Christie’s already nationally famous, if only for his battles with his weight (tamed last year by bariatric surgery) and his penchant for dressing down reporters (and occasionally voters) with words like “idiot.” And a CNN/ORC International poll released Friday declared Christie the early front-runner in the Republican race.

But who is Scott Walker?

At a breakfast with reporters in Washington last month — one of the obligatory stops for any politician thinking about running for president — the taciturn, understated Walker joked that he’s just like Christie but “with a Midwestern filter.”

“I’m willing to speak out, but I’m not going to call you an idiot,” he said.

Marc Thiessen, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush who collaborated with Walker on a recent book (another requisite pre-campaign step), described him this way: “Moderate in temperament but immoderate in policy.”

Walker, 46, was elected governor of Wisconsin in 2010 and, when confronting a budget deficit, made an audacious decision: Instead of raising taxes or cutting state services, he went to war with public employee unions over their contracts. The new governor initially proposed to eliminate collective bargaining, but he bowed to advisors who urged him to focus instead on cutting employees’ generous benefits, which exceeded what most private-sector workers enjoyed.

The ensuing battles included a virtual occupation of the state Capitol by protesters, the flight of 14 Democratic state senators across the state line to Illinois in a failed attempt to prevent a vote and a 2012 recall election that Walker won by a convincing margin.

Along the way, he also cut taxes, turned the state’s budget deficit into a surplus — and became a hero to fiscal conservatives across the country.

Advertisement

Now, Walker says, he’d like to bring the lessons of his experience in Wisconsin to Washington, even if only in advising his party’s next presidential nominee, who he thinks (surprise!) should be a governor.

His message is that rugged fiscal conservatism can win support from voters in the center, as long as it’s consistent, unwavering and focused on increasing economic opportunity for all. As evidence, he points to polls that show that 11% of Wisconsin voters supported both him and Obama last year.

“We need to do more than simply say no,” he writes in his book. “The way to win the center is to champion bold, positive reforms that make people’s lives better.”

That means focusing on the economy and jobs and the size of government, not on the arid federal budget issues that have captured Congress (“debt limits are not relevant to people’s lives”) or even the social issues that have dominated Republican primary races in years past.

Advertisement

“I’m pro-life,” Walker said. “I don’t apologize for that. But I don’t focus on it; I don’t obsess with it.”

Above all, capturing the center means reaching out to minorities and low-income people, he says, and avoiding the trap Romney fell into of dismissing the bottom 47% as unreachable for Republicans.

“Republicans need to reclaim their position as the party of upward mobility and opportunity for all,” Walker writes, citing Ronald Reagan as a conservative who appealed to blue-collar workers as well as business owners.

Which is a fine idea, so fine that almost every GOP candidate in memory, including Romney, has said it more than once.

Advertisement

The challenge none of the potential candidates has met is to show how they’d do it. For all the critiques Walker and Christie have been willing to sling at Washington, they’ve been shy on specific remedies.

And Republicans in Congress, including Wisconsin Rep. Paul D. Ryan and Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, aren’t likely to concede that a governor would make a better president. But at this early stage, the momentum in the GOP race belongs to governors.

In an interview released Sunday with The New Republic's Franklin Foer and Chris Hughes, Obama labeled media as one of the ""biggest factors"" in upcoming conversations, scripting his ideal for how the relationship between the two forces should change.

""If a Republican member of Congress is not punished on Fox News or by Rush Limbaugh for working with a Democrat on a bill of common interest, then you'll see more of them doing it,"" Obama said.

Most recently, Limbaugh had a flair for the divisive during the fiscal cliff talks, encouraging members of the GOP to refrain from negotiating with the president.

""I would suggest to people who really believe Obama is concerned about his second term and his legacy -- he doesn't want a recession -- the only way to flush that out is to come dangerously close to allowing it all to happen,"" said Limbaugh in late November.

Obama linked that point to John Boehner in the TNR interview, adding that he thought the House Speaker ""genuinely wanted to get a deal done,"" but was impacted by vulnerability to attacks from more conservative streams of the Republican Party.

Boehner barely retained his House Speaker role, leaving the holiday talks in an embattled state after many members of his caucus were displeased with the terms of the agreement.

While the president specifically named some names of the right-wing contingency, he added that the left is far from immune to the ""same dynamic."" Yet those networks in his estimation, and Democrats alike, are less obstinate to some give and take.

""I think the difference is just that the more left-leaning media outlets recognize that compromise is not a dirty word,"" he said. ""And I think at least leaders like myself—and I include Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi in this -- are willing to buck the more absolutist-wing elements in our party to try to get stuff done.""

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — As voters in some states cast ballots Tuesday, warning signs flared for Tea Party forces and the Democratic Party about their prospects in the broader and more critical midterm elections precisely one year from now.

The staying power of the conservative movement that burst onto the scene four years ago was called into question in this year's marquee contests. Tea Party nemesis Chris Christie swept to a landslide re-election as governor in New Jersey, a case study in how more moderate Republicans can carry even Democratic-leaning states. Tea Party favorite Ken Cuccinelli lost a closer race against Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor in Virginia, a contest establishment Republicans thought they could have won with a more mainstream candidate.

Still, Democrats saw looming problems of their own on the horizon — not so much in returns from the off-year elections but in the roiling furor over the flawed rollout of the federal health care exchange. One key official, Marilyn Tavenner, was grilled at a Senate hearing Tuesday, and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was slated to be back on the hot seat Wednesday at another hearing on Capitol Hill.

For yet another election, Obamacare seems to be emerging as the defining issue of 2014. This time, the controversy over the president's signature legislative achievement is gaining traction not as a result of Republican attacks but through administration fumbles.

""Certainly, other issues may rise and fall — but Obamacare is the constant that runs through this election,"" says Oregon Rep. Greg Walden, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee and a critic of the Affordable Care Act.

Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., who supports the law, warned Tavenner at Tuesday's hearing that enrollment snafus with the launch of the HealthCare.gov website last month had created a ""crisis of confidence.""

At stake next year is more than bragging rights. Republicans have their best shot in the foreseeable future to regain control of the Senate. Democrats harbor long-shot hopes of getting back a majority in the House of Representatives. Thirty-six states, including a half-dozen swing states in national elections, will elect governors.

And for the president, the 2014 elections will shape how ambitious his legislative agenda realistically can be for his final two years in office, how many congressional investigations he is likely to face, and the degree to which his presidency will have charted a new course for the Democratic Party or left it weaker.

The midterms are likely also to be a test for the Tea Party movement, which tapped voter outrage over passage of the Affordable Care Act to help Republicans gain control of the House in 2010.

REMEMBER THE SHUTDOWN?

To be sure, prognostication is a dangerous sport in politics.

A year ago, Obama scored a historic victory, becoming the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win two presidential terms with more than 50% of the vote. Obama predicted then — inaccurately, as it has turned out — that his win would ""break the fever"" in Washington and persuade Republicans to cooperate on issues such as immigration.

Just a month ago, Democratic hopes for 2014 were buoyed when voters were inclined to blame Republican lawmakers for the 16-day government shutdown, driving approval ratings for the GOP to new lows. The non-partisan Cook Political Report then shifted the ratings on 15 House races, moving 14 of them in the Democrats' direction.

That was then.

""Democratic pols had been gleefully anticipating the negative impact the Republican Party would incur as a result of the recent government shutdown debacle,"" Charlie Cook wrote in a National Journal column Tuesday. ""Now Democrats are shaking their heads over signs that much of the advantage they might have gained has been effectively neutralized"" by Obamacare's problems.

Democrats not only are shaking their heads. Some are urging the administration to delay key deadlines in the health care law. At Tuesday's hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., urged Tavenner to put off penalties for consumers if the website wasn't working in December. Tavenner is administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the website for the federal health care exchange.

Eleven Democratic senators have endorsed an appeal by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire that the administration give consumers more time to sign up. The group has some common characteristics: Seven of the 11 are in potentially competitive re-election races next year, and one of the others is Michael Bennet of Colorado, who just happens to chair the Democrats' Senate campaign committee.

Republicans need a net gain of six seats to win control in the Senate. The two most endangered Senate Democrats running for re-election are Mark Pryor of Arkansas, who is likely to face Republican Rep. Tom Cotton, and Mark Begich of Alaska. The GOP also is favored to pick up seats where Democratic incumbents are retiring in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia.

In the House, Democrats need a net gain of 17 seats to regain control.

The 36 gubernatorial races include contests in some of the states that play big roles in presidential elections, among them Florida, Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. On Monday, former Florida governor Charlie Crist, a Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat, announced he would seek his old job back, challenging Republican Gov. Rick Scott.

BEST CASE, WORST CASE

At a panel at the Brookings Institution think tank Tuesday discussing the 2014 midterms, not one of the academics and political analysts on the dais raised a hand when asked whether it's possible the Affordable Care Act could have enough of a turnaround to be an asset for Democratic candidates next year.

The best-case scenario for Democrats would be that the issue recedes, says Elaine Kamarck, a veteran of the Clinton White House. The worst case? ""They don't fix the technical problems with the sites and the insurance companies use the law as an excuse to drop or change a lot of benefits,"" she says. ""And people get really, really mad about it.""

At the moment, the issue of Obamacare splits the electorate down the middle, surveys of voters as they left polling places showed. In Virginia, just under 50% supported the Affordable Care Act, just over 50% opposed it. Democrat McAuliffe got nine of 10 votes of those who supported it. Republican Cuccinelli got eight of 10 votes among those who opposed it.

The onslaught of negative news about the Affordable Care Act in the past week or so was one possible explanation analysts gave for a closer-than-expected race for Virginia governor. ""Obamacare is a problem,"" Stu Rothenberg of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report said in a tweet. ""It's an obviously conclusion from close VA results.""

A series of deadlines will keep Obamacare in the news. The administration has promised to release enrollment numbers by Nov. 15; early indications are that they will be embarrassingly small. Obama has promised to fix the website by Nov. 30; a failure to fulfill that promise would intensify demands for delay.

The deadline to enroll for coverage that starts at the beginning of the year is Dec. 15. The deadline to enroll and avoid having to pay a penalty has been set at March 31.

By then, the midterm elections should be raging.

We don’t need to have a discussion about whether or not Christie is a yeller, right? You just have to call up that video of him pursuing a heckler down the boardwalk, waving an ice cream cone. And while Christie is probably not any more in love with himself than your average major league politician, he is a little less good about concealing it. Dan Balz of The Washington Post interviewed him for the newly released book, “Collision 2012,” in which Christie happily recounts the way the rich and powerful begged him to run for the White House. (Henry Kissinger, the governor reported, told him: “Being a successful president is about two things, courage and character: You have both, and your country needs you.”)

Also, we all remember the Christie keynote speech at the Republican convention, in which he told the crowd how wonderful he had made things in his home state and urged them to support whatshisname, who would carry out the New Jersey agenda in Washington. (Before which, Balz reports, the governor had a meltdown over plans to cut his introductory video in the interest of time and threatened to either walk away or go onstage and say the world’s most popular obscenity on live TV.)"

The New York Times on Wednesday published an in-depth report detailing the move, as well as some of the behind-the-scenes tensions within the Clinton Foundation, which is about to accommodate the work and ambitions of all three members of the immediate Clinton family -- Bill, Hillary and their daughter Chelsea. It is also being renamed the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation.

The Times reports that Hillary Clinton plans to move her staff into offices at the foundation's Manhattan headquarters in the coming weeks. The new digs will be just blocks from most major news organizations, including across the street from NBC News, which gave daughter Chelsea a job and is planning to run a controversial miniseries on Hillary Clinton's life.

Clinton reportedly will focus on new initiatives covering women, jobs and other areas. The foundation, should she choose to run for president in 2016, would provide a high-profile perch for Clinton to stay in the public eye in the interim.

Among the staffers expected to move from Washington to New York are long-time aide Huma Abedin, wife of New York mayoral candidate and former congressman Anthony Weiner.

But the foundation itself is grappling with internal debates and problems concerning the group's finances and the role of long-time Clinton aides, the Times reports.

The foundation ran a $40 million deficit in 2007 and 2008. While some blamed the recession, it still ran a deficit of more than $8 million last year.

The Times reports that some in the organization have also raised concerns about the role of Clinton ally Douglas Band, who was helping run a consulting firm while also working on the Clinton Global Initiative. The firm and the Clintons' world reportedly were deeply intertwined, with Bill Clinton previously working as a paid adviser at the firm, while the firm brought in clients who also donated to the foundation.

The article also reported on tension regarding the prominent role in the foundation of Ira C. Magaziner. Band reportedly wanted Magaziner fired, but Bill Clinton refused."

@SCOTUSblog Sec 4 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional. 5-4. Per CJ Roberts.

The Supreme Court has struck down part of the Voting Rights Act. According to analysis from NBC's Pete Williams, the court upheld the Section 5 notion of preclearance—requiring locales with history of racial discrimination to preclear any changes of their voting laws with the Department of Justice—but struck down the map identifying which areas must be subject to preclearance. According to Williams, this means Congress could, in theory, pass a law creating a new map of locales subject to preclearance. Assuming the Court approved the map, it would go into effect. On a practical level, however, it essentially means the end of preclearance because there's virtually no chance of Congress agreeing on a new map. Therefore, given the current Congress, the effect of the ruling is to render Section 5 moot, although in theory at some point in the future it's conceivable that a new map could be drawn that would revive Section 5.

Here's the ruling.

@jeffzeleny ""What the Supreme Court did was to put a dagger in the heart of the Voting Rights Act,"" John Lewis tells me.

President Obama issues this statement:



I am deeply disappointed with the Supreme Court’s decision today. For nearly 50 years, the Voting Rights Act – enacted and repeatedly renewed by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress – has helped secure the right to vote for millions of Americans. Today’s decision invalidating one of its core provisions upsets decades of well-established practices that help make sure voting is fair, especially in places where voting discrimination has been historically prevalent.

As a nation, we’ve made a great deal of progress towards guaranteeing every American the right to vote. But, as the Supreme Court recognized, voting discrimination still exists. And while today’s decision is a setback, it doesn’t represent the end of our efforts to end voting discrimination. I am calling on Congress to pass legislation to ensure every American has equal access to the polls. My Administration will continue to do everything in its power to ensure a fair and equal voting process.

It’s a little known fact that the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee the right to vote for everyone, but we are fighting to change this. Please sign the petition to join Daily Kos, Color of Change, and a growing movement to pass a constitutional amendment guaranteeing and protecting the freedom to vote for all."

People outside of Virginia may be more interested in the proof that 13 years after the contested presidential balloting in Florida, U.S. elections remain rife with small, but sometimes critical, mistakes.

Unlike Florida in 2000, however, the effort to correct the errors in the Virginia race has been eagerly watched over – and in some cases spurred on – by a small but eager corps of election devotees who have pored over preliminary vote numbers available on the Internet looking for anomalies and trumpeting their discoveries on Twitter.

Obenshain led on election night last Tuesday, and at one point had a margin of more than 1,000 votes over Herring. That margin began to erode as officials in the state’s cities and counties began reviewing their tallies. Local officials have until midnight Tuesday to present a certified count to the state election board.

Most of the errors officials discovered were small – a transposed number here, a mathematical error in adding up vote totals there. But on Friday, officials in Fairfax County, the state’s most populous, discovered a voting machine in a heavily Democratic area that had malfunctioned. Nearly 2,000 votes had not been counted, and when they were, the race became a near tie.

Monday afternoon, attention shifted to the state capital, Richmond, where GOP officials had asked for a review of eight majority-Democratic precincts where they said irregularities might have occurred. Their request for a review backfired badly.

The local election board, which has a 2-1 Republican majority, found that voting machine No. 3791 in precinct No. 501 had never been counted. The 190 votes on that machine went overwhelmingly to Herring, giving him a statewide lead of 115 votes.

Meantime, election boards also have to rule on provisional ballots, cast by voters who for one reason or another were unable to use a regular ballot on election day. Several hundred provisional ballots remain to be reviewed on Tuesday, mostly in Fairfax. A legal dispute already has flared over the process for determining which of those ballots are valid.

Once officials have certified the results, the loser can request a recount. Both parties already have begun soliciting contributions to pay for further challenges. The race may not finally be settled until sometime next month.

(CNN) – Another member of the Bush family is making a bid for office in Texas.

George P. Bush, the eldest son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, filed paperwork in the Lone Star State to run for land commissioner, a post that's seen as a jumping-off point for more prominent statewide office.



""If you believe, as I do, that Texas is truly an exceptional place with a rich heritage and a future of unbound potential, then I ask for your support as I run for Texas Land commissioner in 2014,"" Bush said in the two minute, forty-five second spot.

In the video, he discusses traveling all over Texas in the last few months, weighing a decision about running for office. He said there was one person in particular who truly inspired him.

""You probably know her as former first lady Barbara Bush, but to me she's just Ganny. The lesson Ganny taught me? The importance of public service, and I have tried to live up to those values,"" he said.

He mentions his time teaching at a public high school, helping organizations like Big Brothers and Big Sisters in North Texas and serving in the naval reserve.

""I am again constantly reminded that as Texans, we are exceptional people,"" he said.

As land commissioner, he vowed to address issues involving veterans affairs, education funding, energy policy, natural resources, coastline problems, and historical archives.

The land commissioner in Texas is responsible for state-owned land and mineral rights, and is regarded as a stepping stone for higher statewide office. The current lieutenant governor of Texas, David Dewhurst, previously served as land commissioner.

""Texas Land Commissioner is a great fit for George P. Bush,"" Austin-based Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak said, pointing to Bush's experience in education and his military service, which included a deployment to Afghanistan.

""He will likely escape a serious primary, while raising significant money, helping down ballot candidates, growing the Republican Party and building his own statewide organization. His future in Texas is very bright,"" Mackowiak said.

Bush, who first filed documents with the Texas Ethics Commission to run for office in November, co-founded the group Hispanic Republicans of Texas, billed as the first Texas-based political action committee that recruits Hispanic candidates for political office. His mother hails from Mexico.

Bush has deep ties to Texas - his uncle George W. Bush served as governor before being elected president, and the younger Bush attended Rice University and the University of Texas School of Law.

He hit the trail as a top surrogate for George W. Bush during both of his presidential campaigns, though earlier this year said he had ""no specific plans"" to run for office.

A Texas conservative activist, who asked to remain anonymous so as to speak candidly, said the land commission post was a ""slam dunk"" for Bush.

""Remember, he supported [Conservative senator] Ted Cruz early and took a risk there. He's considered to be more conservative than his grandpa and uncle W. I doubt anyone will even pose a real challenge,"" the activist said.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/27/big-week-in-washington-stoked-talk-clinton-biden-running-in-2016/,2013-01-27 00:00:00,[],"Big week in Washington stoked talk of Clinton, Biden running in 2016","Two of Washington’s biggest events last week -- the presidential inauguration and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s testimony on Benghazi -- also turned out to be early-but-critical moments for two top potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidates.

Vice President Biden moved across Washington -- even breaking into a jog along the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route -- like a man clearly excited about 2016 possibilities.

His private swearing-in ceremony was attended by New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, who would be a key ally in the state's first-in-the-nation primary. And he attended the State Society Inaugural Ball for Iowa, whose caucus results can kick-start a presidential run.

Meanwhile, Clinton’s long-awaited Capitol Hill testimony on the Sept. 11, 2012, deaths of four Americans at a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, essentially put the issue to rest for supporters but agitated critics who would be certain to revive the debate should Clinton run in four years.

“We don't know why the president and the secretary of state ignored the warnings,” Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain told ABC’s “This Week.” “There are so many questions that are unanswered.”

Biden’s demeanor last week and over the past few months prompted a Democrat close to the White House to tell Politico that the vice president is “ intoxicated by the idea.”

Political observers have said the Democratic field would be instantly cleared should Clinton, who has insisted she is exhausted and finished with public office, decide to run. The former first lady and New York senator would return as a more experienced politician than the one who lost to Obama in 2008. And her approval rating late last year was as high as 75 percent, according to one poll.

However, the recent emergence of Biden, whose middle-class appeal helped Obama get re-elected, has sparked debate about who the president would support and who might or might not step aside.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney tried Wednesday to tamp down speculation, two days after the public inauguration, by saying: “For the sake and sanity of all involved, it's worth taking a bit of a break from presidential election year politics.""

Biden will be nearly 74 on Election Day 2016. But he is well aware of how campaigns work and the energy that is needed, after unsuccessful bids in 1988 and 2008.

In addition, the former Delaware senator has compiled a list domestic and foreign policy achievements in Washington, even as his occasional off-script moments have become fodder for Republican critics. In fact, Biden helped reach a deal several weeks ago with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to avert the fiscal crisis.

""There's a whole lot of reasons why I wouldn't run,"" Biden told CNN before the inauguration. ""I don't have to make that decision for a while. In the meantime, there's one thing I know I have to do, no matter what I do. I have to help this president move this country to the next stage.""

Biden also has good, fresh contacts with members of the Democratic ground game in such key states as Florida, Iowa, Ohio and New Hampshire. And he has a decent approval rating -- 49 percent according to the most recent New York Times/CBS poll.

""It seems obvious that he's going to keep that option open for himself and do the right things,"" said Mike Gronstal, the Democratic leader of the Iowa state Senate.

Prior to the recent Biden talk, young Democratic Govs. Andrew Cuomo, New York, and Martin O’Malley, Maryland, each appeared to have a clear path toward a potential nomination.

Though they now might have to wait, both are pushing ahead with a legislative agenda like the one voters supported in re-electing Obama.

What issues might emerge during the next presidential election cycle remains unclear.

But Cuomo has already gotten the state legislature to pass his proposal for tougher gun laws, in the wake of the shootings last month inside a Connecticut elementary school in which 20 first-graders and six adults were killed.

He has also proposed a “Reproductive Health Act"" as part of a 10-point plan to advance ""women's equality"" that is expected to include language that would allow abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy if it is ""necessary to protect a woman's health.""

O’Malley, who was a frequent advocate for Obama through the 2012 election cycle, must leave the Maryland state house because of term limits. But last year he started a federal Political Action Committee that allows him to raise money for future office.

He also already this year has renewed efforts to bring offshore wind energy to Maryland, called for more early voting on Election Day and wants to restricts mental-health patients' access to firearms as part of his gun-control plan.

http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/new-rove-group-could-backfire-on-g-o-p/,2013-02-11 00:00:00,['Nate Silver'],New Rove Group Could Backfire on G.O.P.,"The strategist Karl Rove and his allies last week announced the formation of Conservative Victory Project, a new “super PAC” designed to lend support to what they see as more electable candidates in Republican Senate primaries.

The effort makes plenty of sense on the surface. Republican primary voters nominated a series of inexperienced and extremely conservative candidates in Senate races in 2010 and 2012, often with the support of the Tea Party and other insurgent groups. It can be argued that they lost as many as a half-dozen Senate races as a result, including the contests in Delaware and Nevada in 2010 and in Missouri and Indiana last year.

But conservative groups and activists have reacted very harshly to the announcement, while some conservative candidates who are potential targets of the group, like Representative Steve King of Iowa, have already sought to raise money off the backlash to it.

An analysis of Republican Senate primaries in 2010 and 2012 suggests that money is usually the least pressing problem for the incumbents and other establishment-backed candidates whom Mr. Rove’s group might be inclined to support. Instead, some insurgent candidates won their races despite having been at more than a 10-to-1 fund-raising disadvantage heading into the primary.

The table below reflects 23 Senate races between 2010 and 2012 in which an establishment-backed candidate squared off against an insurgent candidate in a Republican Senate primary. There are some judgment calls required in selecting the races, particularly because the Tea Party consists of no one single group but instead an informal network of organizations that tend to back highly conservative candidates. In other cases, some candidates, like former Representative Pat Toomey in the Pennsylvania Senate primary in 2010, tended to be supported by both Tea Party and establishment groups; these instances are excluded. The list includes a number of relatively obscure candidates. I do require, however, that the candidates listed were viable enough to have filed at least one fund-raising report with the Federal Election Commission.

Photo

These issues aside, the overall message from the data should be reasonably clear. The establishment candidates substantially outraised the insurgents, by an average of $4.3 million to $1.2 million based on the last Federal Election Commission reports that the candidates filed in advance of the primary. (The difference in median fund-raising totals, which reduces the influence of outliers, is just as substantial: about $3 million for the establishment candidates versus about $400,000 for the insurgents.)

And yet, the insurgent candidates won 11 of 23 races, or nearly half the contests. Joe Miller of Alaska did so in 2010 despite being at nearly a 20-to-1 fund-raising disadvantage against the incumbent Lisa Murkowski. Christine O’Donnell of Delaware defeated Representative Mike Castle that year despite having raised about $260,000 to Mr. Castle’s $3.2 million.

Does that mean there is literally no benefit to having more money in a Republican primary? Not exactly; as the chart below suggests, there is a modest but positive correlation between the share of the funds that went to the establishment candidate and that candidate’s margin of victory or defeat.

Photo

However, the relationship is much weaker than it is in general elections for the Senate, when fund-raising totals have about twice as much power to predict the margin between the Democratic and Republican candidates. (The chart below reflects all Senate general elections between 1990 and 2010 in which both the Democratic and Republican candidate were viable enough to have filed at least one F.E.C. report.)

Photo

Moreover, it is not clear that the correlation implies a strong causal link. Better fund-raising totals can serve as evidence that a campaign is well-organized, or has more grass roots support, which are indicators of candidate strength regardless of how the candidate actually deploys her financial resources. But if a superPAC spends a large sum in support of a candidate — or a candidate makes a large contribution to her own campaign — that money may not go far if the candidate is otherwise having a difficult time persuading voters of her merits. (Largely self-funded candidates, such as Linda McMahon of Connecticut and Carly Fiorina of California, have poor track records in recent years despite having gargantuan budgets.)

This may hold especially true in Senate primaries because they usually feature very light turnouts. (Ms. O’Donnell’s win over Mr. Castle in 2010, for example, came with a turnout of only about 58,000 voters in Delaware, representing about 30 percent of Delaware’s population of registered Republicans and less than 10 percent of Delaware registered voters of all parties.) The voters who do turn out in Republican Senate primaries are likely to be highly informed consumers of conservative-friendly news media outlets such as talk radio, prime-time shows on Fox News and conservative magazines and blogs. They may also weigh the endorsements of prominent conservative politicians and organizations. An insurgent candidate who is presented in a favorable light in these outlets may have plenty of ability to reach her target voters, even if she is spending little or nothing on paid advertisements and outreach efforts.

Mr. Rove’s efforts could backfire, therefore, if they result in the insurgent candidate receiving more sympathetic treatment through these channels; the amount of so-called “earned media” that the insurgent receives could outweigh the extra advertisements that the establishment candidate is able to afford.

A related problem is that the insurgent candidates could seek to raise money directly in response to moves by Conservative Victory Project, as Mr. King of Iowa is attempting to do. This could be the case especially when insurgent candidates were otherwise having trouble raising funds.

My analysis of fund-raising data, in this context and others, has found that it is generally the proportion or ratio of funds raised by each candidate that has the most power to predict races, rather than the absolute amounts. This is a consequence of the diminishing returns of campaign spending: the first $100,000 of spending goes a lot further in establishing a candidate’s viability than the marginal $100,000 after she has already spent $5 million.

Suppose, for example, that the establishment candidate has raised $3 million and the insurgent candidate $500,000, a six-to-one advantage for the establishment candidate. Mr. Rove’s group intervenes and contributes $1 million to the establishment candidate, bringing him to $4 million total. In response, the insurgent candidate raises $500,000 through grass roots groups, bringing her to $1 million total. Despite the absolute difference between the candidates’ fund-raising totals having increased, the ratio has declined to a four-to-one advantage for the establishment candidate from six-to-one previously, arguably leaving the insurgent candidate in better shape than before the fund-raising salvos.

The intuition is simply that it may be dangerous to raise the profile of an insurgent candidate for whom a little extra money and exposure could go a long way.

Where might Mr. Rove’s efforts be more likely to achieve their desired goals? One case would be in multiple-candidate primaries where there are two or more establishment-backed candidates running against one insurgent. This eventuality has come up quite frequently in recent years, such as in the Nevada primary in 2010 and the Missouri primary last year, when the insurgent candidate was able to win with 40 percent or less of the vote. By directing money to one of the establishment candidates at the expense of the other, Mr. Rove’s group could force the insurgent candidate to win an actual or near-majority of vote rather than a mere plurality.

The money raised by Mr. Rove’s group might also be more likely to help candidates if it is directed toward functions other than advertising which have a lower public profile, although coordination rules related to super PACs can limit such efforts.

But the money may be less likely to help if Mr. Rove’s group hopes to save struggling candidates through a barrage of advertisements late in the race. Republican voters have already been rejecting these candidates despite their overwhelming advantage in paid media placements, and often because they are viewed as too much a part of the Washington establishment. It will take more than a new super PAC for Mr. Rove to earn back their trust.

An earlier version of this post referred imprecisely to the support a candidate receives from a PAC. While the political action committees can raise and spend money on behalf of a candidate, the candidate does not add the money directly to his or her campaign coffers."

Perez was confirmed by a vote of 54-46.

Below, more from the Associated Press:

WASHINGTON — A divided Senate confirmed Thomas Perez on Thursday to become secretary of labor, elevating the son of Dominican immigrants who as a top Justice Department official won praise from Democrats for aggressively enforcing civil rights laws and criticism from Republicans for being a liberal ideologue.

Thursday's party-line, 54-46 vote marked the third major vacancy in President Barack Obama's second-term leadership team that the Senate has filled in three days. The sudden movement followed this week's bipartisan deal in which Republicans agreed to end blockades against votes on seven nominations and Democrats shelved efforts to change Senate rules to weaken the minority GOP's powers.

Perez, 51, is a Buffalo, N.Y., native who once worked as a trash collector. Since earning a Harvard University law degree, his career has included stints as a Justice Department civil rights prosecutor and an aide to Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., before taking over Justice's civil rights division in 2009.

At Justice, he has challenged Texas and South Carolina laws requiring voters to show photo identification and sued the office of outspoken Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, alleging that Latinos were racially profiled during a crackdown on immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.

""He has spent his career fighting for working families, protecting our important civil rights laws and turning around troubled agencies,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

Republicans say Perez has selectively enforced laws according to his political views. GOP senators have suggested that politics has guided his decisions about enforcing voting rights laws and accused him of supporting efforts to sidestep federal immigration laws when he was a local government official in Maryland.

""Tom Perez is more than just some left-wing ideologue – he's a left-wing ideologue who appears perfectly willing to bend the rules to achieve his ends,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

After the vote, the Senate began debating Gina McCarthy's nomination to head the Environmental Protection Agency.

On Wednesday, the Senate voted narrowly to end a filibuster against Perez. All but six Republicans voted against Perez – the exact number of GOP senators that majority Democrats needed to muster the 60 votes required to end the delaying tactic against Perez's nomination.

That 60-40 vote was the closest senators have come to unwinding this week's deal between the two parties that has averted all-out partisan warfare over nominations and Senate rules. That roll call seemed to signal that while GOP leaders would deliver the votes needed to honor the bipartisan agreement, numerous Republicans were rankled by the pact and unhappy with Perez.

McCarthy, who currently heads the EPA's air pollution office, has helped craft rules aimed at reducing pollutants from power plants and other sources. Republicans have long criticized the agency for championing overly restrictive regulations that they say kill jobs.

Last week, Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, top Republican on the Senate environment committee, said he was dropping efforts to delay McCarthy's nomination after the EPA agreed to release more information about how it makes decisions. McCarthy has also faced opposition from Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., because of delays to a flood control project.

The other five nominees involved in the deal include Richard Cordray, whom the Senate confirmed Tuesday as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Fred Hochberg, whom the Senate approved Wednesday to continue leading the Export-Import Bank.

Still to be considered are labor lawyers Nancy Schiffer and Kent Hirozawa to join the National Labor Relations Board and NLRB Chairman Mark Pearce, whom Obama wants to keep in the role.

UPDATE (2:10 p.m. ET) -- President Barack Obama issued a statement Thursday afternoon on Perez's confirmation:

I welcome today’s confirmation of Tom Perez to serve as Secretary of Labor. Tom has lived the American dream himself, and has dedicated his career to keeping it within reach for hardworking families across the country. At the Department of Labor, Tom will help us continue to grow our economy, help businesses create jobs, make sure workers have the skills those jobs require, and ensure safe workplaces and economic opportunity for all. I want to thank the Senate once again for agreeing to move forward on Tom and the other nominees who have waited far too long for the yes-or-no votes they deserve.

During Off Hours', 'He Tours California Wineries', 'Watches A Lot Of Hockey. He Left The Times In']",Eric Garcetti is sworn in as 42nd mayor of Los Angeles,"The party is on in Grand Park now that Eric Garcetti has taken the oath of office as the first elected Jewish mayor of Los Angeles. At 42, he is also the youngest in more than a century.

With musical groups about to perform on the park stage and food trucks lining the sidewalks, the free festivities will continue until 10 p.m.

In his speech, Garcetti called L.A. “a place where you can’t be pessimistic even if you want to be” and pledged to keep crime in check, boost education and meet with Fortune 500 executives to find new ways to create jobs. Garcetti also spoke of ending runaway production and making Los Angeles more attractive for the entertainment industry.

The oath of office was administered by Kenia Castillo, an eighth-grader at Luther Burbank Magnet Middle School. She said she was 4 when she encountered Garcetti outside City Hall at a Justice For Janitors rally. She attended that event with her mother, a janitor, and more recently volunteered for his mayoral campaign.

Hours before the swearing in, Garcetti signaled that he plans to give former rival Jan Perry a senior role in his administration.

Perry, whose 12 years on the City Council end Sunday, won nearly every precinct in South Los Angeles in the March mayoral primary but did not make it into the May runoff.

“Twelve years of elected service does not mean the end of her service, mark my words,” Garcetti told parishioners at First African Methodist Episcopal Church in South L.A., one of the city’s most prominent African American churches, on Sunday. “I’ve got plans for her.”

Perry, the only African American among the top contenders for mayor, declined to comment. She backed Garcetti in his runoff against Wendy Greuel, the city controller.

In his morning appearance, Garcetti cast himself as a champion of the underprivileged.

“I wanted this city to understand that I know the power comes from you, from the least among us, from the most humble, from the forgotten, from those voices and those faces who aren’t even in the pews today,” he said.

Their original story has been wiped from their website and replaced with one dripping with left-wing spin to the point you’d think it was a press release from the Obama campaign.

Unfortunately for the Times, there are a lot of websites that republish their work the minute it’s posted. That means it lives forever, even after they’ve killed it.

It’s unfortunate for them, but very fortunate for those of us who like to expose how media bias works.

The original piece contains this paragraph:

Romney told reporters Monday night that his remarks were “not elegantly stated” and were “spoken off the cuff.” But he says Obama’s approach is “attractive to people who are not paying taxes.”

In the new piece that paragraph reads like this:

Mr. Romney addressed the video, somewhat awkwardly, at a fund-raiser Monday night in Costa Mesa, Calif., summoning reporters with a few moments’ notice to walk through the Segerstrom Center for the Arts, which was filled with guests sipping drinks at tables elegantly draped in blue cloths.

The first one simply conveys facts, the second one adds commentary designed to paint a picture of bumbling with “somewhat awkwardly” and of elitism with “guests sipping drinks at tables elegantly draped in blue cloths.”

But it doesn’t end there.

The original reads:

Jim Messina, Obama’s campaign manager, said in a statement Monday evening that it was “shocking” that Romney would “go behind closed doors” to describe nearly half of the country in such terms.

Again, straightforward reporting. But the new version reads quite differently:

Mr. Romney, who has been under fire for releasing only two years of his tax returns, was quickly attacked by the Obama campaign. Jim Messina, Mr. Obama’s campaign manager, said in a statement Monday evening that it was “shocking” that Mr. Romney would “go behind closed doors” to describe nearly half of the country in such terms.

Weird how, in a story that has absolutely nothing to do with tax returns, the Times feels the need to editorialize about Romney’s tax returns. The only people “firing” at Romney for his tax returns are on the payroll of the Obama campaign and “journalists” who write things like this that read as if they’re padding their resume for a position in a second term.

The new version of the story has nearly double the words as the original and is full of editorializing of the sort listed above. The original reads like a news story.

In a tale of two stories, the former “new” version is committed to attacking Mitt Romney and reelected the President, the latter is simply committed to conveying facts. That’s probably why the former has been scrubbed from the Times‘ website and latter exists."

The reason, Boortz said, would be the GOP’s tendency to run on issues related to social conservatism.

Boortz explained the importance to the republic for a GOP win next year while guest hosting Sean Hannity’s Thursday radio show:

This whole thing about Phil Robertson and what have you – it speaks a lot to what we have coming up in the election next year. We desperately need to get the Democrats out of control of the United States Senate. The survival of our republic may depend on getting the Democrats out of control of the Senate, sending Harry Reid into the position of minority leader in the U.S. Senate – the survival of the republic may depend on that. And the Democrats are afraid that is indeed what is going to happen. That is why Harry Reid pulled the nuclear option a couple of weeks ago – because they were afraid we may lose the Senate.

However, Boortz admitted he did not think the Republican Party would succeed in saving the republic because it could not resist the temptation to run on social issues in the upcoming midterms.

Let me tell you what I think is going to happen – I don’t think the Republicans are going to take the Senate next year. They’ll keep the House, but they’re not going to get the Senate and I’ll tell you why – because they simply cannot resist the urge, the impulse to get into this social conservatism. The Republicans can’t run on fiscal responsibility. The Republicans, they can’t get out there and say, ‘Look, we are trillions of dollars in debt.’ They can’t stick to that. They can’t say, ‘We need private sector options to ObamaCare that can give people choices in the private marketplace.’ They can’t do that. They can’t stick to fiscal conservatism. They can’t stick to the small government message. The Republicans have this drive, this maniacal, this obsessive drive to get into social conservatism.

Boortz pointed to the race for the seat currently occupied by outgoing Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA). He noted that it could be a loss for the GOP should they nominate Rep. Paul Broun (R-GA) in a contest that might have Michelle Nunn, daughter of former longtime Sen. Sam Nunn (D-GA), as the Democratic opponent.

But now this city, which is in the midst of a trial to determine whether it is eligible for bankruptcy protection, is set to elect its first white mayor since 1974, Mike Duggan, and by an overwhelming margin. Recent polls show Duggan up by a nearly 2-1 margin over his opponent, Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon, in a city that is 82% African American.

Duggan’s lead is seen as a signal that the residents of long-struggling Detroit are ready for a change in leadership — someone who hasn’t served the city in politics before. After all, still fresh in voters’ minds is the case of former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who three weeks ago was sentenced to 28 years in prison for corruption.

The winds of change, however, may also be fueled by the nation’s willingness to elect a black president.

Minister Malik Shabazz, president of the Marcus Garvey Movement/New Black Panther Nation in Detroit, is one of Duggan’s most vocal supporters. Shabazz admits that having President Obama in the White House changes things.

“In the last two national elections, African Americans have asked the nation to choose the best person for the job and not get caught up in color. And twice, Barack Obama has won,” he said. “Now, in Detroit, in 2013, the best man running is a white brother, and that’s OK.”

The political establishment in Detroit did not make Duggan’s road to Tuesday’s ballot an easy one. The onetime hospital executive, who moved to Detroit from the affluent, mostly white suburb of Livonia, was kicked off the Aug. 6 primary ballot after opponents raised a court challenge questioning whether he met residency requirements.

A frustrated Duggan withdrew from the race — until supporters persuaded him to run as a write-in candidate. He won more than 50% of the vote that way, despite a crowded ballot and despite his opponents’ bid to confuse voters by mounting the candidacy of a barber named Mike Dugeon.

“He became this folk hero. It just kind of took on a life of its own,” said Bill Ballenger, editor of Inside Michigan Politics, a popular political newsletter.

Duggan’s background appeals to voters in a city that is desperately trying to turn itself around, where street lights don’t work and police can take hours to respond to violent crimes. He was once the deputy executive of Wayne County, where he helped overhaul the bus system, served as a county prosecutor and is widely credited with helping to turn around Detroit Medical Center with its eight hospitals.

He’s received endorsements from unions including Service Employees International Union Healthcare Michigan and from African American religious leaders including the Rev. Jim Holley of the city’s Historic Little Rock Baptist Church.

“Mike Duggan has a reputation, deserved or not, as a Mr. Fix-it, a turnaround artist,” Ballenger said.

Duggan’s opponent, Sheriff Napoleon, has impressive credentials as well. His campaign literature shows a younger Napoleon, wearing a bulletproof vest, carrying a small child away from a home where the boy’s family had been held hostage. He has played up his Detroit roots and long law enforcement career, at one debate saying that he “put on a bulletproof vest, a .40-caliber Glock and patrolled this city” as Duggan slept in Livonia.

Napoleon, 61, has snagged endorsements from major law enforcement groups such as the Detroit Police Officers Assn. and from unions including the city’s largest, Michigan’s American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees Local 25.

The new mayor, whoever he is, will not have too much responsibility when he first takes office. Detroit is being run by Kevyn Orr, an emergency manager appointed by the state, who has taken the reins from current Mayor Dave Bing. The law that allowed Orr to be appointed sets up a potential exit route for him in a year.

Many Detroiters seem to be focusing on who will best be able to run the city when Orr leaves. Few want to replicate what happened in Flint, Mich., which had an emergency manager, got rid of him and then needed another one when its finances again tanked.

Some voters see Napoleon as part of the old political establishment that wasn’t able to help the city.

“Duggan represents change; Napoleon does not,” said Joe Darden, a professor at Michigan State University who has studied race relations in Detroit. “Napoleon essentially represents a continuation of the status quo.”

Phil Pugh, 73, has lived in Detroit his whole life; like many other African Americans here, his family moved to Detroit from the South in the early part of the 20th century. He says he has seen many friends leave as they seek a safer place to raise families or after their grown children persuade them to move away.

Safety is so much on Pugh’s mind that he has three dogs, saying it’s the only way he can live in Detroit. He also says he has called the city many times to get help with keeping his neighborhood safe and free of blight. Every time, he says, he was rebuffed.

On a recent morning walk through his neighborhood near the Boston Edison section of the city, where boarded-up houses dot the block, Pugh talked about how difficult it had become to live in the city.

“I think it’s time for a change, and that change is Duggan,” he said.

New Jersey’s governor is more Mickey Spillane than Jane Austen, and his persona, which sometimes is that of a bulldog who got up on the wrong side of the bed, is so popular that he seems to be cruising toward reelection this November and does not deny that he might look beyond that.

His budget for 2013 calls for spending less than did the state’s 2008 budget. He has vetoed a tax on millionaires three times. He has scrapped, exuberantly, with public employee unions. In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, 41,000 families are still homeless. Nevertheless, 61 percent of his constituents think the state is on the right track, more than twice the 27 percent who thought so when he entered office three years ago. His 74 percent job approval rating includes 56 percent among Democrats and 78 percent among independents. This in a state where only 29 percent view the Republican Party favorably. And New Jersey is one of just three states (with New York and Maryland) in which Barack Obama improved upon his 2008 margin of victory (18 points, up from 16).

When the House of Representatives pondered longer than he thought proper in considering the bill for aiding Sandy’s victims, Christie placed, in less than an hour, four unanswered late-evening calls to Speaker John Boehner, calls that were, Christie says mildly, “increasingly agitated.” At last, Christie did his best imitation of Mount Vesuvius, denouncing Boehner by name. The approval-disapproval numbers for his eruption were 79-15, including 70-22 among Republicans. People may not like government, but they enjoy one operatic governor.

Sen. Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican, accused Christie of a “tantrum.” Christie’s pugnacity emerges: “I want to see the next time a hurricane comes to Kentucky.” Such Sturm und Drang earned Christie a place on Time magazine’s cover — a photo making him look very like New Jersey’s Tony Soprano. Beneath the photo were two words — “The Boss.” Time told him that the reference was to New Jersey’s Bruce Springsteen. Christie isn’t buying that, but neither does it bother him. “If my mother were alive,” he says, “she’d be hot. She’s the Sicilian.”

He is potentially the un-Romney of Republican presidential politics, the candidate who connects viscerally, sometimes perhaps too much so, with voters. Although he campaigned hard for Mitt Romney in 2012 and was one of the first governors to endorse him, Christie told Oprah in 2011 that Romney doesn’t connect with people. No one knows how the Republican nominating electorate of 2016 will feel about the idea of selecting a second consecutive Eastern governor from a blue state. “The presidency,” Christie says, “is the most personal vote people cast,” and he distills into two words the lesson of 2012: “Candidates matter.”

He calls the GOP’s decision, made in the run-up to 2012, to lengthen the nominating process “the stupidest thing the Republican Party ever did.” When the process is too protracted, “You wind up with a good candidate who’s damaged.” Although he understands the lacerating rigor of a nomination campaign, “I may not do it, but it won’t be for that reason.”

He heartily agrees with the axiom that the most “likable” candidate usually wins presidential elections, and he understands that combativeness that might serve a governor might be inappropriate for a president, whom people want cloaked in a particular dignity, and who is in everyone’s living room every night. Christie says, “The image of me nationally is a little skewed.” What he calls his “yelling and screaming” is very limited and always tactical. He thinks even voters choosing a president “want someone who has that club in his golf bag.”

Cory Booker, Newark’s Democratic mayor, supposedly has a bright future, but it will not be as New Jersey’s governor any time soon. He has challenged the renomination of an incumbent Democratic senator, 89-year-old Frank Lautenberg, rather than tangle with Christie, who already has $2.14 million in his campaign treasury and who will be given a Silicon Valley fundraiser at the home of Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg on Feb. 13.

By 2015, the Republican nominating electorate will have forgotten Christie’s effusive praise of Obama’s post-Sandy solicitousness toward New Jersey. And Christie will be the rambunctious fellow who before Sandy described Obama as “a man walking around in a dark room looking for the light switch of leadership.” Remember the name of Mickey Spillane’s famous protagonist: Mike Hammer.

(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File)

Just a few days after being notably absent from President Barack Obama's second inaugural ceremony, former presidential candidate Mitt Romney will head to Washington, D.C. to attend a reception in his honor.

As the National Journal first reported, Romney and his wife, Ann, are scheduled to attend a business luncheon Friday at Washington’s J.W. Marriott Hotel hosted by two of his campaign's top fundraisers. Romney rejoined the board of directors at Marriott International after losing the election last year.

CNN reports that the Romneys will also attend Saturday night's black tie Alfalfa Club Dinner while in Washington. Obama spoke at last year's event.

Romney has done his best to remain out of the spotlight following his loss to Obama. He ate lunch with the president after his defeat in November, and has been spotted in various places, but for the most part has remained largely out of the public eye.

On Monday, an aide told NBC News that Romney was at his beach home in La Jolla, Calif., during Obama's inauguration. While Romney reportedly had ""no big plans,"" the aide said it was ""doubtful"" that Romney would watch the ceremony.

Romney was the first losing presidential candidate not to attend the inauguration since Michael Dukakis in 1989. Dukakis reportedly opted to remain in Massachusetts, watching the day's events on television while eating a tuna sandwich. He did, however, send a telegram to the White House, offering incoming President George H.W. Bush his congratulations."

After it was announced this morning that anti-gay Pastor Louie Giglio had withdrawn from delivering the benediction at President Obama's inauguration, the usual suspects on the right stepped forward backward to, as Think Progress describes it, rant about ""a left-wing conspiracy to force him off of the program."" From the same Think Progress story, here are some of the right's comments:



• “[T]he administration’s inclusivity only goes so far. It’s not inclusive of those who disagree with them.” [Richard Land, Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission] • “This president appears determined to stir division and create two Americas: One America that holds to a biblical view of sexuality and another that offers tolerance so long as you embrace its redefined view of sexuality.” [Tony Perkins, Family Research Council] • “It is the ultimate hypocrisy for the Obama administration to pretend it supports diversity and yet denounces anyone who dares to disagree with its radical homosexual agenda. Rev. Giglio’s comments about homosexuality from more than a decade ago were not hateful but represent the historical teachings of the world’s three major religions. Apparently the Obama administration’s definition of tolerance is only broad enough to include its own views.” [Robert Jeffress, First Baptist Church, Dallas, Texas] • “The intolerant Left claims another scalp.” [Kirsten Powers, Fox News political analyst] • “Louis Giglio, a popular orthodox evangelical pastor whose views are mainstream Christian cannot pray the Inaugural benediction.” [Erick Erickson, RedState] • “The bully bigots at Big Gay win huge victory for fascistic intolerance.” [Bryan Fischer, American Family Association radio host]

Erickson and others argue that Giglio represents ""mainstream"" Christianity since, after all, when he was slamming homosexuality, he quoted the Bible. These are, as Robert Jeffress says, ""historical teachings."" Sure, the Bible also suggests adulteresses should be stoned. I guess that's mainstream and historical too. And don't you even dare piss against a wall!

Their main gripe is that President Obama says he supports diversity, yet he will not showcase points of view with which he disagrees at his inauguration. Hey, it's his party! He didn't ask Nazis to speak at the inauguration either. And what about the millions of Americans who are atheists? Their voices are almost never represented at these big shindigs. The right's argument is just hogwash. Remember Rick Warren? It's time for another perspective. Diversity.

Look, Giglio wasn't asked to just sit on the stage or meet with the President during the ceremonies. He was asked to give the friggin' benediction! This is America's every-four-year Big Speech to God and the Nation. A man who thinks homosexuality is a sin, who warned America not to allow the gay lifestyle to become ""acceptable,"" and who promoted therapy to cure the gay, is not mainstream, except when he's standing next to Tony Perkins and Bryan Fischer.

Louie Giglio is free to preach his divisive and hateful religion whenever and wherever he wants, and Americans are free to listen to him. Or not. President Obama also has the right not to give his homophobia a platform and big microphone. If that's being intolerant of intolerance, so be it."

How can conservatives adjust their strategy to appeal more strongly to the single female society? Well, one obvious approach would be restricting the vote to people who are married.

Now I'm not quite sure how that's supposed to appeal to single women. It seems to me that if you just go ahead and disenfranchise single women (or blacks, or Latinos, or poor people, or people who don't drive for whatever reason), well then, that solves your problem right there. No need to have policies or platforms that appeal to people who can't vote, right? So it's kind of illogical on its face. But it's also just mind-bogglingly bizarro as well.

A couple of quotes from the comments:



The goal of the GOP should be to resist urbanization, not just because of the voting trends, but because urban life leads to a lower standard of living.

Speaking as someone with a paid off mortgage I still oppose the idea of property owners being the cut point. Taxpayer is a perfectly good one. Best would be to first seize the vocabulary, change out 'entitlement' for 'public charity.' Then anyone who declares themselves destitute and in need of public charity would be a lot easier to drop from the voter rolls. They would have declared themselves incapable of maintaining themselves; why do they get to tell the rest of us how to run the country if they can't take care of themselves?

So people who live in cities shouldn't vote either I guess?I knew about only allowing property owners to vote...

Now my little diary doesn't explore the author's myriad reasons why single women are the problem, but here's his opening generalization:



The single female demographic doesn’t get hung up on details. Another of the new liberal icons, Wendy Davis of Texas, couldn’t answer basic questions about the abortion legislation she opposed with a purportedly heroic filibuster. Now she’s claiming she is actually kinda sorta “pro life” when you think about it. This is true of all the emotional appeals directed at single female society – lack of knowledge is not only overshadowed by passionate conviction, it can be a point of pride.

I was mainly just impressed by how much Red State conservatives don't want people to vote, to the point where disenfranchisement is a Serious Discussion.

I can only conclude that it's because what Kos always says about our base, if our people vote WE WIN.

Thanks for listening. I was partly practicing block quotes and links. If I have overstepped the rules for linking to Mr Hayward's diary I stand properly chastised.

[Update] Wow, Rec List. Thanks everyone!"

USA TODAY

BOSTON — As expected, Republican Party officials voted Friday not to allow CNN and NBC to sponsor Republican primary debates in 2016 if the networks air planned programs about potential 2016 Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

In a resolution passed at the party's summer meeting in Boston, national committee members called CNN's planned documentary and NBC's planned biopic ""little more than extended commercials supporting Secretary Clinton"" and an attempt to put ""a thumb on the scales"" for the 2016 presidential election.

GOP chair Reince Priebus had sent a letter to the networks Aug. 5. telling them to drop plans for the programs or face the RNC action. NBC News has said the fictionalized biography is being developed by the network's entertainment division, a separate entity from the news division. CNN asked the RNC to ""reserve judgment"" until the documentary is further along.

Though the RNC is making Hispanic outreach a priority, the ban nonetheless includes NBC's cable networks and Telemundo and CNN Espanol, RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said. Both networks aired debates during the 2012 campaign.

The RNC is trying to find ways to limit the number of debates in 2016 after the marathon of 20 debates in the 2012 primaries, which Priebus said gave the party's candidates too much opportunity to ""slice and dice"" each other. Republican candidates could agree to debates regardless of the RNC action, Kukowski said.

Clinton, who recently stepped down as secretary of State, has not said whether she plans to run for office, but activists around the country are organizing a campaign infrastructure for her.

After the vote, CNN issued the following statement:

""CNN Films, a division of CNN Worldwide, commissioned a documentary about Hillary Clinton earlier this year. It is expected to premiere in 2014 with a theatrical run prior to airing on CNN. The CNN broadcast date has not been determined. This documentary will be a non-fiction look at the life of a former First Lady and Secretary of State. The project is in the very early stages of development, months from completion with most of the reporting and the interviewing still to be done. Therefore speculation about the final program is just that. We encouraged all interested parties to wait until the program premieres before judgments are made about it. Unfortunately, the RNC was not willing to do that.""

News emerged Friday regarding the NBC miniseries. First, Fox Television Studios, which was in talks to produce it, confirmed it had decided not to go ahead with the project.

Late in the day, NBC entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt, who announced last month that the network is developing the project, issued a statement saying the Clinton miniseries is in its early stages and there is no guarantee it will run.

""The Hillary Clinton movie has not been ordered to production, only a script is being written at this time. It is 'in development,' the first stage of any television series or movie, many of which never go to production,"" he said. ""Speculation, demands and declarations pertaining to something that isn't created or produced yet seem premature."""

Pelosi: No budget deal without UI,"

@gzornick Whoa--strong pledge from Pelosi just now: ""We cannot sign a budget agreement that does not include unemployment insurance.""

It's encouraging to see this bit of pushback against would-be austerity measures. When a budget agreement was signed off on in early 2011, however, the federally funded Emergency Unemployment Compensation was included but with 26 weeks of extensions hacked out of it. Partly as a consequence, only 34 percent of the nation's 4.1 million long-term unemployed people are now receiving checks under EUC, a program specifically designed to financially assist those who cannot find work after 27 weeks or more without a job. The other 66 percent are flat out of luck.

If EUC is not renewed by Dec. 28, when the program expires, 1.3 million long-term unemployed Americans will lose their average $269 a week from the government. And in 2014, another 3.6 million Americans who would have become eligible for EUC will not receive its benefits.

As Sarah Ayres points out:



This is because unemployment benefits are not just good for workers; they are also good for the economy. By putting money into the pockets of people who will spend it, unemployment benefits boost demand, spur economic growth, and create jobs. In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has found that unemployment benefits are one of the most effective fiscal policies to increase economic growth and employment. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, has found that every $1 spent on unemployment insurance grows the economy by $1.55. All these dollars circulating through the economy create jobs. According to an Economic Policy Institute analysis, extending emergency unemployment benefits would create 310,000 additional jobs in 2014.

Nine out of the 11 times the EUC has been renewed since it was first enacted in June 2008, Republican lawmakers have resisted. Their essential argument: unemployment compensation makes people lazy. In other words, with just one job opening available for every three job seekers, Republicans say Get a Job!

Meanwhile, the Council of Economic Advisers and Department of Labor have published a new report, The Economic Benefits of Extending Unemployment Benefits. Among its findings:



• Including workers’ families, nearly 69 million people have been supported by extended UI benefits, including almost 17 million children • In 2012 alone, UI benefits lifted an estimated 2.5 million people out of poverty [...] • Failing to extend UI benefits would put a dent in job-seekers’ incomes, reducing demand and costing 240,000 jobs in 2014. • Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and JP Morgan suggest that without an

extension of EUC GDP will be .2 to .4 percentage points lower. • In 2011, CBO found that aid to the unemployed is among the policies with “the largest

effects on output and employment per dollar of budgetary cost”

The official unemployment rate of 7.3 percent is higher now than it has been at any time in past recessions when extended unemployment compensation has been removed."

More than 200,000 people crowded the streets of Berlin — a favorite backdrop for U.S. politicians reaching for history — to hear then-candidate Barack Obama promise to turn the page on the unpopular policies of George W. Bush.

“Germany meets the superstar,” the news magazine Der Spiegel proclaimed on its cover.

As he heads to Europe on Sunday for a visit that will culminate with a sequel to that Berlin speech three days later, Obama has been demoted to mere president.

For many Europeans, Obama’s tenure has been a lesson in lowering expectations. Although he maintains approval ratings on the continent any politician would envy, confidence in his leadership and support for his international agenda have slipped since those heady early days.

“He was the subject of enormous projections that he was never, ever going to be able to live up to. He was the non-Bush. He was the intimation of the America without Bush that people could love again,” said Constanze Stelzenmueller, a transatlantic relations expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Berlin.

“He’s become somewhat demystified.”

Obama’s failure to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center, his escalation of drone warfare and small steps on global warming are among the reasons the sheen has dulled, polling shows. Another may have been added with the recent revelations that Obama has expanded Bush-era surveillance of phone calls and email. Several European officials have demanded more information. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she will raise the issue with Obama when the two meet privately.

There are other rifts between the United States and European leaders that the president will try to mend during his visit, which begins Monday with the annual meeting of the Group of 8 industrialized nations, held this year in Northern Ireland.

Obama will explain his decision to arm the rebels in the bloody civil war in Syria, a move hailed by leaders in Britain and France, while others fear being pulled into another war in the Middle East. And Obama is likely to renew his unsuccessful efforts to persuade Merkel to ease up on her demands for austerity measures in other European countries, which he views as hampering the continent’s economic recovery. On Friday, he called Merkel and the leaders of Britain, France and Italy to talk about Syria and Libya, which faces threats from radical Islamists.

This year, his economic offensive comes with a full-scale appeal to his high-wattage popularity — and to history. In Berlin, Obama has chosen a city that became a potent reminder of American ties to Europe. His speech will mark 50 years since President Kennedy, at Schoeneberg Town Hall in West Berlin, affirmed his solidarity with Germans in the face of communism with his declaration, “Ich bin ein Berliner.”

The president is to speak at Brandenburg Gate, an imposing columned monument once cut off from the West by the Berlin Wall. In 1987, President Reagan stood with the gate behind him and demanded that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev “tear down this wall.”

Once a symbol of Cold War division, the edifice is now a coveted setting for U.S. presidents as a testament to the triumph of democracy. President Clinton spoke there in 1994 after the wall had been torn down and declared: “Berlin ist frei.”

Advertisement

Obama’s own moment at the gate has long been envisioned by his foreign policy advisors. His campaign scouted the site in 2008, but chose another venue after Merkel suggested she was uncomfortable with electioneering at the historic monument.

The incident was not forgotten. In 2011, Merkel needled Obama for not returning to Berlin as president, joking: “I can promise that the Brandenburg Gate will still be there.”

Advertisement

Obama will speak on the east side of the gate, where a plaza will limit the crowd size and the potential for unfavorable comparisons to his mega-rally.

The audience awaiting him Wednesday will undoubtedly be more skeptical. In European countries polled by Pew Research last year, 63% of those surveyed approved of Obama’s international policies, down from 78% in 2009. In Germany, 52% said they had a favorable view of the United States, down from 64% in 2009 — but up from 34% in Bush’s last year in office.

“Those numbers are still pretty good compared to other parts of the world. Really, what it’s all about is he didn’t meet expectations,” said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Global Attitudes Project.

Still, an overwhelming 87% of Germans said they have “a lot” or “some” confidence in Obama.

Advertisement

In his unabashedly lofty speech five years ago, Obama asked the massive crowd to envision a world without nuclear weapons, a planet Earth healed, without racial or sectarian divisions.

“These are the walls we must tear down,” Obama said. “This is the moment to stand as one.”

In Berlin this week, Obama probably will return to similar themes, referring back to the united front that ended the Cold War and imaging a more harmonious world.

“I think his message is very much going to be that just because the threat is not immediately apparent with a wall and barbed wire, it doesn’t mean that we don’t have work to do together,” said Ben Rhodes, a top White House foreign policy aide.

Advertisement

But Obama’s words may also reflect the toned-down ambitions he has after a term as president. Stelzenmueller noted that Germans — and Europeans as a whole — will expect Obama to address some difficult issues: Syria, trade and U.S. surveillance of foreign phone calls and email.

“Despite the fact that we’re close, we have legitimate disagreements that we need to thrash out or negotiate,” she said. “It’s difficult to make glamorous speeches about that kind of thing.”

Mr. Obama’s offensive will begin on Wednesday in Galesburg, Ill., with what his aides are saying will be a major address on economic policy at Knox College. Officials declined to provide details of the president’s message, but said he would set his terms for what they expect will be another bruising battle with a Republican-controlled House over the nation’s fiscal policies.

White House officials liken Wednesday’s speech to one he gave in 2011 in Osawatomie, Kan., where he articulated the theme of economic inequality in American society that became a leitmotif of his re-election campaign, and to one at Georgetown University soon after taking office in 2009, when he talked about how the American economy would recover from the Great Recession.

A vegetarian with a Harvard M.B.A., Mrs. Cruz is a managing director at Goldman Sachs, one of the Wall Street firms that helped set off the populist rage that ushered Mr. Cruz into the Senate in 2012. She works for Goldman in Houston, where she lives with the couple’s two young children, and as her husband’s fame has increased — depending on the audience, he is among the most pilloried or revered members of the Senate — she has maintained a low profile.

“I think it works really well for our family for us both to have careers, and I know what my commitments are to Goldman,” Mrs. Cruz, 41, said in an interview last week in her husband’s Senate office. “I think it’s also really good for our girls to have me at home with them.”

Yet the fallout from her husband’s role in the Congressional fiscal showdown this month did not spare Mrs. Cruz, one half of what she calls “a great team.” And it was the Democrats who seemed to be making her background an issue."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/18/Why-Obama-Fears-the-Gettysburg-Address,2013-11-18 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],Why Obama Fears the Gettysburg Address,"President Barack Obama has elected not to attend the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address on Tuesday, Nov. 19th. Instead, he will be meeting with Senators at the White House to persuade them not to impose new sanctions on Iran, and to convince them of the merits of an agreement that will allow Iran to continue to enrich uranium at low levels. No doubt, that is important–but it is also a revealing choice.

Lincoln’s speech is remembered because it expressed, simply and elegantly, why hundreds of thousands risked their lives for an idea: “that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” When President Obama sought to rouse Americans to support a “targeted military strike” on Syria, he failed to move the nation. Now, he prefers to counsel the nation to accept a weak compromise with tyranny.

The contrast is striking. Obama has repeatedly likened himself to Lincoln, launching his presidential campaign from the Old State House in Springfield. He cast his candidacy as the fulfillment of the promise Lincoln made at Gettsyburg–“that all men are created equal.” Like Lincoln, Obama came up through the Illinois legislature. Like Lincoln, Obama became known for his oratory. But Lincoln’s speeches had something Obama’s never will.

Lincoln’s speeches are admired not just because they are well-constructed, but because they contain timeless principles to which he devoted his career and to which he committed the nation. The fate of Obama’s speeches is to serve a political purpose, then fade. His speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, an appeal to unity, launched his national career. Today, it is largely forgotten amidst the failures of his divisive presidency.

Obama’s address on race in Philadephia, in the midst of the 2008 presidential primary, was praised by Chris Matthews and mainstream media as “a speech worthy of Abraham Lincoln.” Yet just weeks after declaring he could “no more disown” his pastor, the race-baiting Jeremiah Wright, than he “could disown the black community,” Obama severed ties with Wright and his church, the platitudes of Philadelphia quickly cast aside.

Lincoln’s speeches were more than words–which is why his words are still cherished. The highlight of the commemoration at Gettsyburg in 1863 had been the 13,000-word speech by Edward Everett, a rousing, anti-Confederate diatribe. But Lincoln did not distinguish among Union and Confederate dead. All, he suggested, fought in their own way for the same cause. He was committing the nation, and himself, to reconciliation.

Obama has never shown the same inclination to put partisanship aside for the sake of the nation’s needs. He has coveted the aura of Lincoln’s charisma, but has never humbled himself to learn from Lincoln’s example the way Ronald Reagan humbled himself before “The Boys of Pointe du Hoc.” For Obama to speak at Gettysburg, to stand where Lincoln had once stood, would only sharpen the contrast. That is why he is staying away."

A look at Hillary Rodham Clinton in relaxed moments during her tenures as secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady.

Two worlds of Hillary Rodham Clinton intersected this past week. Together they underscored not only why the former secretary of state is seen as perhaps the dominant unelected politician in the country today but also the concerns among some of her Democratic supporters as she considers a return to the political arena in 2016.

As President Obama and Clinton’s successor at State, John F. Kerry — during a dizzying week of diplomacy and threats of military action — grappled with how best to respond to Syria’s alleged use of chemical weapons, Clinton was enjoying a fresh round of accolades and honors. The contrast between her recent past life and her current life was striking.

On Tuesday, on a sultry summer evening, she was in Philadelphia, where she received the Liberty Medal during a ceremony at the National Constitution Center. On Friday, she was in Scotland, where she received an honorary degree from St. Andrews University, which was marking its 600th anniversary with all appropriate academic pomp.

Tuesday’s ceremony in Philadelphia concluded an hour before Obama addressed the nation on the Syrian issue. On Friday, Clinton spoke in Scotland as Kerry was in Switzerland negotiating with his Russian counterpart on eliminating Syria’s chemical weapons stocks.

As both a former secretary of state and the prospective favorite for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, Clinton enjoys the freedom to operate in an almost idealized world. She is still in the public eye but mostly not in the line of fire. For now, the hard decisions are someone else’s responsibility.

Circuit of accolades

This fall, Clinton will maintain this circuit, receiving awards from civic and other organizations while delivering paid speeches to private audiences along the way. She is already a draw on the strength of her impressive résumé and her achievements during decades in public service. That she might also become president makes her all the more irresistible to organizations looking for someone to honor.

Clinton may be a year or more from a formal decision about running, but among those who are turning out to hear her, there already is an assumption that she will be a candidate, if not a winning candidate. It is never far below the surface when she appears and is sometimes explicitly stated.

In Philadelphia, Amy Guttman, president of the University of Pennsylvania, told the audience, “A few decades ago, when I was a child, it would have been unthinkable for a woman to be president of the University of Pennsylvania, let alone secretary of state of the United States, and something many of us can’t wait to celebrate — the first woman president of the United States.”

The Philadelphia ceremony included elements that might have been scripted for the 2016 Democratic convention, with a highlight reel of Clinton’s life and video tributes from people such as former British prime minister Tony Blair and tennis star and women’s rights advocate Billie Jean King. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R), who serves as chairman of the National Constitution Center, gave a warm introduction that included teasing references to possible competition with her in 2016.

Across the street from the ceremony and behind barricades came a reminder of Clinton’s past and possible future, as a small but vocal band of demonstrators sought to draw attention to the Obama administration’s handling of the attacks on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, a year ago that resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens.

Clinton will deliver policy speeches this fall, but up to now she has made little news with most of her appearances. As the president’s posture was shifting from threats of military strikes to an embrace of diplomacy that on Saturday produced an agreement between the United States and Russia to corral and eventually eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons, Clinton offered Obama her full support, as one would expect.

Ghosts of 2008 campaign

In between Clinton’s two public appearances this past week came unexpected news, which grew out of a long-standing federal investigation into political corruption in the capital city, particularly the activities of Washington businessman Jeffrey E. Thompson.

As first reported in The Washington Post this past week, investigators have been looking into Thompson’s role in financing a shadow campaign set up to aid Clinton’s 2008 presidential bid.

At a moment in early 2008, when Clinton’s campaign was in trouble and in debt, her advisers were approached by Troy White, a New York marketing executive and music promoter, who wanted to set up “street teams” to help build support for Clinton in several states with upcoming primaries. According to court documents and subsequent reporting by Post reporters, the offer was rejected by Guy Cecil, the campaign’s national political director.

Then, through the intercession of Minyon Moore, a senior adviser to Clinton, White’s services were enlisted, not under the Clinton campaign umbrella but for a separate and seemingly secret operation. Thompson, who is under investigation for allegedly financing a secret operation for the D.C. mayoral campaign of Vincent C. Gray (D), reportedly provided $600,000 in financing.

Clinton campaign officials and Moore have been cooperating fully with federal prosecutors, who are believed to be focused on building a case against Thompson, not going after Clinton’s campaign. Moore is a veteran of Democratic politics and campaigns and well regarded in Democratic circles. She is not a target of prosecutors, and her attorneys think that if she made a mistake, it may have been in assuming that all of what White was doing was being handled properly.

Repeat of past mistakes?

All that aside, this window into Clinton’s campaign has again pointed to systemic problems that plagued her first bid for the White House and could do so again if she runs in 2016, unless she structures her operation differently.

What has made some Democrats wince is the portrait that emerges of a Clinton campaign in which decisions did not stick, campaign leaders operated without clear lines of authority and there were endless avenues for end runs, second guessing and freelancing.

“They had a lot of wildcatting going on,” said a veteran of past Democratic presidential campaigns who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. “If that happens in ’16, it doesn’t augur well.”

Clinton is neither in the fray nor fully out, enjoying a kind of best-of-all-worlds existence as she looks toward a time when she must truly decide whether to seek the presidency. Meanwhile, some nagging questions remain that her Democratic allies hope will be addressed as she weighs the bigger decision.

The Internal Revenue Service spent years averting its eyes while clever campaign operatives abused the tax code for political purposes. Advocacy groups, mostly on the right, wanted to run attack ads while concealing the source of their money, and they came up with a brilliant way to do it: claim to be “social welfare” groups, which are allowed to hide donors.

Federal statutes say these groups can only engage in social welfare activity, but the tax agency decided political activity was fine as long as it wasn’t the primary purpose of the group. That helped create the torrent of secret money that poisoned the last few federal elections. The I.R.S. never explained, though, what kinds of activities are considered political, or why these groups, also known as 501(c)(4)’s, should be allowed to participate in campaigns at all.



On Thursday, long after the abuse became too rampant to ignore, the I.R.S. took the first tentative steps at reining in the problems it helped create. It proposed a definition of “candidate-related political activity,” an important starting point in determining what tax-exempt groups are really allowed to do. But it will have to do much more than that if it wants to be taken seriously as a regulator on this battlefield.

According to a press release from the Treasury Department, the agency said the new definition of political activity would include ads or other communications that clearly advocate for a candidate or party, or ads that mention a candidate within 60 days of a general election (30 days for primaries). That’s a good start for a definition, though 60 days is far too narrow a window — many of these attack ads air a full year or more before voting begins.

Once political activity is defined and separated from social welfare activity, 501(c)(4)’s will no longer be able to claim, as Karl Rove and others have, that “issue ads” mentioning candidates are for social welfare purposes. (These are the kinds of ads that say, “Dog-kicking is terrible. Call Senator Jones and tell her to stop doing it.”)

But a definition alone won’t do any good unless the I.R.S. tells these groups how much political activity is permitted. The ideal answer would be: zero. Social welfare groups have no business meddling in politics. Any group with a political interest has its own place in the tax code — they can be a 527 political organization. Those groups, which include political parties and official campaign organizations, also get tax exemptions, but there is one crucial difference: they have to disclose their donors, and 501(c)(4)’s don’t.

Conservatives immediately claimed that the I.R.S. was trying to take away their free-speech rights, which is laughable. Absolutely nothing is stopping advocacy from running ads, and the Supreme Court, in the Citizens United case, even granted corporations the right to make unlimited donations to independent groups that produce political ads. But there is no right to keep these donations a secret.

The Treasury announcement, tantalizingly, said the I.R.S. would consider comments from the public on how much political activity should be permitted for a social welfare group, suggesting that decision was farther down the road. It’s in the agency’s interest to end the confusion surrounding 501(c)(4)’s, which has led to charges that it has been arbitrary in its audits. But it’s in the public interest to do even more, and disallow sleazy secret money in campaigns."

(CNN) – Mark Sanford overcame the latest hurdle in his South Carolina political redemption tour, ending Tuesday night with a concession from his opponent in the GOP primary runoff for a U.S. House seat.

Results showed the former South Carolina governor had 57% of the vote, compared with 43% held by former Charleston City Councilman Curtis Bostic. That was a difference of about 6,000 votes out of about 45,000 cast.

Jake Tapper interviews Mark Sanford Wednesday on ""The Lead"" - 4 p.m. ET, only on CNN.





[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Sanford said he was “humbled” and “thankful” for the win, calling his competitor “a gentleman.”

His fiancee, Maria Belen Chapur, made a rare public appearance, standing at his side Tuesday evening. Revelations about his extramarital affair with her in 2009 led many observers to conclude his political career was over.

“I congratulate the governor on his race,” Bostic told supporters after conceding. “I want to be the first to say, ‘Congratulations, campaign well-run, we wish you the very, very best.’ ”

Sanford now goes on to the May 7 special election against Democratic nominee Elizabeth Colbert Busch.

In a statement Tuesday night, she said she looked forward to a “vigorous campaign” and said the heavily Republican district needs “a voice in Washington who stands up for South Carolina solutions - not either political party.”

National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden wrote in a statement that “South Carolina families clearly deserve a continuation of the strong fiscal discipline displayed by now-Senator Tim Scott and will greatly benefit from Sanford’s fiscal hawk approach. Without a doubt, Mark Sanford will campaign tirelessly to grow South Carolina jobs and work to get our nation’s massive spending problem under control.”

Sanford's past infidelity is front and center in battle for the state's 1st Congressional District, which he represented from 1995 to 2001 before being elected the Palmetto State's governor for two terms.

In his victory speech Tuesday night, Sanford thanked voters, saying that while God forgives, “sometimes the voters aren’t so forgiving.”

Bostic claimed in Thursday's debate that Sanford was a ""compromised candidate"" because of his extramarital affair with a woman from Argentina. The affair came to light in 2009, sinking any hopes Sanford had of making a bid for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012.

""Trust is a crucial issue,” he said. “In fact, it has become a crucial issue in this race.""

Sanford and his then-wife, Jenny, were divorced in 2010, and Sanford finished his second term as governor in January 2011. He's now engaged to the woman with whom he had the affair.

Sanford, who's touting his fiscal conservative credentials as he campaigns for Congress, is also asking the public for a second chance, telling CNN that he was seeking ""redemption"" by running for office again. He came in first in a 16-candidate primary two weeks ago but finished with 37% of the vote, far short of the 50% needed to avoid a runoff. But he was far ahead of Bostic, who narrowly edged out state Sen. Larry Grooms to finish second with 13%.

Sanford said his first-place finish was ""incredibly humbling.""

""The events of 2009 absolutely represent a failure on my part, for which there were and probably always will be consequences,"" added Sanford. ""But that does not mean, because you have had failure in your personal life, that you cannot step back into life again.""

But Bostic, who had won the support of some top social conservative leaders, disagreed, arguing that the congressional seat - which has been held by the GOP since 1981 - would become vulnerable if Sanford became the Republican nominee.

""A compromised candidate is not what we need. It's just not what we need. We need to secure this seat. It needs to be red,"" Bostic said, citing surveys that indicated that Colbert Busch was leading Sanford.

But Bostic did not repeat his criticism of Sanford's infidelity at their second debate last weekend.

Colbert Busch is the sister of Stephen Colbert, the satirist and host of ""The Colbert Report"" on Comedy Central. He's campaigned on his sister's behalf, recently telling Jake Tapper, CNN’s chief Washington correspondent and anchor of CNN's The Lead, that ""she's my sister, and I'm willing to, you know, break the jewel of my own creation to try to do something for her.""

Colbert Busch, an official with Clemson University's wind turbine drive testing facility, is expected to have an uphill climb in the general election because the district is heavily Republican.

GOP Rep. Tim Scott won re-election to the seat by 27 percentage points in last November's election. But when Republican U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina stepped down from his seat late last year to take over as the head of the conservative Heritage Foundation, GOP Gov. Nikki Haley named Scott to fill the seat, triggering the special election to fill his seat.

Story highlights Salazar is a former U.S. senator from Colorado He led the administration's reaction to the 2010 Gulf spill and explosion Salazar made strides in renewable energy, forging better relations with Native Americans

Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, who led the response to the 2010 BP oil spill and administered a moratorium on offshore drilling, announced Wednesday that he is stepping down.

The former Colorado lawmaker plans to return home in March after eight turbulent and busy years in Washington, four years in the U.S. Senate and four years as head of the Interior Department.

President Obama nominated him for the Cabinet post four years ago and he was unanimously confirmed.

He was most prominent when he spearheaded the administration reaction to the BP Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

Salazar issued a six-month drilling moratorium after the April 20, 2010, explosion.

Critics, including Republican leaders, Gulf state officials and Gulf Coast residents, slammed the ban. They said it would hurt oil and gas workers in the already hard-hit coastal communities, where hundreds of jobs were lost because of the disaster.

But Salazar said the moratorium provided time to make sure that similar accidents wouldn’t occur and that rig operators were prepared to deal with worst-case scenarios if they did happen again.

Eleven people died in the explosion, which spawned one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history. An estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil gushed into the Gulf before the broken well some 4,000 feet below the surface was capped.

“We have undertaken the most aggressive oil and gas safety and reform agenda in U.S. history, raising the bar on offshore drilling safety, practices and technology and ensuring that energy development is done in the right way and in the right places,” Salazar said in an Interior Department news release announcing his departure.

The department has offered millions of acres of offshore acreage in the Gulf for exploration and “is proceeding with cautious exploration of Arctic resources,” the release said. It added that the department has leased millions of acres onshore for oil and gas development and has protected “special landscapes for hunting and fishing.”

“Today, drilling activity in the Gulf is surpassing levels seen before the spill, and our nation is on a promising path to energy independence,” said Salazar, who also overhauled Interior’s management of oil and gas resources and installed new ethics standards for employees.

Obama’s Cabinet: Who’s in, who’s out?

Salazar also has pursued renewable energy, with his department authorizing 34 solar, wind and geothermal projects on public lands since 2009, the news release said. Those projects total enough energy to power more than 3 million homes.

“Today, the largest solar energy projects in the world are under construction on America’s public lands in the West, and we’ve issued the first leases for offshore wind in the Atlantic,” Salazar said in the release. “I am proud of the renewable energy revolution that we have launched.

The release also noted progress made during Salazar’s term regarding Native American lands. A settlement was reached and passed that addressed “long-standing injustices” involving the government’s trust management.

In addition, Obama signed into law water rights settlements that “help deliver clean drinking water” to tribes, the release said, and spearheaded a reform of surface leasing regulations for Native American lands.

“President Obama has made it a priority to empower our nation’s first Americans by helping to build stronger, safer and more prosperous tribal communities,” Salazar said.

Obama, in a separate release, said Salazar “helped usher in a new era of conservation for our nation’s land, water, and wildlife” and promoted renewable energy along with oil and gas production. He “played an integral role in my administration’s successful efforts to expand responsible development of our nation’s domestic energy resources” and made strides in ties with Native Americans.

“I have valued Ken’s friendship since we both entered the Senate in 2005, and I look forward to receiving his counsel even after he returns to his home state of Colorado,” the president said.

Salazar’s move comes amid criticism over Obama’s second-term Cabinet nominees. He has taken flak because major nominations have gone to white males.

White males have been tapped for three prominent Cabinet positions with second-term openings: secretary of state, secretary of defense and secretary of the treasury. One of those posts has been held by a woman, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while the others have been held by white men.

Salazar focused on energizing Hispanics

While Obama’s record of appointing women to top posts doesn’t differ significantly from that of former President George W. Bush, many take the issue with Obama’s appointments since he ran as a champion of women’s issues during both of his presidential election campaigns, unlike his predecessor.

The draft environmental review of the Keystone XL pipeline acknowledges tar sands are nasty stuff for the environment, but concludes that the project is OK because this oil will get to market anyway — with or without a pipeline.

A public comment period is underway through April 22, after which the department will prepare a final statement to help the administration decide whether the pipeline is in the “national interest.” If the conclusion is yes, a Canadian company, TransCanada, gets a permit to build a pipeline to transport toxic tar sands through our heartland, connecting to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, for likely export to China.

Around the world, emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide continue to soar. Australia is now finishing “the angry summer” — 123 extreme weather records broken in 90 days — which government sources link to climate change. Last year, 2012, was also the hottest year on record in the contiguous United States.

Yet a bipartisan chorus says the pipeline is no big deal. Some suggest the administration is better off focusing on stronger EPA regulations, as if it were an either-or proposition. Others say we need the temporary jobs. Still others torture logic by claiming that not building the pipeline will be worse because that would force the tar sands to be shipped overseas, with the greater carbon footprint that entails — even though analysts say this is the fate of most Keystone XL oil anyway.

The perspective of pipeline apologists is contrary to the laws of physics and basic economics, neither of which gives a damn about politics. Here are a few points the State Department ought to reconsider:

Nothing to see here. The draft review suggests the climate impacts of the pipeline are limited because the project will not substantially “induce growth in the rate of extraction in the oil sands.” This narrow analysis misses the mark. Researchers now say that the Alberta tar sands contain 360 to 510 billion tons of carbon — more than double that of all oil burned in human history. While only a fraction is considered economically recoverable right now, we humans are genius at finding new and better ways to dig junk out of the ground. Digging begets more digging. Once the big spigot is open, TransCanada will have every incentive to milk the massive tar sands basin for all it is worth.

It’s out of our hands. The idea that the tar sands would get developed at the same rate without the pipeline is undercut by mainstream financial analysis and industry documents that show Keystone XL is the linchpin for tar sands expansion in the next decade. Tar sands may get to market without it, but at a slower rate and a much greater cost. For example, Canadian research and investment advisory firm Peters & Co. says moving tar sands by rail would spike costs twofold, from $7 to $11 a barrel to $15 to $20 a barrel.

Some tar sands will inevitably cross the border on trains and in smaller pipelines but not at the scale permitted by Keystone XL. Only with a substantial increase in pipelines to the coasts, and with access to markets overseas, can the tar sands industry meet its eye-popping production targets — a full tripling of output in coming decades — along with the crushing blow that would deliver to our climate.

Going backward is in the national interest. According to law, the administration’s final decision will be based on whether the pipeline is in the “national interest.” While the world will be stuck with the climate damages, the U.S. will be on the hook for spills, environmental degradation and much more. Not only is it a bad marriage but a long one: TransCanada’s estimated annual depreciation rate for “oil pipeline and pumping equipment” is 2% to 2.5%, which means a pipeline with a useful life of 40 to 50 years.

Just last week, a Canadian train slid off the tracks in Minnesota, spewing as much as 30,000 gallons of Canadian crude on U.S. soil. A few days later, a pipeline carrying crude from Canada leaked “a few thousand” barrels in Arkansas. Is this in the national interest?

Once we get a price on carbon that makes fossil fuels pay their true cost, the tar sands will start to shut down. But if the pipeline opens the big spigot in the meantime, it will be difficult to avoid great harm.

The science on climate change has been in for a quarter of a century. There are no more mixed messages, just catastrophe after catastrophe. The president stands at a fork in the road: Rejecting the pipeline will show the world we are serious and determined to be on the right side of history. Approving it will signal we are too entrenched with business-as-usual to do what’s right by the people, planet and future generations.

WASHINGTON –- The Obama administration quietly unveiled a new executive order on Friday laying out plans to deal with the impacts of climate change and directing federal agencies to revise programs and policies that might serve as barriers to climate adaptation.

The order builds out the Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience that President Obama called for in his June climate change speech. The task force will bring together local, state and tribal officials to collaborate on approaches for dealing with climate impacts and advise the federal government. Those impacts include heat waves, extreme storm events, droughts, ocean acidification, sea-level rise and the melting of the permafrost.

The task force includes the Democratic governors of Hawaii, California, Washington, Delaware, Maryland, Illinois and Vermont. There is only one Republican governor who signed on to the task force -- Eddie Calvo, the governor of the small Pacific Island territory of Guam. The task force also includes 16 mayors and two tribal leaders.

The executive order also creates a second group –- the Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience –- made up of senior officials from all of the federal agencies and led by the head of the Council on Environmental Quality, Obama's top national security adviser and the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The council will replace the Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force that Obama created in 2009.

The order also calls on federal agencies to identify ways to remove barriers in laws or programs that might make it difficult to address climate-related issues, and to ""reform policies and Federal funding programs that may, perhaps unintentionally, increase the vulnerability of natural or built systems, economic sectors, natural resources, or communities to climate change related risks."" The directive pushes agencies to think proactively about how climate change could affect federal programs -- from the construction and maintenance of dams and levees to the flood insurance program.

It directs the heads of the departments of Defense, Interior, Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Army Corps of Engineers to take an inventory of their land and water policies and deliver a list of proposed changes to the White House in the next nine months, along with a proposed timeline for making those changes.

The order comes three days after the anniversary of Superstorm Sandy, which caused $65 billion in damage along the East Coast.

WikiLeaks hints at next move,"Story highlights Washington analysis: Nicolas Maduro is pushing for political points in Venezuela WikiLeaks fuels speculation about Edward Snowden's next move It's unclear whether Snowden has accepted any offer of asylum The trick will be avoiding the airspace of the U.S. and its allies

(CNN) —

As speculation grows over Edward Snowden’s path to freedom, WikiLeaks teased that his “flight of liberty” campaign starts Wednesday, promising further details.

But so far, WikiLeaks has not lived up to the Twitter promise to provide more details. And the questions are piling up.

Is the future of the U.S. intelligence leaker, grounded at Moscow’s airport for more than two weeks, no longer up in the air?

Not so fast.

It’s unclear whether Snowden has accepted anyone’s offer of asylum. And if he has, how does he intend to get there?

Speculation centers on Venezuela, which was the first to offer asylum. With both sides expressing interest, it only appeared to be a matter of time before it is confirmed.

Venezuela extended the asylum offer to Snowden last week, and on Monday President Nicolas Maduro received a formal asylum request from Snowden.

Just who is Edward Snowden?

There were flurries of information Tuesday after a tweet by a Russia lawmaker announced that Snowden had accepted Venezuela’s offer of asylum.

But the lawmaker who sent the tweet, Russian parliamentary spokesman Alexei Pushkov, deleted the message. WikiLeaks, which has been assisting Snowden in his asylum bid, denied the report in a Twitter post.

“The states concerned will make the announcement if and when the appropriate time comes,” WikiLeaks said. “The announcement will then be confirmed by us.”

If Snowden does accept, it resolves one issue in the saga, but sets the stage for the next chapter: How will he get from Moscow to Caracas?

Creative maneuvering

The trick would seem to be avoiding U.S. airspace or the airspace of nations friendly to the United States.

Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who faces espionage charges, would be wise to take a chartered jet on a route that goes over water the entire time, former CIA analyst Allen Thomson told Foreign Policy.

“Leave Moscow,” he told the Foreign Policy. “Fly north to the Barents Sea, thence over to and through the Denmark Strait. Continue south, steering clear of Newfoundland until getting to the east of the Windward Islands. Fly through some convenient gap between islands and continue on to Caracas.”

Kirk Koenig, president of Expert Aviation Consulting, told CNN that such a route would probably work, as it avoids the airspace of any countries that may try to ground the plane.

“That would probably be his only choice,” he said.

Such a flight would not come cheap – about $200,000 – Koenig said.

“Where it gets more interesting is if they try to put him on an Aeroflot Russian Airlines flight nonstop to Havana, Cuba,” he said. “The smart move would be to put him there as a passenger and hope nobody notices.”

Would other countries make a commercial passenger jet land if they believe Snowden is on board? Given what happened to Bolivian President Evo Morales, it’s possible, Koenig said.

Opinion: Why we’re all stuck in the digital transit zone with Snowden

No place to fly

Last week, several European countries wouldn’t let Morales’ plane fly through their airspace, allegedly because of rumors that Snowden was aboard. The presidential aircraft instead made an unscheduled stop in Vienna, Austria, which became a sore spot for Morales and sparked outrage throughout Latin America.

On Tuesday, members of the Organization of American States passed a resolution condemning the incident, calling for France, Italy, Portugal and Spain to formally apologize. The United States and Canada dissented.

Security Clearance: No end in sight for NSA leak fallout

As speculation swirled about Snowden’s next move, Maduro took the United States to task in a speech to military academy graduates, accusing Washington of persecuting Morales and threatening his life.

“Under those circumstances, several Latin American countries have decided for dignity and as a clear message to the empire, that we’re not afraid of it, that the children of Bolivar do not fear the empire,” Maduro said in a speech broadcast Tuesday on Telesur, a TV network based in Caracas.

Obama administration keeps close watch

Officials in national security agencies and on Capitol Hill were watching closely Wednesday for any signs that Snowden was preparing to leave Moscow for asylum in Venezuela.

Some are questioning Maduro’s motivation, according to two U.S. officials who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information involved.

U.S. officials believe Maduro’s decision to offer asylum to Snowden is aimed more at boosting the Venezuelan president’s standing at home rather than engaging in any direct anti-American effort, according to an assessment by the Obama administration that the officials described to CNN.

http://news.yahoo.com/house-gop-slash-environmental-arts-171201521.html,,[],"House GOP to slash environmental, arts funding","WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans Monday proposed slashing cuts to environmental programs and funding for the Smithsonian Institution and the arts as they unveiled the latest legislation to implement the second year of budget cuts required under so-called sequestration.

The $24 billion spending measure would gut the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency with a one-third cut and cuts the National Endowments for the Arts by almost half. Overall, the measure funding the Interior Department, EPA, national parks and federal firefighting efforts is cut by 19 percent below funding approved in March.

It takes a more modest approach to the national parks with a slight increase over levels mandated by sequestration, the across-the-board cuts forced by Washington's failure to strike a bipartisan budget accord. And firefighting efforts would benefit from $1.5 billion in ""emergency"" funds on top of the spending limits set by the GOP's austere budget plan.

The measure is the latest of 12 spending bills for the almost one-third of the federal budget funded each year by Congress in the form of day-to-day operating budgets for government agencies. Such budgets are hit the hardest by sequestration.

Republicans control the House and are insisting on living within a tight $967 billion ""cap"" on agency operating budgets and are shifting more than $47 billion from domestic programs to the Pentagon — which runs counter to a 2011 budget agreement. The restoration of money to the Defense Department would force austere cuts on nondefense programs like foreign aid, transit grants and community development grants sought by local officials.

Monday's measure, along with a legislation coming to the floor later this week funding transportation and housing, are two of the GOP bills absorbing the brunt of the domestic cuts, along with a measure funding labor, health and education programs that will be revealed on Wednesday.

""Simply put, this bill makes very difficult choices in an extremely tough budget environment,"" said author Mike Simpson, R-Idaho. ""Within challenging budget constraints, we've focused on providing adequate funding to fight and prevent wildfires, making sure our national parks stay open, and meeting our trust responsibilities to American Indians.""

The measure also contains a roster of policy ""riders"" aimed at reining in the EPA such as language that would prohibit the agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions from electric utilities.

The bill is sure to be slapped with a White House veto threat and functions as a placeholder until negotiations this fall."

So Orcutt sent him an email in response, in which he justified the new tax, in part by claiming that cyclists generate more pollution than cars.



State lawmaker defends bike tax, says bicycling is not good for the environment

Posted on March 2, 2013 by Tom Fucoloro Representative Ed Orcutt (R – Kalama) does not think bicycling is environmentally friendly because the activity causes cyclists to have “an increased heart rate and respiration.” This is according to comments he made in an email to a constituent who questioned the wisdom of a new bike tax the legislature is considering as part of a large transportation package. We spoke with Rep. Orcutt to confirm the email’s authenticity and to get further clarification. “You would be giving off more CO2 if you are riding a bike than driving in a car,” he said. However, he said he had not “done any analysis” of the difference in CO2 from a person on a bike compared to the engine of a car (others have). “You can’t just say that there’s no pollution as a result of riding a bicycle.”

Someone please tell me this was snark. Please, I beg you.

In any case, putting aside these, ahem, deep thoughts about cycling, pollution and the environment, Orcutt is also wrong on the notion that cyclists don't pay for the roads that they ride on, that he claims drivers do.

First, the majority of funds that go towards building and maintaining roads, including bike lanes, comes from general revenue, not gas or vehicle taxes or license and registration fees, which everyone, including cyclists, pays into, via sales, property, income and other taxes--some of them not local or even state, but federal.

Second, to the extent that vehicle-related taxes and fees pay for roads, the vast majority of cyclists also own and drive vehicles, and pay these taxes and fees as much as non-cyclists.

And third, the wear and tear that bicycles impose on public roads is miniscule verging on infinitesimal compared to that imposed on them by cars, motorcycles and trucks. Powered vehicles weigh anywhere from hundreds to thousands of pounds. Most bikes weigh anywhere from 15 to 40 pounds. Do the math, even if you include the weight of the driver.

I wonder if Mr. Orcutt has done an analysis of how much pollution is caused by Republicans opening their mouths or attempting to use their brains?"

The temperature rise due to man-made carbon dioxide is lower than their prediction in 2007. Originally a three degrees Celsius increase was predicted, but that number is now expected to be between 1-2.5 degrees Celsius.

Specifically, the draft report says that “equilibrium climate sensitivity” (ECS)–eventual warming induced by a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which takes hundreds of years to occur–is “extremely likely” to be above 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), “likely” to be above 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and “very likely” to be below 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 Fahrenheit). In 2007, the IPPC said it was “likely” to be above 2 degrees Celsius and “very likely” to be above 1.5 degrees, with no upper limit. Since “extremely” and “very” have specific and different statistical meanings here, comparison is difficult.

Most experts believe that warming of less than 2 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels will result in no net economic and ecological damage. Therefore, the new report is effectively saying (based on the middle of the range of the IPCC’s emissions scenarios) that there is a better than 50-50 chance that by 2083, the benefits of climate change will still outweigh the harm.

Warming of up to 1.2 degrees Celsius over the next 70 years (0.8 degrees have already occurred), most of which is predicted to happen in cold areas in winter and at night, would extend the range of farming further north, improve crop yields, slightly increase rainfall (especially in arid areas), enhance forest growth and cut winter deaths (which far exceed summer deaths in most places). Increased carbon dioxide levels also have caused and will continue to cause an increase in the growth rates of crops and the greening of the Earth–because plants grow faster and need less water when carbon dioxide concentrations are higher."

What the anti-science CNN is withholding from its audience, though, is the good news that there actually is no Global Warming. Global temperatures have not increased for fifteen years. Moreover, we have just learned that the Antarctic sea ice is at its highest level in 35 years.

CNN is lying through the dark art of omission. Context is kryptonite to any left-wing media outlet trying to pose as objective.

Moreover, if CNN truly believed that burning energy dooms the planet and mankind, why doesn’t CNN go off the air? The energy this network burns to spew anti-science reports likely puts more carbon in the air in an hour than I will during my entire lifetime — and I regularly burn tires in front of my hippie neighbors.

But that is the whole thing with these anti-science Global Warming truthers, isn’t it — that they don’t behave like people who actually believe burning energy is dooming the planet. And that is because they know it is a lie. Global Warming is a left-wing hoax; it is not some coincidence that the only way to save the planet is to check off every box on The Socialist Wishlist.

The report from Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee charged that the Treasury Department-administered program has ""failed"" in its goal of putting Americans to work.

""Billions of dollars have filled the coffers of overseas firms while the evidence of the promised permanent jobs and economic growth here in the United States is scarce,"" the report said.

The program is separate from the Energy Department fund that gave nearly $530 million to failed solar panel firm Solyndra.

This one sprung out of the 2009 stimulus package, and offers cash payments to alternative energy companies worth 30 percent of any given project's cost. The money is available for everything from solar to wind to geothermal to fuel cell projects.

According to the report, though, nearly one-quarter of the $16 billion approved to date has been for U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms. The money went to several Spain-based companies, as well as those in Japan, Germany, France and Italy.

Nearly $1.8 billion, for example, went to various wind energy projects across the country under the U.S. division of Spain's Iberdrola Renewables, according to the study.

Republican lawmakers say the program is effectively aiding foreign competitors, with money the U.S. government arguably does not have.

""With $16 trillion in debt, we cannot afford to send one out of every four taxpayer dollars overseas for a program that has failed to create the jobs promised,"" Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the committee, said in a statement.

The program, though, nevertheless was funding projects in the United States that largely employed U.S. workers. According to a July 2012 status report, more than 45,000 projects were funded at the time -- presumably more have been funded since. The projects have also helped boost the country's electricity generation from renewable sources.

Nancy McLernon, president of the Organization for International Investment, said the House report mischaracterizes the economic benefit of U.S. subsidiaries.

""U.S. subsidiaries are not rivals of U.S. industry, they're an important part of it,"" she told FoxNews.com. ""This is in-sourcing.""

McLernon said U.S. subsidiaries, across all industries, directly employ 5.3 million people in the U.S., and said the committee report gave a ""terribly wrong impression"" of their integration with the U.S. economy.

She said U.S.-owned companies likewise can take advantage of certain government aid abroad, but said it's ""very hard to put a flag on a company.""

Energy Department spokesman Bill Gibbons also defended the grant money, saying the program has directly benefited the U.S. economy and boosted U.S. wind power.

""All of the recipients of 1603 funds are U.S. taxpayers and all of the projects funded are located in the United States. Therefore, every single project that has received funds to produce clean energy generation here in the United States is directly creating investment in America and domestic jobs,"" he said. ""That's true for every corporate tax credit or deduction -- not just the ones that our critics don't like.""

Previously, renewable energy companies could collect tax credits for their projects -- the provision in the stimulus bill turned that into cash payments. The program was then extended through 2011, but money is still being paid out for projects that began during that period.

The so-called 1603 program has also recently come under scrutiny after it was revealed that several solar panel companies were issued subpoenas as part of a federal probe into whether they overcharged for their work in order to squeeze more stimulus money out of taxpayers.

The investigation was revealed last year by one of the subjects in the probe, California-based SolarCity. The company disclosed in an SEC statement that it and others had received subpoenas from the Treasury Department's Office of the Inspector General. The company has claimed it is not aware of ""specific allegations of misconduct"" but acknowledged the investigation."

Chu, who disclosed his decision in a letter to Energy Department staff, frequently clashed with GOP lawmakers over gas prices as well as government backing for green-energy companies like the failed firm Solyndra.

In his letter, Chu took aim directly at his critics, saying the clean-energy efforts were a success—and blasted climate-change skeptics as trapped in ""the Stone Age.""

""While critics try hard to discredit the program, the truth is that only one percent of the companies we funded went bankrupt,"" he wrote. ""That one percent has gotten more attention than the 99 percent that have not.""

Chu added: ""The test for America’s policy makers will be whether they are willing to accept a few failures in exchange for many successes. America’s entrepreneurs and innovators who are leaders in the global clean energy race understand that not every risk can—or should—be avoided. Michelangelo said, 'The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.'""

He also scolded climate-change skeptics and urged a shift from fossil-fuels to other sources of energy.

""The overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activity has had a significant and likely dominant role in climate change,"" Chu warned in his letter. ""There is also increasingly compelling evidence that the weather changes we have witnessed during this thirty year time period are due to climate change.""

Chu underlined that China was pushing ahead with clean-energy investments—outpacing U.S. efforts.

""While we cannot accurately predict the course of climate change in the coming decades, the risks we run if we don’t change our course are enormous. Prudent risk management does not equate uncertainty with inaction,"" he said. ""The Stone Age did not end because we ran out of stones; we transitioned to better solutions.""

Story continues

In a written statement, Obama praised Chu for giving the Energy Department ""a unique understanding of both the urgent challenge presented by climate change and the tremendous opportunity that clean energy represents for our economy.""

Obama added, ""And during his time as Secretary, Steve helped my Administration move America towards real energy independence. Over the past four years, we have doubled the use of renewable energy, dramatically reduced our dependence on foreign oil, and put our country on a path to win the global race for clean energy jobs. I wish him all the best.""

Chu will likely stay in his post through the end of February, though it will depend on the confirmation of his successor."

An inspection report released Friday by the state Department of Transportation says inspectors brought in a bucket truck to examine the structure and identified tears, deformations and gouges on the northbound side of the bridge.

In that Nov. 29, 2012, impact, an overheight truck struck a metal overhead truss on the bridge, DOT spokeswoman Broch Bender said. An inspection crew determined the bridge to be safe, with only minor repairs required. She said those minor repairs were added to an existing list of bridge maintenance items to be completed at a future date.

The inspection report also details a variety of other problems with the bridge, including vegetation growing in panels, and rust. It also summarizes a variety of parts on the bridge that have been subjected to ""high-load"" hits.

A trucker was hauling a load of drilling equipment Thursday evening when his load bumped against the steel framework over the bridge. He looked in his rearview mirror and saw the span collapse into the water behind him.

Two vehicles fell into the chilly river. The three people in those vehicles were not seriously hurt.

As authorities try to find a temporary span, motorists will have to use alternate routes during the holiday and for weeks to come.

""You cannot overstate the importance of this corridor to Washington state,"" Gov. Jay Inslee said. Traffic on I-5 and surrounding roads was backed up for miles, a situation the governor said would continue indefinitely.

Officials were looking for a temporary, pre-fabricated bridge to replace the 160-foot section that failed, Inslee said Friday. That option could be in place in weeks. Otherwise, it could be months before a replacement can be built, the governor said.

The collapse came on the north end of the four-lane bridge near Mount Vernon, about 60 miles north of Seattle.

""He looked in the mirrors and it just dropped out of sight,"" Cynthia Scott, the wife of truck driver William Scott, said from the couple's home near Spruce Grove, Alberta. ""He was just horrified.""

The truck driver works for Mullen Trucking in Alberta, the Washington State Patrol said. The tractor-trailer was hauling a housing for drilling equipment southbound when the top right front corner of the load struck several of the bridge's trusses, the patrol said.

Scott, 41, remained at the scene and cooperated with investigators. He voluntarily gave a blood sample for an alcohol test and was not arrested.

The truck made it off the bridge, but the other two vehicles went into the water about 25 feet below.

Bryce Kenning, of Mount Vernon, said the bridge seemed to explode in front of him. The 20-year-old slammed his brakes, but there was nothing he could do.

""It was like time was frozen -- like a roller coaster where you're not attached to the tracks,"" Kenning said in a phone interview.

Ed Scherbinski, vice president of Mullen Trucking, said in an interview with The Associated Press that state officials had approved of the company's plan to drive the oversize load along I-5 to Vancouver, Wash.

Mike Allende, a state Department of Transportation spokesman, confirmed the truck had a permit.

""We're still trying to figure out why it hit the bridge,"" Allende said.

State officials approved the trucking company to carry a load as high as 15 feet, 9 inches, according to the permit released by the state. However, the southbound vertical clearance on the Skagit River bridge is as little as 14 feet, 5 inches, state records show. That lowest clearance is outside of the bridge's vehicle traveling lanes, Transportation Department communications director Lars Erickson said Friday. The bridge's curved overhead girders are higher in the center of the bridge.

The bridge has a maximum clearance of about 17 feet.

The permit specifically describes the route the truck would take, though it includes a qualification that the state ""Does Not Guarantee Height Clearance.""

It's not rare for trucks to strike bridges in Washington state. The state DOT said there were 21 bridge-strikes involving trucks last year, 24 in 2011 and 14 in 2010.

There are no signs leading up to the Skagit River bridge to warn about its clearance height. State Transportation Secretary Lynn Peterson said that under federal and state standards, the clearance is tall enough to not require signage.

Inslee said it will cost $15 million to repair the bridge. The federal government has promised $1 million.

The bridge is used by an average of 71,000 vehicles a day.

A Federal Highway Administration database lists the bridge as ""functionally obsolete"" -- a category meaning that the design is outdated. But it was not classified as structurally deficient."

What Rich Lowry (Yes, that Rich Lowry, who saw ""star bursts"" while watching Sarah Palin's VP nomination speech), the NR's editor, said was this:



we will be embarking on a journalistic project of great interest to us and our readers. And this is where you come in. If Mann goes through with it, we’re probably going to call on you to help fund our legal fight and our investigation of Mann through discovery. If it gets that far, we may eventually even want to hire a dedicated reporter to comb through the materials and regularly post stories on Mann.

What the National Review and its co-defendants have done instead is fight tooth and nail to prevent discovery from ever happening. They filed motions to dismiss Dr. Mann's case as discussed here , allowing them to temporarily invoke a privilege against any discovery taking place.

Discovery in a civil law suit is a very powerful tool. It forces a party to submit to interrogation and open its papers and premises to the eyes of their litigation opponent. The disclosures required are extremely broad and sanctions for concealment or non-cooperation can be severe.

After the court overruled the defendant's motions to dismiss they asked for that to be reconsidered. The court said no, so the defendants moved for permission to take the ruling against their motion to dismiss for an immediate appeal, called an interlocutory appeal.

Now, the motions for interlocutory appeal have been overruled and it is certain that discovery will immediately move forward, almost a year after the suit was filed.

Discovery is totally to the advantage of Dr. Mann and against the interests of the National Review and its minions. Because it is scientific work, Dr. Mann's work is an open book which has survived every challenge and investigation attacking it by the climate change denial community, including the National Review. Dr. Mann has nothing to hide.

It is the defendants who are in a hot spot, now. Every aspect of their knowledge and thinking about climate change reporting is now open for scrutiny in full daylight.

Dr. Mann has been a poster boy for powerful right wing voices denying anthropogenic climate warming, which have attacked his scientific work, without success, from a number of directions. Now, Dr. Mann and his legal team have the chance to pry open the dark and murky recesses from which what passes for right wing thinking emerges. It won't be pretty.

But neither are the Friday the 13th movies. Make popcorn."
