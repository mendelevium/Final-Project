WASHINGTON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will travel to South Africa next week to participate in memorial events for Nelson Mandela, the former South African president who died on Thursday.

Obama's exact schedule was as yet unclear, the White House said. It was not yet known whether Obama would give public remarks while in South Africa.

""President Obama and the first lady will go to South Africa next week to pay their respects to the memory of Nelson Mandela and to participate in memorial events. We'll have further updates on timing and logistics as they become available,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement.

Obama, speaking Thursday night shortly after Mandela's death at age 95 was announced, said he was one of the ""countless millions who drew inspiration from Nelson Mandela's life.""

Obama, America's first black president, also said the first political action he ever took as a young man was attending a protest against apartheid.

Carney, at his daily news briefing, said Obama and Mandela last spoke in 2010 or 2011 and that they also spoke when Obama won his first election as president, in 2008.

He had no details on who might be in the U.S. delegation traveling with Obama, including whether former U.S. presidents might go with him.

Schmidt', 'Suliman Ali Zway']","After Attack in Libya, Ambush Struck Rescuers","Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced on Thursday the creation of a review board led by a veteran diplomat and former under secretary of state, Thomas R. Pickering. She also briefed lawmakers behind closed doors on Capitol Hill. But the State Department now faces Congressional demands for an independent investigation of the attacks and any security failures that might have added to the death toll.

“In my judgment, which is informed by numerous briefings and discussions with experts, the attack in Benghazi was not a black swan,” Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said at a hearing on Wednesday, “but rather an attack that should have been anticipated, based on the previous attacks against Western targets, the proliferation of dangerous weapons in Libya, the presence of Al Qaeda in that country and the overall threat environment.”

Investigators and intelligence officials are now focusing on the possibility that the attackers were affiliated with, or possibly members of, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb — a branch that originated in Algeria — or at least in communication with it before or during the initial attack at the mission and the second one at the mission’s annex, a half-mile away.

One extremist now under scrutiny is a former detainee at the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, Abu Sufian Ibrahim Ahmed Hamouda, a Libyan who is a prominent member of an extremist group called Ansar al-Sharia, which some have blamed for the attack. “It is safe to assume that any significant extremist in eastern Libya is going to be under a lot of scrutiny right now,” an American intelligence official said, adding that it was premature to draw any conclusions.

The most significant inconsistency between Libyan and American accounts is whether the attack that night began with a small protest over the trailer of “The Innocence of Muslims,” parts of which were broadcast on Egyptian television. American officials insist there was a protest that began peacefully, only to be hijacked by armed militants. But Libyan witnesses, including two guards at the building, say the area around the compound was quiet until the attackers arrived, firing their weapons and storming the compound from three sides, beginning at 9:30 p.m. on Sept. 11. A witness said that some of those attacking referred to the film’s insults to Islam.

Matthew G. Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said at a Senate hearing on Wednesday that the authorities believe “this was an opportunistic attack” that “evolved and escalated over several hours.”

What is clear, however, is that those who arrived at the mission — not officially a consulate, though Libyans call it that informally — came intending to inflict maximum damage on the building. They quickly overwhelmed a small security detail that included three guards from a force called the 17th of February Brigade and five Libyans employed by a British security company called Blue Mountain."
http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/05/bipartisan-cluelessness-on-egypt/,2013-07-05 00:00:00,[],Bipartisan cluelessness on Egypt,"By Christian Whiton, Special to CNN

Editor’s note: Christian Whiton is the author of the forthcoming book, ‘Smart Power: Between Diplomacy and War.’ He was a State Department senior advisor from 2003-2009. The views expressed are his own.

That’s twice Washington was caught slack-jawed amid revolution in the world’s biggest Arab-majority state. But don’t blame the Obama administration exclusively for twice being on the losing side of events in Egypt. Reality in Egypt has also eluded Beltway Republican foreign policy mavens and America’s dysfunctional and distracted intelligence bureaucracies. That makes shaping events in Egypt nearly impossible.

The first shock for Washington came in January 2011, when hundreds of thousands of Egyptians demanding secular democracy filled town squares. According to Washington and its $80 billion-per-year intelligence bureaucracy, these people did not exist in the Middle East. The choice there was supposedly between corrupt strongmen like Egypt’s 30-year president Hosni Mubarak or repressive Islamists like those who run Iran and populate Muslim Brotherhood parties around the region.

Secular liberals were as rare as unicorns and supported by only a small number of Egypt’s urbanites – or so the story went. And yet there they were: mobs of young Egyptians not demanding Islamic law and clerical rule, but accountable government with democratic laws and institutions.

The Muslim Brotherhood, which essentially invented modern Islamism – the political force seeking unification of mosque and state – hesitated and kept its supporters on the sidelines in Egypt. Senior Obama administration officials were also stunned along with much of the rest of Washington’s byzantine national security apparatus.

More from CNN: Will Brotherhood survive?

Even as it became clear that Mubarak would not survive, Vice President Joe Biden said supportively, “I would not refer to him as a dictator.” Of the nation that historically has been the political bellwether of the broader region, then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton said, “We’re not advocating any specific outcome.”

These officials should be afforded some pity. The information and advice they were getting came partially from State Department experts who are perennially wrong about major developments in the Middle East. Meanwhile, the CIA was distracted. Originally created for the crucial tasks of stealing secrets and waging political war on America’s foes, the CIA has spent the last decade becoming a second military. With what amounts to a second American air force around the globe and a ground force now focusing on arming Syrian rebels – inexplicably so for a mission that isn’t conceivably covert – the CIA drifts ever farther from helping policymakers grasp and influence foreign political developments.

And so the first Egyptian revolution came and went. Despite being caught flatfooted before the uprising, surely officials across Washington would be excited at the emergence of a bloc in Egypt that wanted a modern democracy, wouldn’t they? Unfortunately, Washington has a way of not allowing new facts to tamper with long-held assumptions. If Egyptian secular liberals did not exist in theory then they couldn’t exist in practice.

More from GPS: Six lessons for Egypt

So when Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham went to Cairo in February 2011, they held high-profile meetings with the Muslim Brotherhood, lending it credibility. According to the Wall Street Journal, Graham remarked, “After talking with the Muslim Brotherhood, I was struck with their commitment to change the law because they believe it’s unfair.” Later, in April 2012, White House spokesman Jay Carney cited the McCain-Graham engagement with the Brotherhood as justification for the Obama administration’s own engagement with the Islamist group.

Of course, Egypt’s liberals were not entirely on top of their game in eliciting support from Washington – whether overt or covert. Their delegation that made the rounds on Capitol Hill stressed retribution over problem-solving and coalition-building. At one point, reformers told Hill staffers they wanted to put members of Egypt’s military on trial for their lives for past involvement in Egypt’s governance. This self-indulgent and unwise attitude toward the most prominent institution in Egypt that could keep the Islamists at bay did not endear the secularists to Congress. As crucial elections arrived in mid-2012, the secularists appeared as disorganized as ever. The only surprise was how narrow their loss was in the presidential contest; the Islamists won by only 52 percent to 48 percent.

But official Washington should have known the secularists needed help – and deserved it even if they weren’t quite sure how to ask for it. Secular liberals will always, by definition, start off more disorganized than their authoritarian opponents. For example, organization and discipline were key traits of being an active member in a communist party in the last century. The same holds true of adherents for today’s totalitarian alternative to democracy: Islamism. Islamist groups ranging from the Muslim Brotherhood to Hezbollah to al Qaeda are nothing if not disciplined.

Ultimately, liberals do get organized, but it often takes time. After 1944, Poland was under the communist boot for more than three decades before on-again, off-again disobedience and dissent grew into the more organized Solidarity movement. Even then, Poles did not win their freedom for another decade. Georgia and Ukraine broke free from the collapsing Soviet Union in 1991, but they would not have true democracy until liberal oppositions toppled corrupt, authoritarian governments in 2003 and 2004 respectively.

There are ways to shorten these transitions. The CIA used to support pro-freedom political forces in the Cold War, and those actions helped secular democracy prevail in countries like Italy and Greece. In the 1980s, Washington created the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) to pick up this mantle and help foreign democratic forces organize and prevail politically.

Unfortunately, doing this today is light years from where the CIA is or wants to be. Furthermore, the world’s bad guys are now wise to NED’s intentions; Egypt expelled the employees of one of its subsidiaries. NED also has a leader, Carl Gershman, who seems to believe that Islamist parties can be coaxed into supporting liberal democracy by including them in the process – the same theory posited by other Washington bigwigs from Obama to McCain, which has now been clearly refuted by events.

Enter Egypt’s second revolution. Is it any wonder that the Obama administration has chosen to remain reticent about the matter? Egypt’s Islamist president is gone, but his supporters still exist and their secular opponents don’t yet appear to be more organized. Worse still, the will for America and its allies to help them organize, and the tools to do that with, both appear to be in mothballs. So once again the most titanic political contest of our era takes a dramatic turn – one that will have an impact in every Muslim-majority nation and beyond, but with America largely on the sidelines. Washington will again leave crucial matters to chance."

Speaking to the nation from the White House, Mr. Obama laid out his most extensive and detailed case for an attack to punish Syria for its use of chemical weapons. But he also acknowledged the deep doubts of Americans who after the experience of Iraq and Afghanistan view any form of military engagement in Syria with alarm.

In a speech that only 48 hours ago was going to be solely a call to arms, Mr. Obama instead offered a qualified endorsement of a proposal that his own advisers conceded was rife with risk, given Russia’s steadfast refusal to agree to any previous measures to pressure Syria, its longtime ally.

“It’s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments,” Mr. Obama said. “But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force.”"

The planning for intense attacks over a three-day period reflects the growing belief in the White House and the Pentagon that the United States needs more firepower to inflict even minimal damage on Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces, which have been widely dispersed over the last two weeks, the officials said.

Two U.S. officers said the White House asked for an expanded target list in recent days to include many more than the 50 or so targets on the initial list. As a result, Pentagon planners are weighing whether to use Air Force bombers, in addition to five warships now on patrol in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, to launch cruise missiles and air-to-surface missiles from hundreds of miles offshore, well out of range of Syrian air defenses.

Syria is also within range of an aircraft carrier strike group in the Red Sea, which includes one cruiser and three destroyers, all capable of firing cruise missiles.

“There will be several volleys and an assessment after each volley, but all within 72 hours and a clear indication when we are done,” said one officer familiar with the planning.

The officers requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the campaign.

The stepped-up military planning comes as President Obama and his aides prepared to press their own offensive to seek public support, as well as congressional votes for authorization to use military force to punish Assad’s government for alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians last month.

Obama plans to blanket the nation’s airwaves in coming days to make his case to a skeptical public. Aides say he will tape interviews Monday with the anchors of CBS, NBC and ABC, the three major broadcast networks, as well as with PBS, CNN and Fox News. He also will address the nation from the Oval Office on Tuesday, the night before the full Senate is expected to vote.

Obama, who has declined to say whether he would order an attack if Congress votes against it, gave a preview of his argument in his weekly radio address Saturday.

“Failing to respond to this outrageous attack would increase the risk that chemical weapons could be used again, that they would fall into the hands of terrorists who might use them against us, and it would send a horrible signal to other nations that there would be no consequences for their use of these weapons,” he said.

The administration ran into a new diplomatic roadblock Saturday at the European Union.

Foreign ministers of the EU’s 28 member nations, meeting in Vilnius, Lithuania, said that “the international community cannot remain idle” after reports that poison gas was used Aug. 21 against neighborhoods near Damascus held by rebels trying to topple Assad.

But despite the presence of U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, the EU declined to back a military strike without approval of such intervention by the United Nations. American officials say they see almost no chance of winning a resolution for use of force in the U.N. Security Council because Russia, a permanent member with veto power, is Assad’s strongest international backer.

The EU ministers noted that U.N. chemical weapons inspectors were expected to report on their findings in Syria. They also welcomed a decision by French President Francois Hollande, a vocal advocate of a military strike, to wait for the inspectors’ report before taking further action.

Obama still favors a limited attack that would not involve sending large numbers of warplanes over Syria to drop bombs, officials said.

But some military officers are doubtful that even a longer air campaign, using cruise missiles fired from offshore, will hurt Assad enough to degrade his forces and to deter future use of chemical weapons. One officer described the planned operation as little more than a multi-day “show of force,” not a game-changer in Syria’s bitter civil war.

The planned U.S. attack “will not strategically impact the current situation in the war, which the Syrians have well in hand, though fighting could go on for another two years,” said another U.S. officer familiar with the latest intelligence estimates.

The Obama administration hopes that by denying Assad the option of resorting to chemical weapons and by providing some additional weapons and training to rebel fighters, it will boost the now remote chances of negotiations that might lead to Assad’s exit.

The administration has struggled over the last week with the competing demands of hitting Syria hard enough to undermine Assad’s resolve but not hard enough to undermine support by members of Congress who are leery of being drawn into another Middle East war. A smaller contingent has urged Obama to provide more muscular support for the rebels seeking to oust Assad.

Facing such cross-currents, administration officials and top Pentagon officers have veered between describing the planned attack as a limited operation that will not significantly tilt the balance of power in Syria and a punishing attack that will degrade the Syrian military’s equipment and forces capable of delivering chemical weapons and deter Assad from using them.

The current planning tries to thread the needle. After the initial round of strikes, the Pentagon will assess the damage inflicted on Syrian forces using satellite imagery and other surveillance systems. The U.S. military then can either hit targets that weren’t destroyed or choose new ones to ensure that Assad suffers significant losses, current and former military officers said.

“It’s got to lead to something or we’re going to be back in the same situation a year from now,” said Mark Kimmitt, a retired Army brigadier general and former top Middle East planner who served as a Pentagon and State Department official during the George W. Bush administration. “So we’ve got to have a larger target set.”

Pentagon planners also are offering options to hit Assad again if he or his regional proxies retaliate against the United States or its allies, the two officers said.

Administration officials have signaled that they intend to move ahead with their plans to provide arms to some Syrian rebel factions, a demand by Sen. John McCain of Arizona and other Republicans who have called for aiding the rebels in return for their supporting any resolution to authorize force.

In closed-door briefings with lawmakers last week, the administration said Assad’s conventional forces were concentrated around Damascus, the capital, and in the north of Syria. But many installations and pieces of equipment, including rocket launchers, tanks and other hardware, have been moved in the last two weeks to avoid as much as possible the expected U.S. attack.

Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged during two days of congressional testimony the possibility of follow-up strikes. He said the Syrian military was moving forces, making more difficult the task of striking units and equipment capable of delivering chemical agents.

“At this point our intelligence is keeping up with that movement,” Dempsey said. He also noted reports that prisoners and other noncombatants had been moved to potential military targets where the U.S. might strike.

Throughout the day, the White House proceeded to demonstrate why this is so.

The death toll is approaching 1,000 in the Egyptian military’s crackdown, the Edward Snowden case is straining international relations and new questions are emerging about privacy violations at the National Security Agency. But Obama, who just returned from a nine-day, six-golf-round vacation on Martha’s Vineyard, remained out of sight at the White House.

Obama’s press secretary, Jay Carney, was away, so the task of representing the White House to the outside world fell to one Josh Earnest, a deputy press secretary who lived up to his surname on Monday. For an hour, reporters quizzed him on the news of the day, and Earnest, his face burned by the Vineyard sun except where his sunglasses had been, responded by reading from a binder full of bromides.

“As you’ve heard the president talk about quite a bit, the economic interests of middle-class families is his top domestic priority,” Earnest informed the assembled reporters.

“The president believes and understands that his chief responsibility as president of the United States is the national security of the United States of America and her citizens,” he announced.

Right, right, but what about all the people being killed in Egypt?

“What you’re asking is a pretty broad question,” Earnest said, “because we’re talking about a large number of people in a large country, under a lot of different circumstances.”

This is not to pick on Earnest, a genial product of Kansas City, Mo., who is well-liked by the White House press corps. He was doing exactly what he was supposed to be doing: trying to get the president through the August doldrums without making news. And that’s the problem.

Since the earliest days of the republic, Washington has been a sleepy town in August. Lawmakers once fled the capital to avoid heat and malaria; now they do it for fundraising and boondoggles. In 2002, President George W. Bush delayed making the case for war in Iraq until the fall because, his chief of staff said at the time, “you don’t introduce new products in August.”

But it no longer works to push the snooze button throughout the month. August of 2001 was when the Bush administration failed to connect the dots that could have warned of the Sept. 11 attacks. August of 2009 was when the tea party movement rallied public opposition to Obamacare.

By now it should be obvious that running the country is not an 11-month job, yet the administration is still operating under the old ways.

At the White House this week, Obama is holding an event to honor the Miami Dolphins team that won the Super Bowl — in 1973. “This is an opportunity for them to get the kind of White House visit that contemporary Super Bowl-winning teams get to enjoy,” Earnest explained Monday. “I can tell you, the president is certainly looking forward to it.”

He is also, Earnest disclosed, looking forward to a bus trip at the end of the week, during which he will talk about paying for college. “I think it is going to be, hopefully, both fun and informative,” the spokesman said, tipping the reporters off to the fact that Obama believes that “never has a college education been more critical to the economic success of middle-class families in this country.”

“What’s the fun part?” NBC’s Chuck Todd asked.

“Getting on a bus for a couple of days and seeing America? Sounds pretty good to me,” the earnest man at the microphone replied. “Maybe you don’t think it’s fun. I think it’s going to be.”

Best of all, Earnest said, “the current plan is for the vice president to join the president in his home town of Scranton. So that should be fun.”

Reporters agreed: Biden is fun. “Okay. See? We’re lots of fun,” Earnest said.

Less fun is all the other stuff going on in the world while the president is feting long-retired football players: an Egyptian military ignoring Obama’s calls for restraint and an NSA committing thousands of privacy violations, undermining the president’s claim that surveillance programs aren’t being abused.

On the NSA, Earnest offered the platitude that “there is an important balance for us to strike.” On U.S.-Egypt ties, he attested that “we certainly value that relationship. I think it’s fair to say that the Egyptian government does as well.”

But not enough to heed Obama’s demands. Or maybe they just aren’t paying attention. It’s August, after all.

Any decision to leave would be particularly wrenching for the tens of thousands of Russian-speaking women who met and married Syrian men who were sent to study in the former Soviet Union and who now live across Syria.

At the airport in Moscow, Russian evacuees described a sharp deterioration over the last year. Natalya Yunus said she ran a salon on the outskirts of Damascus until the Free Syrian Army captured her neighborhood, asking, “where could I go with no lights, no water, no money?”

“It was good for me there for a long time, but in the end it was terrifying,” said Ms. Yunus, whose husband remained behind in Syria. “Of course it’s terrifying, it’s a war, what can you do? There are machine guns, planes. And now I’m in a situation with no way out. There is nowhere to go.”

Her daughter, Anzhelika, said she had also left her husband behind.

“We ran,” she said. “How else can you put it?”

Rushana Vildanova, 26, spent the early morning waiting at the airport, waiting for her husband, Ali, who is a shopkeeper, and their 7-year-old daughter. She said Ali’s mother had died when the roof of their house caved in after a bomb exploded in their section of Damascus, and he was badly injured. She said she left Syria at the very beginning of the conflict, and that in recent months, he confided that he wanted to get out.

“I left right when it started, he stayed behind because he never thought it would get this bad,” she said. “At first there were demonstrations, and it all started there.”

Natalya Ivanova was waiting for her daughter, Olga, who has lived in Syria for the last 13 years. “What could she do? She took her daughter and she left, even though her husband had to stay behind,” she said. “And we are happy that she did that, she had to do that, and now she is here with us. If only for the time being.”"

Le président américain a invité les parlementaires à s'attaquer aux réformes de l'immigration et de l'agriculture et à s'entendre sur un budget durable. Les événements des deux dernières semaines à Washington, a-t-il poursuivi, ont infligé des dégâts ""totalement inutiles"" à l'économie américaine. ""Tous mes amis du Congrès doivent comprendre que la façon dont le travail est fait dans cette ville doit changer, parce que nous avons tous beaucoup de pain sur la planche."" Barack Obama s'exprimait une douzaine d'heures après avoir promulgué la loi sur le relèvement du plafond de la dette et la reprise de l'activité dans les services publics, qui ont été en partie paralysés pendant 16 jours. ""Maintenant que l'administration a rouvert et que cette menace pour l'économie est levée, nous devons tous cesser de nous focaliser sur les lobbyistes, les blogueurs, les animateurs de radio et les militants professionnels qui profitent des conflits pour nous concentrer sur ce que la majorité des Américains nous ont envoyés faire ici"", a-t-il ajouté. La loi qu'il a promulguée mercredi n'apporte qu'une solution temporaire et ne résout en rien la question du contrôle des dépenses fédérales ni celle du déficit budgétaire qui divisent profondément républicains et démocrates. Elle permet le financement des services fédéraux jusqu'au 15 janvier et autorise le Trésor à emprunter jusqu'au 7 février, en lui laissant une marge de manoeuvre supplémentaire si le Congrès ne parvient pas à un accord définitif au début de l'an prochain. Le compromis ne tient pas compte de la principale demande des républicains qui, sous l'influence du 'Tea Party', favorable à une forte réduction de la fiscalité et des dépenses publiques, voulaient remettre en cause l'ensemble de la réforme du système de santé, dite ""Obamacare"". FOLIE Les déclarations du président démocrate n'ont guère impressionné les républicains, qui lui promettent de nouvelles heures difficiles. ""Le président doit finalement prendre conscience que les républicains ont remporté la majorité à la Chambre et qu'il partage la responsabilité de gouverner"", a réagi Brendan Buck, porte-parole du président de la Chambre des représentants, John Boehner. ""Si le président persiste à refuser de négocier ou à effectuer la moindre véritable concession, je ne sais pas comment il espère qu'on parvienne à quoi que ce soit susceptible d'aider le peuple américain."" Un attaché parlementaire républicain de haut rang a aussi déclaré: ""Où était-il durant tout ce temps? Se montrer une fois que tout est fini pour venir donner des leçons, ça ne sert à rien."" L'échec des républicains à fragiliser l'Obamacare a semé la discorde au sein du Grand Old Party, auquel l'opinion impute la responsabilité de la crise. ""Nous avons mené bataille. Il est temps maintenant de nous replier et d'identifier les choses sur lesquelles nous pouvons nous entendre"", a estimé le député républicain Tom Cole, membre de l'équipe chargée des négociations à venir sur le budget. Plusieurs centaines de milliers de fonctionnaires mis en chômage technique pendant le ""shutdown"" des services publics ont repris le travail jeudi. Le vice-président Joe Biden a lui-même apporté des viennoiseries aux membres de l'Agence de protection de l'environnement (EPA), tandis que le secrétaire à l'Agriculture Tom Vilsack accueillait le personnel de son ministère. ""J'espère juste que nous ne vivrons pas ça de nouveau dans deux mois"", a déclaré une sous-traitante de l'EPA. La croissance économique américaine sera sans doute inférieure à ce qui était initialement prévu en raison de l'érosion de la confiance provoquée par la crise politico-budgétaire qui a sévi ces deux dernières semaines à Washington, montre une enquête Reuters publiée jeudi. (voir ) Le quatrième trimestre 2013 devait être celui de la transition vers une croissance plus solide, mais les économistes interrogés sont de moins en moins optimistes. ""La folie à Washington pénalise la confiance du consommateur et des entreprises. C'est une véritable entrave pour la croissance"", a estimé Joel Naroff, économiste en chef chez Naroff Economic Advisors. L'enquête réalisée auprès de plus de 70 économistes entre le 11 octobre et mercredi table sur une croissance de 2,3% du produit intérieur brut en rythme annualisé sur les trois derniers mois de l'année. En avril 2011, la quasi-fermeture de l'administration américaine avait déjà conduit à une impasse sur le plafond de la dette en juillet et en août suivants, ce qui mis les Etats-Unis au bord du défaut et leur a fait perdre leur précieux triple ""AAA"".

Speaking on NBC's ""Tonight Show,"" broadcast Tuesday evening, Obama told host Jay Leno that Americans should go ahead with summer travel plans abroad despite global travel warnings. But he said they should ""show some common sense"" and recognize that some countries are more dangerous than others.

He didn't specify which countries posed the greatest threat. He also wouldn't say whether the U.S. learned of the threat through National Security Agency Surveillance programs. Nineteen U.S. embassies and consulates in 16 countries have been ordered closed to the public until Saturday.

Obama also made his first comments about National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, saying that he was ""disappointed"" that Russia granted him temporary asylum.

""There have been times where they slip back into Cold War thinking and a Cold War mentality,"" Obama said.

Snowden, an ex-NSA systems analyst, is accused of leaking details about highly-secretive government surveillance programs. He spent several weeks in the transit zone of a Moscow airport before being granted asylum for a year.

Obama also lauded two of his former political rivals: former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.

When Leno brought up a White House lunch that Clinton and Obama shared last week, Obama acknowledged that he had invited the former Secretary of State, saying Clinton ""had that post-administration glow ... when folks leave the White House like two weeks later, they look great.""

The president also discussed the status of Obamacare, and maintained that previously uninsured Americans would be eligible to sign up to receive health insurance on October 1."

""The American global domination project is bound to generate all kinds of resistance in the post-colonial world,"" Richard Falk, the UN Human Rights Council's Palestine monitor, wrote in an article for Foreign Policy Journal titled, “A Commentary on the Marathon Murders.""

""It is soon to tell, and the somewhat hysterical Boston dragnet for the remaining at large and alive suspect does suggest that the wounds of 9/11 are far from healed,"" he wrote. ""We should be asking ourselves at this moment, 'How many canaries will have to die before we awaken from our geopolitical fantasy of global domination?'”

Falk also blamed Israel for the unrest he believes prompted two brothers of Chechen descent to set bombs that killed three innocent people and injure nearly 200, then kill a police officer.

[pullquote]

""The war drums are beating at this moment in relation to both North Korea and Iran, and as long as Tel Aviv has the compliant ear of the American political establishment, those who wish for peace and justice in the world should not rest easy,"" he wrote.

The comments drew a sharp rebuke from Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch. In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Ambassador Susan Rice, the Geneva-based monitoring organization's chief expressed outrage.

“First, its thesis is that America is to blame for last week’s atrocity,” the letter reads. “Falk approvingly cites comments justifying the Boston Marathon bombings as ‘retribution’ for actions of the U.S. military in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan.”

Neuer’s letter, which also referenced Falk's past promotion of conspiracy theories following the Sept. 11 terror attacks on his personal blog, called on Ban to condemn Falk.

“Mr. Falk’s odious and preposterous remarks insult last week’s victims and discredit the cause of human rights and the founding principles of the United Nations,” Neuer’s letter concludes. “We urge you to speak out.”

Calls seeking comment from UN officials were not immediately returned. UN spokesman Farhan Haq told UN Watch that Falk is an independent expert.

“The secretary-general did not appoint him and is not responsible for his views,” Haq told UN Watch. “Mr. Falk reports to the Human Rights Council, which is comprised of different member states.”

Haq’s comment came in a reply to an inquiry by David Bedein, director of the Center for Near East Policy Research.

Neuer said he was confused by the UN chief’s silence.

“The secretary-general has rightly rebuked Falk in the past for promoting 9/11 conspiracy on his personal blog, and the outrage this time is far more substantial, offensive and repugnant,” he said in a statement. “We indeed urge all UN Human Rights Council member states to condemn Falk, and we have appealed for US Ambassador Susan Rice in particular, but Mr. Ban should use his moral pulpit to show leadership in the world body.”"

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

An influx of heavy weaponry has aided anti-regime forces in recent weeks in a conflict in which an estimated 70,000 people have been killed.

An influx of heavy weaponry has aided anti-regime forces in recent weeks in a conflict in which nearly 70,000 people have been killed.

The Obama administration is moving toward a major policy shift on Syria that could provide rebels there with equipment such as body armor and armored vehicles, and possibly military training, and could send humanitarian assistance directly to Syria’s opposition political coalition, according to U.S. and European officials.

The administration has not provided direct aid to the military or political side of the opposition throughout the two-year-old conflict, and U.S. officials remain opposed to providing weapons to the rebels.

Elements of the proposed policy, which officials cautioned have not yet been finalized, are being discussed by Secretary of State John F. Kerry in meetings this week and next with allies in Europe and the Middle East as part of a coordinated effort to end the bloody stalemate, which has claimed about 70,000 lives.

Those talks — along with a nearly two-hour meeting in Berlin on Tuesday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and a Thursday conference with allies and leaders of the Syrian Opposition Coalition in Rome — are expected to weigh heavily on administration deliberations.

Kerry has repeatedly made indirect references to a policy shift during his travels. He told a group of German students Tuesday that the United States wants a “peaceful resolution” in Syria, but if its leaders refuse to negotiate and continue to kill citizens, “then you need to at least provide some kind of support” for those fighting for their rights.

On Monday in London, he said: “We are not coming to Rome simply to talk. We’re coming . . . to make decisions about next steps.”

Opposition political leaders had threatened to boycott the Rome meeting, but they were persuaded to attend after telephone calls in which Kerry and Vice President Biden said substantive proposals would be on the table.

The pending shift to a more active role comes as the administration and its partners backing the opposition, including Britain, France and countries in Syria’s region, have concluded that there is little immediate chance for a negotiated political settlement with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Western officials have also acknowledged that the opposition coalition is unlikely to quickly develop a governing infrastructure or attract significant support from fence-sitting Syrian minorities and Assad supporters.

The opposition, meanwhile, has been strident in its criticism of the United States and others for refusing to provide it with the resources to organize a quasi-government and broaden its support inside Syria.

The Obama administration, citing legal restrictions on direct funding of the opposition, has funneled $385 million in humanitarian aid through international institutions and nongovernmental organizations, most of which operate under Syrian government supervision.

On the military side, the administration has established direct contact with rebel leaders but has limited aid to communications equipment delivered indirectly. A push last summer to arm the rebels, backed by then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, then-CIA Director David H. Petraeus and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, was rejected by the White House in favor of continued efforts to build the political opposition.

While anti-government fighters have made significant gains against Assad’s military, concern has grown that militants linked to al-Qaeda have begun to dominate the opposition force. Early this year, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries directly arming the opposition fighters increased weapons shipments to secular and moderate Islamist rebel factions after consultations with Washington.

A senior Arab official in the region said those armaments, including antitank weapons and recoilless rifles, have begun flowing into Syria. The New York Times reported Tuesday that at least some of those weapons were purchased in Croatia.

Britain and France have pushed to lift a European Union arms embargo on Syria. At a meeting in Brussels last week, political representatives of some of the E.U.’s 27 members refused to lift the year-long embargo entirely when it expires this Friday. Instead, they renewed it for three months and agreed to reconsider it in May.

More important, according to several European officials, the E.U. inserted a clause that allows member countries “to provide greater non-lethal support and technical assistance for the protection of civilians.”

Finalization of the new provision will be announced Thursday as Kerry and representatives of other governments meet with the opposition coalition in Rome, said officials close to the deliberations.

Although a number of countries opposed the change, it was favored by Britain, France, Germany and Italy, according to a European official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss rapidly evolving policies.

“Under the old E.U. setup, we couldn’t do anything,” a senior European official said. The new rule will allow “things that don’t of themselves kill people,” including night-vision equipment, armored vehicles and military training.

Another European official said, “We’re talking about things that can be helpful on the ground — bulletproof jackets, binoculars and communications.”

Each country participating in the effort is expected to decide for itself what equipment it will supply. The European officials said they have been in close contact with the Obama administration about its intentions and have been told that discussions are ongoing.

Asked Tuesday about prospects for expanding U.S. military support for the rebels, Kerry said he would not speculate on the outcome of the meeting with opposition leaders.

“We’re going to Rome to bring a group of nations together precisely to talk about this problem,” Kerry said. “I don’t want to get ahead of that meeting or ability to begin to think about exactly what will be a part of it.”

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Kerry and Lavrov, his Russian counterpart, spent the bulk of their meeting discussing Syria. Lavrov met in Moscow on Monday with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who said the Assad government is willing to talk with opponents while continuing its fight “against terrorism.”

Opposition leader Mouaz al-Khatib deflected a Russian offer to visit Moscow amid disagreements within the coalition.

Lavrov called his meeting with Kerry “constructive” and told reporters that they agreed to do everything in their power “to create the best conditions to facilitate the soonest possible start of a dialogue between the government and the opposition,” Reuters reported.

He said Russia wants the opposition to name representatives for talks with the government, and he blamed “extremists” in the coalition for stopping progress toward negotiations.

A resettlement plan under discussion in Washington and other capitals is aimed at relieving pressure on Middle Eastern countries straining to support 1.6 million refugees, as well as assisting hard-hit Syrian families.

The State Department is “ready to consider the idea,” an official from the department said, if the administration receives a formal request from the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which is the usual procedure.

The United States usually accepts about half the refugees that the U.N. agency proposes for resettlement. California has historically taken the largest share, but Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia are also popular destinations.

U.N. refugee officials, diplomats and nongovernmental relief groups plan to discuss possible resettlement schemes at a high-level meeting this week in Geneva. Germany already has committed to taking 5,000 people.

“It was probably inevitable that in this crisis, with these overwhelming numbers, governments would start moving in this direction,” said Lavinia Limon, chief executive officer of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a Virginia-based advocacy and service group. “But there will be resistance.”

The Obama administration supports rebels trying to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad, but is wary of deeper involvement in Syria.

The issue is politically sensitive on several levels.

Congress strongly resisted accepting Iraqi refugees, including interpreters who had worked with U.S. forces, after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Most lawmakers share White House caution about getting more engaged in Syria and may have little appetite for a major influx.

But Susan Rice, President Obama’s new national security advisor, and Samantha Power, Obama’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to the U.N., both have been strong advocates for refugees. They may make the White House more receptive to at least a partial opening.

Homeland security officials require careful vetting of refugees, with multiple interviews and background checks before they are allowed to enter the country. Under normal circumstances, the screening process can take a year or longer.

U.S. officials are likely to be extra careful with Syrian refugees. As Islamic militants take a more prominent role in the rebel forces, officials worry about fighters with Al Qaeda ties trying to enter the country. Two resettled Iraqis were convicted of trying to send arms to Al Qaeda from their home in Bowling Green, Ky.

The refugee dilemma is more acute for countries that lie on Syria’s borders.

Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon, which have absorbed the bulk of the refugees, worry that a resettlement plan could actually widen the flood if Syrians see a chance for a better life in North America, Europe or Australia.

Jordan and Lebanon each have taken in about 500,000 refugees and Turkey has more than 375,000, according to the U.N. refugee agency. It predicts that the total number of refugees will double to 3.2 million by the end of the year.

Turkey already has demanded that the West take some its refugees, even proposing an airlift to fly them abroad. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has faced angry protests against his government for giving refuge to so many Syrians, declared last month, “We are the first victims of the Syrian situation.”

Some Middle Eastern officials worry they may get stuck housing and feeding refugees for months or years while the West does the vetting, leading to an even longer logjam and more domestic political turmoil.

“Their view is that unless this involves big numbers, it’s not worth doing,” said a European official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject. “You need to be talking about tens of thousands of people.”

Western officials try to discourage poor foreigners who are seeking a more comfortable life or business opportunities in the West. They say resettlement is only for those who can’t go home, and seek to dispel notions that an easy life awaits.

According to a State Department publication aimed at refugees, “Cars are not provided.... Most Americans value self-reliance and hard work. They expect newcomers to find jobs as soon as possible and to take care of themselves and their families.”

Another sensitive issue is who qualifies for resettlement. Western countries often prefer intact, well-educated families with familiar religious backgrounds.

But experts say 80% of the Syrian refugees are women and children, many with war-related injuries or psychological problems that could hamper finding work or going to school.

Kirk Johnson, founder of the List Project, which has pushed for Iraqi resettlement, said it may be difficult to sell Syrian resettlement to Congress. He said it would require an advocacy effort and sympathetic lawmakers, “and I don’t seen either of those necessary ingredients.”

Yet most refugee advocates predict that Americans will ultimately help the Syrians.

“Americans have a long tradition of welcoming refugees,” said Daryl Grisgraber, a Washington-based Middle East specialist at Refugees International, which provides advocacy and services for refugees. “They’ll respond here, too.”

* Says unaware of son's plans, believes he is not disclosing information

* Russia has not disclosed Snowden's location

By Steve Gutterman

MOSCOW, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden's father arrived in Moscow on Thursday to see his son, who was granted asylum in Russia after he leaked details of government surveillance programmes and fled the United States.

Speaking at the same Moscow airport where his fugitive son was stranded for weeks this summer, Lon Snowden said he had no direct contact with Edward Snowden but that he felt ""extreme gratitude that my son is safe and secure and he's free"".

The younger Snowden, 30, is wanted in the United States on espionage charges and Russia's decision to grant him temporary asylum aggravated already tense relations between Moscow and Washington.

Russian authorities and the Russian lawyer who is assisting Snowden, Anatoly Kucherena, have not disclosed his location.

""I am not sure my son will be returning to the U.S. again. That's his decision, he is an adult, he is a person who is responsible for his own agency,"" Lon Snowden said, standing beside Kucherena at Sheremetyevo airport.

""I am his father, I love my son and I certainly hope I will have an opportunity to see my son,"" Snowden said.

Edward Snowden was the source of disclosures about U.S. government surveillance that included details about a program that collected e-mails, chat logs and other types of data from companies such as Google Inc and Facebook Inc.

""I really have no idea what his intentions are,"" Lon Snowden said, citing his lack of direct contact with him.

But he said he believed Snowden had not been involved in the publication of any information since he arrived in Russia and was ""simply trying to remain healthy and safe"".

Directly from the airport, he and the lawyer drove to a state television studio to give an exclusive live interview, indicating the visit was under strong government control.

Kucherena, who said he last saw Edward Snowden on Wednesday, expressed hope the former intelligence contractor would soon find a job in Russia - possibly in IT or human rights sector - because he has largely run out of his savings and was living modestly, mainly of donations.

He also said the fugitive American lived under security in Russia and was avoiding publicity because of the U.S. chase after him.

NO HANDOVER

Snowden, who worked as a systems administrator at a U.S. National Security Agency facility in Hawaii, fled to Hong Kong in June and then flew to Moscow. The United States annulled his passport and urged nations in Latin America and elsewhere not to take him in or help him find refuge from U.S. prosecution.

President Vladimir Putin rejected repeated American pleas to hand Snowden over to the United States but has denied Russia had any role in Snowden's disclosures or that its intelligence agencies were working with him in any way.

Putin has used Snowden's case to accuse the United States of preaching to the world about rights and freedoms it does not uphold at home.

After Snowden was granted asylum, on Aug. 1, U.S. President Barack Obama pulled out of a summit with Putin that had been scheduled for early September in Moscow, but then met Putin at a G20 summit in St. Petersburg.

Edward Snowden is in the running for the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, a European human rights award whose past winners include Nelson Mandela and Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The winner is to be chosen on Thursday."

Pawlowski'],Florida celebrates 500th anniversary,"Magic kingdoms, princesses and roller coasters usually dominate the itineraries of Florida visitors, but this week a Spanish explorer and a big moment in history are overshadowing them all.

Tuesday marks the 500th anniversary of Juan Ponce de León becoming the first recorded European to land on Florida's shores, or anywhere else in the current United States. Historians believe the event happened on or around April 2, 1513.

Arriving right around Easter, Ponce de León named the new land La Florida, meaning the ""land of flowers” and a reference to “Pascua Florida,” the Feast of Flowers -- Spain’s Easter celebration.

The state is marking the occasion with Viva Florida 500, a year-long celebration that began in January and is hitting a crescendo right now with “Viva Florida 500 Week.”

“We’re highlighting this to really stand out as the week within the year when that important moment in history occurred,” Chris Cate, a spokesman for the Florida Department of State, told NBC News.

“We think it’s a big deal not just from a tourism standpoint but an educational standpoint as well.”

A re-enactment of Ponce de León’s landing and the unveiling of a 10-foot statue of the explorer is taking place in Melbourne Beach on Tuesday.

If you missed that celebration, another re-enactment of the landing will take place in St. Augustine on Wednesday, complete with the firing of cannons from the Castillo de San Marcos. Meanwhile, the U.S. Post Office will commemorate the anniversary with the unveiling of the “La Florida” Forever stamp.

On Thursday, historical documents rarely glimpsed by the public -- including the state’s original 1838 Constitution and a 1586 map of Sir Francis Drake's West Indian voyage -- will go on display in the Department of State's Museum of Florida History.

But perhaps the most anticipated event is the arrival of “El Galeón,” a 170-foot, 495-ton wooden replica of a 16-century Spanish galleon. The ship left Puerto Rico on Monday and is sailing toward Florida, where it will call on ports in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Cape Canaveral and St. Augustine later this month.

Tourism officials hope all that focus on history will expand travelers’ perceptions of the state, showing them it’s not all just about beaches and theme parks.

“By offering visitors a whole new reason to explore the Sunshine State in 2013 with events such as the upcoming arrival of El Galeon, we are continuing to increase the economic impact of travelers to Florida,” said Will Seccombe, president and CEO of Visit Florida, in a statement.

The goal is not just to attract more travelers, but to also convince the tourists who have come to visit a theme park to stay an extra day to explore Florida’s historic sites, Cate said. The state is reaching out to international visitors as well.

“This is a message we really want to carry world-wide… I do think there’s a lot of interest for overseas visitors to come to Florida and see how they helped shape our state,” Cate said, noting that beyond Spanish rule, the region was also under the British flag and the French flag during its history.

You can check out all of the events taking place as part of Viva Florida 500 on the initiative’s official website."

Having assumed for months that the United States was unlikely to intervene militarily in Syria, the Defense Department has been thrust onto a war footing that has made many in the armed services uneasy, according to interviews with more than a dozen military officers ranging from captains to a four-star general.

Former and current officers, many with the painful lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan on their minds, said the main reservations concern the potential unintended consequences of launching cruise missiles against Syria.

Some questioned the use of military force as a punitive measure and suggested that the White House lacks a coherent strategy. If the administration is ambivalent about the wisdom of defeating or crippling the Syrian leader, possibly setting the stage for Damascus to fall to fundamentalist rebels, they said, the military objective of strikes on Assad’s military targets is at best ambiguous.

“There’s a broad naivete in the political class about America’s obligations in foreign policy issues, and scary simplicity about the effects that employing American military power can achieve,” said retired Lt. Gen. Gregory S. Newbold, who served as director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the run-up to the Iraq war, noting that many of his contemporaries are alarmed by the plan.

New cycle of attacks?

Marine Lt. Col. Gordon Miller, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, warned this week of “potentially devastating consequences, including a fresh round of chemical weapons attacks and a military response by Israel.”

“If President [Bashar al-Assad] were to absorb the strikes and use chemical weapons again, this would be a significant blow to the United States’ credibility and it would be compelled to escalate the assault on Syria to achieve the original objectives,” Miller wrote in a commentary for the think tank.

A National Security Council spokeswoman said Thursday she would not discuss “internal deliberations.” White House officials reiterated Thursday that the administration is not contemplating a protracted military engagement.

Still, many in the military are skeptical. Getting drawn into the Syrian war, they fear, could distract the Pentagon in the midst of a vexing mission: its exit from Afghanistan, where U.S. troops are still being killed regularly. A young Army officer who is wrapping up a year-long tour there said soldiers were surprised to learn about the looming strike, calling the prospect “very dangerous.”

“I can’t believe the president is even considering it,” said the officer, who like most officers interviewed for this story agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity because military personnel are reluctant to criticize policymakers while military campaigns are being planned. “We have been fighting the last 10 years a counterinsurgency war. Syria has modern weaponry. We would have to retrain for a conventional war.”

Dempsey’s warning

Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has warned in great detail about the risks and pitfalls of U.S. military intervention in Syria.

“As we weigh our options, we should be able to conclude with some confidence that use of force will move us toward the intended outcome,” Dempsey wrote last month in a letter to the Senate Armed Services Committee. “Once we take action, we should be prepared for what comes next. Deeper involvement is hard to avoid.”

Dempsey has not spoken publicly about the administration’s planned strike on Syria, and it is unclear to what extent his position shifted after last week’s alleged chemical weapons attack. Dempsey said this month in an interview with ABC News that the lessons of Iraq weigh heavily on his calculations regarding Syria.

“It has branded in me the idea that the use of military power must be part of an overall strategic solution that includes international partners and a whole of government,” he said in the Aug. 4 interview. “Simply the application of force rarely produces and, in fact, maybe never produces the outcome we seek.”

The recently retired head of the U.S. Central Command, Gen. James Mattis, said last month at a security conference that the United States has “no moral obligation to do the impossible” in Syria. “If Americans take ownership of this, this is going to be a full-throated, very, very serious war,” said Mattis, who as Centcom chief oversaw planning for a range of U.S. military responses in Syria.

The potential consequences of a U.S. strike include a retaliatory attack by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah — which supports Assad — on Israel, as well as cyberattacks on U.S. targets and infrastructure, U.S. military officials said.

“What is the political end state we’re trying to achieve?” said a retired senior officer involved in Middle East operational planning who said his concerns are widely shared by active-duty military leaders. “I don’t know what it is. We say it’s not regime change. If it’s punishment, there are other ways to punish.” The former senior officer said that those who are expressing alarm at the risks inherent in the plan “are not being heard other than in a pro-forma manner.”

President Obama said in a PBS interview on Wednesday that he is not contemplating a lengthy engagement, but instead “limited, tailored approaches.”

A retired Central Command officer said the administration’s plan would “gravely disappoint our allies and accomplish little other than to be seen as doing something.”

“It will be seen as a half measure by our allies in the Middle East,” the officer said. “Iran and Syria will portray it as proof that the U.S. is unwilling to defend its interests in the region.”

Still, some within the military, while apprehensive, support striking Syria. W. Andrew Terrill, a Middle East expert at the U.S. Army War College, said the limited history of the use of chemical weapons in the region suggests that a muted response from the West can be dangerous.

“There is a feeling as you look back that if you don’t stand up to chemical weapons, they’re going to take it as a green light and use them on a recurring basis,” he said.

An Army lieutenant colonel said the White House has only bad options but should resist the urge to abort the plan now.

“When a president draws a red line, for better or worse, it’s policy,” he said, referring to Obama’s declaration last year about Syria’s potential use of chemical weapons. “It cannot appear to be scared or tepid. Remember, with respect to policy choices concerning Syria, we are discussing degrees of bad and worse.”"

But a much more complicated sell was the tough message he delivered in a bold speech on Thursday afternoon, saying that Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state was threatened by settlement building and other activities in the Palestinian territories, and calling young people to pressure politicians to advance the peace process. As the words began to sink in, some Israelis wondered if they would be followed by more pressure from Washington.

Individual Israelis and analysts alike said Mr. Obama had hit all the right notes in his internationally televised address and throughout his first visit as president. He cracked jokes, quoted the Talmud and revered Israeli figures, pledged America’s unwavering emotional and financial support while asserting Israel’s right to defend itself, and, perhaps most important, echoed the Israeli narrative of the conflict with the Palestinians.

“Obama finally learned to speak Israeli,” said Yossi Klein Halevi, a writer and fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute. He called the speech “a love song to Israel.”"
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/24/pirates-kidnap-us-sailors_n_4155154.html,2013-10-24 00:00:00,[],Pirates Kidnap U.S. Sailors Off Nigerian Coast,"ABUJA/WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Pirates attacked an oil supply vessel off the Nigerian coast and kidnapped the captain and chief engineer, both U.S. citizens, American officials said on Thursday as the Nigerian military ordered its Navy to rescue the men.

""We believe this was an act of piracy,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said, adding that U.S. officials were closely monitoring the situation and seeking more information.

""At this point, we do not have information that would indicate this was an act of terrorism,"" Harf told reporters in a briefing. ""Obviously, our concern at this point is for the safe return of the two U.S. citizens.""

Pirate attacks off Nigeria's coast have jumped by a third this year as ships passing through West Africa's Gulf of Guinea, a major commodities route, have come under threat from gangs wanting to snatch cargoes and crews.

The U.S.-flagged C-Retriever, a 222-foot (67 metre) vessel owned by U.S. marine transport group Edison Chouest Offshore, was attacked early Wednesday, UK-based security firm AKE and two security sources said. The company was not immediately available for comment.

A U.S. defense official said the State Department and FBI were leading the American response to the incident. A second defense official said the U.S. Marine Corps has a small training unit in the region but it was not clear if it would get involved.

However, representatives for the Nigerian Navy said they were aware of the incident and taking action. ""We have directed the central Naval Command to see to their rescue. So our men are on top of the situation,"" spokesman Kabiru Aliyu told Reuters.

U.S. Navy officials have grown increasingly concerned about piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea and are working with local authorities there to strengthen their ability to patrol the region and better share information.

The White House said on Thursday it is increasingly concerned about the rise in piracy off the coast of West Africa.

""More broadly, we are concerned by the disturbing increase in the incidence of maritime crime, including incidents of piracy off the coast of West Africa, specifically in the Gulf of Guinea,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters at a briefing.

Navy Secretary Ray Mabus has called the region a potential ""hot spot"" after a visit to four countries surrounding the gulf in August. He told Defense News in September the Navy was working closely with Gabon, Senegal, Sao Tome and Ghana to help fight an increase in illegal trafficking of drugs, people and arms.

""The piracy threat is spreading even further through the waters of West Africa, and the attacks have been mounting, even as global rates of reported piracy are at their lowest since 2006,"" said Michael Frodl of U.S.-based consultancy C-Level Maritime Risks.

CONTRAST TO HORN OF AFRICA

Unlike the dangerous waters off Somalia and the Horn of Africa on the east coast of Africa, through which ships now speed with armed guards on board, many vessels have to anchor to do business off West African countries with little protection.

This makes them targets for criminals and raises insurance costs. Kidnapped sailors and oil workers taken in Nigerian waters are usually released after a ransom is paid.

In a separate incident, three Nigerian soldiers were killed on Tuesday when armed robbers attacked a vessel carrying construction workers in the creeks of oil-producing Rivers state, the army said on Thursday.

Piracy has regained attention in the U.S. recently since the release of a movie earlier this month chronicling an April 2009 hijacking of a U.S. ship by Somali attackers.

The incident involved a cargo ship seized off the Horn of Africa later rescued by the U.S. Navy, which sent two ships and Navy SEALS to intervene."

Syria is not the only Saudi grievance against the Obama administration. With Egypt, the Saudis were angry that Washington turned on its longtime ally, President Hosni Mubarak, and accepted the election of an Islamist, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Saudis were again upset that the United States suspended some aid after the military overthrew Mr. Morsi in July.

While Washington may have felt it had no choice but to support the millions who poured into the street calling for Mr. Mubarak’s ouster and to show some displeasure with a military takeover, the Saudis saw the United States as having let down an ally in support of the Islamists, twice.

The Saudis also feel slighted by Washington’s seeming eagerness to reach a nuclear deal with Iran — negotiations they feel they should be a part of. Iran is Saudi Arabia’s nemesis in the region, and the Saudis are worried that Washington is again being naïve in trusting that Iran will offer a sincere and verifiable compromise with its nuclear program.

But Syria has been a special concern for Saudi Arabia’s monarch, King Abdullah, Saudi officials say, for two reasons. He feels responsible for halting the wide-scale killing of his fellow Sunni Muslims. And Syria has become the most important battleground, in Saudi eyes, for the perennial conflict with Iran, which is seen here as almost an existential threat to the kingdom because of its goal of exporting its own brand of revolutionary Shiite Islam across the Muslim world.

“Saudi Arabia cannot afford to be encircled by Iran, from Iraq and Syria. That is out of the question,” said Khalid al-Dakhil, a political sociology professor at King Saud University who has called for Saudi Arabia to become less dependent on the United States.

The Saudis were initially reluctant to provide military support to the rebels in Syria after the uprising turned into an armed opposition movement in 2011. The interior minister, Muhammad bin Nayef, was against it, and cited the concern that money and arms could flow to jihadists, according to a Western diplomat who spoke with him at the time.

The Saudis began funneling arms to the rebels in 2012, but provided light weapons only, largely out of concern that heavier weapons could get into the hands of jihadists. They mostly worked through middlemen, including Lebanese political figures who had long been part of their patronage network. But that approach hampered their effectiveness, with much of the money landing in foreign bank accounts instead of buying weapons for the rebels."

John Kerry is a far more effective salesman when his heart is in it.

When he did the “full Ginsburg” of Sunday show appearances to defend President Obama’s decision to delay action on Syria, Kerry seemed dutiful and workmanlike, repeating the same talking points without much enthusiasm and often averting his gaze from the camera.

People should be “celebrating” Obama’s decision to seek congressional approval, said Kerry, who hardly appeared in a celebratory mood.

What a contrast with his command performance less than 48 hours earlier, when the secretary of State urged action against Syria over chemical attacks that he said he shocked the conscience of the world.

In that speech, the 2004 presidential candidate was impassioned, filled with moral fervor about the need to punish the “thug” and “murderer” Bashar Assad for gassing his own people.

This matters, in public relations terms, because the White House has tapped Kerry as the man to make the case for military action, as Colin Powell did in 2002 and 2003.

But when Obama abruptly decided to hold off after discussions with his White House aides, Kerry was informed afterwards with a phone call—and sent out to defend the move on ""Meet the Press,"" ""Face the Nation,"" ""This Week,"" ""Fox News Sunday"" and ""State of the Union.""

While the Sunday shows draw a heavily insider audience, they fill a weekend news vacuum (which is why Kerry used them to announce new evidence that the Syrian regime used deadly sarin). They also lay down a marker, as Susan Rice found after being dispatched to the same five shows with Benghazi talking points that turned out to be false. Otherwise she’d probably be running Foggy Bottom now.

Kerry, not surprisingly, ran into a buzzsaw of skeptical questioning.

“Do you feel undermined? Do you feel the United States has undermined its leverage in the world?” David Gregory asked.

“This isn’t 'CSI.' This isn’t a civics lesson. People’s lives are at stake,” Chris Wallace said.

“They already declared victory in Syria this morning, the Assad regime,” said George Stephanopoulos, who also spoke of the chances of “getting sucked into a wider war.”

Kerry was in the awkward position of repeatedly insisting he didn’t have to address the possibility of a congressional rejection because that was not going to happen. But the truth is it remains an open question—and Obama has had little success in getting his way on most issues.

It’s no surprise the Sunday anchors were skeptical of a cabinet officer who by all appearances was having to squelch his disagreement with the commander-in-chief."

He went to look for his father, whom he hadn’t seen for years. He left a note for his mother explaining that he missed his father and wanted to find him, and asking her to forgive him for leaving without permission.

A couple of days after Abdulrahman left, we were relieved to receive word that he was safe and with cousins in southern Yemen, where our family is from. Days later, his father was targeted and killed by American drones in a northern province, hundreds of miles away. After Anwar died, Abdulrahman called us and said he was going to return home.

That was the last time I heard his voice. He was killed just two weeks after his father.

A country that believes it does not even need to answer for killing its own is not the America I once knew. From 1966 to 1977, I fulfilled a childhood dream and studied in the United States as a Fulbright scholar, earning my doctorate and then working as a researcher and assistant professor at universities in New Mexico, Nebraska and Minnesota.

I have fond memories of those years. When I first came to the United States as a student, my host family took me camping by the ocean and on road trips to places like Yosemite, Disneyland and New York — and it was wonderful.

After returning to Yemen, I used my American education and skills to help my country, serving as Yemen’s minister of agriculture and fisheries and establishing one of the country’s leading institutions of higher learning, Ibb University. Abdulrahman used to tell me he wanted to follow in my footsteps and go back to America to study. I can’t bear to think of those conversations now.

After Anwar was put on the government’s list, but before he was killed, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights represented me in a lawsuit challenging the government’s claim that it could kill anyone it deemed an enemy of the state.

The court dismissed the case, saying that I did not have standing to sue on my son’s behalf and that the government’s targeted killing program was outside the court’s jurisdiction anyway."

Boehner said Tuesday he will support President Obama’s request to authorize force against the Syrian government and also said he was confident his fellow lawmakers would do the same.

The statement of support from the Ohio Republican was quickly followed by another from House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), notching two critical votes for the White House in what still appears to be an uphill campaign to win majorities on Capitol Hill.

Boehner, after a meeting with the president and other senior officials at the White House Tuesday morning, said that only the United States could prevent Syrian President Bashar Assad from using chemical weapons, and that a military strike was necessary also as a signal to other potentially hostile regimes.

“We have enemies around the world that need to understand that we’re not going to tolerate this type of behavior. We also have allies around the world and allies in the region who also need to know that America will be there and stand up when it’s necessary,” he told reporters outside the West Wing.

In a written statement, Cantor called Assad’s Syria “the epitome of a rogue state” that “has long posed a direct threat to American interests and to our partners.”

He also said that a draft resolution sent to Congress by the administration “will likely change.” He said that it is up to Obama to make the case to lawmakers and to the American people that this is the right course of action -- an indication that Republican leaders will not make a concerted lobbying effort on their own to convince their members.

“Everyone understands that it is an uphill battle to pass a resolution, and the speaker expects the White House to provide answers to members’ questions and take the lead on any whipping effort,” Brendan Buck, a Boehner spokesman, said. “All votes authorizing the use of military force are conscience votes for members, and passage will require direct, continuous engagement from the White House.”

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), who has expressed support for military action, acknowledged that many of her own constituents are probably opposed to military action, telling reporters after the White House meeting that “the American people need to hear more about the intelligence” suggesting that Assad’s military used chemical weapons in an attack Aug. 21 outside Damascus.

Pelosi also sought to counter the argument that Obama committed the nation to this course of action when he said that the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government would be a “red line.”

“President Obama did not draw the red line. Humanity drew it,” she said.

Pelosi said she would lead a discussion among House Democrats to help build support ahead of a vote next week. She said they would have to decide: “Do they want to ignore the fact that this humanitarian disaster took place or not.” She said they will have to consider what message would be sent to the international community if a vote were to fail.

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said in a statement that many questions have still not been answered and called on the president “to make the case not only to Congress, but to the American people, in a national address.”

The president, though, is scheduled to leave Tuesday night for Sweden and later will travel to Russia for the G-20 meeting on the world’s economy.

In addition to the public and closed hearings scheduled in key congressional committees this week, the administration will continue to brief the full membership. Vice President Joe Biden, who is key to any lobbying effort on Capitol Hill, has canceled a scheduled trip to Florida to discuss education policy.

[For the Record, 12:25 p.m. PDT: An earlier version of this online article said that Sen. John Cornyn did not attend Tuesday’s White House meeting. Cornyn was present.]

Chụp lại hình ảnh, Bộ trưởng Ali Haidar hoan nghênh thỏa thuận

Một bộ trưởng Syria gọi thỏa thuận Mỹ - Nga nhằm loại bỏ vũ khí hóa học của Syria là “thắng lợi” giúp tránh chiến tranh.

Bộ trưởng Hòa giải Dân tộc Ali Haidar nói với hãng tin Nga Ria Novosti: “Đó là thắng lợi cho Syria nhờ các người bạn Nga.”

Cùng ngày, Ngoại trưởng Mỹ John Kerry gặp Thủ tướng Israel Benjamin Netanyahu để tiết lộ chi tiết kế hoạch loại bỏ vũ khí hóa học của Syria.

Sau cuộc gặp, ông Kerry cảnh cáo Damascus: “Đe dọa dùng vũ lực là có thật.”

Syria có một trong những kho vũ khí hóa học lớn nhất thế giới, trong khi kế hoạch của Mỹ và Nga muốn loại bỏ toàn bộ kho này trước giữa năm 2014.

Thỏa thuận có được sau ba ngày họp giữa hai ngoại trưởng Mỹ và Nga ở Geneva.

Nó cho Tổng thống Syria Bashar al-Assad một tuần để nộp chi tiết về kho vũ khí.

Kế hoạch cũng yêu cầu cho phép chuyên gia kiểm soát vũ khí được vào Syria và kiểm tra 45 địa điểm trước tháng 11.

Tổng thống Mỹ Barack Obama đã hoan nghênh thỏa thuận giữa Mỹ và Nga về việc giải tỏa kho vũ khí hóa học của Syria trước thời hạn giữa năm 2014 và nói rằng đây là ‘một bước quan trọng’.

Tuy nhiên, ông cũng tỏ thái độ thận trọng rằng Mỹ mong muốn Syria ‘làm đúng theo những gì họ đã cam kết’.

Lạc quan thận trọng

Trong một tuyên bố của Nhà Trắng, Tổng thống Obama nói thỏa thuận Mỹ-Nga là một ‘bước đi quan trọng, cụ thể hướng tới mục đích đặt kho vũ khí hóa học của Syria dưới sự kiểm soát quốc tế để cuối cùng đi đến phá hủy chúng’.

Tuy nhiên, ông cũng cảnh báo rằng mặc dù Mỹ vẫn tiếp tục làm việc với Nga, Anh, Pháp và Liên Hiệp Quốc cũng như các nước khác để đảm bảo rằng quá trình tiêu hủy hay dỡ bỏ vũ khí hóa học có thể kiểm chứng được nhưng sẽ có ‘hậu quả nếu chế độ Assad không tuân thủ’.

“Nếu các biện pháp ngoại giao thất bại thì Hoa Kỳ vẫn sẵn sàng hành động,” ông nói.

Quân đội Mỹ đã xác nhận hôm thứ Bảy ngày 14/9 rằng Mỹ vẫn ở vị trí sẵn sàng tấn công vào Syria.

Trong một cuộc họp báo chung với người đồng cấp Nga Sergei Lavrov, Ngoại trưởng Mỹ John Kerry đã cảnh báo Tổng thống Syria Bashar al-Assad rằng họ chỉ có tuân thủ hoàn toàn thỏa thuận này.

Cả hai vị ngoại trưởng đều nói rằng nếu Syria bất tuân thì Liên Hiệp Quốc sẽ ra nghị quyết trong khuôn khổ chương 7 và chương 8 của Hiến chương để cho phép dùng vũ lực.

Tuy nhiên, ngoại trưởng Nga đã sốt sắng nói rõ rằng vũ lực chỉ là giải pháp cuối cùng.

“Trong những phương cách đã được thỏa thuận này không có nhắc gì đến vũ lực cũng như các biện pháp trừng phạt tự động. Bất kỳ sự vi phạm nào cần phải được chứng minh một cách thuyết phục hoàn toàn trước Hội đồng Bảo an,” ông nói.

Chụp lại hình ảnh, Mỹ và Nga đã cố gắng hết sức để giải quyết cuộc khủng hoảng Syria

Cả Nga và Mỹ đều đồng ý rằng Chính phủ sở hữu 1.000 tấn chất độc hóa học và chất tiền chế vũ khí hóa học, một quan chức Mỹ cho biết.

Mỹ tin rằng số hóa chất này được cất giữ ở 45 địa điểm và tất cả đều do chính quyền kiểm soát.

Tuy nhiên Nga được cho rằng không đồng ý với số lượng địa điểm này cũng như việc toàn bộ kho vũ khí này là do Chính phủ Syria kiểm soát.

Thỏa thuận yêu cầu các cuộc thanh sát tại chỗ ban đầu phải được hoàn tất trước tháng 11. Tất cả các phương tiện sản xuất vũ khí hóa học cũng phải được phá hủy trước thời hạn này.

Còn trong nửa đầu năm 2014 tất cả vũ khí hóa học và phương tiện sản xuất phải bị triệt tiêu hoàn toàn.

Thắng lợi của Assad?

Pháp, Nga, Liên Hiệp Quốc và Nato đều hoan nghênh thỏa thuận này.

Ngoại trưởng Pháp Laurent Fabius nói đây là ‘một tiến bộ quan trọng’ trong khi Ngoại trưởng Anh William Hague phát biểu trong một thông cáo yêu cầu chế độ Assad phải tuân thủ thỏa thuận hoàn toàn.

Tuy nhiên các phân tích gia thì lại chia rẽ về thỏa thuận này.

Ông Andrew Green, cựu đại sứ Anh tại Syria nhận định rằng mặc dù trên thực tế sẽ có nhiều khó khăn khi thực thi thỏa thuận này nhưng đây là vẫn là một tin ‘hết sức tốt lành’.

“Trước hết nó giúp tránh một hành động quân sự, ít nhất trong thời điểm hiện tại. Thứ hai nó thật sự loại bỏ khả năng chế độ Syria sử dụng vũ khí hóa học một lần nữa. Thứ ba và có lẽ quan trọng hơn, nó mở ra khả năng đối thoại và hợp tác với Nga,” ông nói.

Tuy nhiên, cựu Thứ trưởng Quốc phòng Mỹ Paul Wolfowitz cùng với các Thượng ngị sỹ John McCain và Lindsay Graham của Đảng Cộng hòa thì tỏ ra nghi ngờ về thỏa thuận.

“Cho dù thỏa thuận có đem lại điều gì đi nữa trong việc giảm nguy cơ vũ khí hóa học tiếp tục được sử dụng, rõ ràng cái giá của việc này là loại bỏ bất kỳ hành động nghiêm túc nào của Mỹ và phương Tây nhằm vào chế độ Assad. Đây là một thắng lợi lớn của ông ta và của những đồng minh Nga và Iran của ông ta,” Wolfowitz nói."

Kincaid warns that a “group of radicals” in the “left-wing lobby in the U.S.” are trying to engineer the selection of Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson as Pope. Kincaid’s argument boils down to the fact that Turkson introduced a document on global financial policy which was endorsed by Stephen Schneck of Catholic University (along with Pope Benedict XVI) and attended one of Schneck’s conferences in 2011. Since Schneck supported Obama’s reelection and is tied to the group Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, naturally Kincaid has arrived at the conclusion that Soros is plotting to pick the next pope in order to “use the Vatican in a global campaign against capitalism.”

The entire conservative movement is nuts. Every damn one of them. When even the heads of their big, supposedly serious outlets spend their days doing little else but dreaming up new paranoid conspiracy theories (looking at you, Wayne LaPierre), there's just no conclusion other than the obvious one: Conservatism is just another name for batshit crazy Yep. The article is called “ Black Socialist Pope to Follow Black Socialist President? ”, which is the kind of headline someone like me would write in order to make them look crazy, but now they've decided not to outsource that part anymore. Now, I'm not exactly sure why George Soros (who used to run ACORN, before Agenda 21 installed manatees in all high-ranking ACORN positions) or anyone else would think of the good cardinal from Ghana as the ""progressive"" Catholic choice, much less the fellow who will oversee a systemic worldwide ruination of capitalism (again, you usually would pick someone from Wall Street for that job, or just call in Phil Gramm), but if any of this made sense then it wouldn't be movement conservatism. It just stands to reason that a guy who attended a conference held by a guy who liked Barack Obama better than Mitt Romney must be a secret socialist who Obama is planning in installing as pope using his secret cardinal-controlling Vatican Pope Drones. You'd be crazy to not think so.

Remember: There is absolutely nothing you can say or do that will discredit you in the eyes of the conservative movement. Absolutely nothing.

The Arizona Republic

Some urge Obama to take action on his own to stop deportations

Boehner says House won%27t negotiate with Senate over comprehensive bill

Some groups pushing Latino voter registration

PHOENIX -- This was supposed to be the year of immigration reform.

But with hope quickly fading that an immigration bill will pass by year's end, advocates are shifting their focus to 2014, girding for an even tougher battle as the already-contentious issue drifts into the perilous political waters of an election year.

Reform advocates are determined to keep the immigration debate alive, vowing to continue pressing lawmakers to pass immigration reform, if not this year, then next.

""We need to keep fanning the flames,"" said Eduardo Nevares, auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix and immigration-reform advocate.

Until Congress acts, some activists also are increasing calls on President Barack Obama to take action on his own by stopping deportations and expanding his deferred-action program to a larger number of undocumented immigrants, not just those brought here illegally as children.

One unexpected call for such action drew widespread attention this week, when a heckler shouted at Obama as he delivered a speech in support of immigration reform at a recreation center in San Francisco's Chinatown neighborhood on Monday.

""Mr. President, please use your executive order to halt deportations for all 11.5 million undocumented immigrants in this country right now,"" the heckler shouted.

The San Jose Mercury News identified the heckler as Ju Hong, 24, a University of California-Berkeley graduate and immigrant without legal status from South Korea.

""We agree that we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform. But at the same time you have the power to stop deportations for all undocumented immigrants in the country,"" Hong yelled.

""Actually, I don't,"" Obama responded.

""If in fact I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But we are also a nation of laws,"" Obama continued. ""And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend I can try and do something by violating our laws. And what I am proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic process to achieve the same goal you want to achieve.""

But if that doesn't work, reform supporters are also gearing up for next year's elections, when they hope to send a message by targeting Republicans in congressional districts where demographics give Latino voters more clout.

""As much as it looks bleak for action this year, we haven't given up,"" said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that champions comprehensive immigration reform. ""If this Congress doesn't get immigration reform done, then a lot of us are going to work as hard as we can to elect a Congress in 2014 that will.""

In the meantime, reform advocates haven't completely written off this year, which started off with Obama and influential Republicans declaring their support for immigration reform.

Activists from several states have camped out at House Speaker John Boehner's Washington, D.C., office. They also have held vigils at his home and confronted him while eating at a diner.

Despite months of minimal movement on the issue, Boehner, R-Ohio, and — as recently as Sunday — House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., continue to suggest immigration reform is still alive, while being vague about a timeline for action.

But House GOP leaders are unlikely to explicitly declare immigration reform dead, recognizing the negative message such a declaration would send to Latino voters.

""Immigration reform is going to happen,"" McCarthy said Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" ""But it's going to happen in a step-by-step method. ... The immigration system, it is broken, it needs to be fixed.""

Piecemeal approach

A step-by-step approach on immigration reform is gaining momentum after House Republican leaders refused to take up the comprehensive bill passed by the Senate in June.

But the heightened partisanship that accompanies congressional midterm elections will make passing any bill more difficult as the year progresses, analysts say.

Obama announced he is willing to go along with the House GOP strategy of passing a series of ""piecemeal"" immigration bills in a specific sequence rather than the comprehensive approach preferred by the White House and the Democrats who control the Senate. Obama said the House bills must address the same components as the Senate's bipartisan comprehensive package, which includes a pathway to citizenship for most of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country in addition to addressing border security, the legal immigration backlog, new visas for foreign workers and other issues. The Senate passed its bill on June 27.

""They're suspicious of comprehensive bills, but if they want to chop that thing up into five pieces, as long as all five pieces get done, I don't care what it looks like as long as it's actually delivering on those core values that we talk about,"" Obama said at a Nov. 19 Wall Street Journal event.

Boehner dealt a blow to the morale of reform supporters when he announced House Republicans would not negotiate with the Senate on its comprehensive bill. But he has since reiterated that House Republicans are continuing to work on their own immigration bills and called Obama's comments encouraging.

Several House immigration bills have moved through committee, but so far Boehner has brought none to the floor for a vote of the full House. Other bills that would provide a path to citizenship for ""dreamers,"" the young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children, and address the legal status of the broader undocumented population have yet to surface. The House dreamer legislation, which has been tentatively dubbed ""the Kids Act,"" apparently has hit a snag over whether the dreamers would be allowed to sponsor their parents and other family members for citizenship.

Cesar Vargas, director of the Dream Action Coalition, said trying to put such restrictions on dreamers could be unconstitutional and create ""a second-class citizenry"" in the United States. But despite those concerns, he called on House Republicans to introduce the legislation anyway.

""Let's see what the Kids Act is,"" Vargas said. ""If they want to introduce this act as is, with the parental ban, well, let's introduce it. Let's debate it.""

Parallel efforts

Petra Falcon, director of Promise Arizona, an advocacy group pushing for reforms that allow undocumented immigrants to gain legal status and citizenship, said she remains hopeful that a bill will pass in the few remaining weeks of the year. But if it doesn't, her group will push lawmakers to pass immigration reform in 2014.

In 2014, the group's main focus will continue to be applying pressure on lawmakers by building an electorate that favors immigration reform. For the past several years, Promise Arizona and other immigration-reform groups have been targeting Republican-held congressional districts in Arizona by going door to door and registering Latino voters.

""In 2014, we've got to continue broadening the electoral base,"" Falcon said.

Sharry, of America's Voice, indicated efforts to lobby the Obama administration and Homeland Security Department on deportation policy would continue parallel to political efforts.

""The president says he supports the Senate bill, and yet the administration is deporting people who would qualify for legal status,"" Sharry said. ""It's arbitrary and cruel.""

But others in the immigration-reform movement don't necessarily agree administrative action would be the best route. Some worry such a move by Obama would further inflame congressional Republican opposition to a legislative solution on immigration that many say is desperately needed.

""I hope that doesn't happen because I think that would divide the nation in a bad way,"" Nevares said.

Even dreamers who have temporarily benefited under the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals initiative say congressional action is needed now.

DACA applies to undocumented immigrants between the ages of 15 to 30 who came to the U.S. as children and who are in school or have graduated from high school.

Reyna Montoya of the Arizona Dream Act Coalition noted that in Arizona, dreamers still can't get driver licenses.

""It's just been really, really challenging to see that every day, every inaction of Congress, we see the consequences in our state,"" she said during a recent conference call with reporters.

Lizeth Arias of the Dreamers of Virginia also said dreamers need something more permanent.

""We all are pressured by the time that is passing. Our deferred action is not going to last forever,"" Arias said. ""It'll be over for most of us next year, and we must renew it. And if they decide to cut the program, then we are left again where we started: as undocumented (youths) with little possibility for a brighter future."""
http://uk.news.yahoo.com/cyber-attack-threat-uk-armed-forces-warned-000334238.html,,[],Cyber Attack Threat: UK Armed Forces Warned,"The UK's armed forces are now so dependent on information and communication technology that they could be ""fatally compromised"" by sustained cyber attacks.

The Defence Select Committee has produced a report that questions the military's contingency plans and urges the Government to do more to address the threat.

""It is our view that cyber security is a sufficiently urgent, significant and complex activity to warrant increased ministerial attention,"" said committee chairman James Arbuthnot MP.

""The Government needs to put in place - as it has not yet done - mechanisms, people, education, skills, thinking and policies which take into account both the opportunities and the vulnerabilities which cyberspace presents.""

Cabinet Secretary Francis Maude is the minister responsible for cyber security, but the report recommends that more ministers should engage and take on responsibility.

""Unless we have a really vigorous approach to defending against the sort of cyber attacks that are developing at a rather quick rate day by day, minute by minute, second by second, unless we have a really vigorous approach we are at risk of our armed forces as well as the whole of the rest of the government infrastructure being compromised,"" Mr Arbuthnot told Sky News.

Dr Andrew Murrison, the Minister for International Security Strategy, has defended the Government's efforts.

He said: ""There's no complacency and we will continue in a very rapidly evolving field to make sure we do absolutely everything to reduce the chance of there being a significant attack here.""

GCHQ, the Government's communications headquarters, is considered a world leader.

Under the Strategic Defence and Security Review in 2010, £650m was allocated to a new cyber security programme.

It showed significant recognition of the threat, but in truth no budget can ever be big enough. According to the Boston Consulting Group, the UK is the best prepared country to face a cyber attack.

But countries like Israel, China and the United States are well advanced, and are bettering their systems at a quicker pace.

Story continues

Major General Jonathan Shaw, the former head of the Defence Cyber Security Programme, told Sky News that the UK competes favourably.

He said: ""The way that British government is organised and the security side is actually extremely effective at coping with threats.

""It's a very collegiate atmosphere and the ability of GCHQ to spread their knowledge across government actually gives us a real advantage over someone like the United States which has a much more stovepipe government system.""

What is not known is how offensive the UK's strategy is. The Government is clear about the threat it faces, but declines to speak about any aggressive action it takes against states regarded as hostile.

The Defence Select Committee's report should be seen as an attempt to reinvigorate the military and Government's efforts - not as an outright criticism of what has been done."

The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson.

Friedman'],Threaten to Threaten - The New York Times,"If you’re an average American and are confused and worried about us getting embroiled in a no-win Syrian civil war, you’re right to be concerned. It means you’re paying attention. But if you’re a member of Congress or a senator who’s still wondering whether to grant President Obama the authority to use force to deter Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from again murdering hundreds of his people with poison gas, it now makes sense to take a timeout. That also means you’re paying attention.

A new situation has been created in the last two days by the Russian offer — embraced by Obama, all of our major allies and China, but still only vaguely accepted by Syria — for Syria to turn over its stockpiles of poison gas to international control. Let’s have no illusion. There’s still a real possibility that the Russians and Syrians are just stalling and will fudge in the end, and even if one or both are serious, there are formidable logistical and political obstacles to securing Syria’s chemical weapons swiftly and completely. Part of me wonders: Has anybody thought this through?

But all of me wants to acknowledge that if a Syrian surrender of poison gas were implemented — still a big if — it would be a good end to this near-term crisis. The global taboo on poison gas would be upheld, and America would not have to get embroiled in a shooting war in Syria.

In that context, I think it is worth Obama and Congress threatening to schedule a vote to endorse Obama’s threat of force — if the Syrians and Russians don’t act in good faith — but not schedule a vote right now. (That was essentially the president’s message in his speech Tuesday night.) By “threatening to threaten,” Obama retains leverage to keep the Syrians and Russians focused on implementing any agreement — but without having to test Congress’s real willingness to let him fulfill that threat. Because, if it failed to pass, the Russians and Syrians would have no incentive to move."

The president has the authority to offer temporary relief from immigration removals.

He could end the controversial Secure Communities program.

He could also broaden the number of immigrants eligible for deferred action.

President Obama is closing in on a record. Sometime around the end of this year, he will have deported 2 million undocumented immigrants, more than any other president.

Enough, already. The Obama administration should put the brakes on its deportation train. The president has the authority to offer temporary relief from immigration removals. With reform stalled, the president ought to stop trying to appease Republicans by being strong on immigration enforcement. He should consider executive action.

Obama has options to allow undocumented immigrants to live without the threat of deportation. Remember, this impacts only immigrants already here. He could end the controversial Secure Communities program, which turns local law enforcement officers into immigration agents. He could let more immigrants qualify for temporary protected status, which provides them with work and residence permits. In 2010, a leaked memo from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services revealed that the agency was exploring ""meaningful immigration reform absent legislative action."" Though an agency spokesman later characterized the memo as an ""internal draft,"" the legality of such measures was not in question.

Defer action

The president's most practical route to fewer deportations would be to broaden the number of immigrants eligible for deferred action. In 2012, his administration announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, aimed at helping those brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Not only has the program allowed 455,000 young immigrants the freedom to live and work openly, it has withstood legal challenges as well. The Washington Post has noted that this program could be expanded to include other discrete classes of people, such as the parents of citizen children, victims of domestic abuse, or whistle-blowers.

Show some courage

Although Obama said last month on Telemundo that expanding the program would be ""very difficult to defend legally,"" that is not true; it would just be very difficult to defend politically. Immigration reform activists have engaged in civil disobedience nationwide. Isn't it time the president display similar courage?

""I believe this president will be tempted ... to issue an executive order,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in August, ""like he did for the DREAM Act kids a year ago, where he basically legalizes 11 million people by the sign of a pen."" The website PolitiFact judged this statement ""mostly false."" On his own, the president cannot offer citizenship, a path to citizenship, or permanent relief from deportation. He can take limited action to make our system more humane.

True, any executive action on immigration will anger conservative lawmakers. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., told USA TODAY that this ""would effectively kill immigration reform."" Yet Goodlatte and other House Republicans are already effectively killing immigration reform with their inaction. A unilateral move by the president might goad GOP lawmakers into actual legislating.

If Obama believes immigration reform still has a chance, he should not be deporting those who might be eligible for a path to citizenship. If he has given up on reform, he has every reason to move ahead with executive action. Either way, the right choice is to cut back on deportations.

He Previously Covered The Pentagon', 'The White House', 'New York City', 'The Financial Industry. He Was Raised In Minneapolis', 'Washington', 'Graduated Clark University. He Left The Times In']",Critics see contradictions in Obama administration’s Syria claims,"WASHINGTON –- The planned military strikes on Syria would be “targeted, limited” and wouldn’t seek to topple the government of President Bashar Assad or even force it to peace talks.

They would also be punishing and “consequential” and would so scare Assad that he would never use chemical weapons again.

U.S. airstrikes would change the momentum on the battlefield of the Syrian civil war. But the war will grind on, unchanged, perhaps for years.

As administration officials lay out their case in favor of a punitive attack on Syria, they have been making all of these seemingly contradictory contentions, confusing supporters and providing rhetorical weapons to their opponents.

The contradictions stem from the basic challenge the White House faces: how to reassure the large anti-war contingent in the Democratic Party, as well as conservative opponents of overseas intervention, that strikes won’t open the way to another war, while convincing hawks and more militant internationalists that the strikes will do enough to make the mission worthwhile.

It’s possible to square most of the administration’s arguments – if one believes that a military strike can be so precisely calibrated as to harm the Assad government just enough, but not too much. But as a political case, the effort has so far proven hard to sell.

If officials lean too far in one direction, they risk losing supporters on one side or the other. But when they voice both sides of their case, they risk presenting an argument that is incoherent.

Former House Speaker New Gingrich said on “Meet the Press” that Obama was promising to punch Assad a little bit, but not too much, and such a goal was too nebulous to sell to the public.

When the administration is talking to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a leader of the hawks, “the emphasis is on degrade. When talking to Democrats, the emphasis is on limited,” said Michael Doran, a White House official in the Bush administration and a supporter of strikes.

“And it leave us with a big question: What is our overall strategy on Syria, and how does this fit into it?” asked Doran, now with the Brookings Institution.

The sometimes-tortured quality of the argument was apparent over the weekend as some officials claimed that the strikes would shift the momentum of the Syrian war, and others said it would largely be unchanged.

Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, said on “Meet the Press” that “there is no doubt that momentum on the battlefield will be changed by a targeted, limited effort.”

But the day before, a senior administration official briefing reporters on Secretary of State John Kerry’s airplane predicted the war will “grind on” after the strikes.

“I think it will grind on without the use of chemical weapons, but I think it will grind on,” said the official, who the State Department insisted must remain unidentified because of the sensitivity of the subject.

At the same time, the official said other U.S. efforts to help the rebels – presumably U.S. overt and covert training, military supplies and medical help – did have the objective of changing the “balance on the ground.”

“This is an objective the administration has long supported,” the official said.

As administration officials make their arguments, different members of the audience are taking away different points.

McCain came away from a private meeting with Obama on Tuesday convinced that the president had shifted his goals and now intended to do more to “degrade” the Syrian military machine. He offered an amendment to a proposed Senate resolution authorizing a strike to say that the strike’s objective was to “change the momentum on the battlefield.”

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee accepted the language. But that change alarmed Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who warned it could drive away House lawmakers.

It is difficult for the administration to argue that the strikes would help topple Assad because officials have been arguing for some time – and Obama repeated Friday -- that only a massive military intervention could force an end to the 2 ½-year-old civil war.

The White House wants to stay clear from suggestions that it is seeking “regime change” with the strikes, because that phrase, associated with the Bush administration, will alarm foreign allies as well as many Americans.

Officials have insisted all along that there is no military solution to the civil war and that eventually, the Assad government and the disparate rebel forces will have to reach a negotiated settlement.

At the same time, the administration wants to deflect accusations that it is preparing to launch only “pinprick” strikes with a symbolic value.

The Clinton administration was battered by accusations in 1998 that it had turned to strategically meaningless cruise missile strikes against Saddam Hussein and against Osama bin Laden’s Afghan training camps, which were largely empty when they were hit.

One more complication for the White House arguments is that the mission appears to be becoming more ambitious as time passes.

U.S. military officials say the military is expanding the target list, and may use aircraft, as well as unmanned missiles, over what could be a three-day period. ABC News reported that an unidentified U.S. official was boasting that the strikes could do more damage in 48 hours than the rebels have done in the entire civil war.

The senior administration official speaking on Kerry’s plane insisted the addition of new targets did not represent “mission creep” because the objective was the same even if the Pentagon has decided to use more force.

“I define ‘mission creep’ as shifting the objective, not the means,” the official said.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/07/03/Egypt-Kerry-yacht,2013-07-03 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],'Deeply Concerned' Obama Searches for Egypt Strategy,"As the Egyptian military effectively declared a coup, overthrowing the elected government of repressive Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed Morsi, the Obama administration struggled to come up with a coherent strategy to deal with the situation.

President Obama released a statement on Morsi’s ouster, suggesting that his administration “does not support particular individuals or political parties, but we are committed to the democratic process and respect for the law.” With those principles in mind, Obama declared himself “deeply concerned” and called for a transition to civilian rule. He refused to state whether the United States would withdraw aid to Egypt, saying only that he had directed a comprehensive review process.

Simultaneously, the State Department, which issued a mandatory evacuation order to non-essential personnel on Wednesday, said it would not take sides in the Egyptian situation. “We haven’t taken sides and don’t plan to take sides here,” said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.

In an embarrassing signifier of the level of chaos plaguing the administration, Secretary of State John Kerry called into the top level meetings from a secure phone. According to CBS producer Mosheh Oinounou, Kerry was on the “Isabel” on Wednesday afternoon. Oinounou said that when another CBS producer yelled “Morsi!” to Kerry, she received no response. Oinounou tweeted this photo:

Later, Oinounou reported that the State Department denies his claim that CBS reporters saw Kerry aboard his yacht; the State Department maintains that Kerry has been working on Egypt “all day.”

Whether Kerry was working all day or not on the strategy, it’s clear that confusion reigns at the highest levels. President Obama in Cairo in 2009 decried the “overthrow of a democratically-elected Iranian government” in the 1950s; when Honduras’ military ousted a would-be dictator, the Obama administration originally kicked back before caving. Now, it seems that the administration can’t label the military coup a military coup, and won’t label it a democratic movement.

President Obama isn’t even leading from behind at this point, simply because he can’t tell which direction is behind.

NOTE: This post has been edited to reflect the State Department’s denial of the original CBS report regarding Kerry’s presence on his yacht.

But Obama hedged on the much-discussed possibility of a U.S. military presence after that benchmark date.

The training of Afghan forces and the battleground successes against Islamist insurgents have gone well enough to meet NATO-set withdrawal goals and “accelerate them somewhat,” Obama said at a joint press conference with Karzai.

“Make no mistake: Our path is clear and we are moving forward,” Obama said. “Next year, this long war will come to a responsible end.”

The American president, who campaigned on his plan to end America’s involvement in what is now the country’s longest war, said he would collect advice from the Pentagon and military commanders on the ground “in the coming weeks” on how quickly U.S. forces can come home without risking hard-earned security gains. He would then announce the next phase of the pullout “in the coming months.”

Obama hedged on one of the most serious points of contention between the uneasy allies: The prospects of leaving a residual force beyond 2014 that would train Afghan troops and conduct counterterrorism operations. He declined to discuss the possible size of such a deployment and pointedly left open the possibility that America might leave entirely if the Afghan government does not agree to give U.S. troops immunity from prosecution.

“From my perspective at least, it will not be possible for us to have any kind of U.S. troops presence post-2014” without such an arrangement, Obama said.

Karzai, who had previously been wary of supporting immunity, said the talks at the White House had removed lingering obstacles regarding the custody of detainees and the nature of NATO-led operations.

“I can go to the Afghan people and argue for immunity for U.S. troops in Afghanistan in a way that Afghan sovereignty will not be compromised, in a way that Afghan law will not be compromised,” he said. As to how many forces should stay, Karzai added, “That’s not for us [Afghans] to decide.""

Story continues

There are about 66,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Afghan forces lead about 80 percent of security operations.

Was the war, which is now deeply unpopular with the U.S. public, worth fighting?

“It was absolutely the right thing,” said Obama, to invade Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist strikes to hunt down Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida and to ensure Afghanistan could not be used as a base to strike America again.

“We achieved our central goal—or have come very close to achieving our central goal—which is to decapitate al-Qaida, to dismantle it, to make sure that they can’t attack us again,” he said.

“At the end of this conflict, we are going to be able to say that the sacrifices that were made by those men and women in uniform has brought about the goal that we sought,"" the president added.

Obama had been asked whether the war was worth the hundreds of billions of dollars and thousands of U.S., NATO and Afghan deaths since the October 2001 invasion, especially given the now-abandoned dreams of fostering a vibrant democracy.

“Have we achieved everything that some might have imagined us achieving in the best of scenarios? Probably not. This is a human enterprise and, you know, you fall short of the ideal,” Obama acknowledged. “Did we achieve our central goal, and have we been able, I think, to shape a strong relationship with a responsible Afghan government that is willing to cooperate with us to make sure that it is not a launching pad for future attacks against the United States?

“We have achieved that goal; we are in the process of achieving that goal,” he said.

Obama also gave his strongest show of support yet for Afghan-led reconciliation talks including the Taliban Islamist militia, giving his approval to the establishment of a Taliban office in Doha, Qatar, for the purposes of the negotiations.

When Obama campaigned for re-election on a promise to end the war, he vowed that ""the war in Afghanistan is ending"" at one of his final rallies.

""We are leaving. We are leaving in 2014, period,” Vice President Joe Biden said in his debate with Republican rival Paul Ryan.

Except … maybe not. The Obama administration has been negotiating with Karzai on a possible residual fighting force—a notion that’s always been part of the White House’s strategy, just not necessarily one that it has highlighted. When Obama traveled to Afghanistan in May 2012, a senior administration official told reporters that any fighting force left there after 2014 would focus on “very specific, narrow missions” like counterterrorism and training Afghan troops.

Before Friday’s talks, both sides seemed to be in a negotiating posture. Senior Obama national security aide Ben Rhodes got headlines this week by saying that Americans might leave entirely (White House press secretary Jay Carney said roughly the same thing in late November).

Karzai took a tough line on the issue in an early December interview with NBC News, saying he had written to Obama to say NATO-led forces would have to leave entirely unless the U.S. turns over hundreds of detainees held at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and a nearby facility.

Obama aides have long trumpeted the pullout from Iraq as a major foreign policy victory. But that came about in part because of the collapse of negotiations over maintaining an American presence there. The Iraqi government refused to give U.S. forces immunity from prosecution—a deal breaker for Washington. Just weeks ago, Karzai was noncommittal.

""We can consider that question. I can go to the Afghan people and argue for it,"" Karzai told NBC. ""But before I do that, the United States of America must make absolutely sure that they respect Afghanistan's sovereignty, that they respect Afghanistan's laws, that no Afghan is hurt or his or her rights violated by U.S. soldiers."""

UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health.

Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/opinion/abandoned-in-indian-country.html,2013-07-24 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],Abandoned in Indian Country - The New York Times,"It’s an old American story: malign policies hatched in Washington leading to pain and death in Indian country. It was true in the 19th century. It is true now, at a time when Congress, heedless of its solemn treaty obligations to Indian tribes, is allowing the across-the-board budget cuts known as the sequester to threaten the health, safety and education of Indians across the nation.

Many Republicans have lately taken to dismissing the sequester as a mild headache for a country that needs to tighten its belt. They are willfully averting their eyes from Indian reservations, where the cuts are real, specific, broad and brutal. The victims are among the poorest, sickest and most isolated Americans.

The sequester in a nutshell? “More people sick; fewer people educated; fewer people getting general assistance; more domestic violence; more alcoholism,” Richard Zephier, executive director of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, recently told Annie Lowrey of The Times.

The damage is being done to agencies and programs whose budgets rely nearly entirely on federal sources, now being slashed. In signing treaties with Indian nations in return for land, the federal government promised a wide array of life-sustaining services. One of the most important is the Indian Health Service, which serves about two million people on reservations and is grossly underfinanced even in good times. It routinely runs out of money halfway through the year. Though Medicare, Medicaid and veterans’ health were exempted from sequestration cuts, the Indian Health Service was not. It stands to lose about $228 million in 2013 from automatic sequester cuts alone, out of a $4 billion budget. That will mean 3,000 fewer inpatient admissions and 800,000 fewer outpatient visits every year."

Editor’s note: David Andrew Weinberg is a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The views expressed are the writer’s own.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been working overtime arming rebel groups in Syria. But events of the last month suggest these American allies have been throwing their lots in with radical, hardline Islamists.

Some observers are bullishly optimistic about the foreign policies of America’s Gulf allies, suggesting Saudi Arabia backs “the least Islamist component of the rebellion” and Qatar’s young new emir is displaying a more “mature” foreign policy that seeks to avoid controversy in places like Syria. However, there is worrying news coming from Syria’s Raqqa Province, now controlled by the al Qaeda affiliate Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Hateful books described by several different sources as the area’s new academic curriculum, reportedly originate from Saudi Arabia.

Ali al-Ahmed, who directs the Institute for Gulf Affairs in Washington, has conducted previous reviews of official Saudi textbooks. He told me that although the seal from Saudi Arabia’s education ministry has been removed from the books, they otherwise appear identical to the ones he has reviewed. Al-Ahmed said that the two collections being brandished in Raqqa are “toxic,” promoting extremism and the dehumanization of non-Muslims.

But this isn’t the only development that appears to shed light on Saudi and Qatari objectives in Syria.

ISIL has gone on the offensive against certain Syrian rebel groups that are frequently linked to Qatar’s largesse, including Ahfad al-Rasoul and the Farouq Brigades. However, another recipient of Qatar’s support – arguably the strongest militia around Syria’s largest city, Aleppo – appears to prefer to negotiate with ISIL instead of helping other rebels fight it

Perhaps more worrying is what this Qatari-backed group did next. On September 24, one of its leaders in Aleppo issued a declaration with a handful of other militias that called for an Islamic state and rejected the Western-backed Syrian opposition coalition. Its number one signatory was the Nusra Front, al Qaeda’s other main affiliate in Syria. Roughly half the groups that joined in this announcement were Islamist brigades that have reportedly received backing from either Saudi Arabia or Qatar.

A week later, the head of another Islamist group announced the merger of dozens of rebel organizations around Damascus into a massive “Army of Islam.” Both diplomats and rebel fighters indicated that this merger occurred at the conscious direction of Riyadh. The organization’s leader, Zahran Alloush, studied in Saudi Arabia, where his father is a Salafist cleric.

The merger in Damascus contradicts claims that the Kingdom supports only “quietist” Salafis who reject political Islam, since Alloush’s brigade calls for an Islamic state and flies the black jihadist flag instead of a Syrian one. He has insisted this Damascus merger will not push back against ISIL and has openly advocated ethnic cleansing.

Saudi Arabia has suffered blowback for supporting jihadist groups before, most notably when al Qaeda went on a rampage in the Kingdom a decade ago. However, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have other incentives that push them toward promoting Syrian jihadists or at least turning a blind eye.

Riyadh has long promoted the strident, Salafist ideology of Wahhabi Islam at home and abroad (indeed, the textbooks in question are tagged “distributed free of charge”). Since the Arab Spring, Saudi Arabia has aggressively fanned sectarian hatreds to keep its own disaffected Sunnis and Shiites from joining forces to demand greater rights.

Qatar, noted for its “hyperactive” foreign policy, is so eager to acquire clients in the region that it has shown little concern for these groups’ intensely Islamist principles. Qatar reportedly tried to give the Muslim Brotherhood a stranglehold over Syria’s political opposition and was chastised by the U.S. for letting advanced weapons reach the Nusra Front.

Under pressure this past May, Qatar let Saudi Arabia take charge of the opposition cause in Syria. However, now that Saudi Arabia finds itself in a position of leadership over the rebellion, it also has incentives to encourage a broad military coalition against the al-Assad regime. Evidently, the Saudis have been giving in to that temptation, building a very large but also very jihadist tent among the rebels.

But at what cost? Before the war, Salafists in Syria were not indigenously grounded. Since then, they have opportunistically used this conflict to expand their influence, tapping into material support and sectarian rhetoric from the Gulf.

Some outside observers believe hardliners like Alloush are now the only game in town amongst Syria’s armed opposition. However, the continued expansion of such hardline rebel groups means that enticing Western support for the opposition is going to get much tougher as time goes on.

Yet these developments may be a sign that Saudi Arabia and the rebels are writing off the chances of U.S. military intervention altogether. Washington’s recent decision not to launch missile strikes on Syria infuriated the Saudis, and our exclusive focus on chemical weapons has given the Assad regime a new lease on life.

America’s Gulf allies want al-Assad out, and they want it now. Combined with Qatar and Saudi Arabia’s natural ideological predispositions, this intense desire to win Syria’s civil war seems to be overpowering any possible instincts for caution from the Gulf. Riyadh and Doha are feeding an unruly jihadist problem in Syria that will no doubt create all kinds of headaches for America and the region down the line."

The amnesty bill, proposed by Mr. Thaksin’s party, easily passed one house of the bicameral Parliament on Friday.

Mr. Thaksin, a billionaire tycoon, was ousted by the military in a September 2006 coup and later sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for abuse of power. He has lived abroad in self-imposed exile since 2008. His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is now prime minister, and the proposed law offers a broad amnesty for actions and people related to the coup and its aftermath.

If passed, the law might also restore to Mr. Thaksin part of his fortune that a court seized in 2010 on the ground that the money had been illegally obtained through his political influence."

(CNN) —

Anti-Semitism, arguably the most enduring and murderous ethnic prejudice in human history, has always adapted to the prevailing social, political and technological conditions.

In our global age of international flows and world politics and communication, anti-Semitism has become global, and it is in no small measure due to digital technologies: the Internet and satellite television. Anti-Semitism now reaches vast parts of the world where there are no Jews. And the people who rely most on the Internet, the young, are the most innocent and susceptible to believing the prejudices they come across.

Digital technology has become a game changer for anti-Semitism, and for prejudices and hatreds in general, including against African-Americans.

Never before has prejudice toward Jews been so widely present around the world in places where the hated people are present and especially where they don’t even live, as a Pew Global Attitudes Survey of 24 countries reveals. Jews form .2% of the world’s population, with the vast majority in just two countries, Israel and the United States. Yet in Europe, where Germans and many other Europeans slaughtered 6 million Jews in the Holocaust, a shocking amount of anti-Semitism still exists.

Across the Arab world there is almost uniformly poisonous anti-Semitism, including instances of Arab leaders, imams, and ordinary people saying that Jews are the children of apes and pigs. More amazing is that in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia, anti-Semitism is widespread. Fifty percent of Brazilians, 43% of Nigerians, and 55% of Chinese surveyed by Pew said they had an unfavorable opinion of Jews, even though in Brazil Jews form .05% of the population, and in the other countries there are barely any Jews at all. Even in the United States, where anti-Semitism is lowest among major countries, according to the Anti-Defamation League’s index of anti-Semitism, “15 percent of Americans fall in the most anti-Semitic cohort.”

Digital technology has critically contributed to the explosion of anti-Semitism in five ways:

While before a person had to be personally exposed, through people or perhaps a book, to vile characterizations of Jews, today anti-Semitism is prominently available everywhere anytime – to those seeking it out or to the innocent person just looking for information. Typing “Jew” into Google or Bing returns a top site (sometimes No. 2) called JewWatch, which is a vast emporium of anti-Semitic accusations and hatred claiming 1.5 billion pages in support of its mission to defame and eliminate Jews and their supposed power. This is but one of tens of thousands of anti-Semitic hate sites, which include a growing alternative to Wikipedia, called Metapedia, which seeks to create (currently in 18 languages) an anti-Semitic informational universe.

Second, while before new anti-Semitic accusations and initiatives traveled slowly if at all, today they can spread like wildfire over entire regions or the world, picked up by news or community websites coursing through the Internet and beamed to viewers on national, regional, or international television networks. This can be true of blood libels such as that Jews harvest Palestinian organs, of alleged plots to conquer and colonize Patagonia, or–more routinely–false accusations of Israeli atrocities. It is true of the frequent speeches by political and religious leaders urging the annihilation of Jews.

Third, you now have for the first time international and virtual communities of anti-Semitic hatred. Through digital technology, anti-Semites find validation from and communion with anti-Semites elsewhere in their own countries and around the world. Everything we know about prejudice shows that when it is shared in communities, and especially when political or religious leaders openly express hatred of a group, such bigotry is powerfully sustained and spread.

Fourth, the Internet and digital technology has integrated different streams of anti-Semitism into a global anti-Semitic amalgam. Muslim anti-Semites adopt anti-Semitic Christian motifs (to win Christians to their cause), regularly depicting in speeches and political cartoons the Palestinians as the modern crucified Christ! Leftist anti-Semites, neo-Nazi anti-Semites, old fashioned Christian anti-Semites, and, of course Arab and Islamic anti-Semites share common cause in their demonization of Israel.

Fifth, digital technology has also lifted all anti-Semitic restraints. With the anonymity of the Internet, and with the total lack of anti-Semitic inhibition coming from the Arab and Islamic worlds – its commonplace demonizing and dehumanization characterizations of Jews and calls for the extermination of Jews around the world – what anti-Semites say and see as thinkable action goes well beyond, in ferocity and murderousness, even Nazi Germany’s profoundly anti-Semitic discourse. Not just the Jews of Israel but Jews everywhere are endangered.

Digital technology has transformed anti-Semitism into an essential part of the substructure of prejudice around the entire world. To become inundated with it, all you have to do is, innocently or not, enter the word “Jew” into your browser, and then start clicking.

But this surge in anti-Semitism also shows the way to combating it, by using legal means and political pressure to get Internet providers, social media sites and search engines to adhere to their own terms of usage, and to the laws of democratic countries – especially forceful in Europe – which prohibit hate speech.

U.S. President Barack Obama pledged $7 billion Sunday to help combat frequent power blackouts in sub-Saharan Africa.

Funds from the initiative, dubbed Power Africa, will be distributed over the next five years. Obama made the announcement during his trip to South Africa , the continent's biggest economy.

""Access to electricity is fundamental to opportunity in this age. It's the light that children study by, the energy that allows an idea to be transformed into a real business. It's the lifeline for families to meet their most basic needs, and it's the connection that's needed to plug Africa into the grid of the global economy,"" he said.

Two-thirds of the population of sub-Saharan Africa lacks access to electricity, including more than 85% of those living in rural areas, the White House said.

""A light where currently there is darkness -- the energy to lift people out of poverty -- that's what opportunity looks like,"" Obama told students at Cape Town University. ""So this is America's vision: a partnership with Africa for growth, and the potential for every citizen, not just a few at the top.""

The program includes $1.5 billion from the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation and $5 billion from the Export-Import Bank, the White House said. Sub-Saharan Africa will need more than $300 billion to achieve universal electricity access by 2030, it said.

The preliminary setup will include Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique.

""These countries have set ambitious goals in electric power generation, and are making the utility and energy sector reforms to pave the way for investment and growth,"" a White House statement said.

Obama's three-nation African trip started in Senegal and will end in Tanzania this week. The visit aims to bolster U.S. investment opportunities, address development issues such as food security and health, and promote democracy.

It comes as China aggressively engages the continent, pouring billions of dollars into it and replacing the United States as Africa's largest trading partner.

Obama applauded China's investment in Africa, saying he is ""not threatened by it.""

Africa's greater integration into the global economy will benefit everyone with the potential creation of new jobs and opportunities, he said.

""I'm here because I think the United States needs to engage with a continent full of promise and possibility,"" Obama said. ""It's good for the United States. I welcome the attention that Africa is receiving from China, Brazil, India and Turkey.""

However, he urged African officials to ensure that those who invest in the continent and its natural resources benefit Africans in terms of jobs and other assets.

Obama also visited Robben Island , where anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela spent a majority of his 27-year imprisonment, on Sunday. And he spoke at Cape Town University, the site of a famous speech by Robert F. Kennedy at the height of apartheid in 1966.

Obama heads next to Tanzania, where he is scheduled to attend events until Tuesday."
http://news.yahoo.com/central-america-struggles-unite-obama-trip-180853537.html,,[],Central America struggles to unite for Obama trip,"SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) — President Barack Obama on Friday addressed a Central American region that continues to be plagued by violence, drug trafficking, corruption and poverty, despite the success of a seven-year trade agreement with the United States.

Central America's problems have directly impacted the U.S., as thousands from the region migrate north each year along increasingly deadly smuggling routes.

In a press conference late Friday with Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla, Obama said only a comprehensive approach will work to solve the region's problems, including stronger economies, better institutions, education and youth centers that give young people a sense of opportunity.

""Problems like narco-trafficking arise when a country is vulnerable because of poverty and institutions not working for people,"" he said. ""The stronger the economy and institutions for individuals seeking legitimate careers, the less powerful these narco-trafficking operations are going to be.""

Obama went on to a closed meeting with the eight-nation Central American Integration System, known by its Spanish initials SICA, which was formed to discuss regional issues.

He said he looked forward to the regional cooperation. But national rivalries that have often blocked cooperation.

Guatemala and Belize maintain a border dispute. Honduras and El Salvador are fighting over the use of the waters and shores of the Gulf of Fonseca, and a conflict between Nicaragua and Costa Rica has been escalating over the San Juan River border. On top of that, Panama, Costa Rica and Nicaragua often feel excluded because Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras get the bulk of U.S. security aid, said Eric Olson, associate director of the Latin American program at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington.

""SICA has tried to build itself as the place where all these countries can come together and that can be the distribution point for that aid,"" Olson said. ""But I think the rivalry between these governments gets in the way.""

Story continues

Still, the Central American presidents have come manned to talk about security, an issue they see as directly related to drug consumption in the United States. Some Central American countries have the highest murder rates in the world, with Honduras often called the world's most dangerous country. Leaders here say they want the U.S. to take more responsibility in the fight against drug cartels.

""We need the decided support of the U.S. to attack our common enemy, drug trafficking,"" Honduran President Porfirio Lobo said Thursday. ""Unfortunately, Honduras and the countries of the region bear the dead of a war that we didn't start and that we repudiate. It's time to renew our mutual political cooperation.""

The White House doesn't plan to launch any new initiatives with this trip, said Ricardo Zuniga, the lead official for Latin America policy on the U.S. National Security Council. Rather, it wants to talk about better coordination and use of the aid that is already going to the region.

""Besides the United States expressing its deep worry over the deterioration of the region, there isn't much more to expect,"" said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin American program at the Wilson Center.

Since 2008, the United States has allocated $496 million in security cooperation to Central America, Zuniga said, and that number isn't expected to increase substantially.

The White House asked for $162 million for the fight against drug trafficking in its 2014 budget through the Central America Regional Security Initiative. That's $26 million more than what was allocated in 2012.

By comparison, Washington has allocated $1.9 billion to Mexico since 2008 for the fight against drug trafficking through the Merida Initiative.

Even on security issues, the countries have difficulty uniting.

""There is no effective cooperation because there is no trust,"" said Ignacio de Lucas, coordinator of the Network of Prosecutors against Organized Crime, an initiative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime that brings together 10 prosecutors from Mexico to Colombia. ""Sometimes big projects arise, for example creating a database to cooperate with Interpol, but what information will go there? Without trust there will not be useful information.""

The more relevant forum to discuss drug trafficking in the region will be the June general assembly of the Organization of American States, said Guatemalan Foreign Minister Luis Carrera Castro.

Aside from security concerns, Central American presidents also have agreed to prioritize economic issues in their meeting with Obama.

The SICA member governments, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Belize, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and the Dominican Republic, want to enhance the trade agreement they've had since 2006 with the United States, said Muni Figueres, Costa Rican Ambassador to the U.S.

Under the CAFTA-DR agreement, U.S. exports to the region have risen to $30 billion in 2012, up 25 percent from 2010 and 80 percent from 2005, according to her embassy's figures.

One of the specific goals for the Obama meeting is a commitment from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to actively participate in a commission tracking the performance of the trade agreement, Figueres said.

""The challenge now is how to facilitate trade to flow better and how to translate the agreement into more jobs and investment,"" she added."

Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was the latest to get involved, firing off a letter to the American Studies Association on Monday.

Engel called it ""another example of the unfair double standard Israel is regularly and unfairly subjected to by organizations such as yours.""

The 5,000-member academic group announced the boycott of Israeli academic institutions earlier this month, in protest of Israel's treatment of Palestinians.

The move immediately drew objections from Jewish advocacy groups. But top American universities, including Harvard and Yale, have also pushed back.

Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust called it a ""direct threat"" to the ideals universities defend.

""Academic boycotts subvert the academic freedoms and values necessary to the free flow of ideas, which is the lifeblood of the worldwide community of scholars,"" Faust said in a statement. Other universities withdrew their ACA membership.

U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro applauded those universities, and stated Sunday on his Facebook page that the U.S. government ""rejects"" the boycott push.

Engel added his voice in the letter to ASA President Curtis Marez. He noted this is the first time the association has boycotted a country and questioned -- why Israel?

He noted the group ""has chosen to stay silent on China's suppression of independent academic voices critical of the Communist Party, the Venezuelan government's retaliation against opposition-oriented universities, [and] Zimbabwe's denial of foreign academics from countries critical of Robert Mugabe's dictatorial government from assuming academic residencies at the University of Zimbabwe.""

And he questioned whether such venerable Israeli institutions as the Walter Lebach Institute for Jewish-Arab Coexistence Through Education at the Tel Aviv University really ""contribute to the purported Israeli assault on human rights and academic freedoms.""

It's unclear what practical impact the boycott will have. A lengthy explanation from the ACA said Israeli scholars would still be permitted to lecture at member campuses, and ACA members could in many circumstances continue to work with Israeli scholars. The boycott was aimed more at cutting ties between the ASA ""as an association"" and Israeli institutions.

But the association has defended the decision, arguing that Israeli institutions are ""complicit"" in a ""multi-tiered system of oppression"" against the Palestinians. The group noted that all major Israeli universities are governmental organizations, and claimed ""many are directly involved in furnishing the ideological justification and technical means"" for Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory.

The Washington Post's editorial board called the approach ""terrible misguided."" A recent editorial questioned why the group focused its criticism exclusively on Israel.

""Did they give any thought to what's happened lately to freedom in Russia, won at enormous cost in a Cold War that lasted more than four decades?"" the board wrote. ""Have the scholars overlooked the cries for help from Cuban dissidents bravely standing up to the Castro brothers, demanding freedoms -- and suffering beatings and arrest almost every week? Do they condone the decision of a judge in Saudi Arabia who has just sentenced a political activist to 300 lashes and four years in prison for calling for a constitutional monarchy?""

The ACA boycott is part of a broader international campaign against Israeli institutions. It has divided American colleges and universities.

A fraction of the ACA's members ended up voting on the resolution which formalized the boycott, following a similar stance by the Association for Asian American Studies. But the American Association of University Professors took the opposite stance, saying it rejects academic boycotts ""as a matter of principle."""

American worker Warren Weinstein was kidnapped in Pakistan by al-Qaeda more than two years ago

Weinstein appealed to President Obama in a video released Thursday to negotiate his release

The video of Warren Weinstein was the first since two videos released in September 2012

ISLAMABAD (AP) — A 72-year-old American development worker who was kidnapped in Pakistan by al-Qaeda more than two years ago appealed to President Obama in a video released Thursday to negotiate his release, saying he feels ""totally abandoned and forgotten.""

The video of Warren Weinstein was the first since two videos released in September 2012. Weinstein, the country director in Pakistan for J.E. Austin Associates, a U.S.-based firm that advises a range of Pakistani business and government sectors, was abducted from his house in the eastern city of Lahore in August 2011.

In the video sent Thursday to reporters in Pakistan including The Associated Press, Weinstein called on the U.S. government to negotiate his release.

""Nine years ago I came to Pakistan to help my government, and I did so at a time when most Americans would not come here, and now when I need my government it seems that I have been totally abandoned and forgotten,"" Weinstein said during the 13-minute video. ""And so I again appeal to you to instruct your appropriate officials to negotiate my release.""

The video and an accompanying letter purported to be from Weinstein was emailed anonymously to reporters in Pakistan. The video was labelled ""As-Sahab,"" which is al-Qaeda's media wing, but its authenticity could not be independently verified. The letter was dated Oct. 3, 2013 and in the video Weinstein said he had been in captivity for two years.

In the video, Weinstein wore a grey track suit jacket and what appeared to be a black knit hat on his head. His face was partially covered with a beard.

Al-Qaeda has said Weinstein would be released if the U.S. halted airstrikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen and also demanded the release of all al-Qaeda and Taliban suspects around the world.

The White House has called for Weinstein's immediate release but has said it won't negotiate with al-Qaeda.

The videos last year showed Weinstein appealing for help from the Jewish community and Israel's prime minister."

Editor's note: The following commentary originally appeared on RedState.com.

As bankrupt as elected Republican leadership is in Washington vis-à-vis domestic policy, they are completely clueless as it relates to foreign policy.

While America continues to become an economic and moral wasteland under this regime, Obama is attempting to spend American treasure helping one nefarious side of an Islamic civil war in Syria – one which involves Iran-allied supporters of Hezbollah (Assad regime) vs. predominantly Al Qaeda affiliated rebels.

Astoundingly, most GOP leaders are either siding with Obama or are totally insouciant to this reckless fomenting of an Islamic insurrection. Instead of fighting ObamaCare, they are allowing Obama to distract from the upheaval at home by focusing on this inane escapade in Syria.

Most media figures discuss the current foreign policy debate in broad platitudes pitting so-called neo-conservatives vs. libertarians, hawks vs. doves, or interventionists vs. isolationists. But these labels are non-sequiturs to the reality of the current debate.

More On This... Kerry, Hagel to make case for Syria strike

Most mainstream conservatives are not Ron Paul libertarians who don’t support any war on terror. Quite the contrary, we support a robust intervention to repel Islamic terrorism when it threatens our interests. But in the case of Libya, Syria, and Egypt, we are actually intervening on behalf of our enemies.

Granted, Syria is more complicated than the other two examples. Bashar Assad is a sworn enemy of the United States, the closest ally of Iran, and a prolific exporter of terror.

In a perfect world, it would be great to overthrow him and stick it to Iran (and their Russian allies). But the reality is that the strongest elements of the insurgency are saturated with Al Qaeda affiliated extremists, backed by Pan-Islamist Turkish President Recep Erdogen, much like the insurgencies in other countries.

Why place American money and weapons in the hands of people who will be just as adversarial to our interests as the current regime? This is not a matter of opposing intervention for the sake of isolationism; it is a matter of not supporting intervention that is either superfluous or deleterious to our national interests.

A “hawkish” stance towards Assad is a dovish stance towards Al Qaeda. As Sarah Palin noted, in a battle with Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah on one side and Al-Qaeda and Turkey on the other, let Allah sort it out.

This should be a slam dunk opportunity for GOP leaders to oppose a wrongheaded and unpopular intervention, while shifting the focus back to the ObamaCare civil war at home.

Yet, House leaders are either ambivalent or downright supportive of Obama’s planned strike on behalf of Al Qaeda.

In the Senate, Mitch McConnell put out his signature mealy-mouthed parsing of words, declining to take a stand on any contentious issue:

“Today the President advised me that he will seek an authorization for the use of force from the Congress prior to initiating any combat operations against Syria in response to the use of chemical weapons. The President’s role as commander-in-chief is always strengthened when he enjoys the expressed support of the Congress.”

So much for the clout and power of being “GOP Leader:”

Our only interest in Syria is ensuring that as many Islamists on both sides are killed and keep each other busy so they can’t affect our national interests or threaten Israel.

As long as the war is contained to Syria, a stalemate is the best outcome for our purposes so that neither Russia, Iran, Al Qaeda or other Islamists claim an outright victory.

Sadly, in a world of seven billion, there are innocent people killed on a daily basis due to civil wars. But we lack the resources or strategic plan to help those people in Syria without gratuitously tipping the scales to one of our arch enemies.

Some conservatives are concerned about evincing an image of weakness to our enemies by not following through with the ‘red line’ threat. Undoubtedly, they are correct about Obama’s self-contradictory policy in a wrongheaded intervention. But it is still a wrongheaded intervention, and the fact that he made the threat to begin with should not engender a need to fix that bad policy with another bad policy decision.

When Congress returns from the August recess, Republicans should vote with a unified voice against this ridiculous escapade, and summarily reconvene the fight against ObamaCare.

Our freedom and way of life should take priority over bailing out a beleaguered group of Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda fighters. It’s time Republicans realize that."

Goodman On Twitter', 'Www.Twitter.Com Petersgoodman', 'Executive Business', 'Global News Editor', 'The Huffington Post']",American-Led Strike in Syria Risks Return to Reckless Cowboy Era,"Only a cynic could absorb the sight of children wrapped in body bags outside Damascus following the apparent chemical weapons attack and not feel a primal urge to see those who unleashed such evil punished.

Only an innocent could contemplate a world in which a brutal dictator can deploy such weapons without consequence and feel secure.

Yet only someone who has willfully dismissed the tragic lessons of the last dozen years could countenance the Obama administration unleashing its own lethal weapons against Syria absent the authority of the United Nations Security Council and without the active participation of a multi-national coalition. (And, no, France and Australia do not constitute enough.)

Only those who have forgotten how the United States and its allies wound up in a catastrophic war in Iraq could now charge toward military confrontation with Syria, absent a clear and credible annunciation of the intelligence that supposedly ties Bashar Assad's government to the chemical weapons attack, and without an agreed upon plan for how to handle the potential repercussions.

Yes, the Syria conflict of today and the Iraqi misadventure undertaken a decade ago present two different circumstances, as many experts have already emphasized. Iraq was in no way related to the incident that -- at least publicly -- provoked the American-led war, the attacks of Sept. 11 delivered by Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda partners-in-terrorism. In Syria, Assad has for years been meting out horrific brutality on those who oppose him, with visibly lethal consequences. The crime for which he now stands accused fits a pattern.

Where the case for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was manufactured from the beginning, the likelihood that Assad's government really was responsible for the chemical weapons attack in a Damascus suburb appears far more plausible.

And where the government of George W. Bush was palpably intent on waging a broad and transformational military campaign against longtime enemies in the wake of Sept. 11, President Barack Obama could not be more reluctant to take on the battle before him. He made his name as the man who opposed the Iraq war from inception. He has finally charted a course out of the companion disaster in Afghanistan.

But in one crucial regard, the rush to strike Syria is indeed reminiscent of the ill-fated march into Iraq: It would undermine the very thing it is premised on defending -- international norms and a supposed code of decency.

Put aside the bloviating about spreading freedom and democracy that accompanied the plunge into Iraq and go back to the narrative that sold the campaign -- the bogus intelligence that then-Secretary of State Colin Powell shared with the U.N. in seeking its blessing for the war: Iraq was a threat to the community of nations. Its very existence raised the prospect of mushroom clouds, as Bush's national security adviser at the time Condoleeza Rice famously intoned.

That was nonsense, a fact that needs no rehash here. Iraq's then-President Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction. Even if he had, using them against the U.S. or a regional ally would have amounted to suicide -- the sort of basic common sense understanding that had enabled Saddam to endure for decades.

And now here is Obama, declaring in a television interview with PBS, that part of the reason Americans ought to fear Syria is that ""chemical weapons that can have devastating effects could be directed at us.""

Let us generously assume that this is merely unfortunate rhetoric, the usual fear-mongering employed by a commander in chief needing to prepare a dubious public that a now-inevitable military strike is in the national interest. The realpolitik conversation has it that the strike has two aims: to make clear that American dictates are to be taken seriously -- in this case, Obama's delineation of a red line barring chemical weapons -- and to reinforce an international agreement making such means beyond the pale.

Both of these supposed aims would be ill-served by a strike on Syria absent the active assent and support of other actors around the globe, and not least the U.N.

Making a case for a strike based on the first of these two notions, David Ignatius puts it this way in a column in The Washington Post: ""What does the world look like when people begin to doubt the credibility of U.S. power? Unfortunately, we're finding that out in Syria and other nations where leaders have concluded they can defy a war-weary United States without paying a price.""

But that's an idea that urgently needs updating, a frame that retains greatest currency only in the place of its minting -- Washington.

In much of the world, governments and peoples fundamentally inclined to casting their lot with the U.S. have spent much of the past decade assaulted by realities that challenge those proclivities. And this is hardly of help to the narrow American interest or broader multinational concerns. A self-appointed global cop seen as morally reprobate, hypocritical and dismissive of the laws it is supposed to enforce does no favors to stability or security, let alone loftier aspirations like justice and progress on problems like climate change.

Begin with the ill-conceived, poorly executed post-war occupation of Iraq, and the torture of combatants there in American-run military prisons. Consider the kidnapping of suspected militants by American authorities on streets of multiple cities, and the detention of the people seized in the cells of Guantanamo, a festering sore on the American image as moral authority. Contemplate the drone strikes unleashed by a superpower on villagers stuck in places that constitute venues for a nominal global war on terror.

These are not realities that will simply be forgotten by the intended audience for the military strikes in Syria, those powers who are supposed to deduce that international norms are really operative. You can't run torture prisons one day and the next day all but unilaterally unleash missile strikes as moral curative without being seen as a less-than-honest broker among the very community of nations in whose name you act. You need a coalition, backing from the U.N. And if you don't get those things, taking action may well be worse than no action at all.

Obama must surely understand this as deeply as anyone. At home, his presidency traces its existence to American revulsion over the parochial, faith-based, fact-free reign of his predecessor. Around the world, his embrace as a moral authority -- his Nobel Peace Prize! -- reflects a deep sense of relief that the reckless cowboy who occupied the White House before had been replaced by a thoughtful, sophisticated person with international experience and respect for other cultures and values.

The standard for the legitimacy of a strike on Syria ought to be very high -- high enough to require a clear motive and objective, and a demonstrably shared plan of action among a multitude of global actors. But the U.N is missing. The Arab League is missing. Even Great Britain is now on the sidelines. It is fair to shame and pressure these powers to go along. It may be imperative. But failing to curry such support does not constitute justification for going it almost alone.

If the objective is indeed defending international norms, how can one justify a strike authorized only by the U.S. and two stalwart allies?

If this is about international law, how can one countenance rushing ahead before the U.N. inspectors complete their work and issue a report?

If this is really about justice, is there no place for due process and critical scrutiny of the intelligence before letting loose with lethal power?

And let us not kid ourselves in the face of a concerted rhetoric effort by the Obama administration to downgrade what is really unfolding. We hear of narrow limited strikes, targeted surgical procedures, and it's as if robots will reach into Syria, avoid all the people, and defang the military capabilities of the Assad regime.

But what is being prepared -- by most accounts a two-day bombardment of Syrian installations with cruise missiles fired from American destroyers -- is an act of war. It may well prove to be a justified act of war, provided it is supported by a community of nations and based on credible intelligence. But war is what this is.

War, it ought to go without saying, is a risky, unpredictable pursuit. You fire missiles at another country and people will die. If we have learned anything from the past decade, it's that military campaigns have unintended consequences. We could miss the intended targets or learn that the things we were aiming at had other uses than those we understood. We could provoke a strike on Israel from Iran. We could incite unforeseen violence from the Assad regime. And when one of those things happens and some fresh hell breaks loose, genuine moral leadership capable of speaking for international norms had best be supported by more than a couple of far-flung allies going along on a ride that has not been adequately mapped out.

For Obama, this poorly sold, as-yet ill-defined intervention into another seething conflict in the Middle East presents grave risks: He could wind up representing the sort of American power defined by his predecessor, the shoot first-contemplate later mode of operation that has served no interests beyond the Islamist militants for whom such violence functions as a valuable recruiting aid."

Jeffrey']",Can Obama Save Turkey From a Syrian Quagmire? - The New York Times,"Turkey’s government believes that unless the balance of power in Syria is tilted in favor of the rebels now, the Syrian conflict will turn into an interminable sectarian civil war that pulls Hatay Province, and with it the rest of Turkey, into turmoil.

Only Washington can change the equation. Following the May 16 summit meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Erdogan, two options seem to be on the table.

The infusion of American power, by arming the rebels or enforcing a no-fly zone, would change the military and regional dynamic and help unite the often squabbling “Friends of Syria” behind American leadership. Only direct American military engagement will rally the disparate parties that want to act against Mr. Assad into unified action.

The wars in Kuwait and Bosnia are cases in point in proving the value of American leadership. It would tilt the balance of power in favor of the rebels and provide diplomatic cover for Turkey as it faces the wrath of Iran and Russia. By presenting Moscow with a counter-incentive, threatening to act alone if Moscow does not use its influence to bring an end to the conflict, the United States could demonstrate that it is serious about engagement. This would also lighten the pressure on Turkey, which is hesitant to take further steps in Syria without at least tacit Russian consent. Russia is Turkey’s historic nemesis and the only country in the region with an economy and military larger than Turkey’s. The Turks fear the Russians and will not confront them alone.

If convincing the Russians proves impossible, Washington should consider creating a buffer zone in northern Syria along the Turkish border to protect rebel-captured areas. A buffer zone, protected by American airpower and an international coalition, would endow the rebels with a staging ground from which to launch operations against Mr. Assad and it would also help Turkey push the conflict back into Syria by transferring rebels and their headquarters into the buffer zones on Syrian territory rather than offering sanctuary to militants on Turkish soil. (There would most likely be regional support for such a policy, including from Jordan, which would also benefit from a buffer zone inside southern Syria.)

More decisive American engagement would simultaneously end doubts about the United States’ commitment to Syria and save Turkey from being pulled further into a conflict that threatens to squander its progress toward resolving the Kurdish conflict and undermine its impressive economic achievements."

By Mick Krever, CNN

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday delivered his first English-language TV message to the American people in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour.

""I would like to say to American people: I bring peace and friendship from Iranians to Americans,"" he said.

Rouhani is in many ways the ""it"" man of this U.N. General Assembly, where Western leaders are trying to gauge whether his diplomatic overtures will translate into concrete policy changes.

He has recently exchanged letters with U.S. President Barack Obama, and there had been suspicion brewing in diplomatic circles that the two leaders would meet face-to-face, informally, at the United Nations in New York.

""There were some talks about it,"" Rouhani told Amanpour through a translator. ""And preparation for the work was done a bit as well.""

""The United States declared its interest in having such a meeting, and in principle Iran could have under certain circumstances allowed for it to happen,"" he said. ""But I believe we didn't have sufficient time to really coordinate the meeting to the full extent that we needed to.""

Two senior U.S. administration officials told CNN on Tuesday that the encounter was called off because it was considered ""too complicated"" for Iran back home.

Complicated domestic politics or not, the Iranian president made clear that he has full permission from Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to negotiate with the West.

""I think that the president of Iran has the authority whenever the national interest of the country is involved,"" Rouhani told Amanpour. ""The supreme leader of Iran has said that should negotiations be necessary for the national interest of the country, he is in fact not opposed to it.""

""Now, if an opportunity was created today, had arisen today,"" the Iranian president said, ""and the prep work for that had been done, most probably the talks would have haven taken place, primarily focused on the nuclear issue or the developments on the Middle East. Therefore the supreme leader, I can tell you, has given permission for my government to freely negotiate on these issues.""

Rouhani stands in stark contrast to his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who used his speeches at the U.N. to spew rhetoric; he was famous for his questioning of the Holocaust.

""I have said before that I am not a historian, and that when it comes to speaking of the dimensions of the Holocaust it is the historians that should reflect on it,"" Rouhani told Amanpour. ""But in general I can tell you that any crime that happens in history against humanity, including the crime the Nazis committed towards the Jews, as well as non-Jewish people, was reprehensible and condemnable as far as we are concerned."""

In a carefully crafted address that was widely regarded as the centerpiece of his first trip to Israel as president, Mr. Obama spoke in lofty terms about Israel’s history and ideals, pointing out again and again how America had stood at its side and saying he remains unquestionably committed to Israel’s security. But the speech also seemed intended as an opportunity for Mr. Obama to appeal to a young generation of Israelis who do not necessarily share the hardened views of many of their elders, who are at best mistrustful of the Palestinians and wary of Mr. Obama himself.

“I recognize that there are those who are not simply skeptical about peace, but question its underlying premise, and that’s a part of democracy and the discourse between our two countries,” Mr. Obama said in the speech at the Jerusalem Convention Center, which was televised live. “But it is important to be open and honest with one another. Politically, given the strong bipartisan support for Israel in America, the easiest thing for me to do would be to put this issue aside and express unconditional support for whatever Israel decides to do.”

In what appeared to be a gentle swipe at the tough Palestinian policies of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Obama said he believed Israelis have a “true partner” in the administration of Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, with whom he had met hours earlier in the city of Ramallah."

(CNN) —

Doctors Without Borders is pulling out of Somalia after more than two decades because of frequent attacks on its staff, the aid group said Wednesday.

The group, internationally known by its French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres, has worked in the nation since 1991.

It said civilian leaders tolerate or “condone the killing, assaulting and abducting ” of aid workers.

“The same actors with whom MSF must negotiate minimum guarantees to respect its medical humanitarian mission have in some cases played a role in the abuses against MSF staff, either through direct involvement or tacit approval, particularly but not exclusively in south-central Somalia,” it said.

In 2011, two MSF members were killed in Mogadishu, and their convicted killer was released early, the group said.

Aid worker dies after attack in South Sudan

In addition, 14 other staff members have been killed and dozens of MSF’s ambulances and medical facilities have been attacked, the group said.

“In choosing to kill, attack, and abduct humanitarian aid workers, these armed groups, and the civilian authorities who tolerate their actions, have sealed the fate of countless lives in Somalia,” said Dr. Unni Karunakara, MSF’s international president. “… The situation in the country has created an untenable imbalance between the risks and compromises our staff must make, and our ability to provide assistance to the Somali people.”

The aid agency had a staff of about 1,500 in the nation to provide various services, including health care, malnutrition treatment, surgery and relief supplies.

Somalia has been plagued by a long-running struggle between government forces and Al-Shabaab, a militant Islamist group with connections to al Qaeda. It has waged a war to implement a stricter form of Islamic law in the country.

Two years ago, Somali and African forces pushed the militants out of the capital, Mogadishu, raising hopes of a return to relative security after about 20 years of violence.

But the militants have maintained control of large chunks of southern and central Somalia, where they stage attacks.

Until last year, Somalia had not had an effective government since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

It's his decision"" President Obama orders flags lowered to half-staff for the international icon Pickens County Sheriff Rick Clark says not in his department Clark says the honor should be reserved for American citizens

(CNN) —

A South Carolina sheriff is refusing to lower the American flag in tribute to Nelson Mandela, saying the honor should be reserved for American citizens.

President Barack Obama ordered flags lowered to half-staff for the international icon until sunset Monday.

But Pickens County Sheriff Rick Clark says not in his department.

“It’s just my simple opinion that the flag should only be lowered to half-staff for Americans who sacrificed for their country,” Clark told CNN affiliate WHNS.

It should be lowered at the U.S. Embassy in South Africa, he said, but not at home.

The flag in his department was lowered over the weekend to honor a fallen law enforcement officer and for Pearl Harbor Day. But it will stay up Sunday, he said.

“I have no problem lowering it in South Africa in their country but not for our country. It should be the people who have sacrificed for our country.”

A spokesman for the department said the sheriff cannot be disciplined.

“He’s not breaking a law. It’s his decision. And I support the decision of the sheriff,” Chief Deputy Creed Hashe said.

Mandela became the symbol of the fight against racial discrimination in South Africa and served 27 years behind bars for defying the apartheid government. He died Thursday at age 95.

Though rare, the lowering of flags for foreign citizens is nothing new.

George W. Bush did it for Pope John Paul II eight years ago. Bill Clinton did it when former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in the 1990s.

In fact, the practice goes as far back as 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson ordered flags lowered for former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

But not all world leaders get the honor.

This year, Obama issued a statement expressing his condolences for the death of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. But he did not order the flag lowered.

American presidents can issue the executive order at their discretion, the Flag Code states. In general, presidents reserve the honor for major national figures, including governors and foreign dignitaries.

The code says it’s only a guide and it does not offer penalties for noncompliance.

Military repels coup attempt in Congo

At least 40 people were killed in gunbattles at a military base%2C the airport and a TV station

Morning talk show host on the air when gunmen burst onto the set

DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Assailants armed with machetes and automatic weapons attacked the state television station, the airport and the main military base in Congo's capital in what appeared to be a coup attempt early Monday, before being repelled by the country's military, officials and witnesses said.

Congo's government spokesman Lambert Mende confirmed the attack, saying around 40 people were killed in the exchange of fire Monday morning, including 16 at the military base, 16 at the airport and eight at the TV station. Another six were captured, he said. He also confirmed that shooting had broken out in Lubumbashi, the country's second-largest city located in southeastern Congo, though by afternoon calm had returned.

""These are terrorists, you can't call them anything else,"" Mende said.

Most residents of this sprawling African capital first realized the attack was under way while watching a morning talk show on Radio Television Nationale Congolaise, the state broadcaster. The presenter of ""Le Panier,"" or ""The Breadbasket"" show, was in mid-sentence, when the intruders burst in. They had time to identify themselves as being devotees of a local prophet, before the signal on state TV was cut, said Pascal Amisi, the deputy chief of staff of Congo's Minister of Communication.

Between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. local time, gunmen also attacked the international airport and the military camp in the capital housing the country's senior army leaders, he said.

""They attacked three different targets at the same time,"" said Amisi. ""We don't know for sure who they are but the group that attac

At the state TV station, an employee who was inside the building when the attack began described a scene of confusion, and terror.ked the TV station said they were representing Prophet Mukungubila,"" he said, naming Gideon Mukungubila, an evangelical Christian leader in Congo, who has built-up a following and who broadcasts messages on local TV and radio. ""Around 30 men attacked the TV station while the 'Le Panier' show was in progress. They came in with knives and said they had a political message to share, before the signal was yanked.""

""There were around 30 armed men who burst into the headquarters of the television station. They started firing, and we hid,"" said the employee who refused to give his name out of fear for his safety. He said that before they were chased out, they had time to scream out, ""

With a population of nearly 66 million, Congo spans a territory as large as Western Europe. It has twice gone to war with its smaller neighbor to the east, Rwanda, which as recently as this year was accused of propping up a rebel group, ensconced in Congo's eastern forest.

President Joseph Kabila, who is himself from the east and is derided by his opponents as being ""Rwandan,"" came to power in 2001, after the assassination of his father, warlord Laurent Kabila. The elder Kabila marched his rebel army into Kinshasa in 1997, grabbing power in a coup.

Even in a place that has suffered numerous coups, and whose remote forests are still home to armed groups, the attack in the capital on Monday came out of left field, surprising many. International flights that were about to land in Congo made U-turns in the air, including one carrying more than 100 passengers including The Associated Press' local correspondent.

""We took off this morning for Kinshasa, and after one hour in the air, the pilot announced that the airport was under attack,"" said Saleh Mwanamilongo by email, after his flight returned to South Africa. ""The pilot went on the intercom to say, 'We have just learned that there is gunfire at the Ndjili Airport, and as we cannot land, we will need to return to Johannesburg.'""

In an emergency message, the American Embassy in Kinshasa said it had received reports of armed engagements and fighting throughout Kinshasa, as well as indications that numerous police and military checkpoints had been erected. ""The embassy urged all U.S. citizens to stay in place and not travel around the city until further notice,"" the statement said.

(CNN) —

Any great speech about the Israeli-Palestinian peace process should leave everyone feeling a bit uncomfortable. Given that all involved have contributed to the troubled situation on the ground, all must challenge themselves to create the changes that are necessary.

By this measure and virtually any other fair metric, President Barack Obama’s address to Israeli students Thursday was a great speech. Boldly, pointedly and deftly, he provided a virtuoso display of political leadership and international statesmanship.

It stands as a companion piece to his great speech in Egypt early in his first term about America and the Arab world. And his great speech in the Czech Republic about nuclear disarmament. And his great Nobel Prize acceptance speech. And his many other great addresses. And like each of those resonant, masterful moments, the measure of the remarks will be in the follow-up, in the change they actually produce.

5 things to know about Obama’s first presidential visit to Israel

It is, after all, easier to be a speechmaker than a peacemaker. And in the wake of Obama’s energizing address, he must now face greatly raised hopes that he will follow up on his words more successfully than he has the Cairo or Prague remarks. As Brookings Institution analyst and longtime U.S. diplomat Martin Indyk noted on CNN afterward, the president has now “raised expectations sky-high that he himself is going to work to make peace possible.”

It remains to be seen whether that happens, but for a moment it is worth considering why the speech was so effective and important. Let’s start by counting the people the president made uncomfortable.

We must begin with Obama’s host for this visit to Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Surely, Netanyahu must have been pleased with the repeated and persuasive statements from Obama since his arrival in Israel that he and the United States remain committed to a special relationship with Israel and to helping ensure Israeli survival. This was precisely the kind of affirmation that the Israelis hoped for from this trip, salve to the wounds – many Netanyahu brought on himself – acquired in the run-up to last fall’s presidential elections.

But of all the slights and bumps of the past months, the president’s remarks – in a sly but unmistakable way – delivered the toughest blow to date to Netanyahu despite their powerful pro-Israeli rhetoric and images. Because Obama sent a message to Netanyahu that if need be he would go over his head to the Israeli people.

Obama, Netanyahu agree on preventing nuclear-armed Iran

To receive this message, Obama picked a young audience that he knew represented a different portion of Israel’s vibrant polity, and he had them cheering and applauding, not just at the expressions of friendship, but at tough remarks about how unconstructive Netanyahu’s settlement policies have been and how vital it is to establish a safe, prospering state for the Palestinians.

By the end, despite efforts to put an enthusiastic face on the event, Netanyahu must have been grateful there have been no Israeli politicians offering an alternative vision as clear as Obama’s. Had there been, Netanyahu might have been working Thursday’s speech as a commentator on Fox News.

Indeed, Obama’s remarks about how all must share the aspirations of Palestinian children must have resonated particularly well with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. But because this was a good and thus fair speech on the issue of peace, the president likely also made Abbas a bit uneasy with the forcefulness of his commitment to Israel’s existence as a Jewish state, a commitment that cuts directly to an issue on which even the most constructive members of the Palestinian leadership have been reluctant to show flexibility.

Abbas, however, was certainly nowhere nearly as directly affronted as the Hamas leaders in Gaza, whom the president unceremoniously slammed for their rocket attacks and for their inattentiveness to the needs of the Palestinian people entrusted into their care. Further, of course, in calling out the terrorist nature of Hezbollah, the president sent yet another message concerning his willingness to confront that organization’s sponsors in Tehran.

In fact, it has seemed frequently throughout this trip that it has been more about standing together with Israel on Iran, toughening the approach to Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and working to support Jordan than it has been about the Israelis and the Palestinians.

John King: Walking through Ramallah and Gaza, political differences become real

But even on this last point, the speech again succeeded in making another group uncomfortable. Because in the end, it was the most potent speech an American president has ever given in Israel about the peace process, the most personal statement of commitment to it. And therefore it must have made very uncomfortable the small group of American diplomats and national security specialists who are going to have to follow through and try to live up to its promise with their actions.

In the end, Obama must make himself central to this process, actively and continuously, or the hopes it has raised will once again be cruelly deflated.

On the other hand, were he to follow through on this and help advance peace through the establishment of an independent Palestinian state that agreed to the secure existence of Israel, he would also be doing much to live up to the promise of his other earlier addresses. Like those calling for better relations with the Islamic world in Cairo and advancing the cause of peace in Prague and in Oslo.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0163cjt,,[],"BBC Africa Debate, Can Africa set the science agenda?","This edition of the BBC Africa Debate comes from Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, where the BBC is hosting a science festival. We bring together scientists from across Africa and around the world to consider the state of science on the continent. With the majority of funding coming from outside the continent, are African scientists in control of their own research agendas? Is African science meeting Africa’s needs – and can it be used to drive growth on the continent? One Ghanaian doctor cites the fact that many children who were admitted with cancer come from a particular area of the country, but there doesn’t appear to be any effort to research the reasons why.

Funding bodies themselves insist that it is local partners who design their projects. Sir John Savill, Chief Executive of the Medical Research Council in the UK, insists that his organisation has a ""grass roots up"" approach, which results in researchers based in Africa setting the local MRC agenda. Some African countries have tried to move away from the old reliance on outside funding – although not always to great effect. Uganda's government chose not to renew a low-interest science loan from the World Bank in 2010, for example, pledging to provide the money itself. But the money was not allocated in that year’s budget. The Ugandan government has also so far failed to establish a promised science ministry.

Ghanaian-born Nasa scientist Dr Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu, believes that scientists in Africa need to be pragmatic. If it wasn't for foreign funding, there would be no research happening on the continent at all. At least students are trained, labs are built and infrastructure is put in place. Some will argue that, when much of the continent's population is still living without basic necessities, is it right for vast amounts of money to be spent on experiments that may never yield tangible results for years, or even decades?

Story highlights A report says Honduran officials have ceded control of prisons to inmates In one prison, the division between prisoners and guards is known as ""the line of death"" Investigators describe large bazaars with food, household goods for sale Honduran President Porfirio Lobo sends troops into one prison after clashes erupt

(CNN) —

They hand out food, issue fines, punish offenders and have their own set of keys.

It sounds like a guard’s job. But in prisons throughout Honduras, a new report says, it’s the inmates who are in charge.

“Internal control of the prisons has been ceded into the hands of the prisoners themselves,” the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights said in a report released last week, claiming the situation has spread through all 24 of the nation’s prisons and is one of the most serious problems the country faces.

The Honduran government doesn’t deny it.

As he ordered troops into one prison after clashes erupted there on Saturday, President Porfirio Lobo called it an “unacceptable situation” and acknowledged that a “reign of crime from within” plagues the country’s prison system.

At a meeting on Monday, he said, government security officials will present proposals to end the criminal reign.

In the meantime, prisoners are reportedly running facilities throughout the country. And last week’s report from the Organization of American States’ commission details how they do it.

’The line of death’

In a massive prison in the world’s murder capital, a painted yellow mark on the ground separates the inmates from the guards.

They call the line in the prison in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, “the line of death,” according to the human rights report.

“The prison guards know that they must not cross into the yard … without the authorization of the inmates, while the inmates refuse to leave the external perimeter in police custody,” the report says.

There are two padlocks on the prison gate, the report says. The guards lock the outside, and the inmates lock the inside.

The situation is simple, one prison official told investigators.

Authorities, the official said, “have no power to change anything.”

In one cell, decorations and wood-paneled walls

Inside one cell in another prison, investigators from the human rights commission said they saw a sight that stood out from the typically squalid conditions: varnished, wood-paneled walls.

The inmate had a private toilet, a large bed, a remote-controlled air conditioning unit and his own TV.

Why? He was what’s known as a “coordinator” – a key figure in the prison hierarchy.

According to the report, his responsibilities include: applying disciplinary punishment; setting the prices inmates pay to live in cells; distributing and setting food prices; and resolving conflicts that emerge during daily prison life.

“Above all,” the report says, “the ‘coordinators’ serve as spokesmen or liaisons with the prison authorities, and are really privileged prisoners who exercise a degree of decision-making power within the prisons, often sharing the benefits with the prison authorities.”

Prison marketplaces

Inside many of the nation’s prisons, inmates buy and sell food, clothes and household items in unregulated marketplaces, the report says.

The system has serious consequences, the report argues, including promoting corruption and allowing illicit goods to enter the facility.

In San Pedro Sula, for example, the prison yard houses a large bazaar.

According to the report, there are “barbers’ shops, cafeterias, bakeries, sales of fruit and food of all kinds, sales of medications and cloth, tailoring workshops, a cobbler’s shop, a leather workshop, carpentry, a cabinetmaker’s workshop, crafts, manufacture of mirrors, billiard tables, games tables and many soft drink dispensing machines.”

A necessary evil?

Throughout the human rights investigators’ trip to Honduras, officials described self-government in the prisons as a “necessary evil,” the report says.

“This system, as was observed, is accepted by the prison authorities as the only viable way of maintaining order and stability between them and the prison populations, and the ‘coordinators’ are considered collaborators and even allies of the authorities.

But authorities have also acknowledged that the widespread prisoner control of facilities has played a major role in contributing to corruption in the prison system.

A year after deadly prison fire, questions remain

The human rights report’s revelations come more than a year after a deadly prison fire in Honduras cast a global spotlight on prison conditions there.

At the time, analysts said prison overcrowding likely contributed to the massive death toll of the February 2012 fire in Comayagua, Honduras, which claimed more than 360 lives. It’s a problem groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have condemned.

Overcrowding remains rampant, the report says, with outdated facilities housing far more inmates than they were designed to hold.

The report lists “the lack of appropriate, safe physical installations, deplorable health and hygiene conditions, failure to provide adequate food and drinking water and the lack of adequate medical care” as significant concerns.

The report notes that “grave deficiencies…led to the death of the victims of the fire,” including overcrowding, fire hazards and no signs for evacuation routes.

And 18 months after the blaze, the government still hasn’t given a clear explanation of what happened, the report says.

“One of the hypotheses that the commission ask to be studied was the possible presence of criminal hands in the tragedy … and really we see that there has not been up to now an investigation that has reached results proportionate to the duty of the state to investigate,” said Rodrigo Escobar Gil, a prisoner rights rapporteur for the commission.

In one prison, shots ring out and troops take over

After 15 people were injured and three people were killed during clashes at a National Penitentiary prison in Tamara, Honduras, on Saturday, Honduras’ president said he was sending in troops to take over.

In a written statement, his office said that the government has taken steps to disarm prisoners and instituted other security measures at prisons nationwide. But they haven’t been able to stop the “criminal reign” within prisons, the statement.

Last week’s report lists a series of recommendations for the Honduran government. Among them: reducing overcrowding, improving safety and taking back control from prisoners.

Honduran officials have said they accept the human rights commission’s report and are pledging to reform the prison system.

“The panorama that the commission has exposed is the absolute truth,” said Jose Augusto Avila, coordinator of the country’s Penitentiary System Transition Commission. “We cannot deny it.”

The person resided at Pavillon Beau-Lieu, a special care home in Grand Falls, where there's an outbreak involving the variant first reported in South Africa. Health Minister Dorothy Shephard said she is saddened by the news. ""I join all New Brunswickers in sharing sincere condolences with this person's loved ones during this difficult time,"" she said in a statement. On Sunday, Public Health announced another resident of the special care home, someone in their 80s, had died in hospital ""as a result of COVID-19."" With the 15 new cases, there are now 142 active cases of respiratory disease in the province. Six people are in hospital, including two in intensive care. The breakdown of the new cases is as follows: Moncton region, Zone 1: one case: A person 30 to 39 This case is a contact of a previously confirmed case. Saint John region, Zone 2: three cases: A person 30 to 39 A person 40 to 49 A person 50 to 59 One case is under investigation, one case is travel-related and the other is a contact of a previously confirmed case. Fredericton region, Zone 3: five cases: A person under 19 A person 30 to 39 A person 40 to 49 Two people 60 to 69 Three of the cases are contacts of a previously confirmed case and two are travel-related.

A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

As he has pushed for resumption of the talks, Mr. Kerry has essentially served as his own special envoy, engaging in round-the-clock meetings with Israeli and Palestinian officials during six trips to the Middle East and making countless phone calls.

But with the negotiations due to start in the next week or so, and Mr. Kerry intent on assuming his broader responsibilities as secretary of state, he has begun to assemble a team that would manage what one senior State Department official said is expected to be “a rocky and up-and-down process.”

Channel 2 News in Israel reported that Mr. Kerry had told the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, that Mr. Indyk was his choice; the channel said both leaders expressed approval."

USA TODAY

Government is investigating the allegation

PRETORIA, South Africa -- The sign language interpreter used at Tuesday's memorial service for Nelson Mandela, and whose image was broadcast around the world as he shared a stage with world leaders including President Obama, was being called a ""fake"" by the Deaf Federation of South Africa.

Bruno Druchen, the national director of the federation, sent this tweet as the event was taking place at FNB Stadium on the outskirts of Johannesburg, South Africa:

Wilma Newhoudt, a deaf member of South Africa's parliament, tweeted this:

The Associated Press also reported the allegation Wednesday, saying that three sign language experts who watched the broadcast said the man was not signing in South African or American sign languages.

""It was horrible, an absolute circus, really really bad,"" Nicole Du Toit, an official sign language interpreter, told the AP. ""Only he can understand those gestures.""

USA TODAY was not able to independently confirm the allegations, which if proved true would be an enormous embarrassment to South African officials at a time when the nation is looking to celebrate the life and legacy of Nelson Mandela.

South Africa's government said it is preparing a statement.

Collins Chabane, one of South Africa's two presidency ministers, said the government is continuing to investigate the matter.

Many South Africans were unaware of the sign language controversy Wednesday. Rachel Kika, 47, a teacher from the northern cape was surprised.

""I would not think the government would put someone there who did not know what they were doing,"" she said. ""It would be very disappointing. I hope they got the facts wrong. I don't know how that would happen when sign language is an official language.""

Bronwen Wilson-Thomson, 50, was shocked such a thing would happen.

""It would be sad if true,"" she said. ""It's not like they can't find people who know sign language.""

She said a few years ago, a singer messed up the national anthem by singing it to a different tune during a cricket match. ""I guess if we can have someone mess up the national anthem, we can have someone mess up the sign language,"" she said.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/13/opinion/the-north-korea-problem.html,2013-04-13 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],The North Korea Problem - The New York Times,"Secretary of State John Kerry sent several important messages to North Korea after talks on Friday in Seoul with South Korean leaders. Speaking at a news conference, he said that the United States would defend its South Korean and Japanese allies if there was conflict, that the international community would never accept the North as a nuclear weapons state, and that Washington was willing to resume long-stalled negotiations but only if the North Koreans agreed to move seriously on denuclearization.

But the window into North Korea’s nuclear intentions and American policy in response was as blurry as ever. The Defense Intelligence Agency rang alarms bells on Thursday with a report that it had concluded with “moderate confidence” that the North was capable of launching a missile with a nuclear warhead. Mr. Kerry and other officials later dismissed the report as premature.

On Friday, in a background briefing for journalists, a senior American official played down an expected North Korean missile test, saying it might provide the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, with an “off ramp” to save face and de-escalate tensions. Hours later, Mr. Kerry used a news conference to warn Mr. Kim not to proceed with the test in an “already volatile, potentially dangerous situation,” saying Mr. Kim “needs to understand, as I think he probably does, what the outcome of the conflict would be.”

In that climate, Mr. Kerry’s reaffirmation of American interest in negotiations could get lost, especially since he put the responsibility on the North to act first, by seriously committing to denuclearize, and seemed inclined to let South Korea’s new president, Park Geun-hye, move ahead first on her call for dialogue with North Korea."

Some military and Congressional critics question whether the command is up to dealing with its dual mission, and some influential lawmakers warn that Africom, with its headquarters in Germany, is understaffed and poorly financed for challenges that include countering Al Qaeda’s fighters in Mali, Islamic extremists in Libya, drug traffickers in West Africa and armed rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The leader of the command, Gen. Carter F. Ham, must straddle the new and the old missions, as he demonstrated one day last month when he flew to the northern reaches of this largely desert nation to watch United States troops train Niger’s fledgling border corps in basic skills to help combat Al Qaeda’s branch in North and West Africa. Then, within hours, he was back here in the capital for an urgent secure phone call from Washington to weigh what kind of advanced military support or surveillance the Pentagon could provide a French-led operation to blunt an Islamist offensive in neighboring Mali.

“The command is searching to find the right balance between the press of current military operations and the vision of longer-term engagement, helping Africans develop greater capacity for themselves,” said Christopher W. Dell, a former United States ambassador to Angola and Zimbabwe, who is General Ham’s deputy for civil-military activities."

But that’s what President Obama seemed to go out of his way to do at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service Tuesday. Although Castro has imprisoned American Alan Gross for four years now, CNN alternately applauded and made excuses for the handshake.

Obviously worried that shaking hands with a dictator might hurt Obama politically, the media were quick to play goalie. CNN’s Chris Cuomo went so far as to read Obama’s mind and report on the president’s true intent:

And that handshake obviously was a huge moment. But not to be misunderstood, the handshake with Raul Castro, the president of Cuba, we believe was President Obama showing respect to Nelson Mandela and the occasion of today, the spirit of reconciliation. Of course, it will be dissected politically. …

No matter the ongoing political disputes, on this day, it was about something bigger. It was about forgiveness and reconciliation, because it was about a man who was bigger: Nelson Mandela. And that is what the tribute has been all about today.

Cuomo never bothered to mention that Castro is a dictator.

UPDATE: Reporting during the 9am hour, CNN’s Jim Acosta said that it “would have been sort of impolite” for Obama not to shake hands with Raul Castro. Carol Costello suggested that the handshake “surely helps” to thaw the Cold War mentality between Cuba and America. Acosta reminded Costello that Cuba is in its fourth year of holding American Alan Gross. At no time did Costello or Acosta correctly refer to Castro as what he is: a dictator.

The Weekly Standard grabbed CNN video of an excited Chrstiane Amanpour: “Castro, he’s shaking hands with Raúl Castro! … This is a man, it is so true, who brought people together in life and he continues to bring people together today.”

Because everyone in the elite media either coordinates or thinks alike (it has to be one or the other), moments later the USA Today’s Susan Page tweeted out the exact same spin.

FBI searches suspect%27s condo in Stamford%2C Conn.

She was let go from her job as a dental hygienist last year

The woman%27s 1-year-old daughter was taken into protective custody

The 34-year-old Connecticut woman who was shot and killed by police after a harrowing high-speed chase from the White House to Capitol Hill was delusional, believing that President Obama was communicating with her, law enforcement officials said Friday.

The officials, who have been briefed on the investigation, spoke to USA TODAY on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation.

Miriam Carey, a dental hygienist from Stamford, Conn., was identified Friday by Washington, D.C., police as the driver of the black luxury sedan that first rammed a barrier at the White House, then sped to Capitol Hill, defying attempts by armed police to stop her Thursday afternoon.

She was shot and killed fleeing her car near the Hart Senate Office Building.

Police in Stamford spoke to Carey in December 2012 after receiving a call from her boyfriend, the law enforcement sources said. She told police then that she thought Obama was eavesdropping on her and the government was electronically monitoring her house. She said she thought she was a prophet, the sources said.

Investigators have been able to trace Carey's movements in the days before the car chase and shooting, said a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation but not allowed to speak publicly.

Carey appears to have taken a direct route from Connecticut to Washington on Thursday. Investigators used New Jersey highway toll records to in part help track her route.

A 1-year-old girl was in Carey's car, though she avoided serious injury and was taken into protective custody.

NBC4 News, quoting law enforcement authorities, also reported that there were indications that Carey thought Obama was stalking her. Carey's mother told ABC News that her daughter began suffering from postpartum depression after giving birth to her daughter last August. ""A few months later, she got sick,"" Idella Carey said. ""She was depressed. ... She was hospitalized.""

Idella Carey said her daughter had no history of violence and that she had no idea why she was in Washington.

Authorities who descended on Carey's condo in Stamford have not determined a motive for her bizarre behavior through downtown Washington, D.C.

Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, was briefed on the incident by the FBI and secret service.

McCaul said he was told that Miriam Carey had postpartum depression, an injury to her head and a family history of schizophrenia.

He said Carey's boyfriend reported to police that she had been violent on at least one occasion. The boyfriend was worried about Carey's mental state.

McCaul said law enforcement authorities told him that she had a stay in the mental hospital though he didn't know the details. He also said Carey thought that her apartment was under surveillance and that Obama was monitoring her.

""It's the tragic story of a woman with a history of mental illness,"" McCaul said.

He says authorities found an envelope with white powder at the door of her apartment that has slowed down the search of her apartment.

Miriam Carey's sister Amy Carey-Jones said late Friday that her sister ""seemed OK"" the last time they spoke more than a week ago, and there were no indications she was unstable.

A second sister, Valarie Carey, a retired New York City police officer, said police should not have used deadly force.

Valarie Carey said there was ""no need for a gun to be used.""

""That's impossible. She works, she holds a job,"" said Amy Carey. ""She wouldn't be in D.C. She was just in Connecticut two days ago, I spoke to her. ... I don't know what's happening. I can't answer any more.""

In Brooklyn, Freddie Perera, 71, a retired traveling salesman, has lived one door down from Amy Carey for four years and said he has seen Miriam Carey a few times while she was visiting.

""When she was here, she was normal,"" Perera said of Miriam Carey. ""They are a pretty nice family.""

The New York Daily Newsquoted Carey's former boss, dentist Brian Evans from Advanced Periodontics, in Hamden, Conn., as saying that she ""fell down some stairs and she had a pretty significant head injury"" in recent years.

Evans also said that Carey, who was let go last year, had a temper and became incensed over being told to quit parking in a handicapped spot at the medical building. That created friction between them, he said.

Another of Carey's bosses at Advanced Periodontics, dentist Barry Weiss, told NBC Connecticut that she was a bit ""headstrong"" on a few occasions but was otherwise ""an average employee.""

Weiss also that said Carey ""could be a bit rough,"" and after complaints from patients, was fired in August 2012.

""Nothing would have led us to think she would have done this,"" Weiss said.

Another former boss, dentist Steven Oken, for whom she worked eight years, described Carey as a ""non-political person"" who was ""always happy.""

A new Facebook page called ""In Love Memory of Miriam Carey"" features comments from people described as friends and acquaintances. One, purportedly from a former classmate, said Miram ""was really just a sweet and nurturing person.""

A note at the top from the creator of the page says: ""Folks — this is a community page for us to share our feelings on today's tragedy. Keep your politics and hate speech off this page. This is in memory of my friend.""

Court records also show that Carey was sued last year by her condo association for failure to pay fees since 2010 on the Stamford home she owned since 2009. The lawsuit, involving $1,759 plus collection costs, was settled in February, the Associated Press reports.

U.S. Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine said the incident ""appears to be an isolated, singular matter, with, at this point, no nexus to terrorism.""

Two federal officials, who were not authorized to comment publicly, told USA TODAY that all shots were fired by law enforcement officers. One official said no gun was recovered from her car.

""This does not appear to be in any way an accident,"" Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier said Thursday. She noted that Carey twice tried to breach security barriers and struck a uniformed Secret Service officer near the White House.

The chaotic events began at 2:12 p.m. ET when the driver rammed a temporary barrier at 15th and E Streets NW, hitting the officer, said Secret Service chief Ed Donovan. Other Secret Service officers chased the woman east on Pennsylvania Avenue but did not shoot.

Lanier said Capitol Police officers pursued the speeding car eastbound and tried to stop it in Garfield Circle, just west of the Capitol lawn. A 23-year-veteran officer suffered non-life-threatening injuries when he crashed into a barrier.

Police had the woman's car surrounded but she escaped, ramming a Secret Service vehicle as she fled. Lanier said police then fired their first shots at the suspect.

The driver made her way onto Constitution Avenue before eventually stopping in the 100 blocks of Maryland Avenue NE, near the Hart Senate Office Building.

As it is, the country is on the brink. We know that Lebanon's fractious sect-based political system has been strained by the Syrian war. Some Lebanese have crossed into Syria to support the warring sides and that, as an extension of this, there have been retaliatory attacks within Lebanon. But more than the violence or the fear of renewed civil war, what has put Lebanon on the brink is the flood of Syrian refugees who are overwhelming the country, threatening it with economic collapse and its capacity to survive as a state. It is only right that the world has focused attention on the terrible plight of Syria's refugees. But the enormity of this human tidal wave that has hit Lebanon must also be considered. According to the United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHRC) there are currently 790,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon, with an estimated 75,000 coming each month. This number does not include the more than 250,000 Syrians living in Lebanon as migrant workers. Given current projections, the UN agency estimates that if the Syrian war continues apace, by the end of this calendar year, Syrian refugees will constitute about one-quarter of Lebanon's total population. The refugee crisis has affected Lebanon on many levels. Because Lebanon has not built refugee camps, the Syrian exiles have moved into communities across the entire country. Many have crowded into low income apartments, resulting in a housing shortage and a spike in rental rates -- as much as 44 percent in some areas. This in turn has pushed poorer Lebanese out of the housing market -- forcing them to become internally displaced in their own country. Other Syrians have formed informal ""tent cities"" in towns and villages throughout Lebanon creating additional stress on host communities. The UNHRC estimates that there are 1,400 of these settlements. Because the Syrian refugees have flooded the job market, often willing to work for less, official statistics now report that average wages have plummeted and 20 percent of Lebanese are now unemployed. There are additional strains on the economy. The World Bank projects that Lebanon's GDP will decline by 2.9 percent each year from 2012 to 2014. Government revenues will decrease by $1.5 billion annually, while government expenditures are expected to rise by over $1 billion each year, owing to the increased demand for services. As a result, it is projected that an additional 170,000 Lebanese will be forced into poverty this year. The problems don't end there. The 90,000 Syrian children registered in local schools have created a serious over-crowding problem in the educational system -- with additional strains reported in the health care, public and social service sectors. Water, gas and electricity rates have all increased by 7.4 percent in the last year. Some medicines are now in short supply and with winter fast approaching the stress on the food supply, housing, health care, and other services will only grow. In this context, it is important to recall that last winter; there were only about 150,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon -- while this winter the number will be at least eight times that number! It should be expected that this situation might lead to social tensions within Lebanon. Polling data establishes that many Lebanese have become resentful. Many Lebanese poor see their country being overrun, resulting in: their inability to find work; having to settle for lower wages; and forcing them to face increased costs for food and services. They resent the fact that the Syrian refugees receive international assistance, while they must do without. All of this has created a new level of communal tensions. Since Lebanon has had a long and conflicted history with its neighbor, and since Lebanon's internal relationships remain unresolved, the added dimension of over one million Syrian refugees has only compounded an already fragile situation. The UNHRC's representative in Lebanon has written that given all these strains, which no country should be expected to bear, Lebanon has so far held up quite well. She writes ""Lebanon stands as an example of generosity in the face of crisis. Despite misunderstandings and tensions, everyday acts of kindness are commonplace."" But she warns, ""Without more international support, the patience and hospitality of host communities may wear thin. Continuing neglect will stoke rising tensions and raise the risk that the...Syrian civil war will become a regional war."" This said, Lebanon demands immediate attention. I cannot disagree with the push to rid Syria of chemical weapons, convene a Geneva II Summit to find a way to end that country's long war, and provide more assistance to alleviate the humanitarian crisis created by the massive population displacement created by the war. But Lebanon can no longer be ignored. The country need urgent support. It needs support to strengthen its capacity to deal with this crisis: the army needs assistance to help control the border and provide internal security; and the government and relief agencies need assistance to provide support to Lebanon's poor and those who have been displaced in their own country by the influx of refugees. Our concern for what is happening to Syria and Syrians, cannot and must not drown out our concern for Lebanon and its people. If we continue to ignore Lebanon, in short order, that country might collapse under the weight of the pressures to which it has been subjected. Lebanon requires attention."

A 30-year-old government contractor was the source of high-profile disclosures of the vast collection of data obtained by the National Security Agency and other intelligence groups.

A 30-year-old government contractor has been charged with espionage for recent leaks of classified intelligence. He has vaulted from obscurity to international notoriety, joining the ranks of high-profile leakers such as Daniel Ellsberg of Pentagon Papers fame.

Venezuela’s offer of asylum for NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden got a thumbs up from key members of the Russian parliament Saturday, even as the Kremlin and Foreign Ministry kept a studious silence.

“Sanctuary for Snowden in Venezuela would be the best decision,” Alexei Pushkov, head of the foreign affairs committee of Russia’s lower house of parliament, tweeted Saturday.

Pushkov, who reliably reflects the government’s position on international issues, voiced what appears to be a growing official desire to see Snowden leave after 13 days holed up in transit limbo at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport. He wrote of Snowden, “He can’t live at Sheremetyevo.”

Another parliamentary deputy and member of Pushkov’s committee, Alexander Babakov, told the Russian News Service on Saturday that he thinks the offer of asylum Friday from Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was Snowden’s best recourse.

“Given that Snowden’s U.S. passport was revoked and that he has no particular alternative, the proposal, especially coming from the mouth of the head of state, is sure to be accepted,” he said.

Pushkov also argued that asylum would not cost Venezuela because the country is already in an acute conflict with the United States. “It can’t get worse,” he wrote.

The central question, though, is how Snowden might get to Venezuela. Until now, Russia has been saying he cannot fly out without proper documents, following the revocation of his U.S. passport. On Saturday, a lieutenant colonel in Russia’s FSB reserve, Anatoly Yermolin, told the radio station Ekho Moskvy that Russia could grant Snowden status as a “stateless person,” and that would allow him to leave without further complications.

But a more difficult question is: by what route? Direct commercial flights from Moscow to Havana cross European airspace, and after the refusal of France, Italy and Spain to allow an overflight Tuesday by Bolivian President Evo Morales, that route would seem to be problematic for Snowden. He might have to rely on a private plane, following a roundabout course, if he were to reach Caracas.

Maduro said he was offering asylum so that the former National Security Agency contractor could live “free of imperial North American persecution.” v

Venezuela is the first country to offer sanctuary to Snowden. On Saturday, Morales said that Bolivia is also willing to give him asylum.

The 30-year-old computer whiz has reportedly requested asylum from more than 20 countries.

But only Jimmy Kimmel brought in a sign language expert to translate exactly what Jantjie was saying to the crowds.

Justin Maurer -- who has signed for some of “Jimmy Kimmel Live’s” concerts, including Hanson -- stood onstage next to Kimmel and watched clips of Jantjie doing his thing and attempted to relate what was actually being said. Sure enough, it had no relation to the words that were coming out of the speakers’ mouths.

“I support basic salutations here salutations,” Mauer translated while watching a clip of Mandela’s great-granddaughter Phumla Mandela. “Inside joining in this week’s cigarette inside to prove and on and on. To support, I would please to say from me to you. Talking to you so far.”

A second clip translated as: “Hello. Welcome so far. Well cigarette join bringing in different to you. Circle. And I would like to pray this offering. Basically this is fun, all of these balls to prove this is good. I’m sorry.”

Mauer explained to Kimmel: “It’s complete gibberish.”

“In your opinion, does this guy know sign language at all?” Kimmel asked.

“No, not at all,” Mauer said.

Jantjie has subsequently defended himself, telling the Johannesburg newspaper the Star that he suffers from schizophrenia and started hearing voices and hallucinating while on stage. It was because of those hallucinations, he said, that he made the nonsense gestures.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/11/26/Valerie-Jarrett-Chicago-and-the-Iran-Deal,2013-11-26 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],"Valerie Jarrett, Chicago, and the Iran Deal","Last week, the Times of Israel reported that senior presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett had been leading talks with Iran in secret for a year before the formal negotiations in Geneva this month. While the White House denied the report “100 percent,” the existence of back-channel talks has been confirmed by other reporting. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that President Barack Obama had “personally overseen” the talks.

Almost anything “personally overseen” by the President Obama is likely to bear the heavy stamp of Ms. Jarrett, who is the president’s closest adviser, despite a shocking track record of failure. In foreign policy, her most important mistake was her effort to dissuade the president from proceeding with the raid on Osama bin Laden. It was one of the few times that President Obama overruled her counsel–and one of his few successes.

Jarrett’s involvement in Iran is cause for concern for three additional reasons–two minor and one major. One minor reason is that she was born there. That should not automatically disqualify anyone, of course, any more than being born in the Soviet Union would have disqualified an anti-Soviet dissident. But Jarrett was born in 1956 to American expatriates in the aftermath of the CIA-assisted coup that deposed Mohammad Mossadegh.

The Iranian regime remains obsessed with the Mossadegh coup as proof of America’s innate evil–and for decades, some Americans have felt a sense of post-colonial guilt about it. That feeling may be particularly acute for an American born in the shadow of that event. The temptation to show contrition by acceding to Iran’s goals, as a kind of restorative justice, could well shape Jarrett’s involvement, and Obama’s approach.

The second minor reason to worry about Jarrett’s involvement in Iran is her political background. Her entrée into the world of left-wing politics in Chicago was through her father-in-law, Vernon Jarrett, a journalist with somewhat radical views. Jarrett spoke out against antisemitism in the black community, for example, but also took anti-Israel stands, accusing pro-Israel Jews of “support of genocide” in the Lebanon War, for example.

These two reasons for concern are fairly minor, because they are based on mere speculation, and would have to be balanced out by other factors, such as Ms. Jarrett’s personal associations with leaders of the pro-Israel community in Chicago. But the major reason for concern about her role is simply that Jarrett has banished, and repulsed, most of the Obama administration’s most competent appointees from the White House.

One of the most important departures was that of Dennis Ross, who was brought into the White House early in the Obama presidency to advise the president on the Middle East. Ross, who advocated a tough approach to Iran, is widely thought to have been marginalized by the president’s inner circle. He left the White House in 2011, ostensibly because he had only promised to serve two years, but likely because he was not being utilized.

Finally, it is worth noting that Jarrett, despite her expatriate origins, has little experience in international affairs, and is said to manage Obama’s policies through a domestic political lens. If she was as involved in the talks as reports suggest, that could be a major reason for the president’s eagerness to sign almost any deal, even one the French rejected as too weak.

Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has led the call to suspend the $1.5 billion in annual aid to Egypt, citing long-standing U.S. law that funds be cut off when an elected president is removed in a military coup.

""It was a coup,"" he said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" restating comments similar to those he first made Friday. ""Reluctantly, I believe we have to suspend aid, until free and fair election.""

Later in the day, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker said the United States should first focus on trying to restore calm in Egypt, where street demonstrations and clashes between members of Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood political party and Morsi opponents over the past several weeks have resulted in at least 36 deaths.

“Our role right now should be one of applying calm,” Corker, the highest-ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told “Fox News Sunday.”

He also urged Muslim Brotherhood members to “show some responsibility” in reacting to their leader being removed from power last week.

Sen. Jack Reed, D- R.I., agreed with Corker later on the show.

“We have to be a force of stability,” he said.

The Obama administration has not taken sides in the power struggle. Officials ordered a review of U.S. aid on Wednesday, the day the Egyptian military removed Morsi, but they have stopped short of calling the move a ""coup.”

Corker said some of the money goes toward long-standing treaties and that he didn’t think immediately cutting off aid is the best strategy.

“We’ll have plenty of time to assess that,” he said.

Reed said he didn’t think cutting off aid would help.

“We have to be very, very careful,"" he said.

McCain received support Sunday from congressional Republican and Democrat, despite Mohamed Tawfik, Egypt’s ambassador to the United States, emphatically telling ABC’s “This Week” that a military coup had “absolutely not” taken place when Morsi was removed, then replaced with Adly Mansour.

California Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff told Fox’s “America’s News Headquarters” that Morsi’s removal was a “popular” coup, but it also was a military one, as McCain has suggested.

Florida Republican Rep. Trey Radel said on the show that he also “agrees with Senator McCain and Representative Schiff” and that aid should be suspended until specific conditions are met, including the establishment of elections and a free press."

The breakthrough took place in the most improbable of surroundings: a trailer parked on the tarmac of Ben-Gurion International Airport. Moments before Mr. Obama left for Jordan, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu telephoned the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and apologized for deadly errors in Israel’s 2010 raid on a Turkish ship that was trying to bring aid to Palestinians in Gaza.

After years of angrily demanding an apology, Mr. Erdogan accepted Mr. Netanyahu’s gesture, and both sides agreed to dispatch envoys to each other’s nations, having recalled them in 2011.

The president’s involvement, a senior American official said, was crucial to both leaders, which is why Mr. Netanyahu scheduled the call before Mr. Obama’s departure from Israel. Mr. Erdogan insisted on speaking to Mr. Obama first before the president handed the phone over to Mr. Netanyahu. In the end, the call produced a win-win for all sides."

It would also vindicate the Republican Party’s (often notional) commitment to offering incremental alternatives to bloated liberal bills.

But such incrementalism would punt on the question of how to handle the bulk of the existing illegal-immigrant population, and thus wouldn’t be anything like the game changer sought by many Republican strategists worried about the Hispanic vote. And politically, it would have been much more clever months ago, before the Senate bill raised expectations for how sweeping a reform should be. In the shadow of Rubio-Schumer, a House that passed incremental bills and then refused to negotiate its way to something bigger might well receive the same kind of “do nothing” coverage as a House that did nothing at all.

Hence the (quiet, for now) appeal of the second option, mentioned last week by The Washington Post’s Ezra Klein and The Huffington Post’s Jon Ward, in which the House would find a way to go along with a version of amnesty that either didn’t include the promise of citizenship or made the path so long and arduous that few immigrants would take it.

To its supporters, this combination would deliver illegal immigrants the security and stability that pro-legalization activists are seeking, without running afoul of either the principled Republican desire to avoid rewarding people who have broken America’s laws, or the more cynical Republican desire not to have the newly legalized showing up to vote for Democrats.

But it, too, would come at a cost. We’re living through an era of stratification, a period of mass unemployment, an economic “recovery” in which working-class wages aren’t actually recovering. This is a strange climate in which to create — and then augment, via guest-worker programs — a permanent tier of explicitly second-class, mostly low-skilled residents, deliberately curtail their political leverage and then ask low-wage native workers to compete with them for jobs.

And it’s a particularly strange climate for a Republican Party struggling to shed its “party of the rich” label to identify with such a policy, and give up one of the few issues where it has some credibility with working-class voters.

The party faces risks whatever it does: killing comprehensive reform might further alienate Hispanics, as the conventional wisdom has it, but then again going along with Charles Schumer and a flood of corporate money might exacerbate the kind of “who’s looking out for me?” disaffection that kept many conservative-tilting, economically strapped voters from the polls in 2012.

But a clever-sounding deal that legalizes immigrants as laborers but not as citizens risks disaster on both fronts: rejection by Hispanics as insufficient and ultimately insulting, and rejection by many of America’s tired, poor, huddled workers as another example of the political class’s indifference to their fate."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/12/02/Energy-Drives-Asian-Military-Confrontation,2013-12-02 00:00:00,['Chriss W. Street'],Energy Drives Asian Military Confrontation,"China’s Ministry of Defense on November 30th began enforcing an expanded Air Defense Identification Zone, which now covers a huge off-shore expanse that includes the disputed oil rich Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.

Forced to rely on the Middle East for oil for electrical production, Asian energy costs are surging, and supply has become unstable due to the continuing Arab Spring turmoil. With American domestic energy costs falling as supplies surge due to the boom in fracking for shale oil and gas, Chinese manufacturers are becoming economically uncompetitive on a cost basis compared to the U.S. producers. With China, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea equally desperate to save jobs by exploiting potentially cheap and abundant off-shore oil, energy economics will drive military confrontations in Asia.

The Chinese claim the discovery and control of the Diaoyu islands from the 14th Century, but Japan took control of the islands from 1895 until its surrender to the U.S. at the end of World War II. During the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands after 1945, it was discovered that oil reserves might be found under the sea near the islands. In anticipation of the turnover of the Senkaku islands, Japan declared a 100 mile ADIZ around the islands in 1969. Since reverting back to Japanese control under the 1971 Okinawa Reversion Agreement, sovereignty around the islands has been disputed by the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, and South Korea.

The new Chinese rules require that aircraft must ask for permission to fly in the ADIZ; aircraft in the zone must identify and keep in communication with Chinese authorities; all aircraft must “follow the instructions of the administrative organ of the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone”; and warn “China’s armed forces will adopt defensive emergency measures to respond to aircraft that do not cooperate in the identification or refuse to follow the instructions.” In response to these new Chinese edits, the U.S. flew two unarmed B-52 bombers from Guam on November 25th without notification. Then on 29th, the People’s Liberation Army Air Force scrambled Su-30 and J-11 warplanes in response to 10 flights of Japanese F-15s, E-767s and P-3s; U.S. P-3s and EP-3s; and South Korean fighter jets flying through the ADIZ.

The 1919 Paris Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation recognized the principal of freedom of the skies as an extension of “freedom of the high seas” that limited territorial sea claims of coastal nations to 12 nautical miles off their shores. The Convention on International Civil Aviation of 1944 updated air rights, but it was the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) which created the framework for exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in waters previously regarded as high seas. The three basic obligations of the treaty: (1) the duty to refrain from the unlawful threat or use of force; (2) the duty to have “due regard” to the rights of others to use the sea; and (3) the duty to observe applicable obligations under other treaties or rules of international law.

The United States extended what had been its 12 nautical mile territorial sea into a “high seas” Air Defense Identification Zone in response to heightened tensions with the Soviet Union caused by the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. America claims continental ADIZs extending 300 nautical miles in some Atlantic areas and more than 400 nautical miles in Southern California. The United States also maintains ADIZs off the coast of Alaska extending out at least 350 nautical miles into the Bering Sea, similar distance into the Arctic Sea off Alaska’s northern coast, 250 nautical miles around Guam, and up to 250 nautical miles north of the Hawaiian Islands.

The U.S. from 1870 to 1970 dominated manufacturing and won two wars on the back of oil and gas prices that averaged a third of the world’s price. But shrinking domestic production after 1972 destroyed America’s energy cost advantage by the 1980s. Once expanded Middle East oil production equalized energy costs for the world, American manufacturers began relocating jobs to Asia to stay competitive with lower labor costs.

But U.S. natural gas prices have fallen from $15 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in 2000 to about $3.50 mcf today. This compares to rising natural gas prices that are $10 mcf in Europe, $12 mcf in China and $17 mcf in Japan. If this cost advantage holds or widens as America exploits its spectacular abundance of shale to frack for oil and gas, Asian employment will fall as huge amounts of manufacturing relocates to the United States.

No country has more risk from high energy prices than China, which passed the U.S. in 2010 as the world’s largest manufacturer. China passed Russia to grab the number two spot behind the U.S. in defense spending. Fearing the Peoples’ Liberation Army would become the dominant military power in East Asia, Japan has launched a crash rearmament drive that by next year will have ballooned defense outlays past France and the U.K. to the number four spot, just behind Russia.

The width of China’s new ADIZ does not extend beyond the international EEZ standard, but according to Stratfor Reports: “Beijing is testing U.S. responses in the Western Pacific, as China attempts to shape a new maritime balance in the area. All sides will use the current standoff to recalibrate the balance of power over energy and maritime geopolitics that, much like during the Cold War.”

Japan retaliated early this year to China’s growing military assertiveness by extending its ADIZ around the Senkaku Islands by another 15 miles. The current western border of the zone extends at its closest point to just 81 miles off the Chinese mainland. In this escalating tit for tat, between July and September the Japanese military was forced to scramble fighter jets 80 times in response to Chinese warplane and drone intrusions.

Beijing seems distressed enough about the potential loss of millions of manufacturing jobs that they are willing to threaten the use of military force to assert a sphere of influence that will capture most of the off-shore oil and gas drilling rights in the East and South China seas. Facing U.S.-Japan and U.S.-South Korea security agreements, China is employing tools like the ADIZ to force regional competitors to readjust their behavior in light of China’s ambitions and naval heft.

China’s confrontations may not be intended to lead to a clash, but when armed and dangerous nations play chicken with modern weapons, the risk of a military miscalculation and accidental war accelerates."

Anything With War In The Title We Are So There' (VIDEO),"Original post HERE.

Bill Maher had a rather prescient “New Rules” closing monologue on Saturday. Many Conservatives and Right Wingers are likely to be very upset inasmuch as there is a lot of truth to his statements on America’s war acumen.

Maher admonished Kim Jong-un, the young Korean dictator to be careful. After-all, America is winding down its war in Afghanistan and will be without a major war for the first time in more than a decade. Following is the transcript from a few snippets of his monologue. The video follows as well.

[Best of Mill Maher’s “New Rules Monologue”] I am not worried about him. But I do worry about America’s military industrial complex using any excuse to ramp up the war machine again. Be careful Mr. Kim. I know threatening the US is fun, but the reason it could bite you in the ass is with Afghanistan winding down America is now dangerously close to not having a war…. Come on. We are the war people. We don’t need a lot of encouragement… Preemptive war, just war, wars of choice, wars of liberation, drug wars, wars we put on the credit card, anything with war in the title we are so there. We fought Mexico steal Texas, Spain to steal the Philippines, and the Indians because no one had invented Iraq yet. … Just in my lifetime, we have invaded Vietnam, Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Panama, Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Iraq again. That’s when you know you are war mongers when some countries are coming up twice. … However if you type “wars involving the US” into Wikipedia, the list is 32 pages long. At some point don’t you have to look in the mirror and say maybe it’s me? … America needs to start defining peace as strength. … You know who the role model for every president should be? Jimmy Carter. Because he is the one out of all of them who figured out how to sit in office for four years and never fire a shot.

It is high time that someone acknowledges the basic decency and strength through diplomacy of President Jimmy Carter. For too long, while greatly admired throughout the world, Americans have allowed the Right to disparage Carter.

Maher is correct; working towards peace is the ultimate display of strength. Choosing war is easy. Choosing war means telling the many companies that comprise the military industrial complex yes. Choosing war means using the fog of war as Bush did, to convince a citizenry to give up their civil liberties (e.g. the Patriot Act). Choosing war means having a ready-made excuse for all domestic failures that are then generally falsely attributed to war.

President Eisenhower’s January 17th, 1961 farewell address remains relative to this day. The following paragraphs within the speech were likely the most important and are what we have summarily ignored.

[source] In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.

Inasmuch as Bill Maher is funny and his monologue is funny, his statements more now than ever should give us pause. As we are beginning our path to a warless time, we can hear the drumbeats of our corporate controlled media attempting to instigate the type of disproportional hype that makes yet another war plausible. How else can one explain a suspiciously timed release of the Reuters piece “'Speculative' Pentagon Report On North Korea's Nuclear Missile Capability Sparks Fear As Officials Urge Skepticism”.

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

(CNN) —

Despite the many differences I had with former President George W. Bush on a range of public policy issues, or as he called them, “decision points,” I found common ground with him in one area, simply because we decided to put aside partisanship and do something good.

Hurricane Katrina’s devastation and the bungled rescue efforts are seared in the national memory. Bush’s “heckuva job” remark turned into a byword for government incompetence and public distrust. The shallowness of it coming at such a terrible and low point left deep wounds that are still healing. That was what it was.

JUSTIN LAROSE/cnn

But rather than rehash all that went wrong, I want to share what I believe to have been President Bush’s determination to follow up on commitments, and the intense, personal, dedicated efforts he made to revive and restore people’s futures. I know what I’m talking about.

Bush 43: ‘History will ultimately judge’

Kathleen Blanco, Louisiana’s governor in 2005, asked me to serve on the state’s commission overseeing the long-term recovery from the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. I’ve kept a close watch over the last eight years.

Hurricane Katrina wasn’t one natural disaster: It was a triple whammy of water, winds and lawlessness. An Army Corps engineer on CBS talked this week about Midwest flooding: “Water is the perfect instrument of destruction,” he said. He is so right: Katrina’s waters laid waste to an area the size of Great Britain. Its winds reached 174 mph and, together, they took 1,833 lives.

Every member of my family was displaced by Katrina. Last year, I lost both my father and sister. But I had them with me that much longer because they were rescued from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. My father, Lionel, left New Orleans only two times in his life. The first was to serve his country in Korea. The second was when FEMA evacuated him to San Antonio, Texas.

How will history remember George W. Bush?

My older sister, Sheila – people sometimes thought we were twins, we looked so much alike – was in an assisted care home. Sheila developed a brain tumor in childhood. Brain surgery left her needing help, although she still managed to finish high school and college. When FEMA officials told me it might be weeks before we found Sheila, I was furious.

CNN’s Wolf Blitzer made a public plea for nearby citizens to see if the residents had survived. Eddie Rodriguez of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, and our cousin, Keith, a cop, rescued her from the building’s rooftop. Most other residents had left before her. Sheila wouldn’t leave until she saw someone she knew. Like so many others, she was relocated to Baton Rouge.

Bitterness can corrode the soul. A grudge is like the chains on Marley’s ghost. Donna Brazile

My 92-year-old great uncle Henry, a WWII vet, was plucked from another rooftop and transported to Roswell, Georgia, only to suffer a heart attack. All seven of my remaining siblings, my father, uncle, aunts, and other relatives, lost everything in Katrina. I was upset – mad as hell – and disappointed But, I made a decision not to act out – act against Bush – but rather to turn to his administration for help, and to offer my help.

“Mr. President,” I said, “how can I help you?”

“Civility,” he said.

Opinion: Jury is still out on Bush

Bitterness can corrode the soul. A grudge is like the chains on Marley’s ghost. We can carry these chains in life and they weigh us down. President Obama and former President Bush have been working for eight years to change the atmosphere in Washington, to get Congress to move beyond pride and party.

So far, not even disasters or tragedies that have united the American people – Hurricane Sandy, Sandy Hook, and Boston – have moved the politicians. Not enough, anyway.

Bush understood the need for civility. I joined him despite my frustration because the need was too great for finger-pointing and blame-making. Donna Brazile

Bush understood the need for civility. I joined him despite my frustration because the need was too great for finger-pointing and blame-making. He flew to New Orleans and addressed the nation: “Tonight I also offer this pledge to the American people: Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes. We will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives.”

Glimpse at a White House before everything changed

George W. Bush was good as his word. He visited the Gulf states 17 times; went 13 times to New Orleans. Laura Bush made 24 trips. Bush saw that $126 billion in aid was sent to the Gulf’s residents, as some members of his own party in Congress balked.

Bush put a special emphasis on rebuilding schools and universities. He didn’t forget African-Americans: Bush provided $400 million to the historically black colleges, now integrated, that remain a pride, and magnet for African-American students. Laura Bush, a librarian, saw to it that thousands of books ruined by the floods were replaced. To this day, there are many local libraries with tributes devoted to her efforts.

It was a team effort. I’m glad to report the commission I served on went out-of-business in 2010. I’m also grateful and proud to report that President Bush was one of the leaders, and a very important member, of that team. Our recovery can be credited to the civility and tireless efforts of President Bush and other Americans, who united and worked together to help rebuild the Gulf and the place of my birth, New Orleans.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/08/Mandela-s-Funeral-is-Hillary-Clinton-s-Moment,2013-12-08 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],Mandela's Funeral Is Hillary Clinton's Moment,"President Barack Obama will be visiting South Africa for the second time this year to attend Nelson Mandela’s memorial services. So, too will all other living past U.S. presidents–including Jimmy Carter, who worked with Mandela after the latter retired from politics, and George W. Bush, who did more for Africa than any other but is probably appreciated least. And then there is Bill Clinton, who remains South Africa’s favorite U.S. president–more so even than Obama, who is viewed as a disappointment. Politically, crudely, this is Hillary’s moment.

South Africans love Clinton partly because he happened to be in power when their country made its historic transition. He was there to welcome South Africa back into the international community, and he was there to welcome President Mandela as a fellow world leader. Clinton was also, back then, the “first black president,” and charmed the South African public with the same folksy manner he used to build his political coalition. He was different, too, from other Democrats, seeing potential in globalization, looking for friends rather than foes.

Clinton matched the Mandela mood. Obama, by contrast, has much more in common with Mandela’s successor, Thabo Mbeki, whose top-down leadership, aloof manner, and cronyism made him distinctly unpopular. Like Obama, Mbeki was thin-skinned and divisive, arrogant and jealous of sharing power with the other branches of government.A man who brooked no dissent within the ruling party, and who shunned the opposition, Mbeki left office before finishing his second term after being ousted as party leader by the populist Jacob Zuma.

Zuma has been sour on Obama ever since the Libya war. The South African government had maintained close ties with Muammar Gadhafi, dating back to the anti-apartheid struggle, and saw him as one of the continent’s few unifying figures, comical though he often was. Gadhafi had backed one of South Africa’s most important diplomatic projects, the African Union. His ouster was seen by the South African government as more of the same interventionism it had decried when Bush invaded Iraq. Obama, then, was seen as something of a sellout.

South Africans still like Obama and his family. They vastly prefer him to any of his Republican opponents, the more so as American conservatives get extremely bad press in South Africa (as they do in much of the social democratic world). But they also know a failure when they see one, and Obama’s failure in nearly every aspect of his presidency has not failed to make an impression. Clinton, by contrast, is remembered, mostly correctly, as having been a success. His America was a confident one, buoyed by prosperity and a post-Cold War glow.

I was once in the audience at a speech by Bill Clinton at the University of the Western Cape. I wore an American flag in my baseball cap, attracting hostile stares from some in the academic audience, for whom skepticism of the U.S. is fundamental intellectual principle. And yet as soon as Clinton reached the stage–looking tired and haggard, thin from months of dieting–the same people leapt to their feet in rapt applause. In his flaws, South Africans see their own failures. In his successes, they somehow see their hopes. He is the America they love.

Obama is the America of the South African elites, envious of America’s success and eager to see it more humble on the world stage. He says the right things about the need for government. He comes bearing gifts. But most South Africans are tired of Obama’s exhortations about transformation. They have heard the same from their own leaders for years. Bill Clinton knows how to bypass the dogma and go straight to the heart. He won over Israelis at Yitzchak Rabin’s funeral with: “Shalom, chaver. Goodbye, friend.” Expect something of an encore.

And expect Hillary Clinton to make the most of the moment. This is her chance, finally, to eclipse the man who beat her to the top with the help of a fawning media and disloyal superdelegates. This is her chance to overcome the spurious but effective charges of racism that the Obama campaign used against her to undermine her among black voters. She will know how to place herself in the media spotlight without seeming to have done so, and will make the best use of her husband’s popularity, the better to cast herself as his true American successor."

Pollak'],"New 'Apology Tour,' Same Old Result: Turkey Reneges on Israel Deal","President Barack Obama was once criticized for his “apology tour” around the globe, in which he bowed to Islamic leaders and admitted America’s faults. Now, he is making other western leaders apologize. In a surprise move before leaving Israel, President Obama encouraged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to apologize to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey for the death of nine Gaza flotilla activists in 2010.

The media hailed President Obama’s achievement, calling it a “diplomatic win” and a “diplomatic coup.” Netanyahu’s apology “resolved a bitter three-year dispute,” the New York Times reported, “handing the president a solid accomplishment.” According to the terms of the deal, Turkey and Israel were to restore normal diplomatic ties, and Turkey was to drop its sensational prosecutions of Israeli generals over the flotilla incident.

On Friday, the White House released a statement hailing “the restoration of positive relations” between Israel and Turkey as a result of Netanyahu’s apparently forced apology over the flotilla raid. A day later, however, Turkey appeared to renege on the deal, with Erdogan telling the Turkish press that it was too soon to send a new ambassador to Israel or to stop the show-trial prosecutions, despite President Obama’s assurances.

Turkey appears to have pocketed Israel’s apology and changed the terms of the deal–or else the deal was never what reporters were led to believe. Instead of a diplomatic “coup,” what President Obama appears to have achieved is the humiliation of an ally for the simple act of having defended itself from terrorism. The principle that the apology has established could have negative security implications for Israel and the U.S. as well.

The deaths occurred in 2010 aboard the Mavi Marmara, which was attempting to run a blockade that Israel has established around Gaza to prevent shipments of weapons and weapons-making material to Hamas and other terror groups. There were several other ships in the flotilla, which Israeli commandos stopped and boarded without incident. But passengers on the Mavi Marmara, who included radical Islamists, attacked the Israelis.

The flotilla was organized by a Turkish organization calling itself the Humanitarian Relief Foundation, or IHH. The IHH calls itself a charity but operates as a front for jihadists and has a record of providing logistical support to terrorists as well as accepting money from terrorist financiers. It enjoys the protection and support of Erdogan and his ruling party, who supported the flotilla and its goal of breaking the blockade of Hamas in Gaza.

Similar flotillas and marches have been organized by international anti-Israel activists, including former Obama associates (and domestic terrorists) Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dorhn, who led a “Freedom March” to Gaza in late December 2009. Israel already lets humanitarian aid and some commercial goods into Gaza, but restricts specific materials that can be used to build the kind of deadly rockets fired during President Obama’s visit.

Relations with Turkey are important to Israel. The two once enjoyed close security ties, and both are concerned about the civil war in Syria and Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Yet the Erdogan government has been steering Turkey in an Islamist direction, which includes hostility to Israel. That policy was not appeased by Netanyahu’s apology. Instead, the apology appears to have indicated to Erdogan that he can press for more concessions.

It is possible that Netanyahu may have agreed to apologize in exchange for support by President Obama for a potential pre-emptive strike on Iran. Regardless, it is clear that he would not have apologized without Obama’s involvement. In September 2011, Netanyahu flatly refused to apologize to Turkey for actions taken in self-defense, saying: “We do not need to apologize for working to defend our children, our citizens and our cities.”

It is now becoming equally clear that the gesture now described as a “diplomatic coup” by President Obama was anything but. The apology was merely a capitulation that is being celebrated by Hamas as well as Turkey, with Hamas calling it the first step to “ending the political and economic blockade.” What the New York Times called “a win-win for all sides” now looks like a win for radical Islam and terror at Israel and the West’s expense."

Thousands of citizens, virtually all of them Sunni Muslims, have been gathering in public squares to protest the oppressive Shiite-led government in Baghdad. Sleeping in tents and wielding Twitter feeds and YouTube accounts, the young Sunnis have attempted to take democracy, and a certain sectarian disaffection, into their own hands.

It's not quite the Iraqi Arab Spring -- although that's what it's been tentatively called by some -- but it is a reminder of the stark failure of nearly a decade of American-led warfare in that country.

When President George W. Bush announced the invasion into Iraq in March 2003, the goal was to remove a dangerous dictator and his supposed stocks of weapons of mass destruction. It was also to create a functioning democracy and thereby inspire what Bush called a ""global democracy revolution.""

The effort was supposed to be cheap -- to require few troops and even less time. Instead, it cost the United States $800 billion at least, thousands of lives and nearly nine grueling years (see the graphic below for a further breakdown of various costs).

The toll on the people of Iraq were even greater. A decade of war left chaos and impoverishment, hundreds of thousands of citizens dead and millions more displaced, and a vicious sectarianism that still threatens to rip the country apart at the seams. The government of Nouri al-Maliki, which has reportedly interfered with independent government bureaucracies and ordered the arrest of his Sunni vice president on trumped-up terrorism charges, often rules in a manner more befitting the autocrat the U.S. invaded to remove.

""Here is a country that's being liberated,"" proclaimed Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld a few days into the invasion, even as the first signs of the chaos to come began to stir. ""Here are people that are going from being repressed and held under the thumb of a vicious dictator, and they're free.""

Instead, today in Fallujah, the site of two of the war's largest and most devastating military campaigns, the very best that can be said is that two years late to the party -- not 10 years early -- the Arab Spring has arrived. But the government the people are rising up against is the very one the U.S. installed.

What does it mean to say that the war in Iraq was a wasted effort? Last month, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction filed a final report that found $8 billion of U.S. development aid had been ""wasted outright,"" in the words of Wired magazine.

But nearly eight times as much money -- $60 billion -- was spent rebuilding the country on the whole, with very little to show for it.

And more than 10 times that amount -- $800 billion -- was spent on the mission overall, a boondoggle that left more than 4,000 American service members dead, 32,000 more wounded, and an authoritarian government in place that is little better -- and possibly, owing to its closer ties to Iran, worse -- than the one that was taken out.

Was any of that money wasted? Was any of it not?"

Newser

A jarring report out of North Korea claims that Kim Jong Un's former girlfriend was executed by a firing squad last week.

Chosun Ilbo,an English language newspaper in South Korea, said unnamed sources in China told it that Hyon Song Wol (of ""Excellent Horse-Like Lady"" fame) was arrested on Aug. 17 along with about a dozen others; Hyon was a singer, and a number of the others were members of the Unhasu Orchestra.

They were accused of making a sex tape and selling it and were shot three days later for violating the country's pornography laws. A source said some allegedly had Bibles in their possession, and all were treated as political dissidents.

The report has not been independently verified by other media outlets. Chosun Ilbo is one of Seoul's main daily newspapers.

Chosun Ilbo said it is unclear if Kim's wife had anything to do with the deaths; before becoming the spouse of the ""dear leader"" she was also in that same orchestra. Kim had reportedly known Hyon for about 10 years, and their relationship ended at the orders of Kim Jong Il, though rumors have persisted that the two were having an affair.

New York magazine said that while it's difficult to verify reports like these, the fact that it's one of South Korea's main daily papers reporting it lends it a sliver of believability.

USA TODAY

Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu says Jerusalem will never be divided

Palestinian Authority%27s Abbas wants East Jerusalem for a capital

Proposals range from divine sovereignty to tunnels

As Israeli and Palestinian negotiators prepare for preliminary talks in Washington on Monday, the future of Jerusalem looms as the thorniest and most difficult issue to resolve.

The State Department announced Sunday that the two sides had accepted invitations from Secretary of State John Kerry to come to Washington ""to formally resume direct final status negotiations."" The department said two days of initial meetings will begin Monday evening.

U.S. officials say Secretary of State John Kerry will name former U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk to shepherd the peace talks. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly before the announcement, say Kerry would name Indyk Monday at the State Department.

Kerry's announcement of negotiations came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet approved the release of 104 Palestinian prisoners, a key part of the Kerry-brokered deal.

Netanyahu has said Jerusalem — which Israel unified in the 1967 Six-Day War and claims as its capital — is the heart of the Jewish nation and will never be divided.

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas says there can be no agreement and no end to the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis without a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem, home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the last remnants of the Jews' Second Temple and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.

""Jerusalem will be a huge problem"" to overcome for any final agreement, says Aaron David Miller, a former adviser on Arab-Israeli peace negotiations to Democratic and Republican secretaries of State. ""Down the road, (talks) will fail if Jerusalem is not resolved.""

Miller says the parties will tackle other issues first, such as borders and security, to build trust and confidence on both sides before moving to more difficult ""identity issues"" such as Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and a demand by Netanyahu that Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish homeland.

Before announcing that Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed to meet on resuming talks, Kerry obtained a pledge from Qatar that it would sweeten an Arab proposal initially put forward by Saudi Arabia in 2002 that offered Israel peace with 22 Arab nations and 35 Muslim nations if it returned all lands it seized in 1967 and agreed to a ""just solution"" for Palestinian refugees.

Under Qatar's new proposal, the Gulf state said border disputes between Israelis and Palestinians could be solved through land swaps. The Qatari statement meant that Arab states would endorse a compromise on Jewish settlements in the West Bank.

In the 46 years since Israel took control of the land there, it has built Jewish neighborhoods in and around East Jerusalem, and cities in the West Bank that Netanyahu and previous Israeli leaders have pledged to retain in any future deal. How much of the West Bank Israel would retain is yet to be decided, but Israel is expected to compensate Palestinians with territory from territory that was considered part of Israel before 1967, Miller says.

The two sides will also have to agree on security, including what kinds of weapons a Palestinian military would be allowed to have, whether a new Palestinian state could sign defense treaties with other nations and whether Israel could maintain its military presence in the Jordan River Valley, which separates the West Bank from Jordan.

Hussein Ibish, a senior fellow at the American Task Force on Palestine, predicts agreement on such issues is achievable because security is a prerequisite for economic development and is in the Palestinians' self-interest. However, compromise on the fate of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees scattered across the Arab world and on the Palestinian claim to Jerusalem will be much harder, Ibish says.

Ibish says Palestinians will have to accept that refugees and their descendants who've lived for decades without full citizenship in other nations will never be allowed to return to the homes they left. Their numbers would outnumber the Jewish population, which Israel would never accept, Ibish says.

On Jerusalem, however, there will either be a compromise or no deal, he says.

Competing claims on the land are most intense in the Temple Mount-Haram al Sharif area and the stone-paved 1-square-kilometer area of Jerusalem's Old City. But Jewish neighborhoods and construction in and around East Jerusalem have given rise to various creative solutions for resolving the riddle of how two people can share the same place:

• Palestine or Israel could have exclusive sovereignty over individual areas of the Holy Basin and the Old City. However, Ibish says such an option is not viable because neither side will trust the other, and the city has to somehow operate as a municipality with shared transportation, electrical grid and other services.

• Another option is shared sovereignty or some kind of international administration for the Holy Basin, where it would be managed by a United Nations committee headed by a party agreed to by both sides.

• A light-rail system along the border of Israel and the West Bank boundary of the new Palestine could include train stops that would incorporate border crossings from one side to another. A sketch of this notion was reportedly put on the table during 2008 negotiations between Abbas and then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.

Edward Djerejian, U.S. ambassador to Israel from 1992 to 1995 under President Clinton, has made fresh proposals of his own as director of the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Texas. The two sides will have to agree upon a unified city that serves as a capital for two states and has joint municipal planning for shared systems such as the electrical grid and transportation, Djerejian says.

""At the end of the day, it is going to be intermingled in many ways,"" and it would be a first arrangement of its kind in the world, he says. ""I can't think of another city where that pertains."""

The Afghan president signaled he was not prepared to sign the agreement during a meeting with U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice. According to the White House, he outlined ""new conditions"" for signing it, just days after a tentative deal had been reached.

The White House said Monday that Rice responded by saying this would mean the U.S. would then start planning to pull out all its forces after 2014, adding that a signed agreement is necessary to plan for thousands of troops to stay in the country to train and mentor Afghan security forces to face the Taliban.

""Without a prompt signature, the U.S. would have no choice but to initiate planning for a post-2014 future in which there would be no U.S. or NATO troop presence in Afghanistan,"" she told the Afghan president.

Their meeting in Kabul came the day after Karzai's surprise decision to ignore Sunday's recommendation by an Afghan assembly of dignitaries to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement, a refusal that cast doubt on whether American and allied troops would remain in Afghanistan to train Afghan forces after most foreign troops withdraw next year.

More On This...

According to Karzai's office, he told Rice during Monday's meeting that he wouldn't back down from that decision, deferring it to whoever succeeds him as president in April elections.

Karzai announced his decision at a gathering of 2,500 tribal elders and regional leaders known as a Loya Jirga, even though the council not only overwhelmingly approved the deal after a four-day meeting but urged him to sign it by Dec. 31.

Washington has asked him to change his mind. But the mercurial Karzai, in the meeting with Rice, says he laid out a series of new demands -- albeit ones mostly involving steps the U.S. has already said it would take.

One new demand was that the United States should address a suggestion by the Loya Jirga that all Afghan prisoners be released from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

According to the statement, Karzai ""said the United States of America should respond to the suggestion mentioned in the resolution of the Loya Jirga to free all the Afghan prisoners in Guantanamo.""

There are nearly 20 Afghans currently being held at the American facility in Cuba.

Karzai's office said that in the meeting with Rice, he also asked for further assurances from the United States that its forces will not raid Afghan homes and that America express a sincere commitment to help start stalled peace talks with the Taliban. He also reiterated his demand that the United States commit to holding free and transparent elections on April 5.

The statement further added that Karzai asked Rice to convey his concerns about the raids and peace talks to President Barack Obama so that he can ""give assurances regarding the issues to the Afghan people.""

Obama has already addressed the issue of raids in a letter to Karzai last week that was read to the assembly.

In it, Obama assured Karzai that under the agreement, the U.S. will continue to respect ""Afghan sovereignty."" He also said the U.S. military will not conduct raids on homes except under ""extraordinary circumstances"" involving urgent risks to U.S. nationals.

The US has repeatedly urged Karzai to sign a deal that would allow about 8,000 American troops to stay in the country beyond a 2014 withdrawal deadline.

The two-term Afghan leader has insisted that the winner of an April 5 election to succeed him should be the one to sign the deal. More than $8 billion in annual funds for Afghanistan's fledgling security forces and development assistance also are at stake.

Karzai may be concerned about his legacy, worried he might be seen as responsible for an agreement that some Afghans will likely see as selling out to foreign interests.

Karzai's statement said that Rice told the Afghan president that the U.S. was committed to transparent elections that will be held on time and without interference as prescribed by Afghan law.

It added that Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the top U.S. and coalition commander, told Karzai he had ordered his troops ""to act according to the security agreement and suggestions of the consultative Loya Jirga.""

But is also said Rice did not provide a commitment on the peace talks.

Karzai has blamed the United States for the collapse of talks that were to be held at a Taliban office in the Gulf State of Qatar.

The Taliban office, which opened in Doha last June after talks between the United States and Qatar, closed after Karzai accused the religious movement of trying to set up a government-in-exile by identifying its office as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

A furious Karzai told the Loya Jirga delegates on Sunday that Obama had promised him the Taliban would not open an embassy.

Rice met with Karzai at the end of a previously unannounced three-day trip to Afghanistan to visit U.S. troops and civilians for the Thanksgiving holidays, the White House said, adding that the meeting was at Karzai's request. Her spokesman, Patrick Ventrell, said the meeting was the last stop on her trip.

Karzai, who had convened the Loya Jirga, complicated the debate by announcing on the opening day that he wanted delegates to endorse the deal but he would not sign it.

He repeated that stance Sunday laying down a series of ill-defined conditions and promising to continue negotiations with the United States. They included demands that America ensure peace in a country that has been at war for more than 12 years and guarantee transparent elections.

Karzai, who is constitutionally barred from running in the upcoming presidential vote, also accused the United States of meddling in the 2009 elections, which were marred by fraud, and said he wanted to keep that from happening again.

Even if the president changes his mind and signs the document, it still must be approved by the Afghan parliament, then finally signed into law by Karzai.

Despite unexpected progress in last week’s nuclear talks, U.S. and European governments face a difficult path to a possible deal with Iran, U.S. officials and experts warn, as politics and a deep-seated mistrust on both sides threaten to scuttle even the modest gains made so far.

Only days after negotiations that Iran hailed as a possible “turning point” in the nuclear crisis, diplomats and analysts offered a sober assessment of the obstacles to a genuine breakthrough, including factional fighting inside Iran over whether to agree to limits on Iran’s nuclear program.

New evidence of the internal debate surfaced Friday when Iranian leaders issued conflicting statements about the negotiations and whether Iran should ever accede to nuclear restrictions. A powerful conservative cleric staunchly defended Iran’s “inalienable right” to nuclear energy during Friday prayer services in Tehran, saying no country could dictate the amount or types of enriched uranium Iran produced.

“Any proposal which denies the people their rights is dismissed by the nation, and no official has the right to compromise in this regard,” said Hojjatoleslam Kazem Seddiqi, a senior cleric who is considered close to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s supreme leader.

Negotiators from Iran and six world powers met for two days in Almaty, Kazakhstan, last week in the first direct talks on Iran’s nuclear program in eight months. The negotiations, which began amid low expectations, ended Wednesday with an agreement to expand the talks in the coming weeks to include technical consultations and another round of formal negotiations in April.

The six-nation bloc — the United States, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia — attempted to break a months-long impasse with a new proposal that offered Iran partial relief from economic sanctions while showing new flexibility on demands that Iran restrict parts of its nuclear program.

The proposals drew a favorable response from Iranian diplomats in Almaty and from other prominent officials immediately after the talks adjourned. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi, an MIT-trained engineer widely regarded as a moderate, said the nuclear negotiations were “on the right track and moving in the right direction.”

“Our case is neither like North Korea’s nor Libya’s,” Salehi said in an interview broadcast in Iran on Friday evening. “It will be resolved. . . . We have nothing to hide and we have always been clean.”

Obama administration officials on Friday continued to applaud Almaty’s surprising, if modest, turnaround, with one senior official calling the talks “constructive.”

“I don’t want to overpromise, but we’re encouraged,” said the official, speaking to reporters accompanying Secretary of State John F. Kerry during a visit to Europe. “Our people who were there felt the sanctions have gotten Iran’s attention,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe diplomatically sensitive negotiations.

U.S. officials also said that Iran has not formally responded to the Almaty proposal or agreed to shut down a single centrifuge. Current and former administration officials cited a decade-long history of disappointments and setbacks in previous efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran.

“Iran has a long track record for feints, misdirection and failure to deliver,” said Clifford Kupchan, a former State Department official and Middle East analyst for the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm.

Most recently, Iran made a diplomatic about-face in the summer after appearing to agree to a deal with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Officials for the U.N. nuclear watchdog announced in June that Iran had decided to allow access to military facilities where its scientists are suspected of having conducted secret nuclear research. But before the negotiators could work out details, the Iranians changed their minds.

Such episodes have fueled suspicions that Iran is using diplomacy as a stalling tactic. Conservative U.S. lawmakers and think tanks already have begun criticizing the proposed concessions that negotiators offered in Almaty, arguing that it’s too early to talk about easing the pressure of sanctions on Iran.

Of particular concern to administration critics is a reported offer to lift sanctions that prohibit Iran from exchanging its oil for gold and other precious metals. Iran already faces massive restrictions on oil sales, including a boycott on oil imports to Europe. U.S. officials declined to discuss details of the confidential proposal.

“Allowing Iran to resume trade in gold would drive a significant hole through our financial sanctions and undermine our efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability,” Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) said in a statement.

Other analysts argued that concessions were necessary for any chance of diplomatic success.

“The arguments being made are politically convenient, but they simply are not realistic,” said Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. “Everyone should be wanting tangible results instead of holding on to positions that won’t get us any closer to eliminating the most important proliferation risks.”

Bolivian state politician Domingo Alcibia Rivera was allegedly caught on camera raping an unconscious woman on the floor of the provincial Assembly of Chuquisaca.

The security video, uploaded to YouTube -- be warned, it is disturbing -- shows an unconscious woman get placed on a chair in an empty room. A man, identified by local media as Alcibia Rivera, then enters the room and cuts the lights.

Through the blurry images, it appears that he then removes the woman from the chair and rapes her on the floor. When the lights turn back on -- apparently because someone tried to enter the room -- the man hops up and the woman appears to move. The lights then turn back off and the man appears to pull up his pants and return the woman to a chair.

People return to the room to check on the woman. Toward the end of the video, when she tries to stand up, she falls to the floor.

The video was reportedly taken on Dec. 20, after a holiday party at which Rivera and others allegedly drank too much. After being posted on YouTube, local news stations ran with the story this week, and it later appeared on international news sites including Spain’s ABC and the U.S. blog Jezebel.

Alcibia Rivera, who belongs to the governing Movement Toward Socialism (MAS, in Spanish) denies wrongdoing and says he’ll cooperate with an investigation, according to Bolivian daily La Razón.

“They’re saying that is was rape, but that wasn’t rape,” Alcibia Rivera said, according to La Razón.

MAS’s ethics committee kicked Alcibia out of the party, along with legislator Javier Humana, who was involved in the incident. The allegations drew condemnation from Bolivian President Evo Morales, who said Alcibia Rivera had committed a “serious error.”

Bolivian prosecutors say they’ll take action against local media for showing the video, saying it endangers the victim."

(CNN) —

In 1980, Nelson Mandela was sitting in a South African prison cell, serving a life sentence.

On the other side of the world, a young college student named Barack Obama was riveted by the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa and the brewing crusade to free the renowned activist.

Little did they know that nearly three decades later, the two would have something in common: They would be the first elected black presidents in their respective countries.

U.S. President Barack Obama has made it no secret that he considers Nelson Mandela one of the greatest influences – if not the greatest – in his life and in the lives of countless others. Throughout his first five years in office, he has repeatedly referenced Mandela, either invoking quotes from the anti-apartheid icon or spreading his messages of freedom and equality.

“We have lost one of the most influential, courageous, and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this earth,” the President said Thursday while marking Mandela’s death. “He no longer belongs to us – he belongs to the ages.”

Left and right use Mandela’s death as opportunity to bash their favorite bogeymen

Answering a ‘call’

At Occidental College in Los Angeles around 1980, Obama first forayed into political activism — a protest against apartheid. It was the beginning of what would become years of studying Mandela’s speeches and writings.

“In the most modest of ways, I was one of those people who tried to answer his call,” he wrote in the forward to Mandela’s 2010 memoir “Conversations with Myself.”

Obama has acknowledged that none of the obstacles he faced growing up compared to those of the victims in South Africa, but Mandela’s “example helped awaken (Obama) to the wider world,” he wrote in the forward.

“Through his choices, Mandela made it clear that we did not have to accept the world as it is – that we could do our part to seek the world as it should be,” he added.

In his own book, “Dreams of my Father,” Obama recalls giving his first public speech, in which he made a plea for the trustees at Occidental to divest from South Africa.

“I really wanted to stay up there, to hear my voice bouncing off the crowd and returning back to me in applause.”

Following his involvement with the demonstrations, Obama began pursuing his interests in public policy, transferring to Columbia University where he dug deep into books and courses about race and social justice. After graduation, he became a community organizer in Chicago.

Making history

When Mandela was released from prison in 1990, Obama was well into law school at Harvard and getting ready to start the next phase of his career.

Mandela’s funeral, farewell plans: a day by day breakdown

That same month, Obama made history of his own — though on a much smaller scale. He became the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review, a story big enough to elicit a headline in the New York Times.

In his interview with the Times, Obama said, ”I personally am interested in pushing a strong minority perspective. I’m fairly opinionated about this,” he said. “But as president of the law review, I have a limited role as only first among equals.”

Four years after graduating law school, and not long after Mandela won a Nobel Peace Prize and was elected president, Obama published “Dreams of my Father” in 1995. In the memoir, he lumped Mandela in with a group of men whose attributes Obama aspired to emulate.

“It was into my father’s image, a black man, son of Africa, that I’d packed all the attributes I sought in myself, the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, DuBois and Mandela,” he wrote.

A year later, Obama was elected to the Illinois state Senate, a path that would set him on a fast-moving track that landed him a spot on the presidential ballot just 12 years later.

’A personal hero’

As Obama made his way up the political ladder, Mandela was continuing to spread his influence, campaigning for justice and human rights around the world. He didn’t seek reelection in 1999 – keeping his promise to serve only one term – and he became intimately involved with AIDS awareness, a disease that killed his son at the age of 55 in 2005.

Obama met Mandela for the first time in 2005. Obama, a senator at the time, was riding to a Washington event when his office called; Mandela was in town and asked to see him. The two men met at the Four Seasons Hotel.

Obama: Mandela was influential, courageous

After that, Obama and Mandela had occasional interactions and conversations, including a phone call from Mandela after Obama was elected president in 2008. Obama called Mandela in 2010 after his great-granddaughter was killed in a car crash.

While Obama considered Mandela a champion, he frequently noted he was not alone in his views about the icon.

“He’s a personal hero, but I don’t think I’m unique in that regard,” he said in Senegal. “I think he’s a hero for the world.”

During his first year in the Oval Office, Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize – a decision that sparked controversy, considering that his career on the world stage was only at its infancy at that point.

Obama was keenly aware of where he stood in line.

“Compared to some of the giants of the history who’ve received this prize, Schweitzer and King, Marshall and Mandela, my accomplishments are slight,” he said in his acceptance speech, also paying tribute to those who were suffering in their respective fights for freedom and justice around the world. “I cannot argue with those who find these men and women – some known, some obscure to all but those they help – to be far more deserving of this honor than I.”

’That’s what brings me back here’

On a trip to Africa this summer, Obama and his family visited Mandela’s cell on Robben Island, a spot Obama visited as a senator in 2006. But this time, he got to bring his two daughters, Sasha and Malia.

Life under apartheid: demeaning, often brutal

“For me to be able to bring my daughters there and teach them the history of that place and this country … that’s a great privilege and a great honor,” Obama told students at the University of Cape Town in June.

With Mandela gravely ill, Obama did not get to visit him during his trip; he met with Mandela’s family instead. While in South Africa, Obama noted the “outpouring of love” for Mandela, saying it spoke to “the yearning for justice and dignity that transcends boundaries of race and class and faith and country.”

“That’s what Nelson Mandela represents,” he said at a town hall-style meeting with young people in Soweto. “That’s what South Africa, at its best, can represent to the world, and that’s what brings me back here.”

It's bad news for the much-maligned senator.

The Deloitte auditors reviewed Wallin's $532,508 in total travel expenses from January 2009 to September 2012 and found that at least $121,348 of that was falsely claimed. The inappropriate expenses included trips for personal, private business and partisan purposes.

[ Related: Should Pamela Wallin face criminal charges? ]

The Senate committee also released a report outlining the penalties layed out against Wallin.

Here are some of the highlights from that report.

- Wallin to pay back approximately $121,348 plus interest in improperly claimed expenses - Wallin’s travel is now restricted to only direct or immediate connecting flights between Ottawa and her home province of Saskatchewan - All other travel must be pre-approved by Senate administration - All her expenses will be closely scrutinized for 1 year - The audit report will be forwarded to the RCMP

[ Related: Senator Pamela Wallin vows to repay over $120k but calls audit process flawed and unfair ]

Liberal Senator George Furey and Conservative Senator Gerald Comeau — the two members of the committee who spoke to media upon the audit's release — were vague about why exactly the document was going to the RCMP.

Furey said the audit was being forwarded to the Mounties ""because of matters we found troubling.""

The committee's report shed a little more light on the matter.

""The unusual pattern that required examination related to frequent stopovers in Toronto, where Sen. Wallin maintains a residence,"" the report read.

“Where these stopovers had evidence of parliamentary business or were made to avoid a late arrival at (her) final destination, Deloitte deemed the claims as appropriate; where assessed as not having such business, the incremental costs of stopovers have been designated as reimbursable.

""Other travel claims were deemed reimbursable in their entirety.""

Story continues

Wallin now becomes the fourth Senator — in addition to Mike Duffy, Patrick Brazeau and Mac Harb — whose expenses are being reviewed or investigated by the RCMP.

[ Related: What’s in store for Senators Duffy, Harb and Brazeau? ]

In a prepared statement on Monday, Wallin said that she would pay back all the money — with interest — but called the audit process flawed and unfair.

""It is my view that this report is the result of a fundamentally flawed and unfair process. When appointed to the Senate in 2009, I was determined to be an activist senator. One who saw it as her job to advance causes that are important to Canadians. When invited to appear publicly and speak on subjects including the role of women in public life, our mission in Afghanistan, support of our troops, I saw it as my duty to accept whenever I was able to do so. Travel to these public speeches and appearances was, and is, in my continuing view, a legitimate Senate expense. Deloitte has wrongly, in my view and in the opinion of my lawyers, applied the 2012 changes made to the Senators' travel policy retroactively. The result is that travel expenses which were approved and paid by Senate finance in 2009, in 2010, in 2011, have, in a number of cases, now been disallowed. The basis for this latter decision is apparently some arbitrary and undefined sense of what constitutes of Senate business or common Senate practice.""

Comeau dismissed Wallin's remarks saying that Senate rules have always been the same but that they were only clarified in June of 2012.

[ Related: RCMP seek Duffy's personal banking, credit card records ]

In response to the audit release, the NDP released this statement taking a shot at Wallin and her ties to the Tories.

Of course we look forward to seeing the entire audit. But based on reports so far, these are more troubling revelations about hundreds of thousands in improper expense claims. Stephen Harper and his ministers claimed they looked at Pamela Wallin’s expenses and found no problems. Now we find out that Conservatives were misleading Canadians about Ms. Wallin’s actions and Conservative Senators were campaigning on the public dime. Canadians know they can't trust Conservatives or Liberals to clean up the many ethical scandals in the Senate.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/03/ap-stylebook-drops-illegal-immigrants-from-its-manual/,2013-04-03 00:00:00,[],Associated Press under scrutiny for nixing term 'illegal immigrant' from Stylebook,"The Associated Press is being accused of trying to influence the immigration debate following a decision to stop using the term ""illegal immigrant"" in its coverage -- despite the fact it is still being used by U.S. government officials including Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.

The decision comes as a bipartisan group of senators prepares to introduce sweeping immigration legislation which is expected to propose a pathway to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants.

Indeed, the move by the influential wire service is being hailed as a victory by immigrant advocacy groups.

The conservative Media Research Center, though, described the change as a ""politically-correct mumble.""

The new style guideline was first announced this week on the wire service’s blog by Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll, who said the change came out of conversations with people who opposed the term.

“Our goal always is to use the most precise and accurate words so that the meaning is clear to any reader anywhere,” Carroll said.

“The Stylebook no longer sanctions the term ‘illegal immigrant’ or the use of ‘illegal’ to describe a person,” Carroll said. “Instead, it tells users that ‘illegal’ should describe only an action, such as living in or immigrating to a country illegally.”

Still, some are wondering why the AP decided to nix the phrase when high-ranking government officials don’t seem to have a problem with it.

Last week, Napolitano told reporters that she didn’t “really get caught up in the vocabulary wars.”

“They are immigrants who are here illegally, that’s an illegal immigrant,” she said.

Previously, the AP rejected the term “undocumented immigrants,” favored by some activists, as inaccurate.

Changes to the AP Stylebook, which is updated annually, have important and widespread repercussions in the media. The changes don't just influence the AP's writing, which is found in publications around the world. The book is the primary writing style guide for journalists in both print and broadcast.

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, a group of 27 House Democrats, applauded the AP’s decision and called it “a great step forward.”

On a more tongue-in-cheek note, ALIPAC announced Wednesday it would be changing its “style” preference in all future articles to ""illegal invaders"" -- ""in response to the totalitarian steps by the Associated Press to make 'illegal immigrants' disappear with the stroke of a pen just days before legislation attempting to do the same is expected to be filed in Washington, DC, by the 'Gang of 8.'""

Comedian Jay Leno joked that the phrase should be replaced with ""undocumented Democrat.""

The AP said its decision to stop using the term “illegal immigrants” is part of a broader shift away from labeling people and toward labeling behavior -- for example, referring to people “diagnosed with schizophrenia” instead of “schizophrenics.”

In 1986, the AP’s then-stylebook editor Christopher French used the same reasoning to support the wire service’s decision to use “anti-abortion” instead of “pro-life,” and abortion rights instead of “pro-abortion” or “pro-choice.”

“Until a specific rule is agreed upon at AP, the following existing guideline is being applied: Avoid labeling groups or individuals and instead spend an extra sentence on a more specific description,” French said at the time.

In February, it reversed a decision on gay marriage, saying people in same-sex marriages could now be referred to as “husbands” and “wives.”

Several news organizations are also dropping the term “illegal immigrant” from their reporting. CNN, ABC News and NBC News have all parted ways with the phrase in the past few years.

The debate on whether to change the term at The New York Times is still being debated, public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote in an article Tuesday.

“The Times, for the past couple of months, has also been considering changes to its stylebook entry on this term and will probably announce them to staff members this week,” she wrote.

“From what I can gather, The Times’s changes will not be nearly as sweeping as The AP’s,” Sullivan said, adding, “I would be surprised to see The Times ban the use of ‘illegal immigrant,’ as the AP has done.”"

Rand Paul (R-KY) said on Laura Ingraham’s radio program that House Speaker John Boehner’s speakership is in jeopardy if any form of amnesty, such as the Senate’s immigration reform bill, becomes law.

“I’m worried about conference,” Paul said Friday, according to Roll Call. “The only way to avoid a problem with conference is for the speaker of the House to say we are not going to conference, and we will not allow a vote on anything coming out of conference that resembles the Senate bill, and if there were a much more limited bill that emphasizes border security first, that we would do that.”

“Conference” refers to a legislative process wherein after the House passes its own immigration bill, it will enter negotiations with Senate leaders and even the White House to reconcile the differences between the two chambers’ bills. Conservative lawmakers fear that in conference, Boehner would allow Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to include a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the final law submitted to President Barack Obama.

Paul asserted that if Boehner passes anything like the Senate bill, conservatives in the House will more than likely drive him out of office.

“If he allows something to pass out of conference that looks anything like the Senate bill and is passed with a majority of Democrats, I think that will be the final thing he does as speaker,” Paul said. “So, I think he knows that, and I think he’s going to be very cautious, and I hope he will defend us on this and not pass something that looks like the Senate bill.”

Boehner has agreed that any bill, or conference committee report, that would be voted on would need the support of the majority of House Republicans before receiving a vote in the House. But Boehner has not agreed to kill the Senate bill once and for all by saying no House immigration bill, or group of bills, would be allowed to go to conference with it.

According to The Hill, House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), the GOP’s most recent vice presidential candidate who with Mitt Romney lost to President Obama almost a year ago, is working with the Chamber of Commerce to finalize a deal on immigration legislation."

This is from an article they published on Sunday, August 18, 2013:

U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in Libya’s Benghazi in 2012 when Islamist gunmen attacked the U.S. consulate during a protest by a mob angry over a film they said insulted the Prophet Mohammad.

This claim, first made by then-US Ambassador Susan Rice on all Sunday morning shows, has been debunked many times. Here are a few examples:

October 9, 2012 – Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick F. Kennedy said the attacks in Benghazi were a coordinated terrorist attack. They were planned and organized.

October 27, 2012 – Libyan witnesses said it was an organized attack.

December 19, 2012 – Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s Accountability Review Board released their report on Benghazi and never mentioned a protest or the YouTube video.

March 6, 2013 – Documents turned over by the administration show the Libyan officials knew an attack was going to happen and warned Washington, D.C.

May 8, 2013 – During the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Benghazi, Gregory Hicks testified the YouTube video was a non-issue in Libya. He said he was embarrassed and stunned when he saw Rice claim there was a protest over the video.

August 6, 2013 – CNN airs a Benghazi special and it also destroys the YouTube/protest narrative. Erin Burnett reported US Ambassador Christopher Stevens had to change his running route because terrorists posted it on the internet. He knew and warned DC many times an attack was going to happen. He requested extra security many times.

The YouTube video had nothing to do with the Benghazi attack. There was not a protest in Benghazi."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Hicks also reported that SOCAFRICA commander Lt. Col. Gibson and his team were prepared to board a C130 from Tripoli before the attack on the Benghazi annex. Gibson received a call saying “you can’t go now, you don’t have the authority to go now.’ And so they missed the flight … They were told not to board the flight, so they missed it.”

If a force had left Tripoli to head to Benghazi, Hicks said it might have saved the the lives of Ty Woods and Glen Doherty. Instead the attacks went unchallenged. He went on to surmise that the Libyans “would have split. They would have been scared to death that we would have gotten a laser on them and killed them.”

Below is an excerpt of the Hicks’ testimony released from the House Oversight Committee:

Q: But do you think, you know, if an F-15, if the military had allowed a jet to go fly over, that it might have prevented [the second attack]?

A: Yeah, and if we had gotten clearance from the Libyan military for an American plane to fly over Libyan airspace. The Libyans that I talked to and the Libyans and other Americans who were involved in the war have told me also that Libyan revolutionaries were very cognizant of the impact that American and NATO airpower had with respect to their victory. They are under no illusions that American and NATO airpower won that war for them. And so, in my personal opinion, a fast-mover flying over Benghazi at some point, you know, as soon as possible might very well have prevented some of the bad things that happened that night.

Q : The theory being, the folks on the ground that are doing these — committing these terrorist attacks look up, see a heavy duty airplane above, and decide to hightail it?

A: I believe that if — I believe if we had been able to scramble a fighter or aircraft or two over Benghazi as quickly as possible after the attack commenced, I believe there would not have been a mortar attack on the annex in the morning because I believe the Libyans would have split. They would have been scared to death that we would have gotten a laser on them and killed them.

Q: I just wanted to ask, you mentioned permission from the Libyans. Why is that important? What did you mean by that?

A: Well, it’s their country. And for an American military aircraft to fly over their country, we have to have permission from them to do so.

Q: So what would have been the risk of — do you think it would have been risky for us to send someone, do you think it would have been counterproductive for us to send a fighter pilot plane over Benghazi without that permission?

A: We would have certainly wanted to obtain that permission. I believe we would have gotten it if we had asked. I believe that the Libyans were hoping that we were going to come bail them out of this mess. And, you know, they were as surprised as we were that American — the military forces that did arrive only arrived on the evening of September 12. Yeah.

Q: So, at this point [at approximately 10:00 pm in Tripoli], you are talking to Washington, you are talking to your RSO Martinec, you are talking to RAO. Are you talking to the Defense Attache?

A: The Defense Attache is there, and he is immediately on the phone to Ministry of Defense and to chief of staff of the Libyan Armed Forces. He also notifies Joint Staff and AFRICOM. Our SOCAFRICA lead, Lieutenant Colonel Gibson, connects with SOCAFRICA in Stuttgart, as well. And, obviously, RAO is also connected back home.

Q: Was there ever any thought at that time of the night to have an F-16, you know, fly over?

A: I called — when we knew that — I talked with the Defense Attache, Lt. Col. Keith Phillips, and I asked him, “Is there anything coming?” And he said that the nearest fighter planes were Aviano, that he had been told that it would take two to three hours to get them airborne, but that there were no tanker assets near enough to support a flight from Aviano.

A: And for the second time that night [Before 5:15 AM attack], I asked the Defense Attache, is there anything coming, is there anything out there to help our people from, you know, big military? And the answer, again, was the same as before.

Q: And what was that answer?

A: The answer was, it’s too far away, there are no tankers, there is nothing, there is nothing that could respond.

Q: So you had mentioned that the first team from Tripoli to Benghazi arrived at 1:15?

A: Right.

Q: And was there a second team that was organized? Could you tell us about the second team?

A: Right. The second team — the Defense Attache worked assiduously all night long to try to get the Libyan military to respond in some way. Early in the morning — sorry, after we were formally notified by the Prime Minister, who called me, that Chris had passed, the Libyan military agreed to fly their C-130 to Benghazi and carry additional personnel to Benghazi as reinforcements. Because we at that time — at that time, the third attack, the mortar attack at 5:15, had not yet occurred, if I remember correctly.

Q: So what time did the second rescue team ??

A: Well, again, they flew — I think that flight took off sometime between 6:00 and 6:30 a.m.

Q: At that point, you are the Chief of Mission?

A: Yeah, I’m Chief of Mission effective 3:00 a.m.

Q: Now, did any of the Special Forces folks, were they planning at any time to travel on that second aircraft?

A: On the second, on the C-130? Yes. We fully intended for those guys to go, because we had already essentially stripped ourselves of our security presence, or our security capability to the bare minimum …

A: So Lieutenant Colonel Gibson, who is the SOCAFRICA commander, his team, you know, they were on their way to the vehicles to go to the airport to get on the C-130 when he got a phone call from SOCAFRICA which said, you can’t go now, you don’t have authority to go now. And so they missed the flight. And, of course, this meant that one of the …

Q : They didn’t miss the flight. They were told not to board the flight.

A: They were told not to board the flight, so they missed it. So, anyway, and yeah. I still remember Colonel Gibson, he said, “I have never been so embarrassed in my life that a State Department officer has bigger balls than somebody in the military.” A nice compliment.

Q: Now, at this point, are you having communications with Washington?

A: I was in communications with Washington all night long. I was reporting all night long what was happening to Washington by telephone.

Q: When these Special Forces folks were told essentially to stand down, what was your next move? Did you have a recourse? Were you able to call Washington? Were you able to call anyone at this point to get that decision reversed?

A: No, because the flight was — the flight was leaving. And, you know, if they missed — you know, if the vehicles didn’t leave when they leave, they would miss the flight time at the airport. And the airport — you know, we were going all the way to Mitiga. The C-130 is at Mitiga, which is all the way on the other side of Tripoli.

Q: What was the rationale that you were given that they couldn’t go, ultimately?

A: I guess they just didn’t have the right authority from the right."

There is a reason the international community has set a clear standard and why many countries have taken major steps to eradicate these weapons. There is a reason why President Obama has made it such a priority to stop the proliferation of these weapons, and lock them down where they do exist. There is a reason why President Obama has made clear to the Assad regime that this international norm cannot be violated without consequences. And there is a reason why no matter what you believe about Syria, all peoples and all nations who believe in the cause of our common humanity must stand up to assure that there is accountability for the use of chemical weapons so that it never happens again.

Last night, after speaking with foreign ministers from around the world about the gravity of this situation, I went back and I watched the videos -- the videos that anybody can watch in the social media, and I watched them one more gut-wrenching time. It is really hard to express in words the the human suffering that they lay out before us.

As a father, I can’t get the image out of my head of a man who held up his dead child, wailing while chaos swirled around him, the images of entire families dead in their beds without a drop of blood or even a visible wound, bodies contorting in spasms, human suffering that we can never ignore or forget. Anyone who could claim that an attack of this staggering scale could be contrived or fabricated needs to check their conscience and their own moral compass.

What is before us today is real, and it is compelling.

So I also want to underscore that while investigators are gathering additional evidence on the ground, our understanding of what has already happened in Syria is grounded in facts, informed by conscience and guided by common sense. The reported number of victims, the reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured, the firsthand accounts from humanitarian organizations on the ground, like Doctors Without Borders and the Syria Human Rights Commission -- these all strongly indicate that everything these images are already screaming at us is real, that chemical weapons were used in Syria.

Moreover, we know that the Syrian regime maintains custody of these chemical weapons. We know that the Syrian regime has the capacity to do this with rockets. We know that the regime has been determined to clear the opposition from those very places where the attacks took place. And with our own eyes, we have all of us become witnesses."
http://uk.news.yahoo.com/ahmadinejad-unveils-iranian-stealth-fighter-jet-214852814.html,,[],Ahmadinejad Unveils Iranian Stealth Fighter Jet,"Iran has unveiled a fighter jet military officials claim can evade radar and has been made by Iranian developers.

President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a ceremony broadcast on state television that building the Qaher F-313, or Dominant F-313, shows Iran's will to ""conquer scientific peaks"".

Tehran has repeatedly claimed to have developed advanced military technologies in recent years, but its claims cannot be independently verified because the country does not release the technical details.

The state started producing its own military equipment in the 1980s to compensate for a Western weapons embargo that banned export of military technology and kit to Iran.

The Defence Minister, Ahmad Vahidi, said: ""Qaher is a fully indigenous aircraft designed and built by our aerospace experts.

""This is a radar-evading plane that can fly at low altitude, carry weapons, engage enemy aircrafts and land at short airstrips.""

He said it was Iran's best stealth plane.

However, some reports suggest Iran's programme relies on equipment supplied by major international defence contractors and that it incorporates parts made abroad or uses outside engineered technologies in its domestic designs.

Pictures of the Qaher released by the official IRNA news agency and pictures on state TV showed a single-seat jet. They described it as a fighter-bomber that can combat other aircraft and ground targets.

Iran's English-language state Press TV said Qaher was similar to the American-made F/A-18, an advanced fighter capable of dogfighting as well as penetrating enemy air defences to strike ground targets.

Hasan Parvaneh, an official in charge of the project, said the physical design of the Iranian plane was unique and bore no resemblance to any foreign fighter jet.

""Development depends on our will. If we don't have a will, no one can take us there,"" President Ahmadinejad said.

""Once we imported cars and assembled them here. Now, we are at a point where we can design, build and get planes in the air."""

http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/05/bipartisan-cluelessness-on-egypt/,2013-07-05 00:00:00,[],Bipartisan cluelessness on Egypt,"By Christian Whiton, Special to CNN

Editor’s note: Christian Whiton is the author of the forthcoming book, ‘Smart Power: Between Diplomacy and War.’ He was a State Department senior advisor from 2003-2009. The views expressed are his own.

That’s twice Washington was caught slack-jawed amid revolution in the world’s biggest Arab-majority state. But don’t blame the Obama administration exclusively for twice being on the losing side of events in Egypt. Reality in Egypt has also eluded Beltway Republican foreign policy mavens and America’s dysfunctional and distracted intelligence bureaucracies. That makes shaping events in Egypt nearly impossible.

The first shock for Washington came in January 2011, when hundreds of thousands of Egyptians demanding secular democracy filled town squares. According to Washington and its $80 billion-per-year intelligence bureaucracy, these people did not exist in the Middle East. The choice there was supposedly between corrupt strongmen like Egypt’s 30-year president Hosni Mubarak or repressive Islamists like those who run Iran and populate Muslim Brotherhood parties around the region.

Secular liberals were as rare as unicorns and supported by only a small number of Egypt’s urbanites – or so the story went. And yet there they were: mobs of young Egyptians not demanding Islamic law and clerical rule, but accountable government with democratic laws and institutions.

The Muslim Brotherhood, which essentially invented modern Islamism – the political force seeking unification of mosque and state – hesitated and kept its supporters on the sidelines in Egypt. Senior Obama administration officials were also stunned along with much of the rest of Washington’s byzantine national security apparatus.

More from CNN: Will Brotherhood survive?

Even as it became clear that Mubarak would not survive, Vice President Joe Biden said supportively, “I would not refer to him as a dictator.” Of the nation that historically has been the political bellwether of the broader region, then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton said, “We’re not advocating any specific outcome.”

These officials should be afforded some pity. The information and advice they were getting came partially from State Department experts who are perennially wrong about major developments in the Middle East. Meanwhile, the CIA was distracted. Originally created for the crucial tasks of stealing secrets and waging political war on America’s foes, the CIA has spent the last decade becoming a second military. With what amounts to a second American air force around the globe and a ground force now focusing on arming Syrian rebels – inexplicably so for a mission that isn’t conceivably covert – the CIA drifts ever farther from helping policymakers grasp and influence foreign political developments.

And so the first Egyptian revolution came and went. Despite being caught flatfooted before the uprising, surely officials across Washington would be excited at the emergence of a bloc in Egypt that wanted a modern democracy, wouldn’t they? Unfortunately, Washington has a way of not allowing new facts to tamper with long-held assumptions. If Egyptian secular liberals did not exist in theory then they couldn’t exist in practice.

More from GPS: Six lessons for Egypt

So when Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham went to Cairo in February 2011, they held high-profile meetings with the Muslim Brotherhood, lending it credibility. According to the Wall Street Journal, Graham remarked, “After talking with the Muslim Brotherhood, I was struck with their commitment to change the law because they believe it’s unfair.” Later, in April 2012, White House spokesman Jay Carney cited the McCain-Graham engagement with the Brotherhood as justification for the Obama administration’s own engagement with the Islamist group.

Of course, Egypt’s liberals were not entirely on top of their game in eliciting support from Washington – whether overt or covert. Their delegation that made the rounds on Capitol Hill stressed retribution over problem-solving and coalition-building. At one point, reformers told Hill staffers they wanted to put members of Egypt’s military on trial for their lives for past involvement in Egypt’s governance. This self-indulgent and unwise attitude toward the most prominent institution in Egypt that could keep the Islamists at bay did not endear the secularists to Congress. As crucial elections arrived in mid-2012, the secularists appeared as disorganized as ever. The only surprise was how narrow their loss was in the presidential contest; the Islamists won by only 52 percent to 48 percent.

But official Washington should have known the secularists needed help – and deserved it even if they weren’t quite sure how to ask for it. Secular liberals will always, by definition, start off more disorganized than their authoritarian opponents. For example, organization and discipline were key traits of being an active member in a communist party in the last century. The same holds true of adherents for today’s totalitarian alternative to democracy: Islamism. Islamist groups ranging from the Muslim Brotherhood to Hezbollah to al Qaeda are nothing if not disciplined.

Ultimately, liberals do get organized, but it often takes time. After 1944, Poland was under the communist boot for more than three decades before on-again, off-again disobedience and dissent grew into the more organized Solidarity movement. Even then, Poles did not win their freedom for another decade. Georgia and Ukraine broke free from the collapsing Soviet Union in 1991, but they would not have true democracy until liberal oppositions toppled corrupt, authoritarian governments in 2003 and 2004 respectively.

There are ways to shorten these transitions. The CIA used to support pro-freedom political forces in the Cold War, and those actions helped secular democracy prevail in countries like Italy and Greece. In the 1980s, Washington created the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) to pick up this mantle and help foreign democratic forces organize and prevail politically.

Unfortunately, doing this today is light years from where the CIA is or wants to be. Furthermore, the world’s bad guys are now wise to NED’s intentions; Egypt expelled the employees of one of its subsidiaries. NED also has a leader, Carl Gershman, who seems to believe that Islamist parties can be coaxed into supporting liberal democracy by including them in the process – the same theory posited by other Washington bigwigs from Obama to McCain, which has now been clearly refuted by events.

Enter Egypt’s second revolution. Is it any wonder that the Obama administration has chosen to remain reticent about the matter? Egypt’s Islamist president is gone, but his supporters still exist and their secular opponents don’t yet appear to be more organized. Worse still, the will for America and its allies to help them organize, and the tools to do that with, both appear to be in mothballs. So once again the most titanic political contest of our era takes a dramatic turn – one that will have an impact in every Muslim-majority nation and beyond, but with America largely on the sidelines. Washington will again leave crucial matters to chance."

A State Department cable suggests the Syrian army likely used chemical weapons during an attack in the city of Homs last month, Foreign Policy's The Cable reports.

According to the website, a cable signed by the U.S. consul general in Istanbul and sent to the State Department described an investigation by the consulate into the Dec. 23 attack.

An Obama administration official who reviewed the document, which was classified at the ""secret"" level, detailed its contents to The Cable. ""We can't definitely say 100 percent, but Syrian contacts made a compelling case that Agent 15 was used in Homs on Dec. 23,"" the official said.

U.S. and NATO representatives have warned the embattled Syrian regime that the use of chemical weapons would trigger an international reaction. ""The possible use of chemical weapons would be completely unacceptable for the whole international community and if anybody resorts to these terrible weapons I would expect an immediate reaction from the international community,"" NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters in December, according to Reuters.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist network based in Britain, claimed in December that six Syrian rebels had died after inhaling smoke in the city of Homs. The Observatory said that the fighters inhaled ""white smoke without a smell"" and that they ""felt dizzy and suffered headaches."" Some reportedly suffered seizures.

Al Jazeera received two videos in the wake of the Dec. 23 assault, which purport to show the aftermath of the attack.

Syria denied the December accusations and said it would not use chemical weapons against its citizens.

While the U.S. has said the use of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line,"" the administration has refrained from specifying what action it would consider.

The State Department declined to comment to The Cable.

Activists estimate more than 60,000 people have died since the start of the conflict in Syria in March 2011."

The United States has created supply pipelines and set up intermediaries to deliver humanitarian aid to the opposition for several months and will use them to send direct military assistance to the Supreme Military Council, an umbrella group of rebel factions, Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes said.

“In terms of timelines, we’ve established these pipelines, so I think you should see this as a continuum,” Rhodes said. “There’s already material that has been flowing in to the opposition, and that will continue to be the case in the weeks to come. So, we don’t anticipate that this is something that is far off into the future.”

Another administration official confirmed that the administration is talking about delivery in a matter of weeks, not months. They follow recent rebel losses to President Bashar Assad’s security forces and their allies in Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, and reports of fresh fighting in the country.

Rhodes declined to say what military equipment Obama plans to send. Other officials said the administration plans to send small arms at first and may provide antitank weapons at some point. Some Obama advisors are skeptical of providing shoulder-fired anti-aircraft weapons out of concern that they could fall into the hands of al Qaeda and other Islamist groups that are seeking to topple Assad.

Gen. Salim Idris, head of the U.S.-backed military wing of the Syrian opposition, said in an interview with the Al Arabiya TV network that he hopes to receive the “weapons and ammunition we need in a few weeks.”

The intensity of fighting and recent gains by government troops and Hezbollah created concern at the White House that the rebels may be in danger of losing the war. A new U.S. intelligence assessment that Assad’s forces used nerve gas several times pushed Obama to reverse himself and help arm the rebels, although at a slower pace than advocates had hoped.

Rhodes did not rule out eventually sending U.S. aircraft to impose a no-fly zone in Syrian airspace. But he said an air campaign would be more “difficult and dangerous and costly” than it was in Libya, where U.S.-led airstrikes helped rebels oust dictator Moammar Kadafi in 2011.

Obama plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week at the G-8 summit in Northern Ireland, and is expected to ask Putin to withdraw Russian support from Assad. U.S. officials hope Russia can apply pressure to bring some elements of the Syrian regime together with the opposition to work toward a political settlement.

Leaders should pressure Assad “to come to the table in a way that relinquishes his power and his standing in Syria,” Rhodes said.

“We don’t see any scenario where he restores his legitimacy to lead the country,” Rhodes said. “So we’re fundamentally making an interest-based argument to the Russians that they can best protect their interests by being a part of a political settlement that is real and that enables a transition away from Assad’s rule.”

New Brunswick has had 1,954 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started just over a year ago. There have been 1,773 recoveries so far. A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-paul/third-plenum-_b_4289143.html,2013-11-16 18:48:07-05:00,"['President', 'Fiscal Strategies Group']",China Reforms Do Nothing To Show It Ready For World Leadership,"As trumpeted across the media, the four day meeting of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party has ended, and China's leaders announced that among the decisions were an ""easing of"" its one-child family policy and the abolition of its ""re-education through labor"" camps. As much as these policy changes are being trumpeted as evidence of how far China has come, they really are a reminder of how far China and its leaders have to go.

In the wake of the shutdown of the federal government last month, Chinese President and Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping took the opportunity to remind the world of the failings of the American political system. Year after year, as China's foreign exchange reserves have piled up, the leaders of the regime have gone to great pains to critique America for its profligacy and political instability, among myriad other failings. China's much heralded rise, and its ambitions to supplant American leadership, reflect not just its growing economic and military power, but the values of frugality, stability and conservatism Chinese leaders eagerly contrast with the chaos and moral decay of the west.

Little is ever said amidst these frequent rebukes of the role that America has played in enabling the resuscitation of the Chinese people, to say nothing of the Chinese Communist Party itself, from the depths of economic calcification reached in the 1970s. Much is made of the success of the market reforms instituted under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping beginning in 1978, and indeed the growth trajectory of China's GDP has been extraordinary. But the success of China's economic transformation could not have happened absent the free trade policies of the United States, and to a lesser extent western Europe, that enabled that growth.

Under American global leadership since the end of World War II, international trade policies have uplifted the Asian continent out of severe poverty. Japan led the way, in the wake of the devastation of WWII, building a manufacturing juggernaut enabled by American business insight and market access. The Japanese model of export driven economic growth and development then became the model for the Asian tiger nations of Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, which like Japan have risen from abject poverty a half-century ago to among the highest levels of per capita income in the world.

That was the American half-century. As we opened our markets, our share of global GDP steadily declined. Our trade policies actively supported the rise of Asia out of poverty and the globalization of our leading corporations. That real middle class incomes stagnated at home should have come as no surprise. It was simple economics.

But the Asian Tigers, and even Japan, were relatively small countries, who as trading partners were able to build their domestic economies around export trade with America without destroying the host upon which they fed. Through that economic period, there were unintended consequences that exacerbated the challenges we now face. The combined reinvestment of Asian nation trade surpluses in US dollars -- and the similar practice embraced by OPEC nations selling us oil -- led to relative stability in the US dollar and enabled steady increases in US borrowing without the increases in US interest rates or declines the value of dollar assets that would otherwise have undermined Asian growth.

But it was trade in goods and services with China and India, respectively, that ultimately showed the limit of the export driven model, as the damage to the US economy and middle class has now become too extreme to ignore. The challenges we now face -- underinvestment in infrastructure, chronic deficit spending, and socially debilitating inequality -- have conspired to contribute to the fraught domestic politics that President Xi now trumpets as the rationale for the world to turn to China for future leadership. China's gleaming new cityscapes -- and the Chinese dream of Xi's rhetoric -- are being built not upon the ingenuity of the Chinese system, but instead upon the hollowing out of the American economy.

The policy changes Xi and his colleagues announced this week only draw attention to the depravity that remains central to the Chinese system. Even as there is a rising wealthy population within the Chinese elite and urban cores, economic growth within China remains dependent upon the Foxconn-style factory model that is one step short of a slave economy. The Communist Party social and economic policies continue to drive Chinese peasants from their land while securing billions of dollars in stolen wealth for Party members. Dissent and banned religious practice remains punishable by prison and the Orwellian ""re-education"" that is to be moderated, but not eliminated, under recently announced Party reforms.

The Party plans to modify the decades old one-child policy is perhaps the most shocking reminder of the starkly immoral nature of Communist Party control over the most intimate aspects of Chinese personal life. Unauthorized pregnancies continue to be aborted by force up until birth, and children found to have been born in violation of the law remain at risk of being ""confiscated"" by police. The proposed may relax the rules surrounding who is to be allowed more than one child, but does nothing to curtail this most fundamental power of State control over the population.

This week, the US aircraft carrier George Washington arrived in the Philippines from Hawaii. The stories were so familiar from other disasters in recent years. The helicopters arriving over the horizon, coming to the aid of the population devastated by Typhoon Haiyan needing not just food and water, but the most basic help from building and securing aid distribution capacity, to recovering, identifying and burying the dead. The carrier and accompanying ships brought aid, logistics and people trained and capable of responding to the need on the ground.

Nine years ago, in the days following the 2004 tsunami, it was the US carrier Abraham Lincoln and the Navy hospital ship Mercy that steamed from the Persian Gulf to Banda Aceh, that city on the northern tip of Sumatra that had born the brunt of the tsunami and seen tens of thousands of its residents die. Like Banda Aceh, the Philippines are located close to the Chinese mainland -- just 700 miles from Hong Kong -- yet once again it was an American flotilla that steamed over 5,000 miles to bring critical aid, while the Chinese sat on their hands.

Last month, President Xi trumpeted China's rising essential role in the region at the Asia-Pacific meetings that President Obama chose not to attend due to turmoil in Washington. Yet just a few weeks later, he was nowhere to be seen as the people of the Philippines faced their crisis. The Chinese government committed just $100,000 to the Philippines relief effort after the typhoon struck.

President Xi has a long way to go to build the credibility of China as a modern state to be looked to by the world for leadership. Just the name of its recent meeting, the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party, is a reminder that while much in the world has changed over the past quarter century -- from the fall of the Berlin wall to the Arab spring -- China remains a throwback the Cold War era. As much as Xi would like to show the world the face of a man whose time in Iowa left him an admirer of American freedoms, the pronouncements from his first plenum are a stark reminder of the deep corruption and cruelty that lie at the heart of the Chinese system, and of the ghosts of Tiananmen that still haunt the Chinese leadership.

But it is the response to Typhoon Haiyan that has demonstrated how far China has to go before it will be embraced as a global leader. Leadership is not just about words at meetings of world leaders, or reserves held bank vaults, but about conduct in the world. It is not about what you do to build up your own country, but what you do to uplift others. President Xi and his colleagues disappeared this week when their neighbors across the water were crying in pain, and their inaction spoke volumes. Because, at the end of the day, leadership is not about ideology or rhetoric, it is about showing up."

And in few ways has that belief been more tested than in his frustrating private correspondence with the leaders of Iran, a country with which the United States has had no diplomatic ties for 34 years.

This week, Mr. Obama indicated that he might finally have found a pen pal in Tehran.

At the core of Iran’s recent diplomatic charm offensive — a process that has included the release of 11 prominent political prisoners and a series of conciliatory statements by top Iranian officials — is an exchange of letters, confirmed by both sides, between Mr. Obama and President Hassan Rouhani.

The election of Mr. Rouhani, a moderate, in June kindled hopes that diplomacy might end the chronic impasse with Iran over its nuclear ambitions. But the letters, and the cautious hope they have generated, suggest there is a genuine opportunity for change.

It is not the first time since entering the White House that Mr. Obama has put pen to paper to try to sway Iran’s leadership. Until now, he has had little to show for it: even under the pain of punishing economic sanctions, the Iranian government has shown little interest in negotiating a deal with Washington on its nuclear program."

At least the latter gentleman knows his own mind, even if paying a high price for it, whereas Obama is at wit’s end to articulate where he stands on the sanctity of democracy and its place in American foreign policy.

Mr. Obama is bound by his own words, international law and the expectations of allies, such as Great Britain, not to acknowledge or support coups that overthrow duly-elected governments. For the president, it is an inconvenient truth that Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, accomplished his office through the ballot box and was as constitutionally legitimate as Obama, but for one small fact.

Morsi pushed through constitutional changes that are rather favorable to the fundamentalist thinking of the Brotherhood. Of course, those views about the desired progress of society and place of religion in the equation are hardly simpatico with the left leaning ideas on Harvard Yard and other American temples of the “progressive” movement.

Like most Americans, I have no truck with the ideas of the Brotherhood, but the mob in the streets objecting to Morsi chose methods other than ballots to remove him. Sadly for him, the Egyptian military is neither under civilian control nor primarily financed by the Egyptian government. It gets its manna from the Obama Administration via more than $1 billion annually in U.S. foreign aid.

Now, the new government, in a fit of liberal tolerance is jailing Brotherhood leaders. And it would seem democracy is accomplishing more progress in U.S. sanctioned Iran than American supported Egypt.

During its recent perils, the Obama White House did not support the elected Egyptian government. It stated the Morsi government must respect the will of all the people, much as the U.S. president did pushing through Obama Care despite the disapproval of the majority of Americans, as expressed through town meetings, polls and a Massachusetts Senate election.

Instead, the U.S. president gave a wink and a nod to a military takeover in Egypt, which the State Department is now indicating may not be a coup, because the generals have not imposed a military leader. Instead, they have put in place as president Egypt’s highest judge, after he was in office but two days. Even if a figurehead, that makes the military removal of a duly-elected Egypt president not a coup, therefore legitimate?

That question has the legal minds at the State Department working overtime.

The upshot, in Egypt Obama’s principal representative, Ambassador Anne Paterson, is vilified by all sides, and the Muslim Brotherhood is likely permanently disabused of the notion that participating in democratic processes can lead to its views taking hold anywhere from Syria to Yemen.

This is a mighty grand mess that will result in untold bloodshed and further reinforce anti-American views across the Middle East. Now, the Arab Spring could easily become pan-Arab anarchy, and much blood will be on American hands. Only a fool would think this situation would not inspire new terrorists.

Those remarkable accomplishments notwithstanding, Americans are entitled to know: What is the U.S. policy toward overthrowing democratically elected governments? Is it unacceptable except when it gives rise to fundamentalist social and religious views the prelates within the American academy and mainstream media don’t like?

Who says America doesn’t have an insular aristocracy and Ayatollahs of its own?

Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor now in Moscow.

Instead, this menace may come in the form of a seemingly innocuous dome-topped antenna perched atop an electronics-packed building surrounded by a security fence somewhere in the United States.

In recent months, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon have been quietly waging a campaign to stop the State Department from allowing Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, to build about half a dozen of these structures, known as monitor stations, on United States soil, several American officials said.

They fear that these structures could help Russia spy on the United States and improve the precision of Russian weaponry, the officials said. These monitor stations, the Russians contend, would significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of Moscow’s version of the Global Positioning System, the American satellite network that steers guided missiles to their targets and thirsty smartphone users to the nearest Starbucks."
http://news.yahoo.com/eu-no-deal-reached-nuclear-talks-iran-182548451.html,,[],EU: No deal reached at nuclear talks with Iran,"ALMATY, Kazakhstan (AP) — Iran and six world powers failed to reach agreement Saturday on how to reduce fears that Tehran might use its nuclear technology to make weapons, extending years of inconclusive talks and adding to concerns the diplomatic window on reaching a deal with Tehran may soon close.

Expectations the negotiations were making progress rose as an afternoon session continued into the evening. But comments by the two sides after they ended made clear that they fell far short of making enough headway to qualify the meeting as a success.

""What matters in the end is substance, and ... we are still a considerable distance apart,"" Catherine Ashton, the European Union's head of foreign policy, told reporters at the end of the two-day talks.

Ashton, the convener of the meeting, said negotiators would now consult with their capitals. She made no mention of plans for new talks — another sign that the gap dividing the two sides remains substantial. She said she would talk with chief Iranian negotiator Saeed Jalili by telephone over further steps.

Jalili spoke of ""some distance between the positions of the two sides."" He suggested Iran was ready to discuss meeting a key demand of the other side — cutting back its highest-grade uranium enrichment production and stockpile — but only if the six reciprocated with rewards far greater than they are now willing to give.

Western negotiators noted an improved atmosphere from previous sessions, with Ashton speaking of ""a real back and forth between us when were able to discuss details, to pose questions, and to get answers directly.""

She described the better negotiating climate as a ""very important element.""

Still, the lack of forward movement in international negotiations that started a decade ago was certain to increase concerns that diplomacy was ineffective as a tool to stop Iran from moving toward nuclear-weapon making capacity.

Israel is most worried. The Jewish state says Iran is only a few months away from the threshold of having material to turn into a bomb and has vowed to use all means to prevent it from reaching that point. The U.S. has not said what its ""red line"" is, but has said it will not tolerate an Iran armed with nuclear weapons.

Story continues

""The Iranians are using the round of talks to pave the way toward a nuclear bomb,"" said Yuval Steinitz, the Israeli minister for intelligence and strategic affairs, in a text message to reporters. ""Israel has already warned that the Iranians are taking advantage of the rounds of talks in order to buy time to advance in uranium enrichment, step by step, toward a nuclear weapon.""

Urging the international community to set a ""short, clear and final timetable"" for further talks, he said ""the time has come for the world to show a more aggressive position and make it abundantly clear to the Iranians that their game of negotiations is coming to an end.""

Any strike on Iran could provoke fierce retaliation directly from Iran and through its Middle East proxies in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, raising the specter of a larger Middle East conflict and adding to the urgency of keeping both sides at the negotiating table.

At the talks in the Kazakh city of Almaty, the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany were asking Tehran to greatly limit its production and stockpiling of uranium enriched to 20 percent, which is just a technical step away from weapons-grade uranium. That would keep Iran's supply below the amount needed for further processing into a weapon.

But the group views that only as a first step in a process. Iran is operating more than 10,000 centrifuges. While most are enriching below 20 percent, this material, too could be turned into weapons-grade uranium, although with greater effort than is the case for the 20-percent stockpile.

Tehran also is only a few years away from completing a reactor that will produce plutonium, another pathway to nuclear arms.

The U.N. Security Council has demanded a stop to both that effort and all enrichment in a series of resolutions since 2006. Iran denies any interest in atomic arms, insists its enrichment program serves only peaceful needs, says it has a right to enrich under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and describes U.N. Security Council demands as illegal.

The lack of progress at Almaty was a clear indication that Tehran wants greater rewards for any concessions that the six are ready to give. Among other incentives, they have offered to lift sanctions on Iran's gold transactions and petrochemical trade. But Iran demands much more substantial sanctions relief, including an end to international penalties crippling its oil trade and financial transactions

A senior U.S. official cited Iranian officials who described the six-power offer of limited sanctions relief in exchange for meeting their demands on 20-percent uranium as a ""turning point"" when the two sides met last month. The official said the U.S. administration was ""disappointed that this rhetoric did not carry over into our negotiations.""

The official demanded anonymity as a condition for participation in a post-meeting briefing for reporters.

Jalili in turn urged the six powers to demonstrate their ""willingness and sincerity"" by taking appropriate confidence-building steps in the future"" — shorthand for Iran's demand to lift major sanctions and offer other concessions.

At the same time, he suggested some potential give on the Iranian side, suggesting discussion on some curbs of 20-percent enrichment ""can be continued in the talks"" if the six ""move away from hostile treatment ... of the Iranian people.""

With Iran previously describing the crushing sanctions on its oil exports and financial transactions as hostile acts, his comments suggested that Iran would consider compromise only if those penalties were lifted. That is far more than the relief being offered, with the six prepared to remove sanctions only on Tehran's gold transactions and petrochemical exports.

In demanding recognition of its right to enrich, Iran may hope to exploit some differences among the six, with Russia in recent months pushing for concessions on that point as a way to break negotiating deadlock.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led his country's delegation at Almaty, said after the talks that Moscow ""considers that it's necessary to recognize all rights of Iran, including enrichment."" In exchange, he said Iran must accept more international monitoring of its nuclear program.

A British Foreign Office statement said ""a wide gap remains between the parties. Iran's current position falls far short of what is needed to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough.""

Indirectly warning of further sanctions, the statement urged Tehran to ""consider carefully whether it wants to continue on its current course, and face increasing pressure and isolation from the international community, or to enter into meaningful negotiations.""

But Ryabkov described the meeting as ""undoubtedly a step forward."" Those remarks, and his comments on enrichment, both to Russian news agencies, suggested differences exist among the six, despite assertions by negotiators from Western nations of total unity at the negotiations.

At a news conference last week, Mr. Obama argued that the United States should “get out of the habit” of having the president “stretch the boundaries of his authority as far as he can” while lawmakers “snipe” from the sidelines. But he also explained his decision in terms of very special circumstances: humanitarian interventions where there is no immediate pressure to act and the United Nations is blocked.

Jack Goldsmith, a head of the Office of Legal Counsel in the Bush administration, said the limited criteria cited by Mr. Obama mean his move might not apply to more traditional future interventions. The more important precedent, he said, may concern international law and what he portrayed as Mr. Obama’s dismissive attitude toward whether or not having permission from the Security Council should stop humanitarian interventions.

Mr. Obama has in recent days repeatedly portrayed the Security Council system as incapable of performing its function of “enforcing international norms and international law,” and as so paralyzed by the veto power wielded by Russia that it is instead acting as a “barrier” to that goal.

Mr. Goldsmith said that in the Kosovo campaign, the Clinton administration shied away from arguing that it was consistent with international law to carry out a military attack not authorized by the Security Council purely for humanitarian reasons. Its fear was that such a doctrine could be misused by other nations, loosening constraints on war.

In his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, Mr. Obama said all nations “must adhere to standards that govern the use of force.” But he also argued that humanitarian grounds justified military force and cited “the Balkans,” leaving ambiguous whether he meant Bosnia, which had some Security Council approval; Kosovo, which did not; or both.

Ms. Ruemmler said that while an attack on Syria “may not fit under a traditionally recognized legal basis under international law,” the administration believed that given the novel factors and circumstances, such an action would nevertheless be “justified and legitimate under international law” and so not prohibited."

[Note this is a report issued by House Republicans including Howard McKeon chairman of Committee on Armed Services, Ed Royce chairman of Committee on Foreign Affairs, Bob Goodlatte chairman of Committee on the Judiciary, Darrell Issa chairman of Committee on Oversight & Government Reform and Mike Rogers Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]:

Before the Attacks:

After the U.S.-backed Libyan revolution ended the Gadhafi regime, the U.S. government did not deploy sufficient U.S. security elements to protect U.S. interests and personnel that remained on the ground.

Senior State Department officials knew that the threat environment in Benghazi was high and that the Benghazi compound was vulnerable and unable to withstand an attack, yet the Department continued to systematically withdraw security personnel.

Repeated requests for additional security were denied at the highest levels of the State Department. For example, an April 2012 State Department cable bearing Secretary Hillary Clinton’s signature acknowledged then-Ambassador Cretz’s formal request for additional security assets but ordered the withdrawal of security elements to proceed as planned.

For example, an April 2012 State Department cable bearing Secretary Hillary Clinton’s signature acknowledged then-Ambassador Cretz’s formal request for additional security assets but ordered the withdrawal of security elements to proceed as planned. The attacks were not the result of a failure by the Intelligence Community (IC) to recognize or communicate the threat. The IC collected considerable information about the threats in the region, and disseminated regular assessments to senior U.S. officials warning of the deteriorating security environment in Benghazi, which included threats to American interests, facilities, and personnel.

The IC collected considerable information about the threats in the region, and disseminated regular assessments to senior U.S. officials warning of the deteriorating security environment in Benghazi, which included threats to American interests, facilities, and personnel. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, failed to proactively anticipate the significance of September 11 and provide the Department of Defense with the authority to launch offensive operations beyond self-defense. Defense Department assets were correctly positioned for the general threat across the region, but the assets were not authorized at an alert posture to launch offensive operations beyond self-defense, and were provided no notice to defend diplomatic facilities.

During the Attacks:

On the evening of September 11, 2012, U.S. security teams on the ground in Benghazi exhibited extreme bravery responding the attacks by al-Qa’ida-affiliated groups against the U.S. mission.

responding the attacks by al-Qa’ida-affiliated groups against the U.S. mission. Department of Defense officials and military personnel reacted quickly to the attacks in Benghazi. The effectiveness of their response was hindered on account of U.S. military forces not being properly postured to address the growing threats in northern Africa or to respond to a brief, high-intensity attack on U.S. personnel or interests across much of Africa.

After the Attacks:

The Administration willfully perpetuated a deliberately misleading and incomplete narrative that the attacks evolved from a political demonstration caused by a YouTube video. U.S. officials on the ground reported – and video evidence confirms – that demonstrations outside the Benghazi Mission did not occur and that the incident began with an armed attack on the facility. Senior Administration officials knowingly minimized the role played by al-Qa’ida-affiliated entities and other associated groups in the attacks, and decided to exclude from the discussion the previous attempts by extremists to attack U.S. persons or facilities in Libya.

Specifically, after a White House Deputies Meeting on Saturday, September 15, 2012, the Administration altered the talking points to remove references to the likely participation of Islamic extremists in the attacks. The Administration also removed references to the threat of extremists linked to al-Qa’ida in Benghazi and eastern Libya, including information about at least five other attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi. Senior State Department officials requested – and the White House approved – that the details of the threats, specifics of the previous attacks, and previous warnings be removed to insulate the Department from criticism that it ignored the threat environment in Benghazi.

Email exchanges during the interagency process do not reveal any concern with protecting classified information. Additionally, the Bureau itself approved a version of the talking points with significantly more information about the attacks and previous threats than the version that the State Department requested. Thus, the claim that the State Department’s edits were made solely to protect that investigation is not credible.

The Administration deflected responsibility by blaming the IC for the information it communicated to the public in both the talking points and the subsequent narrative it perpetuated. Had Administration spokesmen performed even limited due diligence inquiries into the intelligence behind the talking points or requested reports from personnel on the ground, they would have quickly understood that the situation was more complex than the narrative provided by Ambassador Susan Rice and others in the Administration.

The Administration’s decision to respond to the Benghazi attacks with an FBI investigation, rather than military or other intelligence resources, contributed to the government’s lack of candor about the nature of the attack.

Responding to the attacks with an FBI investigation significantly delayed U.S. access to key witnesses and evidence and undermined the government’s ability to bring those responsible for the attacks to justice in a timely manner.

(AP Photo/Courtesy of Tom Smedinghoff) (Uncredited/AP)

Three American civilians and three U.S. troops were killed in two attacks in Afghanistan on Saturday, officials said, including a powerful blast that struck officials traveling to a school to donate books. Among the dead was the first State Department diplomat to be killed in the country since the war began.

The bloodshed Saturday, the deadliest day this year for Americans in Afghanistan, underscored how dangerous the country remains as the United States proceeds with the withdrawal of its remaining troops over the next 20 months, leaving security in the hands of Afghanistan’s fledgling army.

The attacks suggested that even as the military coalition’s focus shifts to managing the drawdown, the United States appears likely to face an intense “fighting season,” the springtime period in Afghanistan during which violence typically in­creases.

The American diplomat killed Saturday was identified as Anne Smedinghoff by her parents. Smedinghoff was recently tasked with assisting Secretary of State John F. Kerry on his trip to Kabul.

Four other State Department officials who were with her, traveling to a school in the southern province of Zabul, were injured in the same bombing, one critically, Kerry said in a statement.

“She was everything a Foreign Service Officer should be: smart, capable, eager to serve, and deeply committed to our country and the difference she was making for the Afghan people,” Kerry said. “She tragically gave her young life working to give young Afghans the opportunity to have a better future.”

In a somber address to State Department employees in Istanbul, Kerry paid tribute to Smedinghoff.

There is no greater contradiction, Kerry said, between Smedinghoff's zeal to ""change the world"" and help others and a bomber who he said drove a car into their vehicle.

""Folks who want to kill people, and that's all they want to do, are scared of knowledge. They want to shut the doors,"" Kerry said.

""Here is a huge challenge for us. Here's a confrontation with modernity, with possibilities, with everything that our country stands for.""

Smedinghoff, 25, served as Kerry’s main embassy guide and aide during his two-day visit late last month. That assignment, as a “control officer,” is considered an honor and a mark of promise for young Foreign Service officers.

The diplomat began an assignment as a press officer in Kabul last summer after spending two years at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, Venezuela, where she worked in the consular section. Smedinghoff graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a degree in international relations, said her parents, Tom and Mary Beth Smedinghoff.

The Smedinghoffs, who live in the Chicago area, said in an e-mail that their daughter joined the State Department straight out of college.

“She particularly enjoyed the opportunity to work directly with the Afghan people and was always looking for opportunities to reach out and help to make a difference in the lives of those living in a country ravaged by war,” they said. “We are consoled knowing that she was doing what she loved, and that she was serving her country by helping to make a positive difference in the world.”

The attacks came as Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, arrived in Afghanistan to take stock of the war as U.S. officials continue to deliberate how quickly they should pull out the 68,000 American troops still deployed there.

Saturday’s violence followed a coordinated attack Wednesday in the country’s relatively safe west that killed at least 46 people. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the assault in Farah province, saying it had been carried out to avenge the group’s fighters who have been “kept in prisons for years on end and even mercilessly given the death penalty.”

In the deadlier of the two attacks Saturday, in Zabul province’s Qalat district, insurgents detonated a bomb when a convoy transporting U.S. troops and State Department officials and another one carrying the governor of the province intersected. The blast, in an area that has long been a Taliban stronghold, killed three U.S. service members, the young diplomat and a U.S. Defense Department employee.

The Associated Press reported that the governor survived the attack but that an Afghan doctor was killed in the explosion.

In a statement, the Taliban said the attack was carried out at noon when a militant detonated explosives packed in a vehicle as the provincial governor was approaching the Americans. A Taliban spokesman told the AP that militants linked to the group were hoping to strike a U.S. or an Afghan government convoy when they placed the bomb. “We were waiting for one of them,” spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi said. “It was our good luck that both appeared at the same time.”

In the east, meanwhile, a third American civilian was killed in an “insurgent attack,” according to a statement issued by the military coalition in Kabul. It offered no further details.

Dempsey, the country’s top U.S. military official, told reporters traveling with him that he was heartened by what U.S. officials have described as spontaneous rebellions against the Taliban that have unfolded in recent months as the U.S. presence in the country has thinned. He expressed hope that a political solution will lead at least some segments of the Taliban to join the political process, according to remarks published by the American Forces Press Service, a Pentagon news division.

“Any conflict in history, when it is resolved, is resolved through some form of reconciliation,” Dempsey said. “I support the effort to try . . . through the Afghans to encourage them to take reconciliation as an important line of effort.”

Kerry, who traveled Saturday to the Middle East, spoke to the woman’s parents to offer “what little comfort I can for their immeasurable loss.”

“As the father of two daughters, I can’t imagine what their family is feeling today,” he said.

Tom Smedinghoff said his daughter died in the pursuit of a career she loved.

“The world lost a truly beautiful soul today,” he said. “She was such a wonderful woman--strong, intelligent, independent, and loving.”

Former Olympian wants Americans to dedicate their performances in Sochi to gay friends and relatives

He appears before Congressional briefing on LGBT equality

Louganis says he has been criticized for stance against boycotting Games

WASHINGTON --- Greg Louganis urged American Olympians on Friday to dedicate their performances at February's Sochi Games to their gay friends and relatives as a means of public but personal protest against Russian anti-gay laws.

Louganis, the former diver and Olympic gold medalist, reaffirmed his position against a boycott of the Sochi Games at a Capitol Hill briefing of the House LGBT Equality Caucus hosted by U.S. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and Human Rights First, an international human rights organization based in New York and Washington.

Louganis, who was a member of the 1980 U.S. Olympic team that boycotted the Moscow Games, said his position on a boycott has angered some in the LGBT community but that he believes boycotts ""hurt the wrong people,"" meaning elite athletes who have dedicated their lives to this moment.

Russia's so-called anti-propaganda law, passed by its parliament in June, bars ""propaganda"" about ""nontraditional sexual relations"" as a means of protecting children.

Louganis, who is openly gay, said gay children are born in Russia every day. ""Every child needs to be protected,"" he said.

Human Rights First urged the Obama administration last month to include prominent LGBT people in the official U.S. delegation to Sochi. Louganis said he is open to going, if selected.

""If it would be helpful, I would be there in a heartbeat,"" he told USA TODAY Sports after the briefing. ""If I would be a distraction, that's my concern. I don't want to be a distraction. But if there's any way I can be of benefit, focusing a light on injustice, then I'll be there. I just heard today that my name is in the mix for potentially going. I was like, really? I'm a Summer Olympian. But I think I am pretty level-headed. I have not heard from anyone officially, so it was news to me.""

Louganis said as he understands the law, Olympic athletes in Sochi could potentially be in trouble for wearing rainbow pins in support of the LGBT movement. That, he said, is why he thinks athletes should publicly thank gay friends and relatives who have supported them in their road to the Olympics.

""I don't see how the IOC can say anything about that, because it's personal, not political,"" Louganis said. ""If you have a supportive aunt, uncle, cousin, friend who is gay, you don't win a gold medal by yourself. There is a team of people behind you. And to recognize those people is a way athletes can show their support of the LGBT community and what's going on in Russia.""

Louganis said he got sharply critical pushback when he first said that he is not in favor of boycotting the Sochi Games.

""I got hate mail,"" he said. ""I was told, 'How can I call myself a gay man?' Or that I was a horrible homosexual. I had one really graphic and hateful one and actually reached out to him and we became friends. I was able to express why. I come from the perspective of an athlete.

""I commended the guy who was critical of me. All I'm trying to do is incite action. That's all he's trying to do. We're all on the same side. If you say boycott, that's how you address the issue. I am saying no boycott, but maybe there is another way.""

Louganis said the shelf life of an Olympic athlete is short and that many members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic team lost their opportunities to the sands of time. Louganis came back and won gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, which were boycotted by Eastern bloc countries, and the 1988 Seoul Games. He also competed in the 1976 Moscow Games.

""I competed on two sides of two boycotts,"" he said. ""We have a full Olympic team from 1980 that was never fully recognized by the world. We wanted to send just one person to carry the flag at opening ceremonies and one to closing ceremonies but to go to Russia and kick ass. That's an athlete's mentality.""

Other speakers at the briefing included Anastasia Smirnova, coordinator of the coalition of LGBT organizations in the Olympics advocacy campaign; Maria Kozlovskaya, legal program coordinator of the Council of Russian LGBT network; and Elvina Yuvakaeva and Konstantin Iablotckii, co-presidents of the Russian LGBT Sport Federation. They described a climate of fear for sexual minorities in Russia and a permissive environment for violence against them.

""What's disturbing is how vague the law is,"" Louganis said. ""These vigilante groups are emerging, basically gangs, targeting LGBT people, especially youth. It's so disturbing that these abuses are happening and there is no one to go to. There is only fear.""

But those are among the governor’s new realities this week as he moves from boardrooms to ballrooms amid the government meetings, signing ceremonies and formal banquets that will make up his swing through China.

The formal nature of the official state visit is something of an anathema to the governor’s trademark intellectual populism. Brown’s improvisational style has been curbed by carefully worded statements. A governor who has been known to eat food from other people’s plates is slated to sit through a handful of lavish multi-course banquets, complete with their own sets of cultural rituals.

The formalities began early Wednesday as Brown met with China’s minister of commerce, Gao Hucheng. Seated at a long conference table surrounded by top aides and untouched mugs of green tea, the two exchanged pleasantries and pledged deeper economic ties between China and California.

From there, his police-led motorcade made its way through the streets of Beijing to the Hunan Hotel, where in an ornate ballroom, Brown and six other regional Chinese leaders signed a memorandum also aimed at promoting future partnerships.

These types of non-binding memoranda are precisely the kind of thing Brown typically dismisses back home. State lawmakers have seen dozens of bills meet with the governor’s veto pen, dismissed with curt messages about their non-binding and mostly ceremonial nature.

But this is different, Brown’s aides say. These agreements are seen as significant in China, and lay the groundwork for what Brown hopes will be scores of new business deals in the years to come.

A lunchtime gathering at the tony Peninsula Hotel offered a brief respite. At a luncheon hosted by the Chamber of Commerce, in a room full of U.S. business people, Brown was at ease. He kept the crowd laughing with cracks about the state’s credit rating, the city of San Francisco and California’s propensity for lawsuits.

The governor made light of complaints about state regulations dating back to his first stint as governor that persisted through the 1980s and ‘90s when the state had Republican executives.

Any decision to leave would be particularly wrenching for the tens of thousands of Russian-speaking women who met and married Syrian men who were sent to study in the former Soviet Union and who now live across Syria.

At the airport in Moscow, Russian evacuees described a sharp deterioration over the last year. Natalya Yunus said she ran a salon on the outskirts of Damascus until the Free Syrian Army captured her neighborhood, asking, “where could I go with no lights, no water, no money?”

“It was good for me there for a long time, but in the end it was terrifying,” said Ms. Yunus, whose husband remained behind in Syria. “Of course it’s terrifying, it’s a war, what can you do? There are machine guns, planes. And now I’m in a situation with no way out. There is nowhere to go.”

Her daughter, Anzhelika, said she had also left her husband behind.

“We ran,” she said. “How else can you put it?”

Rushana Vildanova, 26, spent the early morning waiting at the airport, waiting for her husband, Ali, who is a shopkeeper, and their 7-year-old daughter. She said Ali’s mother had died when the roof of their house caved in after a bomb exploded in their section of Damascus, and he was badly injured. She said she left Syria at the very beginning of the conflict, and that in recent months, he confided that he wanted to get out.

“I left right when it started, he stayed behind because he never thought it would get this bad,” she said. “At first there were demonstrations, and it all started there.”

Natalya Ivanova was waiting for her daughter, Olga, who has lived in Syria for the last 13 years. “What could she do? She took her daughter and she left, even though her husband had to stay behind,” she said. “And we are happy that she did that, she had to do that, and now she is here with us. If only for the time being.”"

(CNN) —

The Israeli air force shot down a drone approaching the nation’s coast Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces said.

An Israeli F-16 shot the drone with air-to-air missiles, an Israeli military official told CNN. It went down five nautical miles off the coast of Haifa, and Israeli naval forces were searching the area while an investigation was initiated, the Israeli military said.

“I view with utmost gravity this attempt to violate our border,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a prepared statement. “We will continue to do everything necessary to safeguard the security of Israel’s citizens.”

By the numbers: Drones

Thursday’s incident marked the second time an unmanned aircraft had been intercepted in Israeli airspace within the past seven months, the IDF said.

In October 2012, Israeli warplanes tracked and eventually shot down a drone over the country’s northern Negev Desert.

That drone did not carry any weapons or explosives, Israeli officials said at the time. They declined to discuss the drone’s route or whether it had approached any sensitive facilities.

Hezbollah claimed responsibility for sending the drone, which Israeli officials at the time said appeared to have originated in Lebanon.

Hezbollah frequently flies drones over Israel, but the military rarely bothers to shoot them down, Michah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations said at the time.

Gordon', 'Steven Lee Myers']",Obama Backs Idea for Syria to Cede Control of Arms,"WASHINGTON — President Obama on Monday tentatively embraced a Russian diplomatic proposal to avert a United States military strike on Syria by having international monitors take control of the Syrian government’s chemical weapons. The move added new uncertainty to Mr. Obama’s push to win support among allies, the American public and members of Congress for an attack.

In a series of television interviews with six cable and broadcast networks, Mr. Obama capped a remarkable day of presidential lobbying for military action and a dizzying series of developments at home and abroad. Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said early Monday that Syria could avoid an attack by putting its chemical weapons in the hands of monitors and agreeing to ultimately eliminate its massive arsenal of poison gas. It was an idea that was quickly praised by top officials in Syria and some lawmakers in the United States.

“It’s possible,” Mr. Obama said on CNN of the Russian proposal, “if it’s real.”

Mr. Obama’s statements about the haphazardly constructed plan appeared to offer him an exit strategy for a military strike he had been reluctant to order, and it came as support on Capitol Hill for a resolution authorizing force was slipping. Even some lawmakers who had announced support for it reversed course.

Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Monday evening that he would not force an initial vote on the resolution on Wednesday, slowing Senate consideration until at least next week. Democrats said they had enough votes to overcome a filibuster but possibly not enough to pass it."
http://news.yahoo.com/analysis-obama-lobbies-personally-syria-vote-223628615.html,,[],Analysis: Obama lobbies personally for Syria vote,"By Jeff Mason and Richard Cowan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After putting a decision to launch military strikes on Syria into the hands of Congress, President Barack Obama is doing what his critics have long accused him of failing to do: reaching out, personally and aggressively, to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. While top lieutenants including Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry lobby their former congressional colleagues, Obama is making individual calls himself to members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to press his case for action. What Obama has not done since he made his announcement on Saturday is appeal to the public, which both Democrats and Republicans say will be crucial as polls show little enthusiasm for U.S. military action anywhere. The stakes for the president are high - and the arguments being made in support of a 'yes' vote from Congress are making them even higher. A vote against strikes to punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for alleged use of chemical weapons, officials argue, could undermine Obama's standing in the Middle East as his administration seeks to deter Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, broker peace between Israelis and Palestinians and stabilize a region already in turmoil. ""A rejection of this resolution would be catastrophic, not just for him but for the institution of the presidency and the credibility of the United States,"" Senator John McCain said after meeting with Obama at the White House on Monday. Mindful of those stakes, the White House has employed a ""flood the zone"" strategy, according to an administration official, using an American football term for an offensive move where players flood an area of the field to overwhelm the opposing team's defenders. The evidence of that strategy: an onslaught of briefings, calls and meetings with lawmakers from both political parties. On Monday National Security adviser Susan Rice, Kerry, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and the top U.S. military officer, Martin Dempsey, held an unclassified briefing call for Democratic House members, and Obama met with McCain and fellow Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. On Tuesday Obama will meet with the chairs of key national security committees in Congress and Kerry, Dempsey, and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel will testify to the Senate foreign relations committee. ""In all calls and briefings, we will be making the same fundamental case: The failure to take action against Assad unravels the deterrent impact of the international norm against chemical weapons use,"" a senior administration official said. ""It risks emboldening Assad and his key allies - Hezbollah and Iran - who will see that there are no consequences for such a flagrant violation of an international norm. Anyone who is concerned about Iran and its efforts in the region should support this action,"" he said. CONSULTATION, AFTER THE FACT Obama has stepped up his interactions with lawmakers this year, holding dinners and building relationships that critics say he lacked. But any goodwill he has obtained from that effort is limited, and one Republican aide noted on Monday that Obama had only come to Congress after already articulating a decision that strikes were necessary. ""They're certainly doing more, but it's after the fact. They already made a decision on what they want to do,"" a senior Senate Republican aide told Reuters. Running parallel to the White House contacts with Congress are conversations that senior Democratic and Republican senators are holding in an attempt to get a resolution passed in the full Senate. The aide said the Democratic chairmen of relevant Senate committees were consulting with the highest-ranking Republicans on those panels to try to work out language that could pass the Senate next week. Passage in the Republican-controlled House remains much more problematic, with lawmakers expressing skepticism about U.S. involvement in another war as well as the effectiveness of the limited strikes that Obama has proposed.

Secretary of State John Kerry called India's national security adviser on Wednesday to personally express ""regret"" for the incident, in an indication that U.S. officials were scrambling to contain the furor

But U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who represents Manhattan, blasted the ""misinformation and factual inaccuracy"" surrounding the case. He claimed the ""inflammatory atmosphere"" that has developed is ""unfounded,"" while cataloguing the litany of alleged offenses committed by the Indian diplomat in question.

Devyani Khobragade stands accused of lying on a visa application about how much she paid her housekeeper, an Indian national. Prosecutors say the maid received $3 per hour for her work.

""One wonders why there is so much outrage about the alleged treatment of the Indian national accused of perpetrating these acts, but precious little outrage about the alleged treatment of the Indian victim and her spouse?"" Bharara said in his lengthy and detailed statement.

""The question then may be asked: Is it for U.S. prosecutors to look the other way, ignore the law and the civil rights of victims (again, here an Indian national), or is it the responsibility of the diplomats and consular officers and their government to make sure the law is observed?""

The case, since Khobragade's arrest last week in New York, has turned into an international incident. Indian officials claim the consular official's treatment was heavy-handed, complaining that she was strip-searched and claiming she was thrown in a cell with drug addicts. They've retaliated on several fronts, including by dragging away security barriers from outside the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi.

India's foreign minister has demanded that the U.S. drop federal charges against her.

U.S. officials acknowledge Khobragade was strip-searched, but described it as standard procedure. Bharara further clarified that this was done in a private setting by a female officer. Bharara also disputed many of the claims about her treatment. He said she was, among other things, given coffee and offered food while detained.

Bharara said Khobragade, who has pleaded not guilty, wasn't handcuffed, restrained or arrested in front of her children.

Further, he said, she's alleged to have treated the housekeeper ""illegally in numerous ways,"" paying her ""far below"" minimum wage and having her work far more than the amount of time contracted. Further, he said she was alleged to have created a second contract that was concealed from the U.S. government. Plus he said the victim's family had to be brought to the United States amid an attempt in India to ""silence her.""

External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid told reporters on Thursday that Khobragade should never have been arrested, and that the housekeeper should have been arrested instead.

Khurshid said he would speak to Kerry later Thursday.

""This is an extremely distressing and hurtful incident that needs to be addressed,"" he said.

Earlier Thursday, an official in India's External Affairs Ministry told the Associated Press that Khobragade claimed to Indian authorities in July that the maid had disappeared and was trying to blackmail her. According to the official, the housekeeper said she would not report Khobragade if she agreed to pay her more money and change her visa status to allow her to work elsewhere in the U.S.

Khobragade filed a complaint with New York police and New Delhi police, the official said. It was not clear what action was taken in the U.S., but New Delhi police issued a warrant for the maid's arrest if she returned to India.

News that Khobragade was strip-searched has chilled U.S.-Indian relations, and Kerry called India's national security adviser on Wednesday to express his regret over what happened. India has revoked privileges for U.S. diplomats in protest.

Khobragade, who was India's deputy consul general in New York, would face a maximum sentence of 10 years for visa fraud and five years for making a false declaration if convicted.

She has said she has full diplomatic immunity. The Department of State disputes that, saying hers is more limited to acts performed in the exercise of consular functions. Her work status late Wednesday was unclear.

Indian Consulate spokesman Venkatasamy Perumal said Khobragade was transferred Tuesday to India's U.N. mission, but he declined to comment further, and requests for comment to the U.N. mission's first secretary were not immediately returned.

In an email published in Indian media on Wednesday, Khobragade said she was treated like a common criminal.

""I broke down many times as the indignities of repeated handcuffing, stripping and cavity searches, swabbing, in a holdup with common criminals and drug addicts were all being imposed upon me despite my incessant assertions of immunity,"" she wrote.

Khobragade was arrested by the Department of State's diplomatic security team and then handed over to U.S. marshals in New York. She was later released after posting $250,000 bail.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said ""this isolated episode is not indicative of the close and mutually respectful ties"" that the U.S. and India share.

India retaliated against U.S. diplomats with measures that include revoking diplomat ID cards that brought certain privileges, demanding to know the salaries paid to Indian staff in U.S. Embassy households and withdrawing import licenses that allowed the commissary at the U.S. Embassy to import alcohol and food.

On Wednesday, dozens of people protested outside the U.S. Embassy, saying Khobragade's treatment was an insult to Indian women.

Story highlights NEW: Crowds and news crews stand outside the hospital overnight Mandela's family visits his bedside Officials say Mandela's condition has worsened in the past day Health won't affect President Obama's visit this week, South Africa's president says

(CNN) —

Throughout the night, crowds of people stood outside the hospital where former South African President Nelson Mandela is being treated, and among the balloons, posters and cards early Tuesday were dozens of news crews and broadcast vans.

More than 40 vehicles crowded the parking spaces outside the Medi-Clinic Heart Hospital in Pretoria, the South African Press Association reported. Generators hummed and the area was brightly lit for the news organizations doing regular live broadcasts.

Mandela’s daughter Makaziwe Mandela left the hospital Monday night, SAPA reported. Other family members, including ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and daughters Zindzi Mandela-Motlhajwa and Zenani Mandela-Dlamini, left earlier in the day.

Government officials paid visits as well.

Mandela’s wife, Graca Machel, spends every night at the hospital, where the former president has been since June 8 for a recurring lung infection. Previously, authorities had described his condition as serious but stable.

But over the weekend, his health took a turn for the worse, with the South African president’s office saying he was in critical condition.

“The doctors are doing everything possible to ensure his well-being and comfort,” President Jacob Zuma told the nation Monday.

The former president’s health will not affect U.S. President Barack Obama’s planned visit to the country this week, Zuma said, according to the press association.

Mandela, 94, has become increasingly frail over the years and has not appeared in public since South Africa hosted the World Cup in 2010.

Outside the hospital Monday, a security wall was awash with get-well cards, balloons, flowers, cards and paintings, the press association reported.

Ready for the spiritual realm

For Mandela’s family, these are very personal times – times to be cherished as the end nears.

“I believe he is at peace,” said Makaziwe Mandela, who was born in 1953 to Mandela’s first wife, Evelyn.

“All we do every day is take one day at a time and pray to the good Lord,” Makaziwe told CNN’s Robyn Curnow.

“All I pray for as a daughter is that the transition is smooth. … He is at peace with himself. He has given so much to the world.”

In and out of hospital

The anti-apartheid hero has been in and out of the hospital in recent years.

His history of lung problems dates to when he was a political prisoner on Robben Island during the apartheid era, and he has battled respiratory infections since.

Considered the founding father of South Africa’s democracy, Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in prison for fighting against apartheid, the country’s system of racial segregation.

South Africa’s governing African National Congress noted “with concern” Sunday the change in Mandela’s health.

“The African National Congress joins the presidency in calling upon all of us to keep President Mandela, his family and his medical team in our thoughts and prayers during this trying time,” it said.

A Nobel laureate

In 1993, Mandela and then-South African President F.W. de Klerk jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize.

The iconic leader was elected the nation’s first black president a year later, serving only one term, as he had promised.

Even as he has faded from the spotlight, he remains popular and is considered a hero of democracy in the nation. Last year, South Africa launched a new batch of banknotes with a picture of a smiling Mandela on the front.

His impact extends far beyond South Africa. After he left office, he mediated conflicts in Africa and the Middle East.

Word of his worsening health drew global expressions of concern.

“We have seen the latest reports from the South African government that former President Mandela is in critical condition,” Caitlin Hayden, a U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman, said in a statement Sunday. “Our thoughts and prayers are with him, his family and the people of South Africa.”

Jeffrey Smith of The Center for Public Integrity pens a must-share piece about the waste, fraud and abuse that was ""commonplace"" in the Iraq reconstruction effort. A report by Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction Stuart W. Bowen Jr. has found that ""contracting abuses and mismanagement that wasted at least $8 billion of the $60 billion spent by Washington on Iraq’s postwar recovery"":



James Jeffrey, the U.S. ambassador in Iraq from 2010 to 2012, told Bowen that “the U.S. reconstruction money used to build up Iraq was not effective. ... We didn’t get much in return.” [...] The biggest footprint Americans left behind, most of these Iraqi officials said, was more corruption and widespread money laundering. Such a huge investment “could have brought great change in Iraq,” Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said, but the gains were often “lost.” [...] An Iraqi government watchdog agency, the Board of Supreme Audit, noted last year that $800 million in profits from illicit activities was being transferred out of Iraq each week, effectively stripping $40 billion annually from the economy, according to Bowen’s report.

Dollar estimates of the combined war costs range from $1.4 trillion to $4 trillion spent and obligated, or a bill of between $4,500 and $12,742 for every man, woman and child in the U.S. The human cost and death toll are immense. It is estimated that between 225,000 to more than 1 million have been killed when we take into account all the lives lost in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. To this tragedy are added the tens of thousands who came home injured, with similar numbers of injured in the war-zone countries. Significant brain and spinal injuries to coalition forces approach 20 percent, and 30 percent of soldiers suffer from PTSD. The costs of treating these problems will continue for decades to come.

On Tuesday, at this 10th anniversary of the American Invasion of Iraq, we would do well to remind ourselves about some painful facts. [...] [T]he leaders of the Bush administration were intent on invading from the beginning of their time in the White House. When the 9-11 attacks occurred, Bush cabinet members immediately discussed how that tragedy could be used to justify an invasion. Bush himself asked me to try to pin the blame for 9-11 on Iraq.

Robert F. Dodge , in a guest column at the Times of Trenton, reflects on the costs of the war:Former advisor Richard Clarke on the Bush administration's breach of trust: The Daily Beast has a slideshow of the most iconic images of the Iraq War.

Newsweek correspondent Scott C. Johnson recalls in stirring details of his convoy being attacked. ""The possibility of death became real,"" he writes, when his car flipped over and he was trapped inside:



I was wearing military-issue boots that I had picked up at a store in Kuwait City. I kicked, and the window didn’t budge. I kept kicking. I kicked until I saw a crack, then another. A web began to form. I kicked as hard as I could; I kicked the s--t out of that window. A small hole began to form, a tiny thing at the center of the web, and I kicked it until it became about as big as my head. I could hear the attackers shouting nearby. The firing continued. I heard feet. I heard the click of chambers, the dumping of bags, running, panting, breathing.

Imagine that in the rush toward war with Iraq, the sales pitch had gone like this: ""We must put our troops in harm's way to depose a brutal dictator, Saddam Hussein, and give Iraqis a chance at democracy. This will not be easy. It will take eight years, cost the lives of 4,488 U.S. troops and leave tens of thousands more grievously injured. Al-Qaeda will gain a new foothold, and the civil war we unleash will kill more than 100,000 Iraqis. We will spend $3 trillion, our war in Afghanistan will be orphaned and the big winner will be Iran. But Iraq will be a better place."" That, of course, is an assessment of the war Tuesday on the 10th anniversary of the invasion. The outcome could not have been known with such precision in advance. But if history has made anything obvious, it is that the Bush administration used false premises to peddle the war.

After the war, some of the United States’ leading newspapers were forced to apologize for getting it so wrong. But two reporters consistently got it right: Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel, former Knight Ridder reporters for the McClatchy newspapers. In an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour marking the tenth anniversary of the Iraq War, they cited reporters’ access to top officials in Washington as one of the top problems. The top-level bureaucrats, they said, had more of a propensity to spin toward the line that the Bush Administration was pushing."

Dempsey to another two-year term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Mr. McCain made his announcement after he and the general had a testy exchange over whether the Obama administration was doing enough to assist the Syrian rebels.

“I’m actually going to put a hold on General Dempsey until General Dempsey responds to legitimate questions,” Mr. McCain said just two days after he helped negotiate a deal to ease the Senate confirmation process for Mr. Obama’s nominees.

Asked whether he would place the hold only after the Armed Services Committee forwarded the nomination to a vote by the full Senate, Mr. McCain responded tersely, “Before, after and during.”

“I want to see him answer the question,” he added. A vote by 60 senators can overcome a hold.

The confirmation battle grew out of a debate over whether the United States military should be ordered to more aggressively support Syrian rebels to oust the government of President Bashar al-Assad, including combat action like establishing a no-fly zone. Mr. McCain, who has called for American military intervention in the Syrian civil war, traveled to Syria in late May to meet with the rebel forces.

Corker considering bill to block Obama administration from loosening Iran sanctions,"Sen. Bob Corker is considering legislation that would block the Obama administration from easing sanctions on Iran, as the U.S. prepares for talks this week with Tehran on its nuclear program.

An aide to Corker, R-Tenn., confirms to Fox News Corker is considering a proposal that would prohibit the White House from loosening sanctions on the Iranian regime unless it made major concessions on its missile and nuclear programs. Corker’s plans were first reported by The Daily Beast.

Corker’s legislation would require concessions far beyond those currently being considered ahead of Iran’s talks with the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany in Geneva.

""We've crafted an amendment to freeze the administration in and make it so they are unable to reduce the sanctions unless certain things occur,"" Corker told The Daily Beast. ""They have the ability now to waive sanctions. But we're very concerned that in their desire to make any deal that they may in fact do something that is very bad for our country.""

If Corker’s legislation came to fruition, it could pose a significant obstacle to negotiators already dealing with resistance from both Washington and hard-liners in Iran.

Iranian hard-liners want significant sanctions reductions in exchange for scaling back enrichment, while some U.S. lawmakers want the enrichment to stop altogether in exchange for loosening sanctions. In the talks Thursday and Friday, negotiators will face strong pressure from both camps even as they try to find common ground among their own positions.

The talks concern the size and output of Iran's enrichment program, which can create both reactor fuel and weapons-grade material suitable for a nuclear bomb. Iran insists it is pursuing only nuclear energy, medical treatments and research. However, new reformist President Hassan Rouhani has indicated he could cut back on the nuclear program in exchange for an easing of the crippling economic sanctions.

Both the U.S. administration and Iran's clerical leadership are urging critics at home to support the talks. In Tehran on Sunday, Khamenei asked Iranians not to ""weaken"" the negotiators, and deputy U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Monday that ""the U.S. needs to speak with one voice when we're sitting down at the table.""

A senior U.S. official, speaking to reporters on Wednesday said both sides are coming to the table Thursday with an understanding of what they want from each other as a `'first step"" -- and what they are willing to give in return. She asked for anonymity as a condition for participation in her briefing.

She said the six world powers are ready to offer `'limited, targeted and reversible"" sanctions relief in response to agreement by Iran to start rolling back activities that could be used to make weapons.

But in a nod to skeptics in Congress, she emphasized that any economic relief given Iran can be canceled, should Tehran renege on commitments it makes in Geneva. And she said the six powers were looking to test the durability of any initial nuclear limits Iran agreed to by waiting -- possibly for as long as for six months -- after such agreement before any sanctions relief kicked in..

Corker says his plan would bar the White House from creating any limited sanctions relief before Iran had actually scaled back its nuclear program.

""This would keep an interim deal from happening unless there is actual tangible changes that take place, Corker told the Daily Beast.

In Tehran, Iran's Revolutionary Guard leaders have been mollified somewhat for now by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's suggestion that he will give Rouhani only a limited time to negotiate an end to the sanctions. Underscoring the support that the hard-liners enjoy in Tehran, tens of thousands marked Monday's anniversary of the 1979 storming of the U.S. Embassy with chants of ""Death to America!""

President', 'The American Jewish Congress', 'Israel Policy Forum', 'Co-Chair Of The Middle East Project Of The Council On Foreign Relations']","Israel, the Palestinians, and the Interim Nuclear Deal With Iran","No nation willingly takes action unless it believes that the action is in its own best interest. So, it is utter nonsense when we are told that Israel is reluctant to move forward on a deal with the Palestinians because it does not ""feel the love"" from America and the Obama administration in view of the secret American negotiations with Iran and the interim nuclear deal signed by Iran and the P5+1 powers. It is similarly baseless when we are told that the interim deal with Iran coupled with the effort to negotiate an end to the war in Syria demonstrate that Washington is preparing to turn its attention away from the region and somehow that provides a legitimate reason for Israel to back off its negotiations with the Palestinians.

The claim by those in Israel and in the American Jewish community that President Obama has ""thrown Israel under the bus"" in entering the interim deal with Iran just doesn't stand up to scrutiny. In narrowly framing the only deal that would be acceptable to Israel as one that would stop the Iranians from any kind of nuclear enrichment, Prime Minster Netanyahu has set the bar too high to be realistic. It is not credible that Iran would agree to such a deal, however strong the sanction regime. The result is that the only alternative to Netanyahu's deal would be a war with Iran, with all the uncertainties as to what would be accomplished and the possibilities of costly escalation. The Obama administration, fully reflecting the view of the American people, does not want a war unless every other possibility for a peaceful resolution has been explored and has failed.

What Israel, Saudi Arabia and those other nations opposed to the Iranian deal can contribute of great value is in depth intelligence, in carefully monitoring the actions of the Iranians to insure that they are indeed carrying out the terms of the deal and when the interim period has ended, determining whether Iran is closer to a nuclear capability than it was before. In addition, those nations in opposition can help the United States maintain the full force of the sanctions that have not been lifted under the terms of the agreement and apply pressure on nations and businesses not to allow sanctions to weaken during the interim period so that they can be fully reinstated if they have to be. As for the impact of the Iranian deal on Israel's relationship with the Palestinians -- long before the secret negotiations with Iran had begun, in these pages and elsewhere I, like others, questioned whether Prime Minister Netanyahu truly sought a two state solution with the Palestinians. We pointed to his personal history as well as the effect any deal would have in destroying his political coalition. And we also noted that the Palestinian issue was not in the forefront of concerns of the Israeli people, although a strong commitment from their leaders could probably convince them to accept a two state deal.

Now, that the period for negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians set by Secretary Kerry is one third completed, it does not appear that the parties have made significant enough progress to lead to the belief that a deal ultimately can be reached. This has nothing to do with America's diplomatic efforts regarding Iran. In fact, the why of the failing negotiations does not really matter. What does matter is that they are failing and there is little hope for a negotiated resolution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The question now is what can replace that approach.

There are some in the United States and the region who would now call on the Obama Administration to offer bridging solutions to the parties. These proposals range from the President providing suggestions to resolve specific issues to his presenting a defined plan covering all the points and pressuring the parties to accept the plan as presented. In light of the political position that the President finds himself -- a difficult opposition looking for any reason to attack him and a declining popularity -- it would be surprising if he used what little leverage he has to provide any forcible action in this arena.

Another approach being suggested by some in Israel calls for a ""framework agreement"" that would outline some of the key elements of a final status agreement such as the percent of West Bank areas allocated to each party but not resolve all the claims. It is suggested that this approach be coupled with financial programs that help move the Palestinian closer toward a viable state. However, it is hard to believe that this approach will be acceptable to the Palestinians, even though it is offered coated with financial incentives. The Palestinian leaders will most likely see it as a further delay of their ambition for statehood, allowing Israel time to expand its settlement program, notwithstanding any commitment to the contrary in the agreement.

The other possibility is some form of unilateral withdrawal by Israel even without a mutual agreement. This solution would appeal to those like Israeli author Ari Shavit who argue that Israel should separate itself from the Palestinians for its own benefit but that it should not expect a ""peace"" between them ever to work effectively. For my own part, as a Zionist who has long advocated that Israel avoid a bi-national state or absorbing any large part of the Palestinian population to ensure that it maintains its position as a democratic and Jewish state (see my HuffPost blog A Message From A Long Standing Zionist To The Israeli People, 08/08/2013), I would personally support unilateral withdrawal if a two state solution was impossible to achieve. However, at this time, such a unilateral approach has no significant support in Israel and after the perception of the result of unilateral withdrawal in Gaza and Lebanon, notwithstanding the reality of the benefit of those actions, unilateral action is highly unlikely.

Unhappily, the failure of the effort by Secretary Kerry to bring the parties together will leave a vacuum and no one can predict what will fill it. We are already seeing the beginnings of violence on both sides and one can only hope that it does not erupt in a significant way as it has in the past. Most likely we will see a continued drift along current lines where Israel expands settlements and the Palestinians turn to the UN and International pressure on Israel in the form of boycotts and divestiture. One has to wonder whether this will cause more real damage to Israel than Iran's efforts to achieve nuclear capability. At least, in the latter situation Israel has the overwhelming nuclear capability to face Iran down and also has the United States umbrella of support. What will it have to protect it if somehow it is seen as engaging in apartheid actions? I hope that day never comes; but the expansionist course now being followed by Israel has that danger attached to it.

Story highlights Germany's Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst has been called the ""Bling Bishop"" The bishop's residence in Limburg, Germany, underwent a $42 million renovation The Vatican says the bishop must stay outside his diocese during the investigation

(CNN) —

The Vatican said Wednesday it has suspended a German bishop who has come under fire for his extravagant lifestyle.

Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst is under investigation for his spending after his residence in Limburg, Germany, was renovated for $42 million.

The Vatican says Tebartz-van Elst cannot carry out his ministry as long as the investigation in ongoing, and he’s been ordered to stay outside his diocese.

Called the “Bling Bishop,” Tebartz-van Elst, who is known as theologically conservative, has denied any wrongdoing, saying the cost overruns on the renovation are legitimate because surrounding structures had to be protected, including the old city wall.

But many people in Limburg and elsewhere want the bishop to step down.

“He built his office on lies,” said Limburg resident Patrick Dehm. “This must come to an end. The diocese doesn’t deserve this.”

For papal biographer Marco Politi it’s not that simple. “The Pope is sending Bishop Tebartz-van Elst into exile for two months,” he told CNN affiliate RTL. “That is indeed a punishment, but a lot now depends on what the investigating committee will say.”

Some German media have come down hard on the bishop, with Der Spiegel criticizing him for taking a first-class flight to India, where he visited with the poor. Tebartz-van Elst said that he had gotten an upgrade and that he’s no fan of champagne or caviar.

For his latest trip to the Vatican, he reportedly flew on a budget airline.

The planning for intense attacks over a three-day period reflects the growing belief in the White House and the Pentagon that the United States needs more firepower to inflict even minimal damage on Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces, which have been widely dispersed over the last two weeks, the officials said.

Two U.S. officers said the White House asked for an expanded target list in recent days to include many more than the 50 or so targets on the initial list. As a result, Pentagon planners are weighing whether to use Air Force bombers, in addition to five warships now on patrol in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, to launch cruise missiles and air-to-surface missiles from hundreds of miles offshore, well out of range of Syrian air defenses.

Syria is also within range of an aircraft carrier strike group in the Red Sea, which includes one cruiser and three destroyers, all capable of firing cruise missiles.

“There will be several volleys and an assessment after each volley, but all within 72 hours and a clear indication when we are done,” said one officer familiar with the planning.

The officers requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the campaign.

The stepped-up military planning comes as President Obama and his aides prepared to press their own offensive to seek public support, as well as congressional votes for authorization to use military force to punish Assad’s government for alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians last month.

Obama plans to blanket the nation’s airwaves in coming days to make his case to a skeptical public. Aides say he will tape interviews Monday with the anchors of CBS, NBC and ABC, the three major broadcast networks, as well as with PBS, CNN and Fox News. He also will address the nation from the Oval Office on Tuesday, the night before the full Senate is expected to vote.

Obama, who has declined to say whether he would order an attack if Congress votes against it, gave a preview of his argument in his weekly radio address Saturday.

“Failing to respond to this outrageous attack would increase the risk that chemical weapons could be used again, that they would fall into the hands of terrorists who might use them against us, and it would send a horrible signal to other nations that there would be no consequences for their use of these weapons,” he said.

The administration ran into a new diplomatic roadblock Saturday at the European Union.

Foreign ministers of the EU’s 28 member nations, meeting in Vilnius, Lithuania, said that “the international community cannot remain idle” after reports that poison gas was used Aug. 21 against neighborhoods near Damascus held by rebels trying to topple Assad.

But despite the presence of U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, the EU declined to back a military strike without approval of such intervention by the United Nations. American officials say they see almost no chance of winning a resolution for use of force in the U.N. Security Council because Russia, a permanent member with veto power, is Assad’s strongest international backer.

The EU ministers noted that U.N. chemical weapons inspectors were expected to report on their findings in Syria. They also welcomed a decision by French President Francois Hollande, a vocal advocate of a military strike, to wait for the inspectors’ report before taking further action.

Obama still favors a limited attack that would not involve sending large numbers of warplanes over Syria to drop bombs, officials said.

But some military officers are doubtful that even a longer air campaign, using cruise missiles fired from offshore, will hurt Assad enough to degrade his forces and to deter future use of chemical weapons. One officer described the planned operation as little more than a multi-day “show of force,” not a game-changer in Syria’s bitter civil war.

The planned U.S. attack “will not strategically impact the current situation in the war, which the Syrians have well in hand, though fighting could go on for another two years,” said another U.S. officer familiar with the latest intelligence estimates.

The Obama administration hopes that by denying Assad the option of resorting to chemical weapons and by providing some additional weapons and training to rebel fighters, it will boost the now remote chances of negotiations that might lead to Assad’s exit.

The administration has struggled over the last week with the competing demands of hitting Syria hard enough to undermine Assad’s resolve but not hard enough to undermine support by members of Congress who are leery of being drawn into another Middle East war. A smaller contingent has urged Obama to provide more muscular support for the rebels seeking to oust Assad.

Facing such cross-currents, administration officials and top Pentagon officers have veered between describing the planned attack as a limited operation that will not significantly tilt the balance of power in Syria and a punishing attack that will degrade the Syrian military’s equipment and forces capable of delivering chemical weapons and deter Assad from using them.

The current planning tries to thread the needle. After the initial round of strikes, the Pentagon will assess the damage inflicted on Syrian forces using satellite imagery and other surveillance systems. The U.S. military then can either hit targets that weren’t destroyed or choose new ones to ensure that Assad suffers significant losses, current and former military officers said.

“It’s got to lead to something or we’re going to be back in the same situation a year from now,” said Mark Kimmitt, a retired Army brigadier general and former top Middle East planner who served as a Pentagon and State Department official during the George W. Bush administration. “So we’ve got to have a larger target set.”

Pentagon planners also are offering options to hit Assad again if he or his regional proxies retaliate against the United States or its allies, the two officers said.

Administration officials have signaled that they intend to move ahead with their plans to provide arms to some Syrian rebel factions, a demand by Sen. John McCain of Arizona and other Republicans who have called for aiding the rebels in return for their supporting any resolution to authorize force.

In closed-door briefings with lawmakers last week, the administration said Assad’s conventional forces were concentrated around Damascus, the capital, and in the north of Syria. But many installations and pieces of equipment, including rocket launchers, tanks and other hardware, have been moved in the last two weeks to avoid as much as possible the expected U.S. attack.

Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged during two days of congressional testimony the possibility of follow-up strikes. He said the Syrian military was moving forces, making more difficult the task of striking units and equipment capable of delivering chemical agents.

“At this point our intelligence is keeping up with that movement,” Dempsey said. He also noted reports that prisoners and other noncombatants had been moved to potential military targets where the U.S. might strike.

The first substantive peace talks in years between Israel and the Palestinians began Monday evening in Washington.

The first substantive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians in years will begin in Washington after Israeli leaders agreed to release 104 Palestinian prisoners.

The first substantive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians in years will begin in Washington after Israeli leaders agreed to release 104 Palestinian prisoners.

The first substantive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians in years will begin Monday evening in Washington, the Obama administration announced, after Israeli leaders agreed Sunday to release 104 Palestinian prisoners.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the preliminary talks will be led by Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni and chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. The talks, which will continue Tuesday, are expected to address the framework for full negotiations to follow — the talks about talks that had preceded past attempts at a deal.

The release of Palestinian prisoners was one of the major roadblocks to the peace talks.

Calling the prisoner decision “painful for the entire nation,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won the approval of his divided cabinet earlier Sunday to release the Palestinian inmates, many convicted of killing Israelis, to help restart peace talks brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry.

The list of prisoners who may be released in coming days includes militants who threw firebombs, in one case at a bus carrying children; stabbed and shot civilians, including women, elderly Jews and suspected Palestinian collaborators; and ambushed and killed border guards, police officers, security agents and soldiers. All of them have been in prison for at least two decades; some were serving life sentences.

The Israeli public views these prisoners as terrorists who have blood on their hands. Palestinians see them as freedom fighters struggling to reclaim their homeland and oust the occupiers. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his leadership refused to return to the negotiating table without their release.

Regardless of whether it is a grudging gesture of goodwill, diplomatic blackmail or something in between, Netanyahu’s move is a major concession to Kerry and the Palestinians.

In a sign of Israeli divisions over the prisoner release, the vote among Netanyahu’s cabinet ministers was 13 to 7, with two abstentions.

In a parallel move, the cabinet also approved Netanyahu’s call for a national referendum that would allow voters to approve or reject any peace deal he makes.

Israeli officials said the prisoners will be released in four stages over the next nine months, with the first release to take place soon after the initial talks in Washington.

Erekat called it “a step toward peace” and said, “I hope that we can use this opportunity that the U.S. has provided for us to resume negotiations,” according to the Associated Press.

More prisoners would be freed as negotiations continue, though Netanyahu warned that “every Palestinian provocation will result in halting of the prisoner-

release process.”

The Israeli prime minister called the prisoners he was about to release “depraved people, even if most of them have been in prison for over 20 years.”

This is not the first time that Netanyahu has struck such a deal. In 2011, the Israeli government traded about 1,000 Palestinian and Arab Israeli prisoners for the release of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier abducted by Hamas militants near the Kerem Shalom crossing into the Gaza Strip in 2006. He had been held for five years.

In an “open letter to Israeli citizens” published Saturday night, Netanyahu explained, “This is an incomparably difficult decision, it is painful for the bereaved families and it is painful for the entire nation and it is also very painful for me.”

Kerry, who has made several visits to the region since taking office in February to nudge the Israelis and Palestinians closer to negotiations, said last week that the possibility of finally resolving a conflict that has spanned more than 60 years is the“granddaddy” of international diplomacy.

On Thursday, Kerry chaired a special session of the U.N. General Assembly, during which he praised Israeli and Palestinian leaders for their “courageous decision to try to return to final-status talks.”

State Department officials who briefed reporters on his effort last week said the goal is intensive talks over about nine months. The agreement would set West Bank borders and include promises about Israel’s security once it no longer occupies the West Bank.

Although most polls show that a majority of Israelis support the peace process, releasing prisoners is unpopular across the political spectrum.

“From time to time, prime ministers are called on to make decisions that go against public opinion — when the matter is important for the country,” Netanyahu said in the open letter. He added: “It seems to me that it is very important for the State of Israel to enter into a diplomatic process.”

The prime minister said dramatic change in the region — in Egypt, Syria and Iran — create not only challenges but also “considerable opportunities for us” to strike a deal with the Palestinians.

Netanyahu stressed that although he agreed to release prisoners — and to do so only after talks begin — he rejected a Palestinian demand for a freeze on new construction in the Jewish settlements in the West Bank.

According to Israeli media, Netanyahu told Kerry that over the next nine months, as many as 1,000 new units may be approved for construction in West Bank and East Jerusalem settlements.

Netanyahu was silent on a third Palestinian demand — that negotiations about borders for a future Palestinian state begin with the pre-1967 armistice lines.

Qadura Fares, president of the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society, welcomed the prisoner release as “the right decision for negotiations.”

“It will only help to create an atmosphere of calm. It shows that the state of Israel really does want peace,” he said.

Fares warned, however, that the prisoners must be released to their homes — that a prisoner who hails from Ramallah in the West Bank, for example, not be expelled to the Gaza Strip.

The prisoners have been held since before the signing of the 1993 Oslo Accords, which created interim and limited self-

government for the Palestinians and called for the Israeli military’s withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005.

Because the prisoners’ crimes date to the 1980s and 1990s, in an era before suicide bombing became a widespread Palestinian tactic, the attackers used molotov cocktails, knives, guns and grenades. Many of the attackers were members of Abbas’s Fatah party, and many of their targets were Israeli soldiers.

The Israeli government has not provided details on who would be released and when. But according to Israeli media, Israeli victims groups and Palestinian activists, the list of prisoners to be freed might include Jumaa Adem and Mahmoud Kharbish, who threw a firebomb into a bus in the Jordan Valley in 1988, killing Rachel Weiss and her three children, as well as David Dolorosa, the Israeli soldier who tried to save them.

As Netanyahu and his cabinet debated the release for more than six hours, a few hundred protesters, including relatives of those killed by the Palestinian prisoners, gathered outside the prime minister’s office during the vote and waved signs illustrated with bloody palm prints.

Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, the third most powerful politician in Netanyahu’s government, briefly joined the protest and said he is against the release.

“Terrorists should be eliminated, not freed,” he said, according to the Yedioth Ahronoth news Web site.

Bennett called Netanyahu’s move “a mark of disgrace” and tore into the Palestinian leadership. Anyone “who demands the release of people who murdered and burned children and women is not worthy of being called a ‘partner,’ ” he said.

Other members of Bennett’s Jewish Home party stood beside him and said the release was a sign of weakness, not strength, and was done to appease Washington, which they said would never stoop to releasing terrorists.

“We need to act just like the United States. They have no pity for terrorists. But we are asked to be empathetic,” Meir Indor, leader of the Almagor Terror Victims Association, said in an interview. “The Americans shouldn’t ask us to do what they wouldn’t do themselves.”

Yoni Chetboun, a member of parliament from Bennett’s party who was at the protest, told the Jerusalem Post, “A government that ignores its values so quickly just to enter negotiations will not think twice before uprooting settlements.”

What to do about the 360,000 people living in some 150 Jewish settlements in the West Bank is one of the core issues facing negotiators.

Members of Netanyahu’s party also voiced opposition. “I’m disappointed by the stance of our American allies and the West who adopt this twisted idea and see releasing murderers as something that promotes peace, and building a kindergarten as destroying peace,” Deputy Foreign Minister Zeev Elkin said in a statement.

Elkin was referring to U.S. and European opposition to further construction — of schools and houses — in settlements in the West Bank.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-cancels-putin-summit-amid-snowden-tensions-201838010.html,,[],Obama cancels Putin summit amid Snowden tensions,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Already faltering, President Barack Obama's five-year effort to reboot U.S.-Russian relations finally crashed Wednesday, as the White House abruptly canceled his planned face-to-face summit with Russia's Vladimir Putin.

The effort to upgrade the relationship has fallen victim to the rapidly shrinking common ground between the former Cold War rivals, including extreme differences over the Syrian civil war, Russia's domestic crackdown on civil rights and — the final straw — the asylum granted to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.

The U.S. and Russian foreign and defense ministers will sit down in Washington later this week, but Obama canceled his planned early September summit in Moscow with Putin because of what the White House called a lack of ""recent progress"" on a wide array of critical issues. Such steps are not taken lightly, and the decision will almost certainly herald a new frostiness in already chilly ties.

""We have informed the Russian government that we believe it would be more constructive to postpone the summit until we have more results from our shared agenda,"" the White House said in a statement, citing deep differences over missile defense, arms control, trade, global security and human rights. ""Russia's disappointing decision to grant Edward Snowden temporary asylum was also a factor that we considered in assessing the current state of our bilateral relationship,"" it added.

The Kremlin responded quickly, voicing its own disappointment with the canceled summit and blaming it on Washington's inability to develop relations with Moscow on an ""equal basis."" Putin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, added that the decision was ""clearly linked"" to the Snowden case, a situation that he said wasn't of Russia's making.

While Snowden might have been the immediate catalyst for canceling the summit, the seeds of renewed U.S.-Russia discord were planted more than a year ago when Putin re-took the Russian presidency. On returning to power, he adopted a deeply nationalistic and more openly confrontational stance toward the United States than had his chosen successor Dmitry Medvedev, whose 2008-2012 tenure roughly overlapped Obama's first term in the White House.

Story continues

Where Medvedev abstained in a U.N. Security Council vote that authorized NATO airstrikes in Libya, Putin has refused repeated entreaties from Washington to allow the world body to impose even minimal sanctions on President Bashar Assad's Syria. At the same time, Putin's government has continued to supply its ally Assad with weapons. And it has not delivered on pledges to coax Assad into sending representatives to talks with the opposition aimed at finding a political solution to the Syrian conflict.

Obama sought to cultivate Medvedev as a friend of the United States, making significant changes to Bush administration plans for European missile defense to try to ease Russian concerns about that project, signing a new arms control treaty and famously sending then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva where she proclaimed a ""reset"" in U.S.-Russia relations.

Putin, however, seems to want none of the coziness that a ""reset"" would bring and has actively sought to undo previous agreements on cooperation. Under Putin, Russia has stepped up its negative rhetoric on missile defense, ended two decades of democracy and civil society training by the U.S. Agency for International Development and banned adoptions of Russian children by Americans.

Andrew Kuchins, a political scientist and expert on Russian politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks the reset has been on hold for a while.

""We hit the peak at the end of 2010, and then things started going downhill gradually in 2011,"" Kuchins said. ""Then, when the announcement was made that Putin was coming back as president in the fall of 2011, the downfall of the reset got a little steeper. ""

But he said he does not think that Putin wants to ""trash"" the U.S.-Russia relationship and doesn't think relations are as bad as they were after the Georgia war in the fall of 2008 and 2009. In 2008, Georgia and Russia fought a brief war after Georgia launched an intense artillery barrage on the capital of South Ossetia, and Mikhail Saakashvili, the president of the former Soviet republic, forged a deeper relationship with the U.S.

""That was a pretty dangerous moment for the relationship,"" Kuchins said. ""Right now, I don't see such a dangerous moment in the relationship, but we have some fundamental disagreements on nuclear security, missile defense, Syria. I don't think the Russians are taking positions just to counter us, undermine us. But they have some fundamental differences. They have a different way of looking at some things.""

Ivo Daalder, former U.S. ambassador to NATO and now president of The Chicago Council on Global Affairs, said some positive steps have come from the reset, including Russia's willingness to help the U.S. transport military materiel in and out of Afghanistan.

""There still is cooperation on areas like Iran where Russia voted four times in the U.N. Security Council to impose new sanctions,"" Daalder said. ""There is cooperation on North Korea — Russia has voted for new sanctions. And those are material, positive steps in the relationship that have been the result of the reset.""

But he said that a reset also suggests a future relationship and that despite meetings Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and former National Security Adviser Tom Donilon have had with Russian officials, there has been little progress on Syria, nuclear arms reduction and missile defense issues.

In April, Obama asked Donilon to hand-deliver a letter to Putin, proposing new ways to cooperate. Ushakov, Putin's foreign affairs adviser, said Obama's letter was ""quite constructive"" and contained specific proposals regarding arms control and economic cooperation.

But Daalder said Russia's responses to the letter have been ""either nonexistent or negative.""

Putin and Obama last met in June, on the sidelines of the summit of the Group of Eight industrial nations.

Putin said then that he believed the U.S. and Russia had an ""opportunity to move forward on most sensitive directions.""

Obama said then that the two nations were poised to increase trade and investment and had pledged to continue to work together to counter potential threats of proliferation and to enhance nuclear security.

""I think this is an example of the kind of constructive, cooperative relationship that moves us out of a Cold War mindset,"" Obama said.

That was just seven weeks ago.

On Tuesday, a day before he canceled his meeting with Putin, Obama said on NBC's ""The Tonight Show"" that there have been times where the Russians ""slip back into Cold War thinking and a Cold War mentality.""

He Has Been With The Los Angeles Times Since', 'Covering Technology News Before Joining The Opinion Section.']",Chemical weapons and Syria: How do you deter a desperate despot?,"At what point does a civil war become an atrocity that the world cannot abide? In Syria, the answer appears to be right about now, at least from the Obama administration’s perspective.

Which brings us to the obvious follow-up question: Then what?

The administration appears convinced that President Bashar Assad’s government used chemical weapons in a large-scale attack on civilians, crossing a “red line” that President Obama drew some months ago. Even opponents of U.S. involvement in Syria -- including The Times’ editorial board -- have acknowledged that the use of chemical weapons is intolerable. In order to deter the use of such toxins, anyone who takes such a desperate step has to suffer consequences.

In Assad’s case, though, the only thing he values is his hold on the Syrian government. The same probably could be said of any despot who gasses opponents; it’s the tactic of someone desperately clinging to power. That means the only consequence that matters is one that removes that hold.

My colleague Ken Dilanian had an instructive piece Tuesday that underlines this point. The carefully calibrated punishments meted out on despots and terrorists in past years by the United States haven’t done much to change their behavior; witness the airstrikes on Iraqi weapons facilities in 1998, which didn’t exactly rein in Saddam Hussein. Even former Libyan strongman Moammar Kadafi, who was supposedly scared straight by airstrikes on his living quarters in 1986, was still supporting terrorist attacks such as the one that blew up a commercial airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.

The United States has gained plenty of experience in deposing governments in recent years, often at an enormous cost for all concerned. And while we’ve been quite effective when it comes to removing heads of state, we’ve had mixed results at best when it comes to installing stable replacements.

In Syria, it’s conceivable that the United States could limit its response to delivering a blow to Assad’s military that’s so damaging, he can’t hold off the opposition forces. I’m not sure what that would look like, but it might involve a sustained air campaign against Assad’s heavy weaponry, air force and air defenses.

Just for the sake of argument, let’s assume we could do that and then stand back while Syrian rebels gradually wear down Assad’s forces. We would be making a statement about the use of chemical weapons, but in the end, Syria would be taken over by ... who knows? That’s one of the reasons the Obama administration has been so hesitant to throw in with the rebels.

And still, if the United States doesn’t respond to Assad gassing a rebel city -- should that war crime be confirmed -- what’s to stop the next dictator from (literally) putting down the opposition with toxins? Every nation around the globe has an interest in keeping that particularly nasty genie trapped in a bottle, and not just for humanitarian reasons. The more such weapons creep toward respectability, the more they will be produced, which means the easier they will be for terrorists and anti-democratic forces to find through black-market channels.

The death toll from Assad’s alleged use of chemical weapons -- about 350, according to Doctors Without Borders -- is a tiny fraction of the German civilians killed when Allied forces in World War II firebombed Dresden, or the Japanese civilians killed by U.S. atomic weapons, or the Jewish civilians killed in Nazi concentration camps. Happily, the world has come to view (and the Geneva Conventions confirm) that civilians are not legitimate targets. The fact that the death toll in Syria hasn’t reached the proportions of yore is no reason to shrug it off; doing so would just ensure that the civilian casualties rise.

Nor is it much help to note how many more civilians have died in Syria from conventional weapons. As much as we might like to deter civil wars, the United States’ interests really kick in when forces resort to weapons of mass destruction.

So the case for doing something seems clear. What that action should be, however, is anything but.

Over the next two decades, officials published 534 maps of active earthquake faults. New construction was prohibited on top of these fissures because previous quakes showed that buildings could be torn apart during violent shaking.

But the mapping campaign has slowed to a crawl — with many dangerous faults still undocumented.

Since 1991, only 23 have been drawn. Because of budget cuts, none were completed between 2004 and 2011, according to records reviewed by The Times.

State officials said there are still about 300 maps to draw and even more to revise — including some in heavily populated areas of Southern California. That represents about 2,000 miles of faults statewide.

The slow pace affects public safety. The ban on building atop faults is enforced only for those formally mapped by the state; the regulations don’t cover faults not on California’s official map.

It has become an issue in recent months because of several new developments planned along the Hollywood fault, which runs through the heart of the famed entertainment district. A high-rise development has been approved by the Los Angeles City Council along the fault area, and another large mixed-use project nearby is already under construction.

State law requires new buildings located near faults mapped by the state to perform extensive testing to prove their structures are not on top of the fissures.

But the Hollywood fault has not been officially mapped, even though the state has known of its existence for decades.

The state geologist’s office said it hopes to complete mapping the Hollywood fault by 2014. After that, officials want to concentrate on the Santa Monica fault in the Westside. Officials are also concerned about several other zones they believe need further seismic research, including San Diego Harbor, Yorba Linda, the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, Indio, Napa County and South Lake Tahoe.

The state geologist’s budget has dropped from $9.1 million in 2001 to $2.9 million for the current fiscal year. State geologist John Parrish said his office scraped up funding from its existing budget to restart the mapping program last year, though he said progress has been slow.

“We try to perform as best we can do,” Parrish said.

Many earthquake faults have already been extensively researched by scientists at places such as USC, Caltech and the University of California. When creating a map, the state reviews all this outside research and draws a roughly quarter-mile zone around the fault. Under the state’s Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning act, developers in that zone must prove their structure does not sit on top of the active faults.

The 557 maps the state has completed represent various parts of different fault lines, including such well-known ones as the San Andreas, Hayward and Newport-Inglewood.

Experts say it’s crucial to complete the mapping to keep new structures away from dangerous areas straddling faults.

“Then there’s no mistake [about] the red line,” said retired state geologist Robert Sydnor. “It helps at the political level: the city council and the mayor cannot somehow override” it.

James Dolan, a USC earth sciences professor who has experience mapping faults, recalled driving through the Westside when he was doing research on the Santa Monica fault 20 years ago. “I was stunned to see, either right next to or on top of where I was mapping the fault, a big building in excavation,” he said.

He called around and found out the fault had not been officially mapped by the state, so the property was not covered by the law.

Seismic safety experts have long studied the destruction caused above faults when big quakes strike. But the Sylmar quake reinforced the risks to officials.

One side of the San Fernando fault moved as much as 8 feet from the other side. Many homes and commercial buildings were severely damaged by the ground fracturing. About 80% of the buildings along the fault suffered severe to moderate damage.

The law applies to new construction along faults. But the discovery of fissures has led some to take action. Los Angeles Southwest College demolished two buildings in 1991 that straddled the Newport-Inglewood fault. The Los Angeles Unified School District tore down a portion of the new Belmont Learning Center after finding that a fault ran underneath it.

In Hayward, the original City Hall sits on the Hayward fault and has slowly been damaged by earth movement. The city abandoned the building after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.

Between the 1987 Whittier Narrows quake and the 1994 Northridge quake, some cities stepped up production of their own fault maps. But Parrish said that city mapping has now essentially stopped.

In the case of the Hollywood fault, The Times found the city’s map incomplete. It does not include some sections of the fault drawn in maps published in scientific journals and by federal and state agencies.

Back in the 1970s, the state began its mapping by focusing on faults with recent histories of major ruptures, such as the San Andreas, which caused both the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the Loma Prieta quake. By contrast, the Hollywood fault is capable of producing a 7.0 earthquake but hasn’t ruptured in modern L.A. history.

Parrish said state officials also had to pay special attention to mapping areas where an earthquake could cause soil to liquefy into mud. The dangers of liquefaction became apparent in 1989, when parts of San Francisco’s Marina district were destroyed.

Still, Parrish said there are many faults in populated areas that need to be mapped.

“If you don’t know what’s there, then it’s easy to just ignore it,” he said. “That’s why the Legislature set it up that they be zoned — to make local planning departments aware of these high-hazard areas.”

The landmark earthquake law that started the mapping was co-written by the late state Sen. Alfred E. Alquist, who was considered a champion of seismic safety.

His wife, Elaine Alquist, recently retired after serving in the state Senate. Fault mapping took a back seat during the state’s long financial crisis of the last decade, but Alquist said she believes now is the time for the Legislature to begin investing again.

“We have a history in California and in America of not doing things to take care of issues until somebody dies,” Alquist said. “It would be a crying shame that we have not updated our process for mapping fault lines.... We need to put money into this. We need to know exactly where the fault lines are.”

Holder's March 4 letter was disclosed by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who had asked whether the Justice Department believed President Barack Obama had the legal authority to order a targeted strike against an American citizen located within the United States.

The Obama administration, Holder said, rejected the use of military force where ""well-established law enforcement authorities in this country provide the best means for incapacitating a terrorist threat."" But in theory, it'd be legal for the president to order such an attack under certain circumstances, Holder said.

""The question you have posed is therefore entirely hypothetical, unlikely to occur, and one we hope no president will ever have to confront. It is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States,"" Holder wrote.

""For example, the president could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the military to use such force if necessary to protect the homeland in the circumstances like a catastrophic attack like the ones suffered on December 7, 1941, and September 11, 2001,"" Holder continued, referring to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Holder said he would ""examine the particular facts and circumstances"" if such an emergency were to arise.

Paul, who had threatened to filibuster the nomination of John Brennan as CIA director over secrecy about the U.S. drone program, said in a statement that Holder's ""refusal to rule out the possibility of drone strikes on American citizens and on American soil is more than frightening -- it is an affront the Constitutional due process rights of all Americans."" Holder's letter was first reported by Adam Serwer of Mother Jones.

Holder is scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a Justice Department oversight hearing on Wednesday morning. Earlier in the day, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee said the administration had agreed to allow members of the committee to see all of the Office of Legal Counsel memos relating to the targeted killing of American citizens."

Jeff Sessions tries to halt the inevitable","Not since George Wallace, perhaps, has an Alabamian taken as passionate a stand for a lost cause as the one Jeff Sessions is taking now.

Bipartisan immigration legislation is making its way inexorably through the Senate Judiciary Committee. Although its ultimate fate is unclear, its passage by the committee is assured, and conservatives on the panel such as ranking Republican Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and Orrin Hatch (Utah) are doing what they can to improve the bill. Even firebrands such as Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Mike Lee (Utah) are holding fire.

Then there’s Sessions. The wiry Southerner is on a one-man crusade to undo the compromise drafted by the Gang of Eight (four of whom, two Democrats and two Republicans, are colleagues on the committee).

He has dominated the four days of hearings to “mark up” the bill. As of midday Monday, he had spoken for two hours and 56 minutes — far longer than the second-place Grassley (2:24) and third-place Chuck Schumer of New York (1:38).

As of lunchtime Monday, Sessions had persuaded his colleagues to adopt just two of the 49 amendments he filed. (He voted against one of those two, after his colleagues modified it in a way he didn’t like.)

His most prominent defeat: a 17-1 vote last week against his proposal to restrict legal immigration. Before that bipartisan rebuke, he spent one hour and 11 minutes arguing his case.

On Monday morning, Sessions was up against a bipartisan majority again, this time opposing an amendment by fellow Republican Hatch to expand the use of fingerprinting. Sessions objected, saying the proposal didn’t go far enough.

His face flushing crimson, he waved a Department of Homeland Security report in the air that he said was being kept secret because it concluded that such “biometric” immigration checks weren’t as costly as claimed.

“I’m highly offended!” Sessions shouted in his trademark twang. “This is why the American people are upset about this! They don’t trust their government! . . . Now, that’s the truth. And I’m getting dad gum tired of it.”

“Well,” Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) replied calmly, “a lot of people are tired about a lot of things.” Leahy tried to call a vote on the amendment, but Sessions interrupted.

“Mr. Chairman, I had some other things to say about it,” he announced. Sessions had his say, then Leahy tried again to move along.

“Wait, one more thing,” Sessions said. “I’m concerned about this. I have the floor.”

“I’m sorry, I thought you’d finished,” the chairman said.

“I know you like to interrupt,” the petulant Alabamian complained. “I’m trying to explain a thought.”

“Repeat your statement as often as you’d like,” Leahy said. “You have the right.”

Sessions spoke again, and again. Then four of his seven GOP colleagues voted against him and sided with Democrats to approve Hatch’s amendment.

Even his fellow Republicans have at times become exasperated with him. Early in Monday’s session, Grassley was asking a question of Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) when Sessions interrupted. “I just want to follow up a little bit on that,” he said.

Grassley said he didn’t want people to think “we’re asking these questions to stall. I’d like to not have a debate, if we could.”

“I’m not debating,” Sessions muttered.

This is true. Sessions isn’t debating. He’s doing whatever he can to retard the inevitable. At every opportunity — regardless of the amendment under consideration — he gives speeches about the evils of the compromise.

Even before the panel considered the first of its amendments Monday morning, Sessions piped up. “Um, I would just note that this is not a bill that strengthens border enforcement,” he declared, then proceeded to read a pair of letters from opponents.

Minutes later, Sessions demanded to be heard on an amendment, even though its sponsor, Grassley, had withdrawn it.

“The amendment is no longer before us,” Leahy told him.

“Well, I know, but it’s very important,” Sessions said.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) brought up a noncontroversial amendment about elder abuse. “All those in favor?” Leahy asked.

“Mr. Chairman?” Sessions broke in, requesting more time to speak.

After the senators voted down one of Sessions’s amendments (it would have denied a low-income tax credit to those earning legal status), they moved to an amendment by Chris Coons (D-Del.) to simplify deportation hearings. “I’m very concerned about this amendment,” Sessions announced. After Coons tried to offer reassurance, Sessions declared, “I’m afraid your attempts to answer the questions I’ve raised are not sufficient.”

Leahy held a voice vote. The only audible “no” came from the man from Alabama.

An unmanned drone came within 200 feet of a commercial jet over New York, triggering an FBI appeal to the public for any information about the unusual and potentially dangerous incident.

The crew of Alitalia Flight 608 approaching John F. Kennedy airport on Monday reported the sighting.

“We saw a drone, a drone aircraft,” the pilot can be heard telling air traffic controllers on radio calls captured by the website LiveATC.net.

CNN Explains: U.S. drones

The FAA said it was investigating the incident.

The Alitalia aircraft did not take any evasive action and landed safely.

The FBI expanded on the FAA report, saying in a statement that the Alitalia flight from Rome was roughly three miles from runway 31R when the incident occurred at an altitude of approximately 1,750 feet.

The unmanned aircraft, described by the FBI as black and no more than three feet wide with four propellers, came within 200 feet of the Boeing jetliner.

The FBI said it was looking to identify and locate the aircraft and its operator. A source with knowledge of the incident says investigators interviewed the pilot and others on the Alitalia plane.

“The FBI is asking anyone with information about the unmanned aircraft or the operator to contact us,” said Special Agent in Charge John Giacalone. “Our paramount concern is the safety of aircraft passengers and crew.”

Air traffic controllers warned other planes approaching the JFK runway of the drone report, but at least two other pilots radioed they did not see it.

A spokesman for the New York Police Department was not aware of the incident and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, referred CNN to the FAA.

Unmanned aerial systems, sometimes called drones, and other remote-controlled planes could pose a risk to larger passenger aircraft if they collided or were sucked into an engine.

For recreational hobbyists, flying remote-controlled planes is only allowed by the FAA up to 400 feet, and within sight of the operator. If they are going to fly within three miles of an airport, they have to let air traffic controllers know.

Flying unmanned aerial vehicles is illegal for most business purposes; however, governments and public entities such as police departments can apply for permission to operate them.

The FAA has been working to setup new rules and to safely integrate the use of unmanned aircraft into the national air space, and last year opened an “unmanned aircraft systems integration” office.

Marco Rubio (R-FL), will argue Friday that groups opposed to the immigration bill pending in the U.S. Senate are “nativists,” Breitbart News has learned.

ATR’s Josh Culling and Hispanic Leadership Fund (HLF) president Mario Lopez will make the argument on a conference call with mainstream media reporters on Friday at 11 AM EDT. Brad Bailey of an organization called Texas Immigration Studies will join them on the call.

“As the momentum behind immigration reform continues to build and strengthen, an anti-immigrant opposition is working to scuttle and kill immigration efforts in Congress,” those organizing the press call said in a release obtained by Breitbart News (emphasis added):

Many of these groups are deeply associated with John Tanton, the father of the modern anti-immigrant movement, and his network of nativist groups, including the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), NumbersUSA, and the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). Over the years, Tanton’s network has extended its reach beyond these groups and to some of the most vocal opponents of immigration reform in Congress. [emphasis added]

The authors of the press release added that Culling, Lopez and Bailey–described in the release as “conservative leaders”–will “dive deep into the inner-workings of John Tanton’s network–including its influence on legislators, its ties to radical population control activists, and its opposition to all immigration (including legal immigration)==and discuss the potential implications of the Tanton network and its involvement in the current immigration debate.”

Culling is ATR’s Government Affairs Manager and is working on Norquist’s behalf to lobby for the passage of the Gang of Eight legislation in the Senate. Lopez is working specifically with Rubio to do the same.

In February, Lopez distributed a paper with his byline around Capitol Hill promoting a similar message to this press release. According to the Washington Post‘s Peter Wallsten, in early February, Rubio and his staff brought Lopez into meetings to encourage him to discredit groups like the Center for Immigration Studies, NumbersUSA, and Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR).

“Rubio’s aides last week brought one of the organizers of the effort to undermine the groups, Mario H. Lopez, a party strategist on Hispanic politics, to a regular meeting of GOP Senate staffers, at which Lopez distributed literature about the groups’ backgrounds and connections,” Wallsten wrote on February 13. “Rubio also raised concerns about the groups’ leanings during a recent conference call on immigration with conservative activists.”

Wallsten noted at the time that Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said the Senator “has argued that some groups that oppose legal immigration should not be considered part of the conservative coalition,” and the “vast majority of Republicans strongly support legal immigration.” Conant has not responded to requests for comment from Breitbart News regarding these remarks, nor has Rubio’s outreach director, J.R. Sanchez, or his chief of staff, Cesar Conda.

Lopez’s ties to Rubio go back to the Florida junior Senator’s early days in national politics. Lopez touted his support for Rubio from the very beginning of his campaign for Senate. “From the moment that the establishment lined up behind Charlie Crist, the Hispanic Leadership Fund stood up to say that Marco Rubio was the type of leader who belonged in the Senate,” Lopez said in a statement the night Rubio was elected to the U.S. Senate.

Further, Lopez has given quotes to news outlets defending the Senate’s immigration bill and specifically Rubio. “People appreciate his kind of leadership and that he’s taking such a thoughtful approach to the immigration issue,” Lopez said of Rubio, according to the National Journal‘s Beth Reinhard. “People appreciate him stepping up.”

When Lopez previously accused the bill’s opponents of “nativism” earlier this year, Rubio’s team did not publicly rebuke the attacks. According to the Daily Caller’s Neil Munro, Rubio spokesman Conant “downplayed the revelations” that the Senator worked with Lopez on the attack.

Lopez tried to organize a similar conference call on Tuesday but canceled it at the last minute due to what call organizers described as scheduling conflicts. Breitbart News’ Mike Flynn reported before they canceled that call that these figures’ research “draw[s] heavily on” information compiled by the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).

Flynn reported that the original Tuesday call “was scheduled to take place as the Senate was having its first floor vote on the Gang bill.”

The phone number at which they will present this argument on Friday morning at 11 AM EDT is 877-888-4319. The password for the conference call is “TANTON.”"

Carter']","Lawmaker: If CNN can interview Benghazi suspect, why can't FBI?","Story highlights Rep. Jason Chaffetz wants to know why the FBI hasn't interviewed Ahmed Abu Khattala Some have described Khattala as the ringleader of the attack on the consulate Khattala tells CNN that no American or Libyan official has asked to speak to him He denies he had any role in the attack the left ambassador, three other Americans dead

(CNN) —

A Republican lawmaker demanded Wednesday to know why investigators have not captured or killed any of the suspects in the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, pointing out that CNN was able to find a man who some say was the ringleader in the assault that left the ambassador and three other Americans dead.

Eight GOP lawmakers are asking that incoming FBI Director James Comey brief Congress within 30 days about the investigation. They say the administration’s inquiry into the September 11, 2012, attacks in Libya has been “simply unacceptable,” according to a draft letter obtained by CNN.

“One of the pertinent questions today is why we have not captured or killed the terrorist who committed these attacks?” Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told reporters. “News out today that CNN was able to go in and talk to one of the suspected terrorists, how come the military hasn’t been able to get after them and capture or kill the people? How come the FBI isn’t doing this and yet CNN is?”

Chaffetz was referring to CNN’s recent interview with Ahmed Abu Khattala, who Libyan and U.S. officials have described as the Benghazi leader of the al Qaeda-affiliated militia group Ansar al-Sharia – one of many groups that filled the vacuum of authority following the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi.

He has been described as a “person of interest” in the investigation, according to officials.

In that interview, Khattala told CNN’s Arwa Damon that he had not been contacted by any Libyan or American officials.

House panel subpoenas State Department over Benghazi

“Even the investigative team did not try to contact me,” he told Damon, referring to the FBI.

When asked whether he would be willing to meet with investigators if they asked, Khattala said: “Yes, no problem. …But not as an interrogation, as a conversation like the one we are having right now.”

Damon spent two hours interviewing Khattala at a coffee shop at a well-known hotel in Benghazi, describing his demeanor as fairly relaxed. He allowed Damon to use an audio recorder to tape the conversation, but refused to appear on camera.

Khattala’s narrative of the events that night was sometimes unclear and, at times, seemed to be contradictory, Damon said.

He admitted to being at the compound the night of the attack, but denied any involvement in the violence.

When he arrived at the perimeter of the compound, Khattala said he saw men carrying RPGs and medium guns, but that gunfire prevented him from getting close and entering the compound.

Opinion: Benghazi blame game is useless

Khattala said by the time he managed to get inside the compound, everyone had withdrawn. He said he did not see any fires.

Asked about allegations he may have masterminded the attack, Khattala and two of the men he brought with him to the interview “burst out laughing,” Damon said.

Khattala does not appear to be a man who is in hiding, having granted interviews to The New York Times, Reuters and other news agencies in the weeks following the Benghazi attack.

“Rumors continue to swirl about the whereabouts of suspects involved in the attack,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter to Comey, who will replace Robert Mueller as FBI director in September.

“The FBI continues to add pictures of potential assailants to its website and asks the Libyan people to assist with identifying the alleged perpetrators. We struggle to understand why we don’t know more about those who attacked two U.S. compounds and murdered four brave Americans. “

The FBI did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment on the letter.

The letter was initiated by Chaffetz and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, two of the fiercest critics of the administration’s Benghazi response.

Others who agreed to sign the letter included Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. On the House side, Darrell Issa, the chairman of the committee leading the House Benghazi investigation, Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio signed the letter.

In the letter, the lawmakers wrote: “We encourage you to be aggressive in your investigation to properly hold accountable those who attacked our compounds in Benghazi. We owe the families of those killed, and the people of this nation, answers to who was responsible and ensure they are held accountable.”

The attack at the Benghazi diplomatic compound has become a political flashpoint in a long-running battle between the administration and Republicans, who accuse it of not bolstering security before the attack, of botching the response to it and of misleading the public for political gain less than two months before the November election.

White House releases Benghazi e-mails

The GOP suggests the administration removed specific terror references and stuck to an explanation advanced by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice in television appearances – later proved untrue – that the attack was the result of a spontaneous demonstration over an anti-Muslim film that was produced in the United States.

The White House and its allies in Congress have said any confusion and conflicting information in the early hours and days after the assault stemmed from the “fog of war,” not any deliberate effort to mislead the public.

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/movies/20restrepo.html,2010-06-20 00:00:00,['David Carr'],‘Restrepo’: One Platoon’s Deadly Post in Afghanistan,"ASK almost any American, even those opposed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they will state that they “support our troops.”

It’s a lovely thought, that we care for the soldiers who do the fighting regardless of politics at hand. But for the most part public interest and understanding of what American soldiers do on our behalf remains remarkably limited in wars that go mostly untelevised and undernoticed. American men and women fight, die and kill a long ways from home, and many want it to stay that way. “Restrepo,” a documentary directed by Sebastian Junger and Tim Hetherington, which will open on June 25 in Los Angeles and New York, is a 94-minute tutorial on life at the tip of that very sharp spear. Specifically, Mr. Junger, a veteran war correspondent and author of several books, including “The Perfect Storm,” and Mr. Hetherington, a longtime war photographer, spent 14 months, beginning in May 2007, with a platoon of United States soldiers in the Korangal Valley of Afghanistan.

“Restrepo” avoids the conventions of documentary film: there is no back story, no drive-bys with experts for context, no underlying ideology or obvious message. The viewer is dropped into war, with a hard jolt, and resides, along with 15 soldiers from Second Platoon of Battle Company of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, in a remote and raw outpost called Restrepo, so named after one member of the platoon who is killed early in their rotation. In practical terms the soldiers of Second Platoon hump up a mountain with lots of bullets and some shovels and dig in. During the day they make efforts at outreach, handing over food and sometimes cash to local people, many of whom return at night to shoot at them. “It is a weird sort of anti-paradise,” Mr. Junger said in a phone call from Houston, where he was on a book tour for “War,” his best seller based on the same reporting. “They were in the most extreme place in the valley, which was the most extreme place in Afghanistan. By 2007 a fifth of the fighting in Afghanistan took place there.”

The Korangal Valley, full of giant peaks and hidden enemies, has a bit of reputation inside the military."

Yet two days ago Weinstein called the Pentagon demanding that a Christian painting be removed from a dining hall in an Idaho Air Force base, and the Pentagon complied with his demand–in less than one hour.

On Apr. 28, Breitbart News reported that Pentagon brass met with Weinstein and his Military Religious Freedom Foundation. That was shortly after Weinstein published an article in which he called observant Christians “fundamentalist monsters” who seek to impose “a rapacious reign of theocratic terror” in the military through their “putrid theology.”

While he opposes all religion in the military, Weinstein reserves his most caustic language for observant Christians. And the one thing he objects to above all things is proselytizing in the military, which Christians call evangelism.

Regarding evangelism, Weinstein told the Washington Post that, “What is happening aside from sexual assault is spiritual rape. And what the Pentagon needs to understand is that it is sedition and treason. It should be punished.” (Emphases added and brackets omitted.)

Weinstein said service members who evangelize in the military should be court-martialed, and added, “You need a dozen court-martials real quick.” A court martial is a criminal prosecution in the military, which depending on the crime can carry punishments ranging from fines, to expulsion from the military, to imprisonment. In case anyone missed the point, he also said, “We would love to see hundreds of prosecutions.”

It must be noted that the Pentagon says it would not take this drastic step called for by Weinstein. It should also be noted, however, that the Pentagon continues to change its story on what its policy is on evangelism.

Nevertheless, the latest example of Weinstein’s influence with the Obama-Hagel Pentagon came last week, as reported by Fox News’ Todd Starnes. In the dining hall of Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho there was a painting-style picture of a U.S. Airman with imagery of the cross, above the word “Integrity” and with a reference to Matthew 5:9. (That verse reads, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”)

Weinstein called the Pentagon directly to complain about the picture. Less than one hour later, the picture was permanently removed.

Col. Christopher Short, the base commander, told Fox News the artwork was removed because, “We make reasonable accommodations for all religions and celebrate the religious diversity of our Airmen.” It’s an odd statement to say that accommodating religion and celebrating diversity means tearing down Christian artwork.

Weinstein has previously boasted that he has special status with the leadership of the Air Force Academy similar to the “bat signal” from Batman. He explains that:

… he and Superintendent Lt. Gen. Mike Gould devised a code word only they know in case Weinstein needs to reach Gould with concerns about religious liberty on campus. “We have our own bat-signal,” Weinstein said Friday, referring to the beam of light used to summon Batman in the DC Comic series…. Having a means to reach Gould with any concerns is a positive step in the work to make the academy religiously neutral ground, he said. “We had a bad 96-hour period where I felt like we had fallen back to the bad old days,” he said. “Our relationship [now] is stronger than ever.”

Given Weinstein’s published anti-Christian statements, his relationship with top military officials should raise eyebrows.

And it has done so on Capitol Hill. After Breitbart News’ reporting on this relationship, 59 congressmen sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel demanding to know who approved these meetings and what was discussed. A group of 72 congressmen then sent a second letter demanding to know what the Pentagon is doing to protect the First Amendment rights of service members.

Also last week, one of Weinstein’s staff members published a column denigrating Congress’ efforts, and mocking Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) for coauthoring with Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) the letter signed by 59 Members of Congress. Taunting congressional leaders who are probing this situation may provoke lawmakers to amend federal law to clarify and reinforce service members rights regarding sharing their faith.

The Obama-Hagel Pentagon insists that it would never court-martial a Christian for sharing his faith, but fails to explain why it would accept advice from someone aggressively demanding that action. The Pentagon also claims that Weinstein cannot be called a consultant because he’s not paid for his advice and holds no official position. Yet the dictionary defines a consultant as, “a person who gives professional or expert advice.” There is nothing about having an official status or getting a paycheck.

Mikey Weinstein has been meeting with top Pentagon officials during the Obama administration since 2009. He continues to communicate with them at will, and they immediately respond to his demands. He is therefore an unpaid advisor to the Obama-Hagel Pentagon, with considerable influence.

Not only that, but it’s been more than two weeks since roughly 100 congressmen demanded answers from Hagel, but have not heard a word in response. Yet this anti-Christian extremist brags about how the Pentagon leaps into action when he makes a demand, removing Christian artwork in less than an hour.

Lawmakers are likely to intensify their efforts to find out what’s going on here, and what they can do to stop this assault on Christians in the military.

If people miss their flights%2C or give up on flying because it%27s a hassle%2C the TSA doesn%27t suffer.

If bombs got through%2C the consequence probably wouldn%27t be higher-ups at TSA losing their jobs.

The TSA is more about %22security theater%22 designed to give the appearance of security.

In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the United States took a number of rapid actions. One was the passage of the Patriot Act, which I regarded as a mistake then, and which doesn't seem much better now. Another was the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, a bureaucratic monstrosity that doesn't seem to have done much to keep us actually, you know, safer. And another was the federal takeover of aviation security by the Transportation Security Administration, which also seems to have been a bust.

There's now some talk about repealing or revising the Patriot Act, and the failure of the Department of Homeland Security to do much good seems pretty widely acknowledged. But it's widely accepted -- even by the Government Accountability Office -- that the TSA's army of unionized federal employees is no better, and perhaps worse, than private screeners.

This should come as no surprise. When, as was the case before 9/11, security screeners were contractors employed by airlines, they had every incentive to do a good job: Airlines don't want their planes hijacked or blown up. And they also had every incentive to be speedy and pleasant: Airlines don't want to irritate their customers, or to make flying an unpleasant experience in general.

Federal employees have no such incentives, and it often shows. If people miss their flights, or just give up on flying because it's too much hassle, the TSA doesn't suffer. Even if bombs or hijackers get through, the most likely consequence isn't a bunch of higher-ups at TSA losing their jobs -- when does anybody in the government get fired for failure these days? -- but rather an increased budget and more staff ""to make sure this won't happen again."" The incentives don't align.

Most other advanced nations use private screening services, and their security is just fine -- and, according to most accounts, less of a hassle for travelers. Some American airports, from San Francisco to Jackson Hole, are already trying out that approach. Why not take that national?

One reason, of course, is that the TSA's bloated unionized workforce will oppose it. But the TSA is also one of the most unpopular agencies with the public. What's more, as Bruce Schneier notes, it has never caught a terrorist. It's not about security, but about ""security theater"" designed to give the appearance of security. I think the traveling public has caught on to that, and travelers account for more votes than screeners do.

We wanted to be sure that something like 9/11 could never happen again, but as Brad Todd wrote just a few days after the attacks, that was already made sure of by the passengers' themselves on United Flight 93. As Todd wrote:

Just 109 minutes after a new form of terrorism -- the most deadly yet invented -- came into use, it was rendered, if not obsolete, at least decidedly less effective. Deconstructed, unengineered, thwarted and put into the dust bin of history. By Americans. In 109 minutes. And, in retrospect, they did it in the most American of ways. They used a credit card to rent a fancy cell phone to get information just minutes old, courtesy of the ubiquitous 24-hour news phenomenon. Then they took a vote. When the vote called for sacrifice to protect country and others, there apparently wasn't a shortage of volunteers. Their action was swift. It was decisive. And it was effective.

The 9/11 attacks worked because they caught people -- used to theatrical hijackings that didn't kill anyone -- by surprise. Once Americans figured out this new game, which took, as Todd notes, only 109 minutes, they put an end to it by themselves. The creation of the TSA didn't do any good, and it costs a lot of money, and it does a lot of harm. Put an end to it.

He Has Covered The Pentagon', 'Served As The Berlin Bureau Chief', 'Reported More Than Countries. He Joined The Washington Post In']",Navy Secretary Mabus expects bribery scandal to widen,"Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said Friday that he bluntly told criminal investigators to pursue a widening bribery scandal “wherever it leads” and that he expects more people to get swept up in a case that has already tarred several senior officers and exposed an international, multimillion-dollar fraud scheme.

“I certainly don’t think we’ve seen the end of it,” Mabus told reporters at the Pentagon in his first public comments on the scandal since it came to light in September. “I would rather get bad headlines than let bad people get away.”

Mabus, the Navy’s top civilian official since 2009, spoke a day after he held an unusual video conference with the Navy’s fleet commanders and other admirals around the world to emphasize the need to uphold ethical standards and prevent contracting fraud. With the scandal showing no sign of abating, he also has ordered several reviews and an audit into how the Navy pays for port services.

The Navy has been tarnished by a succession of embarrassing revelations over the past three months about its relationship with a major foreign defense contractor, Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia, that has provided port services to U.S. ships and submarines in the Pacific for a quarter-century.

So far, two Navy commanders have been arrested and charged with taking bribes from the company in the form of cash, luxury travel and prostitutes. Two captains have been suspended or reassigned by the Navy. And two admirals who work in Navy intelligence have had their access to classified materials suspended while investigators scrutinize their possible involvement.

In addition, a senior agent with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service pleaded guilty in federal court this week to taking bribes in exchange for leaking inside information to Glenn Defense Marine about the progress of multiple federal probes targeting the firm. Prosecutors estimate that the government was cheated out of more than $20 million by the alleged fraud scheme.

The president of Glenn Defense Marine, Leonard Glenn Francis — a Malaysian national known as “Fat Leonard” in Navy circles — was arrested in September along with another executive during a sting operation. Francis has pleaded not guilty in federal court and is being held without bail in California.

At his news conference, Mabus shed some new light on the apprehensions. He said investigators lured Francis from Singapore to San Diego to meet with Navy officials by planting false information in law enforcement databases indicating that the probes targeting the firm had fizzled and that no charges would be brought. The investigators suspected, correctly, that the rogue NCIS agent would feed the false information to Francis and make him think it was safe to travel to the United States to seek more business from the Navy.

Mabus said other NCIS agents began investigating Glenn Defense Marine in May 2010, “based on suspicious claims and invoices the company submitted to the Navy, claims that internal processes Navy had set up helped reveal.”

Federal court records filed by prosecutors assert that the initial investigation stalled for lack of evidence and because the rogue NCIS agent and Navy officers taking bribes advised Francis how to dodge the inquiry.

Despite lingering suspicions, the Navy continued to sign lucrative business deals with Glenn Defense Marine, including a $1 million no-bid contract extension in July. Mabus defended the arrangements, saying Navy contracting officials were intentionally not told about the law enforcement investigation. He also said that suspending contracts with the company while the probe was still unfolding would have tipped it off “that something was wrong.”

The scandal is just one in a flurry of misconduct cases involving senior military officials that have dogged the Defense Department over the past year.

On Thursday, the Air Force released an investigative report documenting how a two-star general in charge of nuclear weapons repeatedly drank too much and consorted with suspicious foreign women during an embarrassing four-day business trip to Moscow in July.

In October, the Navy relieved a three-star admiral from his post as deputy commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees all nuclear-armed missiles, bombers and submarines. In that case, Vice Adm. Tim Giardina was allegedly caught using counterfeit gambling chips during a visit to a casino.

Mabus said the misbehavior was limited to a “few” people in the service, but at the same time expressed frustration by saying that there was only so much the Navy could do to prevent some officers from acting badly.

“This not only goes against all the ethics rules that we have, these few people that are alleged to have done these things; this goes against everything you should have learned at home,” he said. “I mean, everybody knows it’s wrong to take a bribe. Everybody knows it’s wrong to get paid to give a contract.”"

It went down in history as perhaps the most crass response to this horrible moment in American history.





PAT ROBERTSON: Jerry, that's my feeling. I think we've just seen the antechamber to terror. We haven't even begun to see what they can do to the major population. JERRY FALWELL: The ACLU's got to take a lot of blame for this. PAT ROBERTSON: Well, yes. JERRY FALWELL: And, I know that I'll hear from them for this. But, throwing God out successfully with the help of the federal court system, throwing God out of the public square, out of the schools. The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked. And when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we make God mad. I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way--all of them who have tried to secularize America--I point the finger in their face and say ""you helped this happen."" PAT ROBERTSON: Well, I totally concur, and the problem is we have adopted that agenda at the highest levels of our government. And so we're responsible as a free society for what the top people do. And, the top people, of course, is the court system. JERRY FALWELL: Pat, did you notice yesterday the ACLU, and all the Christ-haters, People For the American Way, NOW, etc. were totally disregarded by the Democrats and the Republicans in both houses of Congress as they went out on the steps and called out on to God in prayer and sang ""God Bless America"" and said ""let the ACLU be hanged""? In other words, when the nation is on its knees, the only normal and natural and spiritual thing to do is what we ought to be doing all the time--calling upon God. PAT ROBERTSON: Amen

Apparently Pat Robertson never learns a lesson, nor anything else for that matter. On today's anniversary of the September 11th attacks, Pat takes a moment to shift blame away from the dirty liberals and gays to place it squarely on the entirety of the 1.6 billion adherents to the Muslim faith.





I remember when George Bush came on after 9/11 and said ""Don't blame Islam. Islam is a religion of peace"" and I said he was not appointed as Chief Theologian he was appointed as Chief Executive and he doesn't know what he is talking about. Islam does not mean peace, it means submission. And it means submission to Mohammad and it means submission to Sharia, it means submission to the Koran and all the teaching and tenants of that faith. That's what Islam is all about. And they believe that anybody who doesn’t submit is at war with them and they are prime targets, and for the Western nations to welcome this fifth column into their midst is just committing suicide. The reason is they have lost their faith in God, they have lost their faith in Jesus Christ, they don’t believe in what the Bible says and the core values of our society have gone away. We’ve done it here in America, we’ve abolished prayer in the schools, we’ve taken out Bible-reading in the schools and little by little by little we’ve eroded the rights—we keep talking about separation and this that and the other. But here in the country we've still got a great core of people who believe in foundational values. And that's the hope of the next generation.

Um, Pat. These people are Muslim. You are quite right that they don't believe in the Bible as that is not their holy book. They didn't lose their faith in Jesus Christ because they never placed faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ, you are an idiot. You know why we keep talking about ""separation and this that and the other?"" It is because it was written explicitly into our Constitution to keep people like you from turning our country into a Theocracy. That's why.

While the rest of the thinking world remembers this day and those who perished as a sad event perpetrated by madmen, Pat Robertson sees it as an opportunity to further his agenda of hate, this time towards blameless people who's only fault lies in adhering to a faith different than his. It is as tiresome as it is effective with his audience.

Yes, I have hope for the next generation. I have hope that they will overcome hatred and bigotry against people that aren't like themselves.

USA TODAY

Justice's delay isn't necessarily justice denied for Jill Kelley, the Tampa socialite entangled in the scandal that toppled former CIA director David Petraeus.

The Justice Department has asked for a 30-day extension, until Sept. 4, to respond to her lawsuit against the government for violating her family's privacy, rifling through her e-mails and leaking confidential information about her.

And Kelley is fine with the extension, says her lawyer, Alan Raul. The government says it needs the time to sort through the allegations in the 65-page complaint. It doesn't help, Justice Department lawyers say, that Pentagon employees have been furloughed because of sequestration.

""We are pleased that the federal government appears to be taking this case seriously, and is taking extra time to conduct its internal inquiry in response to this lawsuit,"" Raul said in a statement.

Kelley had been an unpaid social liaison to the military and had hosted parties for military officials, including Petraeus and Gen. John Allen, at her home on Tampa's Bayshore Boulevard. The headquarters of Central Command, which oversees military action in the Middle East, is a few miles away.

Petraeus' extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, was exposed after Kelley complained to the FBI about harassing e-mails she had received. Broadwell was behind them.

Allen's name also popped up in Kelley's e-mails.

That prompted then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to call for an investigation of Allen's relationship with Kelley to determine if there had been ""professional misconduct"" on his part. Allen and Kelley say there was nothing inappropriate about their relationship. The Pentagon inspector general agreed, although the Defense Department refuses to release its findings. USA TODAY and other news organizations have filed multiple requests for the report but have been denied.

Allen and Kelley exchanged 3,000 e-mails from July 2010 to July 2012, according to Rep. Jackie Speier, the California Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. She was briefed by the inspector general on the report but not shown the document. Of those e-mails, 41 were reviewed more thoroughly, Speier was told.

Speier wants Allen to divulge e-mails from his private account to Kelley. He refused to provide them to the inspector general, Speier said.

Kelley and her husband, Scott, want an apology and unspecified damages for what they say were willful leaks by federal officials of false and damaging information about them. Those officials should have been protecting them and their privacy, they say in their lawsuit.

""The Kelleys are trying to deter the government from violating the privacy rights of other Americans by calling attention to the government's profound over-collection of private e-mails and egregious leaking of confidential investigative material,"" Raul said."

Ron Calderon,"Story highlights Calderon's lawyer: ""It's sinful how the FBI just shows up"" Calderon, a Democrat, represents the city of Montebello FBI spokeswoman says no arrests are planned

(CNN) —

FBI agents raided the offices of California state Sen. Ron Calderon and the Latino legislative caucus on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear why.

“This afternoon, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation served search warrants in the State Capitol at the office of Sen. Ron Calderon and in the Legislative Office Building at the Latino Legislative Caucus office,” Tony Beard, chief sergeant at arms for the California Senate, said in a statement.

“Those warrants are sealed by order of the federal court; therefore we have no further information. The Senate has and will continue to fully cooperate with the agents in this matter.”

Calderon, a Democrat, represents the city of Montebello in Los Angeles County.

His spokesman, Rocky Rushing, declined to comment.

But his attorney, Mark Geragos – a high-profile lawyer who has represented Michael Jackson, among other celebrities – said the raid is “an example of how out-of-control this Department of Justice is.”

“They leak the search warrant but won’t reveal information about the investigation. It’s sinful how the FBI just shows up,” he said. “Senator Calderon is a victim of this agency that has no moral compass.”

The searches are not in response to anything recent and have nothing to do with public safety, said Lauren Horwood, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Sacramento.

According to FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller, no arrests are planned. She declined to identify the target and nature of the investigation.

The primary focus of the bill is Section 215 of FISA. This is the part of the law that provides the legal justification for the bulk collection of the telephone metadata of Americans, including phone numbers and the date and duration of calls (but not the content of those conversations). While the bill's language amends the statute to prevent the NSA from hoovering up phone metadata en masse, it provides gaping loopholes that could allow the agency to continue with its bulk collection practices as usual, such as if there's a ""reasonable articulable suspicion"" that an investigation is related to international terrorism. The legislation also makes it legal for the government to collect and search records that are three ""hops"" from a target who is suspected of terrorism—in other words, a suspect, all of that suspect's contacts, and all of their contacts. The bill makes only surface fixes and ""absolutely allows for the kind of collection that is already happening right now,"" according to Amie Stepanovich, the director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center's (EPIC) Domestic Surveillance Project.

The sweeping surveillance programs the NSA has used to spy on Americans outside the bounds of existing laws would be officially authorized under new legislation from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, passed out of the Intelligence committee last week. Feinstein calls this a ""reform,"" but what it would actually do is make legal all of the abuses uncovered by Edward Snowden's leaks, codifying the NSA's collection of all of our phone records—a massive setback for privacy rights.The legislation would also expand the NSA's surveillance powers, giving it new authority to tap the cell phones of non-Americans believed to be living outside of the U.S., but who enter the country. The NSA would have 72 hours to track these cell phones. It would also impose a 10-year prison sentence on any unauthorized person who accesses NSA information, a Snowden penalty, basically. Feinstein's bill has a few weak reforms, mostly dealing with the FISA court, allowing it to hear amicus briefs in certain cases (though it already does have that authority and has used it on some occasions) and authorizes a report from the Court to Congress about its decisions. That's not a release of decisions, but rather a report on decision.

This isn't reform. This is about as bad the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 which retroactively legalized warrantless wiretapping and gave all the telecomms who helped conduct it retroactive immunity. It's an attempt to sweep all of the abuses recently brought to light under the rug of legality. The icing on this Feinstein cake is that all of the committee meetings about this bill, indeed the committee meeting in which it was passed, were conducted in secret. Ironic for a bill that Feinstein says is intended to increase transparency in surveillance programs.

Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) has been working with Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) on legislation also introduced last week that does include real reform. It would end the bulk collection of data, require the government obtain court orders before it could use the information collected on Americans, create transparency allowing communications providers to disclose information about the orders they've received from the NSA, make FISA court orders since 2003 public, and create a public advocate for the FISA Court. Feinstein has vowed to kill this actual reform legislation.

John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) attended a private meeting with President Barack Obama on the subject of immigration reform. They emerged all smiles: “It’s one of the best meetings I’ve ever had with the president,” Graham said. President Obama “understands the parameters of what we’re dealing with,” said McCain. Both senators are supporters of immigration reform efforts now under way in the Senate.

Those efforts themselves are the product of separate negotiations outside “regular order” in the Senate. A group called the “Gang of Eight,” which includes both McCain and Graham, has agreed to the broad principles of a bipartisan compromise on immigration that would include both border enforcement and a “path to citizenship”–though the question of whether, and for how long, the enforcement stage would come first remains unresolved.

It is not the first time a “gang” effort has been used to pressure the rest of the Republican caucus, but it is the first time such an effort has been coordinated with the president. McCain and Graham’s endorsement of the president’s efforts is particularly striking given their persistent push for answers on the Benghazi scandal, and their strong opposition to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel (though they both refused to sustain a filibuster).

The Republicans’ “gang problem” has contributed to the growing frustration that conservative voters feel with the GOP. In McCain’s case, the frustration is compounded by the fact that he ran for re-election in 2010 while promising to crack down on illegal immigration. In the House of Representatives, Speaker John Boehner agreed to stop separate talks with Obama, and to commit to “regular order.” The Senate has added no such discipline.

Even in the House, Boehner has abandoned a promise to observe the “Hastert rule”–to ensure that any vote that comes to the floor is approved by the majority Republican caucus first. The result has been a string of capitulations that lead in turn to bad policy. The noble cause of bipartisanship first requires two parties. If Republicans cannot establish minimal policy discipline–even personal discipline–the country’s frustrations will grow."

As Obama heads to Minneapolis on Monday to talk about the fight against gun violence, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano will travel to San Diego and El Paso, Texas, to inspect border security operations at the Southwest border, an aide said Sunday.

On Monday and Tuesday, she’ll meet with state and local officials to talk about how to secure the border without hindering legal travel and trade.

Border security threatens to become a point of contention in the immigration debate. Some members of Congress, including key Republicans, want the government to certify that the border is fully secure before opening a path to citizenship for people currently in the country illegally.

After her two-day trip, Napolitano will join White House policy director Cecilia Munoz to meet with law enforcement officials from around the country to talk about the president’s immigration proposal, which includes a clear pathway to citizenship.

Their emphasis is on the border measures the federal government has already undertaken, including increasing the number of agents on the border to more than 21,000 -- double those assigned in 2004.

The administration reports that fewer people try to cross the border illegally every year now, which they attribute to increased surveillance. Apprehensions totaled about 365,000 in 2012, a 50% decrease since 2008, according to government figures.

On Tuesday, Obama plans to hold White House meetings with labor and progressive leaders and several chief executives to promote his plan.

His sales pitch in those discussions is economic growth and competitiveness, an aide said Sunday.

Leonard Lance, a Republican from New Jersey, toured the U.S. border with Mexico last week, he saw more than 20-foot-high barricades outside San Diego, a surveillance drone base in Arizona and patrol boats on the Rio Grande in Texas.

Lance also spotted a body floating in the tall Spanish cane in an elbow of the Rio Grande. Border Patrol agents told him the man may have drowned trying to swim across from Mexico, or may have been killed by cartel members in a drug deal gone bad.

“To see a dead body right here,” Lance said, “is a dramatic indication that we have to do a better job” on border security.

With a Senate immigration bill approved and the GOP-controlled House starting to review a separate array of proposals, Lance joined five other Republican lawmakers on a three-day trip to the Southwest border. At stop after stop, they posed for pictures and called for more guns, guards, drones and other efforts to stop illegal immigration.

“We have a real opportunity … to finally get control of this very insecure border,” said Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who leads the House Homeland Security Committee, after he rode a patrol boat armed with two automatic machine guns mounted on swivels.

Yet the danger here is hardly so clear-cut. McAllen’s police chief, Victor Rodriguez, bristles when he hears sweeping statements about insecurity on the Texas border. The crime rate in McAllen has fallen to its lowest level in 20 years, Rodriguez said. During that time, the population has doubled to about 130,000.

“The picture people have painted, that the sky is falling down here, that is just not the truth,” Rodriguez said at a police-sponsored picnic and folk-dancing festival in a park about a mile from Mexico.

The roads into McAllen from Mexico are lined with car dealerships, shopping malls, money changers and other thriving businesses. They have been sheltered from the economic downturn by members of the burgeoning middle class in Mexico who drive north to buy luxury goods.

Rodriguez, 56, has served as police chief for more than a decade, and he previously led police departments in two other Texas border towns. But the congressional delegation that visited his town last Tuesday met with rural county sheriffs and Border Patrol officers, not him.

Rodriguez favors granting more U.S. work visas for foreigners, doing more to crack down on illegal drugs, tracking and freezing cartel bank accounts, and chasing stolen goods and fugitives heading south into Mexico.

He’s not surprised that Border Patrol officials ask members of Congress for more money, agents and equipment.

“If I am the Border Patrol … what am I going to ask for? ‘Double my size and give me boats and give me guns. I want everything I can get from you.’ If I was in their shoes, I would be doing the same thing,” Rodriguez said.

Smugglers will always find a way to get across the snaking loops of the Rio Grande, Rodriguez said. He is annoyed by politicians who, in his view, seek political gain, not solutions to problems on the border.

“They say, ‘Seal up the border and then we will talk everything else,’” Rodriguez said. “It’s as if I would tell you, ‘I’ll give you a million dollars when you get back from the moon.’”

Illegal immigration is down or holding steady in every area on the border except for McAllen and the rest of the Rio Grande Valley, the closest crossing point from the end of a train line nicknamed “the Beast” that runs up the Central American isthmus. Total apprehensions in the area are up 55% so far this year, to 125,000 people. More than half are from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, Border Patrol officials say.

The night McCaul’s delegation arrived in McAllen, after visiting border areas in California and Arizona, the group met with 13 local ranchers around a long table at the Patio on Guerra, a local restaurant.

Linda Vickers, 57, a member of the Texas Border Volunteers, a group that regularly alerts the Border Patrol to migrants and smugglers moving north, said over steak and chicken parmigiana that she and her husband found border crossers on their 1,000-acre spread nearly every day.

Migrants are dropped off south of a highway checkpoint and walk a 30-mile loop to elude detection, she said. That morning, she said, her 90-pound dog Tinkerbell tracked two men cresting a hill as she went to feed her horses. She called the Border Patrol, but the men escaped.

She told McCaul she worries that terrorists could be smuggled across the border, along with those simply seeking work. “It’s kind of scary that you don’t know who is coming over,” Vickers said later.

McCaul has introduced a border security bill that would require the Homeland Security secretary to produce a plan to stop 90% of illicit border crossers within two years. Unlike the Senate bill, which is stalled in the House, it says nothing about providing a pathway to legal status for the estimated 11 million people already in the country illegally. It also doesn’t include any money to help achieve the goal.

McCaul’s bill passed his committee with a unanimous, bipartisan vote. House leaders have told McCaul his bill would be the first of several proposals to come up for a vote this fall.

At the U.S. Customs and Border Protection drone operations center at Ft. Huachuca in southern Arizona, McCaul was shown a radar system developed for the war in Afghanistan. Called Vader, the drone-mounted radar can see deep into Mexico from the U.S. side of the border to identify groups of immigrants and drug smugglers moving north. In theory, it can show if they are carrying weapons or drug shipments.

“They call it ‘extending the borders into Mexico,’” McCaul said. “They then know how to deal with it in a smart way. People trying to come to work is a different threat than people coming in with dope and AK-47s.”

McCaul said other soon-to-be surplus U.S. military equipment in Afghanistan — surveillance blimps, radar systems, night-vision goggles — also could be used on the Southwest border.

“It’s not just simply erecting a fence and calling it a day,” said Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.), after touring an RC-26 Metroliner surveillance plane recently back from Afghanistan and Iraq that the Texas Army National Guard uses to help the Border Patrol track smugglers.

“The drugs that come up through here land in Kansas and all across the country,” Yoder said. “We have to ensure we are doing our job down here to stop the flow of crime and drugs to states up north.”

Florida Today

The U.S. military draft ended in 1973

The switch has had both positive and negative effects on the military and the nation

There have been efforts to reinstate the draft%2C including those by Rep. Charles Rangel%2C D-N.Y.%2C over the past decade

MELBOURNE, Fla. -- Young men today no longer face the prospect of being called to compulsory military duty. This month marks the 40th anniversary since the draft ended and the military became an all-volunteer force.

The switch has had both positive and negative effects on the military and the nation as a whole, depending on who you ask.

Today's fighting force is undeniably better educated and motivated than in the days when much of the enlisted ranks of the Army were filled with conscripts on two-year tours.

Nearly all of today's enlisted men and women have at least a high school diploma. Many are college graduates. There is a perception that there are fewer discipline problems than during the Vietnam War-era. The all-volunteer military has consistently demonstrated its ability from Desert Storm to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

But an all-volunteer military also means that the burden of defending the nation is carried by a small fraction of Americans.

Robert Taylor, a professor of American military history and head of the Department of Humanities and communication at Florida Institute of Technology, said the all-volunteer military has been a success, though it is ""a two-sided coin.""

""The downside is that the vast majority of the American people expect the small number of people to fight our wars for us,"" he said.

That relatively small group is carrying the weight of service in the military, which has led to multiple deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan.

From World War II to the final days of Vietnam, nearly every young man in the country faced the prospect of being drafted into the Army.

As time went on, more young men were able to avoid the draft by attending college or seeking other deferments.

Research published in the late 1970s showed that men from low-income or disadvantaged backgrounds were more likely to fight in Vietnam than men from middle- and high-income families who could avoid being drafted by going to college or finding a slot in a stateside National Guard unit.

""The American people lost confidence in the draft as a means of raising an army when it ceased to require equal sacrifice from everyone that was eligible to serve,"" said Bernard Rostker, a former director of the Selective Service System and the author of ""I Want You! The Evolution of the All-Volunteer Force.""

The feeling that the draft was not applied equally, combined with widespread unhappiness with the war, led to increased calls to end the draft, which the Selective Service did in 1973.

Dwight Elliott Stone, then an apprentice plumber from California, became the last draftee to be inducted. Stone, now living in San Francisco, didn't go happily. ""I just wanted to do my two years and get the hell out,"" Stone said. He ended up serving about 17 months, and never had to go overseas.

Others, though, say that compulsory military service gave valuable discipline and direction to many young men.

Retired Army Sgt. 1st Class Juan Santiago, a Vietnam War veteran, said that because many draftees didn't want to go to the war, there were problems. But having to serve was good for many of the draftees who could have ended upin trouble.

""The Army molded them to be good citizens,"" said Santiago, 74, of Melbourne, Fla.

Some like Santiago ended up making the military their careers.

Santiago said he was a high school drop-out when he joined, while today's recruit must have at least a high school education. He went on to get his high school diploma and take college courses while serving.

Interest in the military has waxed and waned during the past 40 years, often dependent on such outside forces as the strength of the economy or the renewed sense of patriotism following the Sept. 11 attacks.

At an Army recruiting station in Rockledge, a board displays the photos of dozens of volunteer recruits who will be starting basic training in coming weeks. Many of them are idealists who find it their duty to serve in the military.

Shafaq Maria Yuhanna, 19, of Rockledge, who four years ago became a U.S. citizen, said that in her native Pakistan, she would not have had the opportunities she has here as a woman. She said she wanted to try every sport when she found that in the United States she was free to do so.

""I want to protect the country that gave me freedom,"" she said. ""Even though I've been here four years, it is my country.""

Latiesha Bryant, 24, of Melbourne, who earned a associate degree from Kaiser University, said she wanted to serve for the experience and to further her education. She said she wants to make a difference.

""I feel like today there are still gender stereotypes,"" she said. ""I want to break that stigma.""

The Pentagon is happy with the all-volunteer force. But others say it is time to bring back the draft.

Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., has made several attempts during the past decade to reinstitute the draft on the grounds that a small fraction of U.S. citizens are bearing a disproportionate burden in fighting the nation's wars. But his bills have gone nowhere.

That hasn't stopped him from trying. Earlier this year, Rangel — who earned a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star for Valor after volunteering for the Army during the Korean War — introduced another bring-back-the-draft bill that also would require women to register.

""Women have proven that they can do the very same tasks, military and non-military, that men can,"" Rangel said.

Santiago said that while there were some advantages to conscription, today's all-volunteer force is better prepared than it used to be.

""They have more professional soldiers,"" he said. ""Today, we have the best Army in the whole world.""

The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks led to a massive buildup of security to make the country safe. Subsequent plots, including attempts to conceal bombs in shoes and underwear, prompted hasty additions to that edifice, as officials sought to fill in cracks that terrorists might exploit.

The bombings at the Boston Marathon, carried out by two young men who immigrated to this country about a decade ago, are likely to yield a more frustrating security postmortem.

So far, there have been no calls for a major addition to the nation’s counterterrorism infrastructure, in part because it is difficult to identify a realistic measure that might have prevented the attacks.

Instead, U.S. officials and counterterrorism experts said that, while the bombings may lead to incremental changes in efforts to secure such events, they exposed the limits of the extraordinary defenses erected over the past 12 years.

The United States has spent billions of dollars on counterterrorism efforts during that span, an investment that has accomplished much of its aim. Overseas operations have pushed al-Qaeda to the brink of collapse, and domestic steps have dramatically reduced the country’s exposure to an attack of the scale and sophistication of Sept. 11.

But the Boston bombings highlighted a lingering vulnerability that officials consider impractical, if not impossible, to eliminate. It centers on small-scale plots carried out by individuals who are unlikely to surface on federal radar. They rely on devices made from common ingredients such as gunpowder, nails and a pressure cooker. They target public gatherings where security resources are stretched.

“There’s just no way to secure many large public events, and the kind of intrusive steps we would have to take are ones that no one would be willing to endure,” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), a former federal prosecutor and member of the House Intelligence Committee. “We’ve always known the limits of what we could do in a free society, and this week we saw those limits in all their horror.”

National security and civil rights analysts said the U.S. government’s response to the Boston bombings will depend on details that emerge from the ongoing investigation, specifically whether the brothers accused of carrying out the attacks had direct connections to a foreign terrorist organization, were inspired by the ideology of radical Islam or had other motivations.

The two men, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, were immigrants who had been in the United States for roughly a decade. They were part of a family with ties to Chechnya, a volatile region where Muslim separatists have been engaged in a bloody campaign against the Russian government for decades.

If there are connections to Islamist militant groups, including help planning and carrying out the attack, the Obama administration could expand intelligence-gathering efforts overseas, as well as widen surveillance and screening measures in the United States. But such measures would likely be controversial and far from foolproof.

If, however, the Tsarnaev brothers carried out the bombings with no foreign assistance, the administration’s policy options may be more limited.

National security and legal experts note that the United States has endured violence committed with relatively small-size explosive devices for decades, attacks carried out by radical groups with ideologies that span the political spectrum.

Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks counterterrorism policy and law, said the administration would have to move carefully if it sought to expand surveillance in public spaces or increase monitoring of Muslim communities.

It’s a “scenario in which you are almost powerless in a policy matter,” Wittes said. “You obviously have to begin thinking about additional security at marathons and other events. But just as school shootings are really hard to prevent . . . I really don’t think there’s much more to do from a policy aspect.”

U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies track thousands of potential threats each year to major public gatherings, ranging from the president’s inauguration to football’s Super Bowl. Those events are regarded as easier to safeguard because spectators must pass through checkpoints before gaining entry to a controlled space.

The Boston Marathon, by contrast, is a snaking 26.2-mile course lined by open parks, sidewalks and buildings. The Boston Police Department conducted two bomb sweeps in advance of the race, but there was little to prevent two brothers from blending into the crowd with homemade devices in their backpacks.

“This is a type of target that is unrealistic to expect to be secured,” said Daniel Byman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University and former CIA analyst. Protecting a single venue, Byman said, only means the list of remaining vulnerable sites is “infinity minus one.”

Efforts to protect such targets have been ramped up over the past decade, but the bulk of the security measures adopted after the Sept. 11 attacks have been aimed at guarding against more catastrophic scenarios.

New agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the National Counterterrorism Center, were established to identify threats, generate terrorism watch lists and mobilize resources. Vast areas of the nation’s infrastructure, including its shipping ports, have been shored up to prevent dangerous materials, such as radiological or chemical weapons, from slipping into the United States.

But security cannot be guaranteed in even the most heavily fortified areas, including aviation. Twice over the past 12 years, terrorists with ties to al-Qaeda have boarded airplanes with hidden explosives. Layers of airport security and surveillance failed to stop them. Both cases might have ended in disaster if the bombers hadn’t struggled to ignite their devices before being subdued by other passengers.

The Boston bombings were reminiscent of another recent near-miss, the failed attempt in 2010 by a Pakistani American to ignite a bomb hidden in a car in Times Square. Faisal Shahzad had lit the fuse on a device that also involved a pressure cooker. A nearby food vendor noticed smoke and alerted authorities, and Shahzad was apprehended after boarding a plane bound for Dubai.

Boston was far from defenseless as the marathon got underway. Among major U.S. cities, only New York and Washington have been under more stringent security since the Sept. 11 attacks.

Boston has used federal grants to help assemble a surveillance network that employs hundreds of cameras across the city and throughout its subways. Those cameras, along with images captured by private video systems and spectators’ cellphones, helped authorities identify the Tsarnaev brothers as suspects — but only after three people had been killed and more than 170 others injured.

Schiff said the bombings may trigger new debate over whether surveillance systems such as Boston’s should be expanded, whether spy agencies should focus more resources on regions such as Chechnya and whether the United States needs to examine how it integrates disaffected immigrants.

“We’ve had a lot of successes in degrading the ability of al-Qaeda to launch massive attacks, but we’ve had a proliferation of one-off, foreign-born plots and self-radicalized individuals,” Schiff said. Ultimately, he said, “we’re going to have to recognize a certain vulnerability, and adopt a determined view that we will go on as we have, taking prudent precautions, but not changing the way we live.”

Roger Wicker tested positive for the same substance.

The warnings come amid a flurry of reports on suspicious packages. Fox News has learned of several suspicious packages or envelopes in various Capitol Hill office buildings. Capitol Police say three packages that were flagged have been removed and the areas have been cleared.

Separately, the office of Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., reported a ""suspicious-looking letter"" at one of the senator's Michigan offices; and a spokesman for Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., reported a ""suspicious letter"" was intercepted at Flake's Phoenix office. Authorities were also called to the Dallas office of Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, over what was described only as ""a piece of mail"" -- but field tests later came back negative.

The package alerts compounded security concerns in the wake of the letter incidents and the Boston bombing, which the FBI has said do not appear to be related.

Both of the initial suspicious letters were apparently intercepted on Tuesday. They never reached the Hill or the White House.

An FBI bulletin obtained by Fox News said the letter sent to Obama is still being screened, though it initially tested positive.

The bulletin said both letters included the phrase: ""To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.""

Both were signed, ""I am KC and I approve this message.""

The letter to the Mississippi Republican was intercepted at an off-site mail screening facility.

Authorities declined to comment on a suspect or any other aspect of the investigation being led by Capitol Police, but Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., told the Associated Press police have a suspect in mind.

""The person that is a suspect writes a lot of letters to members,"" McCaskill said as she emerged from a classified briefing.

Testing is apparently still underway. The letter tested positive for ricin in a field test, but the FBI released a statement Wednesday saying tests have shown ""inconsistent results"" and the substance is being further analyzed.

According to a Homeland Security Department handbook, ricin is deadliest when inhaled. It is not contagious, but there is no antidote.

Wicker thanked law enforcement officials in a statement for ""their hard work and diligence in keeping"" those who work in the Capitol safe, adding that the matter is part of an ongoing investigation by Capitol Police and the FBI. ""Gayle and I appreciate everyone's thoughts and prayers,"" he said.

As of Tuesday night, mail delivery had only been stopped to the Senate, not the House.

""It is of concern,"" Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said after learning about the incident in a briefing with other senators late Tuesday.

The envelope had a Tennessee postmark and no return address.

The letter inside included an implied threat to effect of: ""You haven’t listen to me before. Now you will, even if people have to die,"" Politico also reported.

Sources say officials are familiar with the person believed to have sent the letter as the person has sent other letters before.

FBI Director Robert Mueller and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano were on Capitol Hill on Tuesday for a scheduled talk about cyber security. But that briefing morphed into talks about Boston, after the bombings Monday.

Senate Sergeant at Arms Terry Gainer conducted a separate briefing for senators specifically on ricin.

It's unclear whether the letter had any connection to the Boston attack.

The mail-screening system was established after the Anthrax attacks of 2001 that closed the Hart Senate Office Building.

http://news.yahoo.com/army-5-billion-waste-094500638--politics.html,,[],The Army’s $5 billion Waste,"In 2004, the Army decided to scrap the two traditional camouflage uniforms that had long been used by the military—one meant for woodland environments, another for the desert—and claimed to have come up with a universal pattern that could be worn anywhere and blend in with any environment. The $5 billion dollar experiment with the universal pattern is over as the Army is phasing out the uniform after less than a decade of use. But many soldiers and observers are wondering why it took this long and cost this much to replace an item that performed poorly from the start during a period when the money could have been spent on other critical needs, like potentially life saving improvements to military vehicles and body armor.

Less than a decade after the so-called Universal Camouflage Pattern, or UCP, was introduced the Army is back to the drawing board, set to announce a new camouflage pattern and standard uniform to be worn by the more than million members of the active duty and reserve forces.

Evidence of the UCPs inadequacy as a combat uniform is easy to find—just look at pictures of soldiers currently serving in Afghanistan, they’re not wearing the UCP, which was deemed unsuitable for operations there, but a different uniform known as the MultiCam. In 2009, Congress responded to soldiers’ “concerns about the current combat uniform which they indicated provides ineffective camouflage given the environment in Afghanistan,” by passing a bill in the appropriations act requiring that the DOD “take immediate action to provide combat uniforms to personnel deployed to Afghanistan with a camouflage pattern that is suited to the environment of Afghanistan.” The result was the MultiCam. But that uniform, while it is currently worn in Afghanistan, was not a replacement but an interim substitution for the UCP, which is still the Army’s official uniform and the one worn by all soldiers not overseas.

Only 5 years after it was introduced the UCP’s failures had already become glaring enough to compel congressional intervention but despite the moratorium on its use in Afghanistan, it will have taken another 5 years for the Army to field its replacement.

Story continues

Eventually, after mounting criticism and reports of the uniforms problems, the Army started looking for something better. This time, instead of hoping for a universal, one-size-fits-all design, an Army source who wished to remain unnamed explained that the Army solicited designs from companies for patterns with three variations, one for the desert, another for woodlands and jungles and a third, traditional semi-wooded pattern similar to the one currently used by soldiers in Afghanistan. After several rounds of testing, four patterns with three variations for each, from companies in New York, Virginia and Alaska were submitted to the Army to choose a winner.

Critics say this has been a huge waste of money.

Last year, the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog agency, issued a report taking the Army to task for spending $5 billion on UCP-covered uniforms and field equipment, only to spend an estimated $4 billion replacing them with whatever design it picks next. The Natick Army Soldier Systems Center, which does research and development on things like food, clothing, shelter for the military, conducted two studies on the Universal Camouflage Pattern, once in 2006 and again in 2009, both times finding that the UCP’s performance came up short when compared to other, more popular camouflages, like the Marine Corps desert pattern or the MultiCam. Natick scientists also went on record alleging that the Army had already selected the UCP before testing on it was completed and a full evaluation could be made of its performance compared to other designs.

Representatives from Natick did not return requests for comment on this story and the Government Accountability Office is currently closed due to the government shutdown.

But these reports only reinforce the views expressed by, arguably the most important critics of the Army’s near-decade long quest for the perfect uniform: the soldiers who have to wear them.

During former Army Officer Matt Gallagher’s 15-month deployment to Iraq from 2007-2009, he became well acquainted with the shortfalls of the universal camouflage pattern. In an attempt to blend in with all kinds of environments, the pattern instead wound up sticking out everywhere, its grey, gravel design that only a help to soldiers hoping to blend in with a parking lot. Gallagher said his soldiers would call the uniform pajamas, “both a testament to its comfort and its inability to look right on anyone, no matter their build.” But Gallagher found that the biggest concern with the UCP in Iraq was shoddy velcro.

“On a night raid, if it gets caught on a wire or something, it would make a crunchy sound that might alert insurgents to a soldier’s location,” he said. “That wouldn’t happen with just cloth.”

Army Sergeant Matt Pelak laughs at the mention of the universal camouflage pattern.

“It is one of the things that drives me craziest about the army I have to admit,” he told The Daily Beast. We started rolling it out in ‘05 and everyone was baffled by it.”

While Pelak admits there were some upsides to the design, such as easy-to-access pockets, his complaints outweighed the positives.

“Even currently, in my unit that I’m in now, we wear the normal uniform, the UCP when we’re back on base, but when we go in the field we wear MultiCam,” he said. “We have to carry two uniforms around, one that functions properly and one that’s merely administrative.”

Pelak points out this is hardly the first time the Army has spent billions of dollars on insufficient equipment just to spend more money to replace it, recalling the $20 billion Future Combat Systems program that launched in 2003 to develop a fleet of universally used lightweight armored vehicles and was canceled in 2009, ultimately considered a failure.

“It’s as ridiculous as buying 20 million humvees to go to war in that weren’t armored and then when the war started they had to build all new humvees that were bullet proof,” he said. “It’s that absurd.”

Pelak is not hesitant to admit that, within the ranks, the seemingly unnecessary and wasteful uniform program smells like “a giant conspiracy.”

“People in the military associate certain projects with nepotism, a Good Old Boy network,” Pelak said. “Maybe someone’s brother owns the company that designs the uniforms, or he’s on the Defense Appropriations Committee. No one knows exactly, but there are a lot of theories that all involve some sort of cronyism or backhand deal.”

If it were up to Gallagher, the billions that have been spent on two rounds of designing, testing, issuing new uniforms would instead go to finishing a water treatment plant that was started when he was in Iraq. “The local citizens need that treatment plant far more than we need a new batch of uniforms,” he said.

Neither Gallagher nor Pelak are sure that the ambitious goal of designing a universally functional pattern is realistic, but they both agree that the MultiCam design or the Desert Camouflage Uniform, are the best options they’ve been given so far.

For his part, Pelak would like to see less money spent designing uniforms and more money spent on better quality field equipment, such as more durable boots and lighter backpacks.

“It took 12 years to develop body armor for women,” he said. ‘I thought that was a joke when they announced body armor for women at the end of both wars and that’s absolutely needed. Not a lower budget version of a backpack you can’t even jump out of an airplane with.”

Unfortunately, Gallagher said, “What’s best for soldiers in the field is usually not a primary decision-maker. This is all about defense industry contracts, and just one example of the labyrinth that is that messy, nepotistic world.”

The Army, however, downplays the conspiracy theory. “It’s not like someone pulled the UCP out of their posterior and said let’s use it,” said the unnamed Army source. “They actually did a test and it performed pretty well, but as you can imagine, anything that’s universal doesn’t work that well in all situations.”

The Army source’s claim that the UCP tested well is contradicted by two different studies conducted by Natick showing that the MultiCam outperformed the UCP in various environments and the statements made by Natick scientists accusing the military of selecting the UCP before the full testing on it was complete.

The same source also insists the fuss over wasted money is overblown. “It’s like if you spent $5 billion on Hanes t-shirts and then 5 years later decided you should have bought Under Armor,” he said. “It’s not like you wasted money on those shirts because you got use out of them. We used those uniforms for their lifespan.”

The criticism made by many soldiers and Army watchdogs is that clothing that costs $5 billion dollars and is made for Soldiers going into combat ought to be of higher quality and last longer than a Hanes t-shirt. Despite the Army’s initial claims about fielding a universal uniform of the future, the UCPs nine-year lifespan is less than half the length of its considerably less expensive predecessor, the BDU uniform, which lasted for two decades. What’s more, the UCP wasn’t even worn by soldiers in Afghanistan during the last four years of its duration.

Over the past decade the Army has utilized four different uniforms, with each representing a considerable expenditure and investment of time and resources that could have been applied to other commonly cited needs, like upgrades to field equipment and improvements to tactical vehicles.

Whether the current quest for the consummate camouflage will prove time and money well spent or yet another waste remains to be seen. In the meantime, Pelak said, “We’re stuck with a uniform we can’t wear in the field.”

Send Him Statements To Fact Check Emailing Him', 'Tweeting At Him', 'Or Sending Him A Message On Facebook.']",Rand Paul’s misguided question on how the Tsarnaev brothers arrived in the United States,"“Why did the current system allow two individuals to immigrate to the United States from the Chechen Republic in Russia, an area known as a hotbed of Islamic extremism, who then committed acts of terrorism?”

— Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, April 22, 2013

In journalism, there’s an old rule: The only dumb question is the one not asked.

Still, Paul’s question in a letter urging delay of comprehensive immigration reform appears to ask the wrong question, based on the information that is now known about the Boston Marathon bombing suspects and their arrival in the United States.

The Facts

One undisputed fact about the Tsarnaev brothers is that they were both minors when they arrived in the United States. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was 8 or 9, while his older brother Tamerlan was 15 or 16.

Second, they ended up in the United States because their father, Anzor Tsarnaev, applied for asylum.

It has been reported that Anzor first arrived on a tourist visa in April 2002, with the youngest son, while Tamerlan and two sisters remained behind. The chronology is still a bit confused; some accounts just have the father and Dzhokhar arriving, which would make sense because the State Department, in granting tourist visas, looks for family connections (such as a family) back home. But other accounts have both Anzor and his wife, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, arriving in April with either one or both boys.

Once in the United States, Anzor applied for asylum. According to his sister Maret, she helped him write the petition. (Note that there is a difference: Applicants apply for refugee status if they are outside the United States; they apply for asylum once they are in the United States or at the border.)

But in any case, a spouse and children under the age of 21 are covered by one parent’s status. The rest of the family could be brought into the United States under a policy of family reunification, as long as the petition is filed within two years of being granted asylum.

Finally, the family did not emigrate from Chechnya; they were only ethnically Chechen. Anzor apparently grew up in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan, though he may have lived briefly in Chechnya in the early 1990s. Both boys also were born in Kyrgyzstan, but the family left after run-ins with government authorities and settled in a Russian region that borders Chechnya known as Dagestan. (Some accounts say Tamerlan was born in Russia, but traveled on a Kyrgyzstan passport.)

From a U.S. immigration perspective, the family came from “Russia,” not a particular part of Russia. Moreover, Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.” At this point, we do not know the case Anzor made in seeking asylum, but apparently it was compelling enough to be granted.

Interestingly, despite the turmoil in Chechnya, relatively few ethnic Chechens have sought refuge in the United States. Almut Rochowanski, coordinator of programs and advocacy for the Chechnya Advocacy Network, said there is no hard data, but she estimates that only about 1,000 Chechens are living in the United States. She said Chechens have preferred to settle in Europe — where there are more than 100,000 refugees — and the few who made it to the United States are rather spread out across the country.

In the case of the Tsarnaev family, there were already other relatives in the United States and Canada, which was probably the attraction.

We sought further clarification from Paul spokeswoman Moira Bagley but, as usual, did not receive a response.

The Pinocchio Test

When asking provocative questions, it is important to get the facts correct.

Paul appears to suggest that U.S. immigration officials, in granting an asylum petition from the father, could have discerned that two minor children, after living in the United States for a decade, would eventually commit a terrorist act. That would require an extraordinary amount of clairvoyance.

In any case, the key question for immigration officials was the asylum case made by their father; the minor children had nothing to do with it.

Moreover, Paul misidentified the region from which the Tsarnaev family emigrated. The boys who allegedly turned into terrorists may have been ethnic Chechens but they did not emigrate from Chechnya. Paul is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; one would expect he would know more about such elementary geography.

The result is an unintelligible policy without express limits or protective walls.

Last Wednesday, Attorney General Eric Holder said the president would soon shed more light on his “targeted killing” policy. Mr. Obama needs to. In the last few weeks, confusion over these issues has been vividly on display. On one hand, the administration has said it would use lethal force only when capturing a terrorist was impossible, and it did arrest Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, a son-in-law of Osama bin Laden who once served as a spokesman for Al Qaeda, and arraigned him on Friday in federal court in Manhattan. The Washington Post reported last week that counterterrorism officials considered using the authorization law as the basis for the government’s authority to kill Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a militant leader in Algeria and Mali, but decided it did not apply because he was not part of Al Qaeda or an associated group.

But the administration still has not fully disclosed to Congress the legal documents on which the targeted killing program is based. And in that same article, The Post said the administration was debating whether it could stretch the law to make it apply to groups that had no connection, or only slight ones, to Al Qaeda and the 9/11 attacks.

A big part of the problem is that the authorization to use military force is too vague. It gives the president the power to attack “nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.”

Making the law more specific, however, would only further enshrine the notion of a war without end. And, as Jeh Johnson, then counsel to the defense secretary, said in a speech last November, “War must be regarded as a finite, extraordinary and unnatural state of affairs.”"

She said she and her husband, a Mexican who has been living in the United States illegally for decades, since he was 10, had spent more than $50,000 over eight years on lawyers’ fees trying to fix his immigration status, to no avail.

Speaking emotionally in the senator’s office during a brief protest, Ms. Garcia said her two children, also American citizens, live on edge, fearing they could be separated from their father at any time. She and other advocates chose to focus on Mr. Rubio because he has been a leader in talks among a bipartisan group of senators who are working to craft immigration legislation.

As the debate gathers steam here over how to fix the immigration system, Ms. Garcia is one of the new faces on the side of those favoring comprehensive legislation that would include a quick and direct path to citizenship for 11 million people living in the country illegally."

(CNN) —

When President Barack Obama addressed the nation in the hours following Monday’s Boston Marathon bombing, he did not use the word “terror,” immediately raising questions.

When he took the podium at the White House less than 24 hours later, his phrasing changed. But he still was very careful about what he said, making separate points.

“Any time bombs are used to target civilians, it is an act of terrorism,” Obama said.

He said it was unclear who carried out the attack and why, but that the Boston bombings were a “heinous and cowardly act” that the FBI is investigating as an act of terrorism.

The two bomb blasts near the downtown finish line of the storied marathon killed three people, including an 8-year-old boy, and sent more than 170 others to local hospitals, some with critical injuries.

With developments unfolding late on Monday, Obama spoke to the nation from the White House, saying “we still do not know who did this or why” and cautioning Americans against jumping to any conclusions.

“But make no mistake, we will get to the bottom of this and we will find out who did this. We’ll find out why they did this,” he said.

Obama, calling attack ‘terror,’ shifts to response

Though Obama didn’t mention “terror,” federal investigators and a White House official later classified the bombings as such. Those close to the case have said it is not clear whether the attack was domestic or foreign in origin.

It makes sense Obama would be cautious in his initial public remarks and then clarify matters later with more information known, said Aitan Goelman, a former assistant U.S. attorney who helped prosecute the Oklahoma City bombing case.

“The president is absolutely right in cautioning people we don’t know who did this,” Goelman said.

’Boston will overcome,’ mayor vows amid bombing investigation

Careful decision-making in communicating information to the public seems to reflect lessons learned by a chief executive who has had to navigate the aftermath of attacks or threatened attacks where American lives were lost or threatened.

“There were three attacks in the first 17 months of the administration, four if you count Fort Hood,” said Matthew Miller, who served as a director of the Office of Public Affairs for the Justice Department during Obama’s first term.

“What we learned in dealing with each of those is it’s important for government officials to communicate early and reassure the public,” he said.

The president learned that lesson on Christmas Day in 2009 when a passenger attempted to detonate a bomb hidden in his underwear aboard an international flight heading into Detroit.

The White House called it an attempted terrorist attack and it took Obama three days to address the incident publicly, delay that some Republicans in Congress criticized.

A thwarted attempt to detonate explosives in New York’s subway system in September 2009, the November 2009 shooting massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, and a failed bombing of New York’s Times Square in May 2010 offered valuable lessons on communicating early, often and cautiously, Miller said.

The administration has also benefited from consistency in staffing. Key officials, including White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, who in 2009 served as National Security Council chief of staff, and homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco, who formerly served as a senior Justice Department official, are at Obama’s side now.

The administration also learned a tough political lesson around the word terror when Obama was hesitant to say it outright when first describing the deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, last September.

Details emerge: Boston bombs may have involved pressure cooker, timer

The president did call the attack one of several “acts of terror.”

The administration’s reluctance to clearly label that attack terrorism and comments blaming events initially on a response to an anti-Islamic film ignited partisan bickering and an election-year showdown with Republicans over his administration’s handling of the matter.

Politics aside, experts point out that classifying an attack as terrorism carries important legal and investigative meaning.

“You know, there’s been much discussing about the parsing of words: is this terrorism, isn’t it terrorism, it’s criminal? First of all, terrorism is a crime. So it’s automatically a criminal case if it’s a terrorism case,” said Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director and CNN contributor.

“But secondly, if it was not terrorism, the FBI would not be in charge. It would be Boston P.D. running this case. So it’s clear the authorities are absolutely clear. This is a terrorism investigation. It’s a terrorism case,” he said."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/19/jay-carney-marco-rubio_n_2718110.html,2013-02-19 00:00:00,['Deputy Enterprise Editor'],"Jay Carney: Despite Marco Rubio Staff Claims, White House In Touch On Immigration","WASHINGTON -- White House press secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday that the Obama administration has been engaged with the offices of members of Congress working on immigration reform, despite claims from Sen. Marco Rubio's (R-Fla.) staff that they have had no contact.

""We have been in contact with everybody involved in this effort on Capitol Hill,"" Carney told reporters at a briefing.

A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private talks, said later Tuesday that White House staff met with the offices of the ""gang of eight"" -- including a Rubio staffer -- five times in the past few weeks.

Alex Conant, a spokesman for Rubio, said in a statement earlier on Tuesday that the senator's staff hasn't spoken to the White House on immigration, but that they didn't necessarily want to anyway.

""Senator Rubio's office has never discussed immigration policy with anyone in the White House,"" Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. ""To be clear: That’s fine with us -- we actually think Congress should write the policy; not the White House. But an honest question: If the Obama Administration is serious about drafting & passing its own immigration reform, why wouldn’t they seek input from any Republicans whose support they’ll need?""

USA Today obtained the White House's draft immigration legislation on Saturday, but the White House has said it was not the source of the leak. Carney repeated that assertion in the press briefing, saying it ""was not an intentional release.""

There's no set timeline for when immigration reform should be completed, Carney said. Obama said in his State of the Union last week that he would like a bill passed within ""the next few months"" -- a tight timeframe when bills have not yet been introduced in the House or Senate. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said Sunday that the administration's legislation was a back-up plan and that the White House would continue to work with Rubio and others on a deal.

Rubio is a member of the Senate immigration ""gang of eight,"" along with Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.). The four Democratic members of the group met with Obama last week to update him on the status of the talks.

But Rubio's relationship with the White House, at least publicly, has been more fraught. The senator quickly decried the draft legislation leaked on Saturday, saying in a statement that it could be damaging to the discussions going forward.

“It’s a mistake for the White House to draft immigration legislation without seeking input from Republican members of Congress,"" Rubio said. ""President Obama’s leaked immigration proposal is disappointing to those of us working on a serious solution. ... If actually proposed, the president’s bill would be dead on arrival in Congress, leaving us with unsecured borders and a broken legal immigration system for years to come.""

He also released a statement last week accusing the administration, and in particular Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, of seeming to try to hurt reform efforts. Napolitano testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and said border concerns should not prevent broader immigration reform. The ""gang of eight"" plan would only allow immigrants to earn green cards after certain border metrics were met, a trigger not included in the White House draft legislation, but would allow other reforms to take place immediately, including allowing provisional status for undocumented immigrants.

The White House has come out strongly against a piecemeal approach that requires passing border security enforcement measures first and other immigration provisions later, but has not specifically stated it would oppose a trigger such as the one in the ""gang of eight"" framework.

Rubio, though, said Napolitano should have embraced the plan if the administration was ""serious"" about reform.

""Secretary Napolitano’s refusal to accept this bipartisan principle at today’s Senate hearing is discouraging for those of us who are serious about permanently fixing America’s immigration system,"" Rubio said in a statement after the committee hearing. ""By continuing to oppose a key security principle with bipartisan backing, Secretary Napolitano and this Administration appear to be laying the groundwork to scuttle the bipartisan effort in the Senate.""

UPDATE: 1:55 p.m. -- Rubio spokesman Alex Conant tweeted later that the White House had met with ""gang of eight"" staff, despite his statement that they never discussed immigration policy.

We double checked... WH never asked for our input. They sent agency officials to brief gang of 8, but didn't ask for input or discuss policy — Alex Conant (@AlexConant) February 19, 2013

Rubio spokesman Alex Conant clarified further by email.

""We have never discussed immigration policy with anyone from the White House,"" he said. ""The Administration has sent some agency officials to brief staff at the bipartisan group meetings, but they've never asked for our input. (And, frankly, we've never asked for theirs.) We've never received a call or email from Cecilia Munoz or anyone else at the White House asking for our input as they draft their bill.""

UPDATE: 5:10 p.m. -- President Barack Obama called Graham, McCain and Rubio later on Tuesday to discuss immigration reform, the White House announced. Flake, the fourth Republican member of the ""gang of eight,"" was unable to speak with the president because he was traveling, according to the White House.

During the calls, which build on conversations that have taken place at the staff level, the President reiterated that he remains supportive of the effort underway in Congress, and that he hopes that they can produce a bill as soon as possible that reflects shared core principles on reform. The President has made clear that he believes commonsense reform needs to include strengthening border security, creating an earned path to citizenship, holding employers accountable, and streamlining legal immigration. As the President made clear when he met with Democratic Senators involved in the process last week, that while he is pleased with the progress and supportive of the effort to date, he is prepared to submit his own legislation if Congress fails to act. He thanked the Senators for their leadership, and made clear that he and his staff look forward to continuing to work together with their teams to achieve needed reform.

Conant said Rubio ""appreciated"" Obama's call. ""Rubio said he feels good about ongoing negotiations in Senate,"" Conant tweeted."
http://news.yahoo.com/house-passes-measure-deport-young-114320823.html,,[],House passes measure to deport young immigrants,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled House voted Thursday to resume the deportation of hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children, a largely symbolic move in the first immigration-related vote in either chamber of Congress this year and a measure of the daunting challenge facing supporters of a sweeping overhaul of existing law on the subject.

The party-line vote of 224-201 was aimed at blocking implementation of President Barack Obama's 2012 election-year order to stop deportations of many so-called DREAM Act individuals. Democrats on the House floor reacted with boos when the provision was added to a routine spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security.

The administration has threatened to veto the overall legislation on budgetary grounds. It nevertheless stood as a stark warning from conservatives who dominate the ranks of the Republican House majority about attempts in the Senate to grant a chance at citizenship to an estimated 11 million immigrants residing in the country illegally.

And the White House reacted sharply, saying the House-passed measure would affect ""Dreamers"" who are ""productive members of society who were brought here as young children, grew up in our communities, and became American in every way but on paper.""

Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said in a statement that the vote prohibits the administration ""from implementing executive amnesty"" without congressional action. ""Bipartisan support for my amendment is the first test of the 113th Congress in the House of Representatives on immigration. My amendment blocks many of the provisions that are mirrored in the Senate's 'Gang of Eight' bill. If this position holds, no amnesty will reach the President's desk,"" he said.

The vote took place as Senate leaders set Friday for the opening of debate on White House-backed legislation that would create a chance at citizenship for those in the country unlawfully, at the same time it takes steps to assure the borders are secure against future illegal immigration.

Story continues

The measure was drafted by a bipartisan group of eight senators, then approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee last month on a vote of 13-8. It also creates a new low-skilled guest-worker program, expands the number of visas available for high-tech industry workers and reorders the system for legal immigration that has been in place for decades.

Debate is expected to consume weeks on the Senate floor as lawmakers of differing views try to change it more to their liking. Notably, Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who was part of the group that drafted the legislation, is saying he wants changes before he will support it on final passage. His office did not respond to a request for reaction to the House vote.

In the House, 221 Republicans and three Democrats voted for King's proposal, while 195 Democrats and six Republicans opposed it.

""I can't believe they just did that,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., a leading supporter of the DREAM Act. Ana Avendano of the AFL-CIO, said in a statement that King and his allies are playing to ""a dwindling base of anti-immigrant Republican primary voters. We hope and expect that the leadership of the Republican party will understand that this is not only abhorrent policy but suicidal politics.""

Speaking to a group of reporters, a White House official, Cecilia Munoz, said, ""If part of what is driving this debate is a recognition, particularly on the Republican side, that they need to do better with the Latino community, this is really not the right way.""

Obama announced a new policy in June 2012 that puts off deportation for two years for many of those brought to the United States as children, specifically if they were under 16 at the time and are no older than 31 now. They also must be in school, graduated from high school or have served in the military and have no criminal record. The order offers relief from deportation from many young immigrants who would be covered by the so-called DREAM Act, which has repeatedly failed in Congress.

Democrats argued vociferously against King's proposal when it was debated Wednesday evening. ""We should not hold children responsible for the actions of adults and their parents. We should give them an opportunity,"" said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who has been involved in a sputtering attempt to produce a compromise immigration bill in the House.

Those efforts were dealt a potentially fatal blow on Wednesday, when Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, announced he was leaving the group because of a dispute over health care.

House GOP leaders have not yet announced a plan for considering immigration legislation, although it appears likely that several smaller bills will be considered rather than a comprehensive measure that covers the elements that are combined into one in the Senate.

One of them, introduced during the day by Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., permits state and local authorities to enforce federal immigration laws.

There is little, if any, support among the GOP rank and file for a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million or so immigrants estimated to be living in the United States illegally, although there appears to be some sentiment to allow many such individuals to remain in the country.

Speaker John Boehner has said privately he hopes to have committee action complete by the end of June, with a vote in the House by the end of July.

(CNN) – United States Marines are being told to preserve ammunition and gasoline as a deal softening the impact of automatic spending cuts continues to elude leaders in Washington.

Marine Corps Commandant James Amos urged personnel in a video posted online Friday to ""save every round, every gallon of gas,"" and to ""take every single aspect or opportunity in training to get the most bang for the buck,"" a reminder of the cuts' immediate effect on the U.S. military.



The Marine Corps and other branches are being forced to cut billions from their budgets as the result of the spending cuts, which were triggered March 1 when Congress and the White House failed to strike a deal reducing the federal debt. In a letter to all Marines dated March 2, Amos said his branch would cut $1.4 billion in 2013 and $2 billion in every ensuing year for nearly a decade.

State-by-state reports produced by the White House indicated the military slashes would be seen in delayed maintenance for military equipment and canceled air shows, along with furloughs for civilian defense personnel. Salaries for enlisted personnel are exempt from the budget cuts.

""This is no time to do business as usual,"" Amos said in the video. ""Things have changed. The landscape's changed. We need you to be conservative in the way you do business, I need you to think about conserving our assets, and I need you to become part of the solution as it relates to sacrifice.""

The primary goal of the Marines going forward will be to preserve the corps' readiness, Amos said, including initiatives to ""recapitalize"" and ""modernize"" the institution. But for now, Amos indicated Marine leaders will be focused on ""moving money around"" and looking at more ways to reduce spending.

""This is going to require all of us to take a different perspective on your piece of the Marine Corps, and it's going to require all of us to take a look at how we sacrifice for the good of the institution,"" he said.

And despite the cuts originating from a stalemate between the White House and lawmakers, Amos described Congress as ""our best friends.""

""The Marine Corps exists today because of Congress,"" he said, saying in discussions with congressmen and senators it's clear that lawmakers want to help counteract the automatic spending cuts.

""Everybody's on this, everybody's pulling together,"" he said.

http://news.yahoo.com/exclusive-hundreds-u-security-clearance-records-falsified-federal-052103376--sector.html,,[],Exclusive: Hundreds of U.S. security clearances seen falsified,"By Tabassum Zakaria WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors have documented at least 350 instances of faulty background investigations done by private contractors and special agents for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in recent years, illustrating what some lawmakers call systemic weaknesses in the granting of federal security clearances. Reuters calculated the total by reviewing court documents and press releases from prosecutors for 21 cases resulting in convictions that involved the making of false statements from December 2004 to March 2012. These are the cases government officials have cited to assert that action is taken against investigators who falsely claim to have reviewed records or done interviews for background checks submitted to OPM. Not all the cases identified a specific number of fabrications. The 350 falsified reports represent only a small percentage of the number of background investigations conducted each year, either by OPM's own investigators or a handful of private contractors it uses for most of the work. The Government Accountability Office testified to a congressional committee in June that OPM received over $1 billion to conduct more than 2 million background investigations for government employees in fiscal 2011. But the details of the cases show how cracks in the system may allow employees to obtain clearances without proper vetting. In one case, a private contractor investigator, who pleaded guilty to making a false statement, reported interviewing a person who had died more than a decade earlier. Another investigator was found guilty of making false statements in checks for applicants seeking ""top secret"" clearances for jobs in the Air Force, Army, Navy and U.S. Treasury. The highest number of convictions, 11, involved special agents for OPM. Another seven convictions were of employees of USIS, a Virginia-based company that has come under scrutiny for its role in vetting former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and more recently, Washington Navy Yard shooter Aaron Alexis. Two of those USIS investigators had the highest number - more than four dozen each - of flawed background check reports sent to OPM, court documents showed. USIS faces an ongoing investigation by OPM's inspector general. The company declined to comment for this story and OPM's inspector general's office would not comment on its probe. The most severe punishment was given to an investigator who did not take a plea agreement and instead went to trial. This investigator was found guilty of six counts of making false statements and sentenced to 27 months in prison. Those who entered plea agreements generally received sentences of probation and community service, courts records show. ALEXIS, SNOWDEN CLEARANCES In a statement last week after 13 people died in shootings at the Navy Yard, including shooter Alexis, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia said, ""In light of recent events, we plan to step up our efforts to investigate and prosecute the individuals and companies who risk our security by cutting corners and falsifying information in background checks."" In pressing the cases, prosecutors have required defendants to pay more than $1.5 million in restitution to the U.S. government to recover the costs of redoing improper background investigations. The screening process for security clearances has came under heightened scrutiny this year since Snowden, working as a contract employee assigned to the National Security Agency, used his ""top-secret"" clearance to access documents on the agency's electronic eavesdropping that he later gave to the news media. The issue resurfaced last week with reports that Alexis held a ""secret"" security clearance despite violent episodes before and after he received it. A secret clearance generally lasts 10 years. Ongoing checks are needed because ""in five to 10 years stuff happens and people change,"" a Senate aide said on condition of anonymity. OPM contracts out for most of the background check work. But the decision to grant security clearances rests with the government agency that intends to employ the individual. USIS conducts about 65 percent of the background checks done by private contractors, and more than half of all the investigations conducted by the OPM, according to a statement issued last week by the office of Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat who is a co-sponsor of legislation aimed at boosting oversight of the security clearance process. Investigators for other government contractors, including CACI International Inc, were also convicted of making false statements in reports for security clearance background checks. CACI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Senate aide said the USIS investigation by OPM's inspector general revolves around systemic problems in the company's procedures and does not focus on individual investigators. The inspector general also is investigating the background check done for Alexis before he received clearance to work for the Navy. In 2012, there were 3.5 million federal employees and 1.1 million contractors who held a ""secret"" or ""top secret"" clearance and OPM's security clearance and background investigations cost about $1 billion, McCaskill's office said. The OPM inspector general's office told Reuters it has 68 open cases related to OPM's background investigations program. It did not say how many of those involve report falsifications. The inspector general's office said it has referred 22 former background investigators for debarment, but no decisions have been reached by OPM. A debarment is usually for a specific time period and means the person cannot contract with another federal agency. The Senate Homeland Security Committee has scheduled an October 1 hearing on government clearances and background checks. (Reporting by Tabassum Zakaria; Editing by Marilyn W.

http://news.yahoo.com/big-4-cellphone-carriers-unite-anti-texting-ads-042113131.html,,[],Big 4 cellphone carriers unite on anti-texting ads,"NEW YORK (AP) — The country's four biggest cellphone companies are set to launch their first joint advertising campaign against texting while driving, uniting behind AT&T's ""It Can Wait"" slogan to blanket TV and radio this summer.

AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint and T-Mobile will be joined by 200 other organizations backing the multi-million dollar ad campaign.

The campaign is unusual not just because it unites rivals, but because it represents companies warning against the dangers of their own products. After initially fighting laws against cellphone use while driving, cellphone companies have begun to embrace the language of the federal government's campaign against cellphone use by drivers.

AT&T and Verizon have run ads against texting and driving since 2009. In 2005, Sprint Nextel Corp. created an education program targeting teens learning to drive.

""Every CEO in the industry that you talk to recognizes that this is an issue that needs to be dealt with,"" AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said in an interview. ""I think we all understand that pooling our resources with one consistent message is a lot more powerful than all four of us having different messages and going different directions.""

Beyond TV and radio ads, the new campaign will stretch into the skies through displays on Goodyear's three blimps. It will also include store displays, community events, social-media outreach and a national tour of a driving simulator. The campaign targets teens in particular.

AT&T Inc. calls texting and driving an ""epidemic,"" a term it borrows from the federal Department of Transportation. The U.S. transportation secretary has been on a self-described ""rampage"" against cellphones since his term began in January 2009.

Stephenson said that ""texting while driving is a deadly habit that makes you 23 times more likely to be involved in a crash."" The figure refers to a 2009 government study of bus and truck drivers. It isn't based on crashes alone, but on the likelihood the drivers showed risky behavior such as lane drifting or sharp braking, sometimes culminating in a crash.

Story continues

The unified ad campaign comes as some researchers are starting to say that while texting and driving at the same time is clearly a bad idea, it's not contributing measurably to an increase in traffic accidents. The number of accidents is in a long-term decline, and the explosion of texting and smartphone use doesn't seem to be reversing that trend.

In the 2009 government study, texting, email and surfing on the cellphone was a factor in about 1 percent of crashes, well below epidemic levels.

""There's no question that phone use is causing crashes. But so far it doesn't appear to be adding to the overall crash problem,"" says Russ Rader, a spokesman for the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety, which is funded by the insurance industry. The institute's analysis is based in part on comparing accident rates before and after states enact bans on hand-held cellphone use while driving. Most states ban cellphone use at least for some drivers; 39 states and the District of Columbia ban text messaging for all drivers.

James Sayer, a research scientist at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, has suggested that the debate over driver distraction ""needs to address far more than cellphones. Only addressing the 'new' forms of distraction will have limited impact in terms of total lives saved."" Sayer made the remarks in a presentation to the National Transportation Safety Board.

Nonetheless, the cellphone industry and the federal government have focused their attention on cellphones.

The government's Distraction.gov site singles out cellphones as the greatest danger among all sources of driver distraction. In an interview last year with The Associated Press, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said that in 2010, 3,092 lives ""could have been saved if someone had the sense to put down their cellphone.""

That figure is based on a misunderstanding of the department's statistics, which showed that 3,092 people were killed in crashes involving distractions of all kinds, including eating, drinking, fiddling with the car stereo and talking to passengers. The number of deaths in 2010 that the Department of Transportation attributes to cellphone use was 408, or 1.2 percent of the total traffic death toll.

That figure could be an undercount, though, as it's hard for police to figure out after a crash if a cellphone was involved. Sayer suggested that the real share of traffic deaths caused by cellphones is 3.5 percent.

In campaigning against the use of their products, cellphone companies are in the company of liquor makers, which include discrete reminders not to drink and drive in their advertising. However, drunk driving remains a far bigger killer than cellphone use, accounting for 10,228 traffic deaths in 2010, or 31 percent of the total.

""We have people using our technology, and when they use our technology it has some rather traumatic impacts on society,"" Stephenson said in the interview. ""I think it's a logical place for us to engage.""

The four-way industry collaboration around the ""It Can Wait"" campaign will last until September, Stephenson said, but it could continue if the partners agree."

(CNN) —

In a sign of the political hangover congressional Republicans are suffering in the wake of the government shutdown, three-quarters of Americans in a new national poll say that most GOP members of Congress don’t deserve to be re-elected.

A CNN/ORC International survey released Monday also found a majority saying that the Republicans’ policies are too extreme. And according to the poll, Democrats have an 8-point advantage over the Republicans in an early indicator in the battle for control of Congress. But with more than a year to go until the 2014 midterm elections, there’s plenty of time for these numbers to change.

CNN Poll: House Republicans, Boehner take big post-shutdown hit

The poll was conducted Friday through Sunday, just after the end of the 16-day partial federal government shutdown that was sparked in part by an effort by House conservatives to dismantle the health care law, which is President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement.

A majority of those questioned blamed congressional Republicans for the government shutdown and said the President was the bigger winner in the deal to end the crisis.

The survey also found nearly eight in 10 saying the shutdown was bad for the country, and the standoff has led to a loss of confidence and satisfaction in government. And more than seven in 10 think that another shutdown is likely.

Anger directed at congressional Republicans

More than seven in 10 questioned in the survey said that most members of Congress don’t deserve to be re-elected, with nearly four in 10 saying even their own representative doesn’t deserve a return ticket to Washington next year. Both figures are hovering around all-time highs in CNN polling.

“Although incumbent members of Congress of both parties are not very popular, the shutdown seems to have only affected views of GOP incumbents,” CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said.

Defeated GOP hopes to unite, fight another day

Three-fourths of people questioned in the survey said that most congressional Republicans don’t deserved to be re-elected, 21 percentage points higher than the 54% who say most Democrats don’t deserve another term in office. Only one in five say most Republicans deserve to be re-elected; 42% say the same thing about Democrats on Capitol Hill.

Democrats hold early 2014 polling lead

The shutdown seems to be making an impact on polls asking the generic ballot question: Would you vote for the Democratic or Republican candidate in your congressional district. There is no mention of the names of any candidates.

Fifty percent of registered voters questioned said they would vote for the Democrat in their district, with 42% backing the Republican. The 8-point Democratic margin in the CNN poll is the same as in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey and close to the 9-point advantage for the Democrats in the generic ballot in a recent Quinnipiac University poll.

While the generic ballot is a much-watched gauge, it’s important to remember that the battle for the House is a district-by-district fight, rather than a national race, and just 17 of the 232 House Republicans are in districts won by Obama in last year’s election.

Obama wants new approach after shutdown

“We’re a long way away from saying that the Democrats have a chance to regain control of the House,” Holland cautioned. “There is more than a year to go before any votes are actually cast and the ‘generic ballot’ question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections. A year before the 2010 midterms, for example, the Democrats held a 6-point lead on the generic ballot.”

The Republicans eventually won back control of the House in 2010, thanks to a historic 63-seat pickup.

GOP too extreme?

One major concern for Republicans is the growing number of Americans who think the party is too extreme. Fifty-six percent now feel that way, up from 48% in March. By contrast, 52% say that the policies of the Democrats are generally mainstream (with 42% saying they are too extreme), which is unchanged since March.

“Any connection with the tea party movement isn’t helping the GOP,” Holland added. “Six in 10 Americans now believe that the tea party movement is too extreme; only one in four consider it to be generally mainstream.”

The poll indicates that Republicans themselves are divided on whether the 4 1/2-year-old grassroots conservative movement is too extreme or generally mainstream.

Four things we learned from government shutdown

Blame Game

Fifty-two percent say congressional Republicans were more responsible for the shutdown, with 34% pointing more fingers at the President. At 45%-36%, independents place more blame with the GOP in Congress.

The poll indicates Obama was the clear winner. Sixty-four percent say the President got more of what he wanted out of the deal to end the shutdown, with less than one in five saying the GOP in Congress were the winners. More than seven in 10 Republicans and conservatives agree that Obama got more of what he wanted.

Fifty-five percent of the public say the GOP strategy to link dismantling parts of Obamacare to funding the government was a mistake, with 42% saying it made sense at the time. While vast majority of Democrats say the strategy was a mistake, independents are divided, and most Republicans say the move made sense.

The next shutdown ?

While the GOP doesn’t fare well in the poll, the poll suggests that the public is looking for almost as much compromise from the Democrats as from the Republicans in any bipartisan agreements.

Forty-nine percent say the Republicans should give up more than the Democrats in any future bipartisan agreement, but nearly as many – 44% – would prefer to see the Dems give up more than the GOP.

And seven in 10 say that another shutdown is likely when current funding for the federal government runs out in mid-January.

“That’s probably because Americans have lost confidence in the people who run government,” Holland said.

According to the poll, only a third say they have a great deal or some confidence in the people who run government, down 10 points since May. And only 14% say they are satisfied with the way the nation is being governed.

“That’s an 11-point drop since March and is lower than the 26% who felt that way in September of 1973, when the Watergate crisis was in full swing,” Holland added.

In another sign of anti-Washington sentiment, six in 10 say the government should not do more to solve the country’s problems.

Jan Brewer Talks Border Security Issues Ignored by Senate Immigration Bill,"The “Gang of” 8 grand immigration proposal, over 800 pages, is written by members of the same body that has failed to address the problem of meaningful immigration reform for over 30 years.

Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) stated that he wanted the 92 other members to join in this important debate. In the House of Representatives in particular, the silence of the GOP leadership is deafening.

Look at what is missing in this process: transparency; experts on many aspects of immigration reform; and law enforcement agencies involved in dealing with the problems on the ground. The GOP-led House of Representatives has promised regular order. How much transparency we will see from the Senate is undetermined. Most of all, valuable input from relevant Governors are left out of the equation.

A transparent public discussion is required. In 1986 we had outright amnesty and the promised enforcement of a secure border. Lack of promised enforcement by Democrats got us to this point with a significantly larger problem. Are we creating de facto amnesty again with a rushed comprehensive bill over incremental and combined approaches to the problem?

With America’s burgeoning Hispanic population–the largest block of illegal immigrants–more emphasis seems to be placed on who will vote en masse for which party over necessary solutions for the long-term future of this country. It is a bitter pill to take, with the term “lawful presence” in its prescription.

The recent terror attacks in Boston renewed calls from both Republicans and Democrats in the “Gang of 8” for immediate immigration reform. Border security is key, as Arizona Governor Jan Brewer recently stated in my American Forum.

Governor Brewer made the case for working with residents that live along the border, state police, sheriffs and other local law enforcement agencies. There is also the issue of sending the National Guard for additional resources.

This is not a numbers issue; it is a human issue. We have citizens in constant danger along our southern border. There are areas where a fence is necessary and could prove to be effective. The Obama Administration restricts border patrol activity on federal lands, and the cartels, human traffickers, illegal aliens who break our law by crossing the southern border are not known for their obedience to the law. They cross onto federal land with impunity, and the proper authorities are not allowed to pursue.

The “Gang of 8” proposal so far leaves more questions to be answered than solutions offered. Solutions must include standards, methods to achieve those standards, and metrics to measure their effectiveness. Long-term concerns, such as those expressed by Governor Brewer, much less solutions, are largely cast aside."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/17/envelope-containing-ricin-sent-to-sen-wicker-lawmakers-say/,2013-04-17 00:00:00,[],"Letter sent to Obama tests positive for ricin, FBI says","The FBI has confirmed that a letter addressed to President Obama has ""preliminarily tested positive"" for ricin, a day after lawmakers said another letter sent to the Capitol Hill office of Sen. Roger Wicker tested positive for the same substance.

The warnings come amid a flurry of reports on suspicious packages. Fox News has learned of several suspicious packages or envelopes in various Capitol Hill office buildings. Capitol Police say three packages that were flagged have been removed and the areas have been cleared.

Separately, the office of Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., reported a ""suspicious-looking letter"" at one of the senator's Michigan offices; and a spokesman for Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., reported a ""suspicious letter"" was intercepted at Flake's Phoenix office. Authorities were also called to the Dallas office of Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, over what was described only as ""a piece of mail"" -- but field tests later came back negative.

The package alerts compounded security concerns in the wake of the letter incidents and the Boston bombing, which the FBI has said do not appear to be related.

Both of the initial suspicious letters were apparently intercepted on Tuesday. They never reached the Hill or the White House.

An FBI bulletin obtained by Fox News said the letter sent to Obama is still being screened, though it initially tested positive.

The bulletin said both letters included the phrase: ""To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.""

Both were signed, ""I am KC and I approve this message.""

The letter to the Mississippi Republican was intercepted at an off-site mail screening facility.

Authorities declined to comment on a suspect or any other aspect of the investigation being led by Capitol Police, but Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., told the Associated Press police have a suspect in mind.

""The person that is a suspect writes a lot of letters to members,"" McCaskill said as she emerged from a classified briefing.

Testing is apparently still underway. The letter tested positive for ricin in a field test, but the FBI released a statement Wednesday saying tests have shown ""inconsistent results"" and the substance is being further analyzed.

According to a Homeland Security Department handbook, ricin is deadliest when inhaled. It is not contagious, but there is no antidote.

Wicker thanked law enforcement officials in a statement for ""their hard work and diligence in keeping"" those who work in the Capitol safe, adding that the matter is part of an ongoing investigation by Capitol Police and the FBI. ""Gayle and I appreciate everyone's thoughts and prayers,"" he said.

As of Tuesday night, mail delivery had only been stopped to the Senate, not the House.

""It is of concern,"" Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said after learning about the incident in a briefing with other senators late Tuesday.

The envelope had a Tennessee postmark and no return address.

The letter inside included an implied threat to effect of: ""You haven’t listen to me before. Now you will, even if people have to die,"" Politico also reported.

Sources say officials are familiar with the person believed to have sent the letter as the person has sent other letters before.

FBI Director Robert Mueller and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano were on Capitol Hill on Tuesday for a scheduled talk about cyber security. But that briefing morphed into talks about Boston, after the bombings Monday.

Senate Sergeant at Arms Terry Gainer conducted a separate briefing for senators specifically on ricin.

It's unclear whether the letter had any connection to the Boston attack.

The mail-screening system was established after the Anthrax attacks of 2001 that closed the Hart Senate Office Building.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html,2013-08-18 00:00:00,['Peter Maass'],How Laura Poitras Helped Snowden Spill His Secrets,"Amid the chaos, Poitras, an intense-looking woman of 49, sat in a spare bedroom or at the table in the living room, working in concentrated silence in front of her multiple computers. Once in a while she would walk over to the porch to talk with Greenwald about the article he was working on, or he would sometimes stop what he was doing to look at the latest version of a new video she was editing about Snowden. They would talk intensely — Greenwald far louder and more rapid-fire than Poitras — and occasionally break out laughing at some shared joke or absurd memory. The Snowden story, they both said, was a battle they were waging together, a fight against powers of surveillance that they both believe are a threat to fundamental American liberties.

Two reporters for The Guardian were in town to assist Greenwald, so some of our time was spent in the hotel where they were staying along Copacabana Beach, the toned Brazilians playing volleyball in the sand below lending the whole thing an added layer of surreality. Poitras has shared the byline on some of Greenwald’s articles, but for the most part she has preferred to stay in the background, letting him do the writing and talking. As a result, Greenwald is the one hailed as either a fearless defender of individual rights or a nefarious traitor, depending on your perspective. “I keep calling her the Keyser Soze of the story, because she’s at once completely invisible and yet ubiquitous,” Greenwald said, referring to the character in “The Usual Suspects” played by Kevin Spacey, a mastermind masquerading as a nobody. “She’s been at the center of all of this, and yet no one knows anything about her.”

As dusk fell one evening, I followed Poitras and Greenwald to the newsroom of O Globo, one of the largest newspapers in Brazil. Greenwald had just published an article there detailing how the N.S.A. was spying on Brazilian phone calls and e-mails. The article caused a huge scandal in Brazil, as similar articles have done in other countries around the world, and Greenwald was a celebrity in the newsroom. The editor in chief pumped his hand and asked him to write a regular column; reporters took souvenir pictures with their cellphones. Poitras filmed some of this, then put her camera down and looked on. I noted that nobody was paying attention to her, that all eyes were on Greenwald, and she smiled. “That’s right,” she said. “That’s perfect.”

Poitras seems to work at blending in, a function more of strategy than of shyness. She can actually be remarkably forceful when it comes to managing information. During a conversation in which I began to ask her a few questions about her personal life, she remarked, “This is like visiting the dentist.” The thumbnail portrait is this: She was raised in a well-off family outside Boston, and after high school, she moved to San Francisco to work as a chef in upscale restaurants. She also took classes at the San Francisco Art Institute, where she studied under the experimental filmmaker Ernie Gehr. In 1992, she moved to New York and began to make her way in the film world, while also enrolling in graduate classes in social and political theory at the New School. Since then she has made five films, most recently “The Oath,” about the Guantánamo prisoner Salim Hamdan and his brother-in-law back in Yemen, and has been the recipient of a Peabody Award and a MacArthur award.

On Sept. 11, 2001, Poitras was on the Upper West Side of Manhattan when the towers were attacked. Like most New Yorkers, in the weeks that followed she was swept up in both mourning and a feeling of unity. It was a moment, she said, when “people could have done anything, in a positive sense.” When that moment led to the pre-emptive invasion of Iraq, she felt that her country had lost its way. “We always wonder how countries can veer off course,” she said. “How do people let it happen, how do people sit by during this slipping of boundaries?” Poitras had no experience in conflict zones, but in June 2004, she went to Iraq and began documenting the occupation.

Shortly after arriving in Baghdad, she received permission to go to Abu Ghraib prison to film a visit by members of Baghdad’s City Council. This was just a few months after photos were published of American soldiers abusing prisoners there. A prominent Sunni doctor was part of the visiting delegation, and Poitras shot a remarkable scene of his interaction with prisoners there, shouting that they were locked up for no good reason.

The doctor, Riyadh al-Adhadh, invited Poitras to his clinic and later allowed her to report on his life in Baghdad. Her documentary, “My Country, My Country,” is centered on his family’s travails — the shootings and blackouts in their neighborhood, the kidnapping of a nephew. The film premiered in early 2006 and received widespread acclaim, including an Oscar nomination for best documentary."

Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said Sunday that Democratic aides in the Senate are drafting new language for an authorization of military force in Syria, Politico reports.

Speaking after some members of Congress returned early from recess to attend closed-door briefings on the situation in Syria, Leahy said the draft legislation offered by President Barack Obama on Saturday was too broad.

“I know it’s going to be amended in the Senate,” Leahy said, according to Politico.

On Saturday, Obama submitted to Congress a draft resolution authorizing the use of military force in response to Syrian President Bashar Assad's suspected use of chemical weapons on innocent civilians. The measure would allow the president to use force in a “necessary and appropriate” way.

""While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,"" Obama said during a Saturday statement.

According to the Washington Post, Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) also expressed hesitation over the draft's language.

“I think the biggest question I heard is that the president’s request is open-ended,” Roberts said. “That has to be rectified, and they simply said in answer to that that they would work with the Congress and try to come back with a more prescribed resolution. But I’m not too sure that the people who answered that are the people that have that decision to make.”

According to Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), about 100 to 150 lawmakers attended the classified briefing."

USA TODAY

Chinese leader coming to U.S. next month

Stories in %27The People%27s Daily%27 blast U.S. culture

Latest story even rips United Airlines

BEIJING – Chinese leader Xi Jinping better watch out for ""immoral and dishonest Americans"" when he travels to California for a summit June 7-8 with President Obama. Best he avoids United Airlines, too.

The advice, published for all Chinese citizens, comes from The People's Daily, the flagship newspaper and faithful mouthpiece of China's ruling Communist Party, which Xi, 59, has led since last fall. Yet the overwhelming response within China has been ridicule at the paper's ham-fisted efforts to attack the USA.

""Immoral and Dishonest Americans,"" as the paper's bilingual, online column was titled until Saturday, aims to correct Chinese people's overly positive view of Americans. ""Most Chinese people think that Americans are honest, reliable and righteous,"" the introduction to the column explains. These descriptions ""are a bit misleading,"" it says before offering incidents and individuals ""to provide a more objective picture of what the U.S. and Americans are really like.""

The series started in March but went viral domestically this weekend when many other Chinese media outlets ran its latest piece that criticized customer service at United Airlines. The article featured a Chinese passenger who felt aggrieved and insulted when bumped off an over-booked flight from New York.

Long-suffering American fliers may sympathize with his treatment. The People's Daily chose to turn the episode into further evidence of American dishonesty, following tales of a grasping locksmith and a thieving payroll company. The latest column Friday concluded, ""Of course, Chinese passengers may choose not to consider UA. This probably is the best solution.""

Having his own plane, Xi Jinping is spared this problem. Through countless online outlets in China and especially the Twitter-like Sina Weibo micro-blogging service, The People's Daily has not been spared a barrage of ridicule and contempt for its attempts to criticize the USA.

America, called the ""beautiful country"" in Chinese, remains an object of fascination for Chinese people, as it does for many countries worldwide, and a top target for emigration. Though the state-run media often run critical stories about U.S. political, economic and social issues, most Chinese maintain a broadly positive view of the USA.

Chinese consumers snap up U.S.-designed products such as the iPhone and often prefer Hollywood movies and TV series to China's sometimes turgid and always state-censored entertainment. To counter this ""soft power"" of the USA, Beijing invests heavily to expand the size and reach of its state-run media in the USA and other markets.

The People's Daily's column is penned by its New York staff. The response – ""overwhelmingly negative,"" according to the Global Times, a sister paper with a strongly nationalist bent — shows the difficulty of convincing the Chinese online public, who have grown highly skeptical of their own government and quick to redirect state criticism of other nations.

Many responses on Sina Weibo are rich in irony. Some suggest the column was written as revenge for U.S. TV host Jimmy Kimmel's recent mocking of the shape of The People's Daily new headquarters in Beijing. Chinese Internet users have also laughed at its resemblance to the male reproductive organ.

Zhan Jiang, a journalism professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University, asked whether the column aims to warn Xi against being tricked on his U.S. travels or to ease pressure on the U.S. Embassy's visa section. ""Thirty years ago, we were educated that Americans all lived in hell on earth, but American people were good, they were waiting for us to liberate them,"" historian Lei Yi wrote. ""Thirty years on, we are educated that Americans are 'immoral and dishonest.'""

Despite Xi's crackdown on official corruption, the Chinese public is scornful of party and government officials long seen as enriching themselves to afford elite lifestyles far beyond their modest salaries, including overseas study for their offspring. Many posts mocked officials for sending family members to such a dishonest nation. Xi's daughter studied at Harvard.

In the face of public scorn, the paper changed the column's Chinese title Saturday to the blander ""The Americans You Don't Know."" The English title remains, as before, ""The Dishonest Americans Series."" Calling for more ""objective observation"" by both China and the USA, the Global Times said the incident provides ""an embarrassing lesson that People's Daily has to draw from this misguided effort to diversify Chinese voices regarding the U.S."" But the USA, too, must cease its ""old trick"" of choosing ""part of China's image, usually unfavorable, to magnify and hype up its negative influence,"" the paper said Monday.

One visiting American tried to make progress Monday in handling the often rocky U.S.-Chinese relationship, beset by problems such as cyber-attacks and how to handle North Korea. Tom Donilon, national security adviser to President Obama, met Chinese officials to prepare for next month's summit between the two leaders. China hopes to enhance dialogue, exchanges and cooperation with the U.S. side, as well as properly handle sensitive issues, in a bid to promote the sound and steady development of bilateral ties, said Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi, the Xinhua state news agency reported.

“If he wants to go somewhere and somebody will host him – no problem,” Putin said in televised remarks during a news conference in Moscow. “If he wants to stay here, there is one condition: He must stop his work aimed at harming our American partners.”

It appears, the Russian president added, that Snowden has no such intention. “So he must choose for himself a country to stay in and move there,” he said. “Unfortunately, I don’t know when this will happen. If I knew I would tell you now.”

Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked U.S. security secrets, met Monday morning with Russian consular service officials and handed them an appeal to 15 countries for political asylum, according to a Russian Foreign Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official didn’t name the countries, but said that Russia was among them.

Kim Shevchenko, a Russian consular official at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport, later confirmed to the Interfax news agency that Snowden had applied for asylum in Russia.

The United States has a warrant for Snowden’s arrest and has asked that Russia return him, despite the fact that the two countries do not have an extradition treaty. Putin dismissed the notion, while noting that Russia does engage in spy swaps.

“Russia never hands anybody over anywhere and doesn’t intend to do so,” the Russian leader said. “At best, we exchanged our Foreign Intelligence Service agents for those who were detained and arrested and convicted in a Russian Federation court.”

Putin stressed that Snowden is not a Russian agent and that he is not cooperating with Russian special services. “I am telling you responsibly he is not cooperating with us today, either.”

Earlier in the day, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said to reporters that Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and the American FBI “are in constant contact” over Snowden.

Igor Korotchenko, editor-in-chief of the monthly National Defense journal, said it appeared that Putin was, in effect, offering a peace deal to the United States over Snowden.

“Putin publicly pledged that if Snowden stays in Russia the Kremlin will do its best to prevent any public exposures in the Russian mass media of the CIA’s and NSA’s secret activities,” Korotchenko said. “Washington should see this as a fair deal, a much better bargain than if Snowden goes on to Venezuela and continues to expose U.S. special services operations.”

“Putin made it as clear as possible that Russia is not playing a game with the United States and that Snowden landed in Russia quite unexpectedly for the Kremlin,” the analyst added.

Federal agents trying to stop the black Infiniti speeding between the White House and the U.S. Capitol fired seven shots at its unarmed driver, who had a toddler in the car with her, an uncommon tactic that occurred during a highly unusual chase.

A woman with a 1-year-old girl in her car was fatally shot by police near the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, after a chase through the heart of Washington that brought a new jolt of fear to a city already rattled by the recent Navy Yard shooting and the federal shutdown.

The car was registered to Miriam Carey, 34, a dental hygienist from Stamford, Conn., law enforcement officials said, adding that they believed Carey was the driver.

D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said that the driver tried to breach two Washington landmarks and that the incident was not an accident. But officials also said it did not appear to be part of any larger or organized terrorist plot.

The chase began at about 2:15 p.m. at a White House security checkpoint, where the woman struck a barrier and a Secret Service officer with her black Infiniti. The woman then sped away from that fortified icon and headed straight for another: the Capitol.

During the chase, police officers opened fire twice, both times in areas busy with tourists and office workers. The Capitol itself was locked down, as a bitter debate over the government shutdown was interrupted by echoes of shots, officers with guns and an urgent order to “shelter in place.”

The end came outside the Hart Senate Office Building, at Maryland Avenue and Second Street NE. The woman’s car got stuck. Officers fired another volley. Then, moments later, an officer emerged with the girl and carried the toddler quickly away as new waves of officers arrived.

Authorities said the woman was not armed, and although the incident was first reported as a shooting at the Capitol, the only shots were fired by officers.

Police said there was no indication that the woman was part of a larger threat. But they said little about why she had suddenly become a threat herself.

“I am pretty confident this was not an accident,” Lanier said at an evening news conference.

Lanier said that the girl was in good condition and in protective custody. Two officers were injured in the chase along Pennsylvania Avenue, but only one, a U.S. Capitol Police officer, was treated at a hospital. He was later released.

The chaotic day caught Washington at an unusually low moment. Just days after the government shut down because of a budget impasse and weeks after 12 people were killed at the nearby Navy Yard, the notion of gunfire and a car hurtling from the White House to the Capitol had the city thinking the worst.

It began with something not that unusual — a driver with out-of-state plates turning into a blocked entry near the White House.

It quickly became something else.

“Whoa! Whoa!,” Secret Service officers were shouting at the car, according to a witness, Shawn Joseph, 29. “It looked liked [the driver was] scared or lost. I thought they might have been a tourist.”

But then, witnesses said, officers tried to place a barrier in front of the car. The driver swerved. The officers moved the barrier. She hit it, and a Secret Service officer was thrown up on the hood and then off the car.

The officer was not badly hurt. The driver sped east and was stopped by police at a small traffic circle at the foot of Capitol Hill. There, video shot by the U.S.-funded Arabic TV station Alhurra shows officers with guns pointed at the car. The driver took off.

“I thought it was a motorcade,” said Ryan Christiansen, of Idaho Falls, Idaho, when he saw the black car trailed by police cars with sirens wailing. Then, Christiansen said, the car

“was pulling away, and somewhere between six and eight shots were fired,” he said.

Despite the shots, the driver continued. She went around another traffic circle and then up Constitution Avenue toward the peak of Capitol Hill.

Up there, 46-year-old tourist Edmund Ofori-Attah was walking toward the Hart building to ask if it was open for tours. With most of Washington’s top attractions shut down, touring an office building sounded better than nothing.

Then he saw a black car whiz past. It abruptly turned left, as if to make a U-turn, and lodged itself on a grassy divide.

“That’s where it got pinned,” he said. “At that point, we heard five to six rounds of gunfire and my wife and I dropped to the ground. We were hoping not to get in the way of a stray bullet — we just lay down as low as possible. We even smelled the gunpowder in the air.”

The final shots were fired on that median. Police said they were not sure how many officers had fired or how many times the woman was shot.

Inside the Capitol, legislators were in the middle of their dragging stalemate.

“It was almost like two very rapid-fire bursts, very loud,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who had been standing outside on a Capitol balcony with Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.). They heard the gunfire and saw people running.

Around the vast complex, heavily armed Capitol Police officers began banging on doors, instructing staffers for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) to shelter in place and lock their doors.

“Shelter in place. Just get to your office,” an officer said when reporters asked what they should do.

An e-mail went out: “Gunshots have been reported on Capitol Hill. . . . Close, lock and stay away from external doors and windows.” Sharpshooters took positions outside the iconic building. The House adjourned. The Senate adjourned.

Outside, after the shots had been fired, witnesses saw the girl carried from the scene. A police officer sat down on the median and appeared to struggle for breath, visibly shaken.

In the hours after that, law enforcement officials said the car had been registered to Carey. The FBI was at Carey’s apartment Thursday night.

Police said the incident showed the success of the huge security apparatus that Washington has built since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

“The security perimeters worked” at both the White House and the Capitol, Lanier said. “They did exactly what they were supposed to do.”

Both houses of Congress came back later in the day and offered thanks to the Capitol Police. The House gave officers a standing ovation. Senate staffers were distributing small black buttons reading “THANK YOU, CAPITOL POLICE” with a picture of the Capitol Dome.

Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said he had called the injured Capitol Police officer, and the officer said he would be fine. Reid added that the officer said, “The only thing I do every day is to make sure you and everyone who works up here is safe.”

FBI has received aviation clearance for at least four domestic drone operations

By Craig Whitlock,

The FBI has received clearance from federal aviation officials to conduct drone surveillance operations in the United States on at least four occasions since 2010, according to public records and U.S. officials.

The FBI began seeking permission in 2009 from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones domestically and received authorization for its first operations a year later, according to documents released Thursday by the FAA.

The documents provide virtually no detail on where the FBI has operated drones in U.S. airspace, for what purpose or how long the missions lasted. But they shed some additional light on the origins and extent of the FBI’s secretive drone program, which FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III revealed Wednesday in Senate testimony.

Mueller told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the FBI uses drones “in a very, very minimal way and very seldom.” He gave no other details, except to say that the agency has “very few” drones and “that our footprint is very small.”

The FBI, he added, is working to develop privacy-protection guidelines, a major concern for lawmakers who worry that drones could be used by the government or private companies to revolutionize spying in the United States.

Paul Bresson, an FBI spokesman, declined to say how many drones the agency has, where they are flown or how many surveillance operations it has conducted. He said the FBI always receives approval in advance from the FAA. “We don’t want to get into how many or the geographic locales,” he said Thursday.

In a statement after Mueller’s testimony, the FBI said it used a drone in Alabama in February during a seven-day hostage standoff. The documents released Thursday show that the FAA granted the FBI permission to fly three other drone operations in 2010 and 2011. The records were disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy rights group based in San Francisco.

The FAA redacted the vast majority of the text, citing the need to keep law enforcement operations confidential. But the records suggest that in at least one operation, the FBI was flying a Puma AE, a lightweight drone with a range of about six miles. The Puma has a wingspan of eight feet and carries powerful infrared and electro-

optical cameras. It is made by AeroVironment, a California firm.

Drones, or unmanned aircraft, are generally prohibited from flying in U.S. airspace. The FAA has granted special exemptions to dozens of law enforcement agencies and universities, but authorization is generally limited to a confined geographic area and for a fixed period of time.

In June 2012, the Justice Department informed Congress that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had six drone helicopters in its fleet and that the Drug Enforcement Administration had “two robotic miniature helicopters,” but made no mention of whether the FBI had any unmanned aircraft.

Obama's speech comes after a slew of television interviews on the situation.

Watch Obama's speech above at 9 p.m., and scroll down for the latest developments on Syria.

Below, more from the AP:

WASHINGTON — In the run-up to a prime-time televised speech, President Barack Obama blended the threat of a military strike with the hope of a diplomatic solution Tuesday as he worked to rid Syria of an illicit stockpile of fearsome chemical weapons.

Secretary of State John Kerry set a hurry-up trip to Geneva for talks Thursday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and the United Nations Security Council first scheduled, and then scrapped, a private meeting on steps to defuse a looming crisis.

Despite expressing skepticism about the outcome of the diplomacy, officials said, Obama and close Senate allies reaffirmed their decision for a pause in attempts to win congressional backing for a strike against President Bashar Assad's government.

And while a presidential statement to that effect was possible in Obama's nationwide speech, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel pointedly told a congressional hearing it was not time to let the threat lapse. ""For this diplomatic option to have a chance at succeeding, the threat of a U.S. military action, the credible, real threat of U.S. military action, must continue,"" he declared.

At the same hearing, Kerry said any diplomacy ""cannot be a process of delay. This cannot be a process of avoidance.""

He later added that any agreement must include binding consequences if Syria fails to comply, and lawmakers moved to rewrite pending legislation along the same lines.

Obama himself ""wasn't overly optimistic about"" prospects for a solution at the U.N., said Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, after his party's rank and file met privately for lunch in the Capitol with the president. He quoted Obama as saying that even if a credible plan could be worked out, it could be difficult to push through the U.N. Security Council. And, indeed, Russian President Vladimir Putin said such a U.N. effort could work only if ""the American side and those who support the USA in this sense reject the use of force.""

The president readied his speech against an unpredictable chain of events stemming from a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburbs on Aug. 21 that the Obama administration swiftly blamed on Assad's government.

U.S. officials say more than 1,400 died in the episode, including at least 400 children, and other victims suffered uncontrollable twitching, foaming at the mouth and other symptoms typical of exposure to chemical weapons banned by international treaty. Other casualty estimates are lower, and Assad has said the attack was launched by rebels who have been fighting to drive him from power in a civil war that has so far claimed the lives of more than 100,000 civilians.

Assad's patron, Russia, has blocked U.S. attempts to rally the Security Council behind a military strike. But Monday, after a remark by Kerry, it spoke favorably about requiring Syria to surrender control of its chemical weapons, and the Syrian foreign minister did likewise.

The foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, said Tuesday that his government was ready to turn over its chemical weapons stockpile in line with Russia's proposal in order ""to thwart U.S. aggression."" He also said Syria was prepared to sign an international chemical convention it has long rejected – a step it can take on its own at any time without U.S. or U.N. supervision.

Syria has long refused to provide an accounting of the size of its stockpile, rarely referring in public to its existence. According to an unclassified estimate by the French government, it includes more than 1,000 tons of ""chemical agents and precursor chemicals,"" including sulfur mustard, VX and sarin gas.

Obama has said frequently he has the authority as commander in chief to order a military strike against Assad regardless of any vote in Congress, and he has consistently declined to say whether he would do so if lawmakers refuse to approve the legislation he is seeking.

The response in Congress to support such a strike has been lukewarm at best – as underscored during the day when liberal Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and conservative Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., both announced their opposition.

Markey, who was elected to the seat that Kerry vacated when he joined the Cabinet, said the legislation under consideration was too broad, ""the effects of a strike are too unpredictable, and ... I believe we must give diplomatic measures that could avoid military action a chance to work.""

Said Mulvaney: ""While I am concerned about taking no action, it strikes me that international law cannot be upheld via unilateral attack by the United States.""

And Rep. James Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat who sits on committees dealing both with military and intelligence matters, said he feared that ""Iran and Russia could cause serious damage"" to the United States if they retaliated with a cyberattack.

Yet Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking Democrat in the House, said, ""It would be inimical to our country's standing if we do not show a willingness to act in the face of the use of chemical weapons and to act in a limited way to address that use alone.""

Hours before Obama's speech from the White House's East Room, Hoyer added, "" I don't think there's any doubt that failure to do so would weaken our country, create a more dangerous international environment and to some degree undermine the president of the United States.""

Earlier, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell became the first congressional leader to come out against legislation giving the president authority for limited strikes. ""There are just too many unanswered questions about our long-term strategy in Syria,"" he said.

By contrast, Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, the top two Republicans in the House, have endorsed Obama's request.

Given the uncertainty of diplomatic maneuvering, no vote is expected for several days, if then.

""If something can be done diplomatically, I'm totally satisfied with that. I'm not a blood and thunder guy. I'm not for shock and awe,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in a reference to the massive display of firepower that opened the war in Iraq nearly a decade ago.

Still, there was ample skepticism in Congress about the United Nations as well as Russia's true intentions, as well as Syria's willingness to be bound by international agreements.

""There is an overwhelming view it would be preferable if international law and the family of nations could strip Syria of the chemical weapons,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. ""And there's a large view we should let that process play out for a little while.""

Said Boehner: ""Clearly, diplomacy is always a better outcome than military action. But I will say that I'm somewhat skeptical of those that are involved in the diplomatic discussions today.""

A letter was mailed to Mississippi Republican Sen. Roger Wicker's office containing the toxic substance ricin, forcing the temporary closure of a Senate post office and prompting a federal investigation.

The letter was intercepted at an off-site location on Tuesday morning and was later tested positive for ricin, a highly poisonous chemical that can be fatal to humans if inhaled. While the letter did not reach Wicker's office, the discovery prompted the off-site center to be shut down. There is no evidence of contamination in the on-site post office.

Wicker's office released a statement on Tuesday evening from the senator in which he did not specifically mention the letter or its contents. He said the matter was ""part of an ongoing investigation"" by the U.S. Capitol police and the FBI.

""I want to thank our law enforcement officials for their hard work and diligence in keeping those of us who work in the Capitol complex safe. Gayle [my wife] and I appreciate everyone’s thoughts and prayers,"" Wicker said.

Also Tuesday evening, the Senate sergeant-at-arms, Terrance Gainer, sent an email to senior Senate staff saying the letter had been postmarked from Memphis, Tenn., but had no unusual identifying marks. He urged staffers to be ""vigilant in their mail handling processes for ALL mailings.""

Senators first learned of the letter at a private security briefing about the Boston Marathon bombings, but there is no indication, senators said, that the poisonous letter was connected to Monday's attacks.

""We don't know enough about Boston to even speculate,"" said Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin after the briefing.

Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill said the sender was a person who mailed frequent letters to Capitol Hill. Lawmakers' state offices around the country are currently being notified about the incident.

All mail to the Capitol building is processed and tested in a facility off-site before reaching the destination as a precaution against incidents like this. Several senators interviewed said they were not concerned about a broader attempt to target them.

Story continues

""It was caught in a way that did no damage, so I'm not excessively concerned about it,"" said Michigan Democratic Sen. Carl Levin. ""They've taken strong steps to avoid any problem.""

Letters containing the lethal substance anthrax were sent to Vermont Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy and then-Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle exactly one week after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. Several news organizations were sent anthrax-laced mail as well. Five people were killed and 17 were injured after inhaling the substance.

That's it. Of course, each of those steps presents a different set of challenges, none more than the last one. Prompting the question: Is there anywhere that Snowden can get to without risking being blocked from flying through another country's airspace?

RELATED: The Six Tricky Steps to Edward Snowden's Extradition, Explained

Before we answer that, let's get steps one and two out of the way.

RELATED: These Pundits Have Decided Snowden Deserves to Go to Jail

Step one: Leave the terminal.

Whether or not Snowden can depart Russia depends, first and foremost, on whether or not Russia wants him to leave. The Atlantic Wire spoke with attorney David Leopold of Leopold & Associates who's been practicing immigration law for decades and who is familiar with the vagaries of international travel. The only thing blocking Assange's departure, Leopold told us, were the Russians. ""If the Russian authorities decide that's what they want to do, that's their sovereign territory and they can do it."" Last week, Russian president Vladimir Putin said, ""He came as a transit passenger, he does not need a visa or any other documents. He has the right to buy a ticket and fly wherever he wants."" And on Tuesday, the country suggested it was more than willing to let him leave, particularly if he didn't stop damaging American interests.

RELATED: Snowden Went to Booz Allen to Steal Files, but Didn't He Already Have Some?

Assuming that the CIA isn't waiting outside the terminal doors dressed as baggage attendants, Snowden's path seems clear. There's no violation of international law, Leopold pointed out, nor do Russia and the U.S. have an active extradition treaty. Snowden is probably free to go.

RELATED: Why Hasn't Anyone Else in D.C. Revealed Details on the Breadth of NSA Spying?

Story continues

Step two: Get on a plane.

We're assuming that, if he wants to go, Snowden will avail himself of air travel rather than a lengthy cruise or, say, a cab. In that case, he has two options: commercial or private flights.

RELATED: Germany and France Demand to Know Why They Were Being Spied On

The former, a flight on a commercial aircraft, is probably a non-starter. First of all, it's unlikely that a carrier, regardless of national origin, would be enthusiastic about risking the ire of the United States government by transporting Snowden around the world. Second, Leopold notes that airlines are responsible for ensuring that their passengers have valid travel documents allowing them into their destination country. After having had his U.S. passport revoked, Snowden doesn't have any such valid document. (One issued by Ecuador last week has since been revoked.)

The rule around travel documents is flexible, in a sense. ""At this level and with this kind of attention and the interest of both sides, this is a very delicate diplomatic dance,"" Leopold notes. ""The law says one thing, and the law is there — but you can't look at the law in the abstract."" Any sovereign nation that wants to could welcome Snowden with or without a travel document. But that flexibility likely doesn't extend to commercial flights. (Try going to your local US Airways counter and telling them that China is cool with your showing up without a visa. Let us know in the comments how that goes.)

Which brings us to private aircraft. When Snowden was still in Hong Kong, a WikiLeaks supporter apparently had a plane on standby at that city's airport. There's nothing preventing a private aircraft from landing at Sheremetyevo International Airport, picking up Snowden, and taking off, travel documents or no.

Step three: Fly to another country.

Last night seems to have demonstrated that flying from country to country is not as easy you might think. The private flight of President Evo Morales of Bolivia was apparently barred from flying over some European countries under the (also apparently) mistaken belief that he had Snowden on board. If Snowden boarded a private aircraft and left Moscow — and if the United States or its allies found out about it — it's nearly certain that many countries would similarly bar the flight from entering its airspace.

Which brings us to the key question: Where could Snowden go, without passing through another country's airspace?

First, we need to know how far the plane can fly. If it can't pass through any other countries' air spaces, it also can't land in those countries to refuel. Adam Twidell, founder and CEO of UK-based private charter service PrivateFly, explained to us by email how far these aircraft can go.

""A direct flight on an aircraft is also subject to the head and tailwinds involved for the routing, that would shorten the possible range,"" he noted. But: ""The longest range private jet currently on the market is the Gulfstream G550, with a direct range of 6750 nautical miles."" Other more common aircraft have shorter ranges. The Boeing Business Jet can go 6,141 nautical miles, for example.

Twidell also pointed out that, by law, private aircraft have to land with fuel on board, in case the aircraft needs to divert from its intended destination in an emergency, somewhat shrinking the range under normal conditions. But we'll set that aside for our purposes. (He also noted that commercial aircraft, bigger and carrying more fuel, routinely fly much farther. A regular flight between Newark and Singapore in an Airbus A340 covers 8,200 nautical miles.)

Which brings us to the question of where he can go. We've updated our map showing countries to which he's applied for asylum; it appears below. Black indicates a country that has rejected an asylum claim; yellow, a pending one; green, a country that has indicated some level of support.

Based on this, we narrowed the possibilities down to four: Iceland, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Cuba. Why not China? Snowden has had better opportunities to get to China, but didn't avail himself of them.

Using Google Earth's handy distance calculation tool, we looked at the distances between Snowden's current location and the airports near the capital cities of each country in an effort to figure out how far that private plane would have to fly.

Reykjavik, Iceland: 2,210 nautical miles

In each of the ensuing maps, you'll notice that we assumed the same route: north from Moscow, past the eastern edge of Finland, but outside its territorial control, along the northern edge of Norway. Russia has a lot of coastline, but for travel west, which all of these scenarios require, it's by far the fastest way.

In the case of Iceland, the next stretch of the flight is simple. Snowden's plane could simply continue on to Reykjavik, landing safely well within the plane's operational distance.

Sucre, Bolivia: No can do

Unfortunately for Snowden, Bolivia turns out not to be an option. Completely land-locked, there's no way that his plane could make it to the country without passing through another nation. Not to mention that it's by far the longest flight of all of the options.

Caracas, Venezuela: 6,017 nautical miles

This flight is a little trickier than the one to Iceland. First of all, it's much longer. Second, it requires navigating the small Caribbean islands just off the Venezuelan coast. (That red dot furthest to the west in that image represents that avoidance.) In all, though, manageable.

If Snowden's jet is a Gulfstream G550, this is in range. But not by much. He might want to ensure that there are no storms brewing over the Atlantic before setting a departure date.

Havana, Cuba: 6,068 nautical miles

Trickier still. As with the flight to Venezuela, the flight requires navigating the sovereign territory of the islands to the east of the island, part of why this flight is longer than the one to Caracas. But the big problem is that this requires Snowden traveling awfully close to the United States — almost certainly an unwelcome idea. The president has said he wouldn't scramble jets to intercept Snowden, but if his plane is only 100 miles from Florida, the temptation might be too great.

In other words, it all hinges on Iceland. It's within (safe) range. It's easy to get to. And the country has not yet rejected his overtures about seeking asylum; in fact, they likely haven't been considered. As Johannes Tomasson of Iceland's Ministry of the Interior explained in an email to The Atlantic Wire, ""a person has to be present within or at the borders of Iceland to be able to apply for asylum in Iceland.""

So there you go, Edward. Open the terminal door, get on a private plane, hug the Scandinavian coast, land in Reykjavik, and keep your fingers crossed. It's your best option.

Yet the decision also could provide a potential opening for new arms control talks.

The Obama administration on Friday cited development problems and a lack of money in announcing the cancellation of the interceptors set to be deployed in Poland and possibly Romania early next decade.

Russian officials suspected that the interceptors were a counter to their missiles and had indicated that they would not consider further nuclear arms cuts unless their concerns were resolved.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the cancellation was part of an overall restructuring of missile defense plans aimed at stopping missiles from North Korea and Iran.

He made no reference to Russia's objections to the European plans, but said that other parts of program in Europe would move forward and that the U.S. commitment to missile defense in the region ""remains ironclad.""

The restructuring includes spending $1 billion to add the 14 new interceptors to the 26 that are in underground silos in Alaska.

The shift in U.S. missile defense plans in Europe is the second major change to the program since President Barack Obama has been in the White House. It could cause unease among some U.S. allies, including Poland and Romania, who see the system as a sign of U.S. engagement in the region and a counterweight to Russia.

Missile defense has been a contentious issue since President George W. Bush sought to base long-range interceptors in Central Europe to stop Iranian missiles from reaching the U.S. Russia believed the program was aimed at countering its own missiles and undermining its nuclear deterrent.

Obama reworked the Bush administration's plan soon after taking office in 2009. He canceled an earlier interceptor planned for Poland and radar in the Czech Republic, replacing the high-speed interceptors with slower ones that could stop Iran's medium-range missiles.

Under Obama's plan, the interceptors were to be upgraded gradually over four phases, culminating early next decade with those intended to protect both Europe and the United States.

Russia initially welcomed the changes to the Bush plan, and relations between the two powers improved. That, in turn, paved the way for the New START treaty setting new limits on both countries' nuclear arsenals.

But Moscow has ramped up its criticism of Obama's revisions, which are backed by NATO, and claims the fourth and last planned upgrade of the interceptors would be able to stop its intercontinental missiles launched at the U.S. and undermine Russia's nuclear deterrent.

Whether or not it was intended to, the decision to cancel plans for the long-range interceptors will help the president's arms control goals.

A senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities, said that Poland and Romania were informed of the decision ahead of the announcement, but that Russia was not.

""Canceling Phase 4 opens the door to another round of U.S.-Russian nuclear arms reductions,"" said Tom Collina, research director at the Arms Control Association. ""We give up nothing since Phase 4 was not panning out anyway. This is a win-win for the United States. ""

The issue is particularly sensitive because Obama was overheard whispering in an open microphone last year telling then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at an international summit that he would have more flexibility on resolving their differences over the missile defense program after his re-election in November. The comment suggested that he might change the plans in Europe.

Friday's decision was criticized by Republicans in Congress who have charged that Obama has undermined allies while pursuing his goals to drastically cut nuclear weapons.

""President Obama's reverse course decision will cost the American taxpayer more money and upset our allies,"" said GOP Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, who heads the House Armed Services subcommittee that oversees U.S. missile defense programs.

Hagel said the U.S. remains committed to all the other parts of the plan, including the first three phases. He said the decision was prompted by the need to address faster-than-anticipated progress by North Korea on nuclear weapons and missiles. The changes free up the money to do so, he said.

Hagel cited North Korea's December rocket launch that put a satellite into space and showed mastery of some of the technologies needed to produce a long-range nuclear missile.

He noted that last April, the North Koreans publicly displayed a road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile, the KN-08. Navy Adm. James Winnefeld Jr., vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that missile is believed to be capable of reaching the U.S.

The missile defense system was first fielded by the Bush administration in late 2004. It has a spotty test record and has never been used in actual combat. In addition to the 26 interceptors in Alaska, the system includes four interceptors in California.

Hagel said the 14 additional interceptors should be in place in Alaska by September 2017, but not before they have been tested adequately. The European-based interceptors would not have protected the United States from North Korea.

Hagel also noted that the canceled long-range interceptors in Europe had already faced delays because of congressional budget cuts and that there were technical challenges. A slew of recent reports by congressional and defense analysts suggested the interceptors might not work."

Resignation, coming less than two years after his confirmation, could signal a coming shakeup of the national security team.

1. Chuck Hagel is anti-Israel.

In 2006, I interviewed then-Sen. Hagel for a book I was writing on U.S. policy toward the Arab-Israeli negotiations. Quotes from that interview, such as his comment that “the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here,” have been used by his detractors to argue that he is hostile toward Israel.

By congressional standards, Hagel is quite independent on Israel. He believes in a special U.S.-Israel relationship but not one in which the United States accepts Israeli actions uncritically. And he isn’t as emotionally connected to Israel as some of his former colleagues in Congress — such as Rep. John Lewis (Ga.) or Sen. Mark Kirk (Ill.) — are. But in our interview, his writings and his voting record on military aid to Israel, Hagel has been clear that Israel is a small, democratic ally in a dangerous neighborhood worthy of support.

As for Hagel’s observation about the Jewish lobby, it was an impolitic description; support for Israel rests on millions of Christians, too. But as anyone who’s lived in Washington or followed ­U.S.-Israeli politics knows, Hagel was just stating the obvious. The ­pro-Israel community and lobby have a strong voice, though hardly a veto over U.S. policy. Members of Congress also know how powerful the pro-Israel community is — they’re just not willing to admit it publicly, let alone challenge it. Hagel is one of the few who does.

2. Hagel isn’t qualified.

Was Donald Rumsfeld? Nobody had a better resume for the position: a former member of Congress and defense secretary under Gerald Ford, with management expertise from his days in the private sector. Yet, as George W. Bush’s Pentagon chief, Rumsfeld helped conceive and direct a disastrous war in Iraq that cost thousands of lives and trillions of dollars and eroded American credibility.

What matters isn’t just credentials, but a candidate’s judgment and discretion. We need a defense secretary who be tough and realistic about when, how and why America projects its military power abroad. Like Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Republican secretary of war, Henry Stimson, Hagel believes in bipartisan foreign policy; like Robert Gates, he is an analyst and a skeptic. And that’s what we need today — pragmatists and doubters, not ideologues.

Hagel has management experience: He was deputy administrator of the Veterans Administration under President Ronald Reagan and chief executive of the USO in the late 1980s. And he has foreign policy and intelligence credentials: He’s co-chairman of the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board and a member of the defense secretary’s Policy Advisory Board.

Further, Hagel — who would be the first enlisted, decorated combat veteran to run the Pentagon — personally understands the costs of war. Having been wounded in combat, he would be uniquely committed to the well-being of U.S. troops. This would give Hagel real authority to run the Pentagon and deal with the generals. As Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan, recently put it: “Hagel would run the Defense Department; it would not run him.”

3. As defense secretary, Hagel would be a dominant force in shaping U.S. foreign policy.

In this administration, nobody is, except the president. Obama is the most controlling foreign policy and national security president since Richard Nixon. He dominates, not delegates, foreign policy decisions. Hagel would manage the drawdown and extrication from Afghanistan. But Obama wouldn’t delegate much high-level policy to him.

Hagel’s 2009 comments urging the United States to engage with Hamas to moderate its behavior, his 2006 refusal to sign a letter pressing the European Union to declare Hezbollah a terrorist organization and his opposition to unilateral sanctions on Iran have concerned many. These views are out of sync with U.S. policy, but that wouldn’t matter much. Hagel wouldn’t have a say or influence in these matters.

Hagel’s doubts about using force against Iran would provide a contrarian view if and when Obama weighs whether to strike. But the big decisions will be the president’s call.

4. Hagel is an appeaser who’s reluctant to use force.

Hagel is a realist, not a crusader. And he’s certainly not a pacifist. He takes enormous pride in the U.S. military. He voted for the Iraq war in 2002 but later turned against it, and he opposed the 2007 troop surge. He clearly is wary of getting involved in military adventures abroad in which the United States might end up owning faraway places that it can’t control, let alone fix (see Syria). This isn’t being soft, it’s being smart. On Iran, Hagel hasn’t ruled out the use of force, but he believes in going to great lengths to avoid it.

As for reducing the defense budget, any new Pentagon chief will face a decision — not whether to cut, but by how much. Unlike Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who was reluctant to cut, Hagel is on record saying that the Pentagon should be pared down. But it’s a complex process with many oars in the water, not just the defense secretary’s. And sequestration notwithstanding, no one wants to or would be able to gut the military.

5. The flap over Hagel’s nomination is about his views.

Much of the opposition is based on Hagel’s persona and the positions he’s taken. But it goes deeper. It’s really about opposition to Obama.

Opposing Hagel is a way for Republicans to remind the president not to take them for granted. He can’t have his way without taking their views into account on the debt ceiling, gun control and even national security appointments — an area traditionally regarded as presidential purview. As we saw with Susan Rice, the president’s first choice for secretary of state, who took herself out of the running because of congressional pressure, Republican pushback has influenced Obama.

Attacking Hagel also is a chance for conservative Republicans to reassert their views on foreign policy, such as American exceptionalism, and to stand up for U.S. values and intervention abroad, which they think Obama has abandoned.

Finally, the hammering of Hagel on Israel partly reflects the pro-Israel community’s belief that, like his nominee, Obama is too soft on Iran and too tough on Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. When Hagel appears before the Senate, it’s Obama’s policies that will be up for debate just as much as his nominee.

Rand Paul is blasting Attorney General Eric Holder's assertion that the government could conceivably use drones against its own citizens in the U.S. as ""frightening,"" saying such an action would violate the Constitution.

Paul, R-Ky., was responding to comments by Holder released Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee approved the nomination of John Brennan, President Obama's pick to be his next CIA director.

Paul said in a statement obtained by Fox News that Holder sent him two letters regarding the constitutionality of the use of legal force, such as drones against Americans and on U.S. soil, after Paul petitioned Brennan to speak on the matter.

In the letter, Holder says the U.S. has never carried out a drone strike against one of its citizens on American soil, and calls a situation where such a strike may occur ""entirely hypothetical"" and ""unlikely to occur.""

However, Holder does not entirely rule out that such a scenario may occur in the future, and indicates that such a strike would be legal under the Constitution.

More On This...

“It is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the president to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States,"" Holder said.

Holder said ""catastrophic"" attacks such as the Sept. 11 attacks or the attack on Pearl Harbor are examples of circumstances where the president could conceivably feel such an action is necessary.

Paul says he is not satisfied with the attorney general's response.

“The U.S. Attorney General’s refusal to rule out the possibility of drone strikes on American citizens and on American soil is more than frightening, it is an affront on the constitutional due process rights of all Americans,” Paul said.

Paul says he also received a statement from Brennan, who stated that the CIA does not have authority to order such operations be carried out.

Brennan vigorously defended the use of drone strikes during his confirmation hearing. He declined to say whether he believes waterboarding, which simulates drowning, amounted to torture. But he called the practice ""reprehensible"" and said it should never be done again. Obama ordered waterboarding banned shortly after taking office.

Drone strikes are employed only as a ""last resort,"" Brennan told the committee. But he also said he had no qualms about going after U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in September 2011.

A drone strike in Yemen killed al-Awlaki and Samir Khan, both U.S. citizens. A drone strike two weeks later killed al-Awlaki's 16-year-old son, a Denver native.

Officials said agents rescued 52 of the 177 just in the last week, when temperatures soared near 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

The recent rescues by the Tucson sector of the Border Patrol reflect a larger trend. Agents from the sector have performed 372 rescues during the current fiscal year. During the same period last year, there were 265 rescues, according to federal data.

Those rescued are suspected of crossing into the United States illegally. It’s physically impossible for the average person to carry enough water to survive such punishing heat, Border Patrol agents report.

“Smugglers convince migrants that they will only walk a short distance. In reality, they are forced to walk long distances within short periods of time. Those unable to keep up are left behind to die,” stated Border Patrol Agent Brent M. Cagen.

Death rates among people trying to cross into the country illegally are at an all-time high in the southern Arizona desert despite a lull in illegal border crossings, according to data collected by the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner.

The deaths have probably increased because those who still choose to enter the country illegally are traveling for longer periods of time — mostly on foot — through more remote areas to avoid detection by border enforcement officials, according to a new report, a joint effort by the medical examiner’s office and University of Arizona’s Binational Migration Institute.

prev Image 2 of 2

A Republican senator blasted the Pentagon after it entered into a new helicopter contract with a Russian company which is supplying the Syrian regime -- even as the U.S. moves to arm the Syrian opposition.

The contract was announced Monday with Russian arms firm Rosoboronexport, for military helicopters that will go to Afghan security forces. The Pentagon argues the helicopters are the only option, but Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, is adamant that the U.S. find an alternative considering the company's ties to the Bashar Assad government in Syria.

""American taxpayers should not be indirectly subsidizing the murder of Syrian civilians,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in a statement.

Cornyn first challenged the Pentagon over a prior contract with Rosoboronexport last year, and was able to successfully pass an amendment in November barring the use of funds for contracts with the company.

But the latest contract used money from the fiscal 2012 budget, which was approved before Cornyn's amendment.

More On This...

Cornyn said Tuesday that the Obama administration also could get around that amendment by arguing the contract was in the country's national security interests.

""In other words: they want us to believe that we are promoting U.S. security by doing business with a Russian arms dealer that is helping an anti-American, terror-sponsoring dictatorship commit mass atrocities,"" he said.

The $572 million contract announced Monday would purchase 30 Mi-17 helicopters for Afghan security forces, which deals with counterterrorism and other missions. The contract also includes spare parts, test equipment and engineering support services. The contract lasts through the end of 2014.

The Pentagon has defended its arrangements with Rosoboronexport, arguing that the Mi-17 helicopters are ""uniquely suited"" for Afghanistan.

Spokeswoman Maureen Schumann said Wednesday the Russian government has notified the U.S. that Rosoboronexport is the ""sole legal exporter of Mi-17s for military use.""

""The department explored whether there were any alternatives to contracting with Rosoboronexport to meet this requirement, but none were identified,"" she told FoxNews.com.

Gen. Joseph Dunford, commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, also said Tuesday that the Mi-17 is favored in part because of its ""simplicity.""

""I can tell you, having watched them very closely here over the last several months, the Mi-17 is actually operating very well for the Afghans. It seems to be going through their operational construct and they seem to be using it very effectively, both for casualty evacuation, to move troops around the battlefield, and in fact, this week we've just equipped it with a weapons system, so it's also now capable of providing some limited fire support,"" he said.

The contract comes as U.S. forces look to hand security responsibility in Afghanistan over to the Afghans.

As for the company's work with Syria, Russia's government has claimed the company's arms cannot be used against Syria's civilian population.

""Weapons do not shoot all by themselves. It is people who shoot from them. Unlike its partners, Russia has never tried to add oil to the fire,"" a Russian official was quoted as saying last year.

But Human Rights Watch claimed last year that Rosoboronexport nevertheless appears to be Syria's main weapons supplier, questioning how the company tracks how its weapons are being used.

The Pentagon contract comes at a vital time, as the Obama administration steps up its support for the anti-Assad opposition by pledging to provide small arms to certain opposition groups. The contract potentially puts the U.S. government in the uncomfortable position of funding a company that is aiding the other side of that civil war.

Despite Russia's claims, a Pentagon official wrote a letter to Cornyn in March 2012 that acknowledged ""evidence"" that Rosoboronexport's arms ""are being used by Syrian forces against Syria's civilian population."""

USA TODAY

Allegedly pointed blame at husband before she was charged on Friday

A TV actress was arrested and charged Friday in connection with ricin-laced letters sent to President Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The arrest of Shannon Rogers Guess Richardson, 35, comes two weeks after Richardson contacted the FBI claiming that her husband, Nathan Richardson, had sent the letters last month to Obama, Bloomberg and Mark Glaze, head of a gun-control organization co-founded by Bloomberg.

Richardson, according to a federal criminal complaint, is charged with mailing a threatening communication to the the president. An arrest affidavit says Richardson mailed the letters on May 20. She made an initial court appearance in Texas Friday afternoon. If convicted, she faces up to 10 years in prison.

Nathan Richardson, a 33-year-old Army veteran, was questioned by the FBI last week. He's been married to Ms. Richardson, a former Dallas beauty queen, since 2011. She has had minor roles in cable TV series The Walking Dead and The Vampire Diaries.

Richardson contacted agents after she said she found a suspicious substance in her refrigerator and ricin-related Internet searches on the couple's computer. But investigators said she had sent the letters.

Attorney John Delk, who represents Nathan Richardson, said his client is divorcing his wife and claimed she was trying to set him up when she contacted authorities about the letters. ""There are a lot of factors I'm aware of that indicate (he) was set up in this deal by her,"" Delk said.

Delk said Nathan Richardson came to him to discuss a potential divorce a year ago and finally hired him on May 6, weeks before the ricin incident came to light. The couple is expecting their first child in October. Shannon Richardson has five children ranging in age from 4 to 19 from other relationships, Delk said.

FBI agents in hazardous material suits were seen at her home earlier this week in New Boston, Texas, a small community near the Oklahoma-Arkansas border.

Tim Giardina has been suspended and under investigation for issues related to gambling

He is the No. 2 officer at the military command in charge of all U.S. nuclear war-fighting forces

He was suspended on Sept. 3%2C but the suspension was not publicly announced

WASHINGTON (AP) — The No. 2 officer at the military command in charge of all U.S. nuclear war-fighting forces has been suspended and is under investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigation Command for issues related to gambling, officials said Saturday.

The highly unusual action against a high-ranking officer at U.S. Strategic Command was made more than three weeks ago but was not publicly announced.

Air Force Gen. Robert Kehler, who heads Strategic Command, suspended the deputy commander, Navy Vice Adm. Tim Giardina, from his duties on Sept. 3, according to the command's top spokeswoman, Navy Capt. Pamela Kunze. Giardina is still assigned to the command, but he is prohibited from performing duties related to nuclear weapons and other issues requiring a security clearance, she said.

Kehler recommended to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel that Giardina be reassigned, Kunze said. Giardina has been the deputy commander of Strategic Command since December 2011. He is a career submarine officer, and, prior to starting his assignment there, was the deputy commander and chief of staff at U.S. Pacific Fleet.

Two senior U.S. officials familiar with the investigation said it is related to gambling issues. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the probe in incomplete.

Strategic Command oversees the military's nuclear fighter units, including the Navy's nuclear-armed submarines and the Air Force's nuclear bombers and nuclear land-based missiles. It is located near Omaha, Neb.

Kunze said Strategic Command did not announce the Sept. 3 suspension because Giardina remains under investigation and action on Kehler's recommendation that Giardina be reassigned is pending. The suspension was first reported by the Omaha World-Herald.

The spokeswoman said a law enforcement agency, which she would not identify, began an investigation of Giardina on June 16. Kehler became aware of this on July 16, and the following day he asked the Naval Criminal Investigation Service to begin a probe.

The suspension is yet another blow to the military's nuclear establishment. Last spring the nuclear missile unit at Minot Air Force Base, N.D., pulled 17 launch control officers off duty after a problematic inspection and later relieved of duty the officer in charge of training and proficiency. In August, a nuclear missile unit at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Mont., failed a nuclear safety and security inspection; nine days later an officer in charge of the unit's security forces was relieved of duty."

The panel was in the midst of a discussion on the recent terrorist threat that led to the closing of more than 20 U.S. embassies and consulates around the Middle East and North Africa.

""Oh, I think it's a huge deal,"" Santorum said of the threat. ""And I think it's really a consequence of the policies of this administration. If you look at Benghazi and what happened there—we had an attack on our embassy. We've seen really nothing other than cover-ups. We haven't seen anything from this administration really go after the people who are responsible, or the network behind it.""

Scarborough disagreed on Santorum's characterization of Obama's anti-terrorism policies. ""Even the president's critics inside the C.I.A. have been surprised at his drone policy,"" Scarborough argued. Santorum went on to argue that other than Obama's drone policy, the president has not ""confronted radical Islam.""

""I'm not in the business of defending Barack Obama,"" Scarborough said. ""But if you talk to people in the intelligence community, they will tell you that Al Qaeda is busted, it's broken, it's splintered ... Al Qaeda is not any stronger today than it was when Barack Obama came into office. And most people, conservatives in the intel community, will tell you that in fact it is weaker today than it was.

Scarborough and Santorum have clashed in the past. During the 2012 Republican presidential primary race, the former candidate accused the MSNBC host of playing ""gotcha politics."""

President Obama says the U.S. will take military action against Syria, but only with Congress’s approval. (Sandi Moynihan/The Washington Post)

President Obama has put his and the nation’s credibility at stake with his call for congressional authorization to launch a military strike against Syria. But the coming debate also provides an early and important test for any Republican contemplating a campaign for the White House in 2016.

Whether serving in Congress or not, prospective GOP presidential candidates will be pressed to answer whether they agree with Obama about the need to retaliate militarily against Syria for its alleged chemical weapons attack and, if not, whether any response is required.

The answers to these and the other questions that will arise with regard to Syrian policy will begin to define areas of agreement and disagreement in a Republican Party whose foreign policy consensus has been frayed by a decade of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the emergence of new voices within the party.

As others have learned from past debates about using military force, there are potentially serious political consequences later to the words said and votes taken now. None of these politicians can know now how their actions will be judged in two or three years. Inevitably, some will then find themselves on the wrong side of public opinion, whether among GOP primary voters or the electorate at large.

Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton’s 2002 vote as a senator to authorize the invasion of Iraq, which seemed relatively safe at the time, proved enormously costly when she sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. Her support provided Obama, who had opposed the war, an opening to grass-roots liberal activists.

Grenada: Unilateral U.S. military action In October 1983, the United States led a military invasion of Grenada, a tiny Caribbean island nation, after a bloody coup ousted the government of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, who was assassinated.

The administration was also concerned about the safety of 800 American medical students studying in Grenada. AP Wait 1 second to continue.

Obama’s stuttering week, in which he surprised his own advisers and the rest of the world by putting seemingly imminent military action on hold and calling for congressional approval, has focused renewed attention on his leadership — which is why he has so much to lose if he is rebuffed.

The coming debate in Congress will provide Obama with an opportunity not just to argue for a limited strike — a “shot across the bow” of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, as he put it in an interview on PBS’s “NewsHour” last week — but also to provide greater clarity to the administration’s overall Syrian strategy.

Secretary of State John F. Kerry has been the administration’s most forceful advocate for retaliation over the alleged Aug. 21 sarin gas attack, as he demonstrated with a speech Friday and again Sunday while making the rounds of the morning talk shows, but that is a role rightly reserved for a president at moments like this. Obama’s Saturday statement in the Rose Garden presumably was a beginning, not an ending.

As Obama makes that case, how will Republicans, particularly those with presidential aspirations, respond? There are a variety of questions for them to answer. Do they support military action as retaliation for the recent attack? Do they accept the evidence of the use of chemical weapons or doubt U.S. and other intelligence findings? Do they think the limited military action under consideration would be insufficient and therefore unwise? If that is the case, what kind of military action do they favor? Do they oppose all military intervention in Syria? If so, what would an effective strategy be toward Syria?

There are other questions: Do the Republicans support the administration’s resolution as written, or would they advocate amending it? If they are critical of the administration’s general strategy on Syria, what approach would they recommend? What precedent do they think military action, or inaction, would set for future uses of chemical weapons by Assad or others?

The debate comes at a time of shifting sentiments and even role reversals. The Democratic Party was long saddled with criticism that its leaders were soft on defense. Republicans were the party of muscularity in foreign policy. Now, a president who won office in part by promising to end wars and who has been criticized for weak leadership by his political opponents is leading the call for military action, while Republicans, at least some, are hesitating.

Some Republicans may oppose the president simply because they are opposed to the president. But that does not constitute a foreign or national security policy. The Republican Party now is divided among those in the neoconservative wing who led the call for invading Iraq and who continue to argue in favor of more robust action in Syria; those in the libertarian wing who want the United States generally to stay out any conflicts; and those in the middle who see a need for U.S. leadership but are tempered by public weariness with war.

Fissures within the Republican coalition broke into public view this summer over the question of surveillance vs. civil liberties, sparked by the leaks from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) attacked Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and other libertarians for tilting too far in the direction of protecting civil liberties. Similar divisions are likely to be exposed in the coming debate between those who favor military action in Syria and those who do not.

So far, most of the prospective GOP candidates in Congress have resisted making any definitive statements about where they stand on the president’s latest move.

Paul praised the president for taking the issue to Congress, but on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday he said he thinks that “it’s a mistake to get involved in the Syrian civil war.” He added, “If Congress votes this down, we should not be involved in the Syrian war. And I think it’s at least 50-50 whether the House will vote down involvement in the Syrian war.”

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said military action “taken simply to send a message or save face” does not meet his standard of using military force only when there are “clear and attainable” national security goals. He also wrote last week that failing to act would “further embolden Assad . . . leaving the impression that the United States is feckless and weak.”

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said he was glad Obama listened to calls from Republicans and Democrats to put the issue before Congress, but he offered no signal about the substance of the case. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the party’s 2012 vice presidential nominee, has been silent, as have other prospective candidates who are not serving in Congress but are eyeing 2016 campaigns.

Prudence argues for careful statements as Congress remains in recess. But in putting his own presidency at stake by calling for a congressional debate about the use of force, Obama has put Republicans on notice that they too must declare exactly where they stand.

Story highlights To commemorate 9/11, al Qaeda's leader issued new threats Ayman al-Zawahiri called on his followers to ""land a large strike"" He named the Boston Marathon bombings as an example Drone strikes have weakened al Qaeda in Yemen

(CNN) —

Americans commemorated this week the loss of those who died at the hands of al Qaeda terrorists on September 11, 2001. Their leader chimed in a day later with new threats against the United States.

Ayman al-Zawahiri called on his followers in an audio message posted on the Internet on Thursday to “land a large strike on it, even if it takes years of patience for this.”

9/11 anniversary: ‘Our hearts still ache,’ Obama says

Al-Zawahiri has headed al Qaeda, since a U.S. military operation killed his predecessor and al Qaeda’s founder, Osama bin Laden, in May 2011 in Pakistan.

In his message, he claimed victory against the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan. He called on terrorists to continue the battle on American soil.

Al-Zawahiri named the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15 as an example of such an attack.

He encouraged his followers to provoke the United States into spending more on security, in order to “bleed America economically.”

In August the Obama administration closed 19 embassies and consulates across the Middle East and North Africa after intercepting communications between al Qaeda leaders indicating possible strikes on U.S. interests.

In a message between al-Zawahiri and a top ally in Yemen, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terror chief told the Yemeni commander to “do something,” which U.S. officials inferred to mean an attack.

In his audio message Thursday, Zawahiri also claimed victory over the United States in Yemen.

But extensive drone attacks there allegedly carried out by the United States over the past two years have whittled away at al Qaeda’s infrastructure and killed key leaders, diminishing its ability to carry out attacks."

USA TODAY

The National Security Agency is worried that Edward Snowden may have accessed files that reveal how the United States spies on China and other strategic countries, The Washington Postreported Thursday.

An internal review has found that the former NSA contractor ""was able to range across hundreds of thousands of pages of documents,"" the Post wrote, citing an unidentified former official briefed on the issue. But another intelligence official, also unidentified, told the Post that so far it did not appear that Snowden obtained data collected through hacking or other means.

The official said Snowden had ""got a lot"" but ""not even close to the lion's share"" of the NSA's intelligence trove. Nonetheless, the official described potential harm to U.S. surveillance efforts as ""a concern.""

The Post writes:

The possibility that intelligence about foreign targets might be made public has stirred anxiety about the potential to compromise the agency's overseas collection efforts. U.S. officials fear that further revelations could disclose specific intelligence-gathering methods or enable foreign governments to deduce their own vulnerabilities.

Snowden has stated publicly he does not plan to publicize technical specifics of the NSA's operations. He has archived encrypted documents with others, the Guardian newspaper has said, and U.S. officials worry they could eventually be out of his control.

The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald told the Daily Beast that ""if anything happens"" to Snowden, ""the stories will inevitably be published.""

Snowden leaked the files to the Post and the Guardian.

Separately, Greenwald and other Guardian reporters wrote that documents leaked by Snowden show that Microsoft ""collaborated closely with U.S. intelligence services to allow users' communications to be intercepted."" The company said it was legally obligated to cooperate.

With Microsoft's help, the NSA evaded encryption to intercept e-mails on Outlook and Hotmail, and Web chats and video calls on Outlook and Skype. It also gained access to SkyDrive, the company's cloud storage service.

The NSA shared the material with the FBI and CIA,the Guardian said. One agency document described the effort as a ""team sport..""

The formerly secret files illuminate the workings of the PRISM surveillance operation and reveal the extent of cooperation between big technology companies and the government during the past three years, the Guardian said.

Microsoft responded that it merely follows the law.

""We have clear principles which guide the response across our entire company to government demands for customer information for both law enforcement and national security issues,"" the company said in a statement.

USA TODAY

The National Security Agency collected evidence of online sexual activity and visits to pornographic websites as part of a proposed plan to harm the reputations of six people the agency considered ""radicalizers,"" the Huffington Post reported, citing documents released by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

The targets, all Muslims, are described in the document as examples of how ""personal vulnerabilities"" can be learned through electronic surveillance, and then exploited to undermine a target's credibility, reputation and authority, HuffPo said in its report.

Among the vulnerabilities are ""viewing sexually explicit material online"" and ""using sexually explicit persuasive language when communicating with inexperienced young girls,"" according to the NSA document, dated Oct. 3, 2012.

None of the six individuals targeted by the NSA is accused in the document of being involved in terror plots. The agency believes they all currently reside outside the United States, HuffPo reported.

However, the agency identifies one of them as a ""U.S. person,"" which means he is either a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident. A U.S. person is entitled to greater legal protections against NSA surveillance than foreigners are, HuffPo noted.

""The NSA scandal turns a dangerous corner,"" Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU Speech, Privacy & Technology Project, wrote on Twitter after reading the HuffPo report. ""I bet Washington is full of nervous people.""

The latest revelations come as the European Union reviews a commercial data-sharing agreement with the U.S. known as Safe Harbor. One EU executive threatened to freeze the pact, which covers commercial swaps between U.S. and European companies, information exchanged to limit international terrorist funding, and the supply of information on transatlantic air passengers.

HuffPo released an appendix that was attached to the document which lists the argument each surveillance target has made that the NSA says constitutes radicalism, as well the personal ""vulnerabilities"" the agency believes would leave the targets ""open to credibility challenges"" if exposed.

One target's offending argument is that ""Non-Muslims are a threat to Islam,"" and a vulnerability listed against him is ""online promiscuity.""

Another target, a foreign citizen the NSA describes as a ""respected academic,"" holds the offending view that ""offensive jihad is justified,"" and his vulnerabilities are listed as ""online promiscuity"" and ""publishes articles without checking facts.""

The Huffington Post said it withheld the names and locations of the six people and noted that the allegations made by the NSA about their online activities in the document cannot be verified."

On Wednesday, the New York Times became one of the more influential voices to say what many others have been saying: that the administration's methods are an attack on press freedom.

In a scathing editorial, the Times wrote that, ""With the decision to label a Fox News television reporter a possible 'co-conspirator' in a criminal investigation of a news leak, the Obama administration has moved beyond protecting government secrets to threatening fundamental freedoms of the press to gather news.""

The Times editorial described the Obama administration as going ""overboard"" with its investigations into leaks and threatening press freedom. The board added:

Obama administration officials often talk about the balance between protecting secrets and protecting the constitutional rights of a free press. Accusing a reporter of being a 'co-conspirator,' on top of other zealous and secretive investigations, shows a heavy tilt toward secrecy and insufficient concern about a free press.

The Times editorial was just one in a chorus of hard-hitting attacks on Obama's media policy that have surfaced in the wake of the Justice Department investigations. Journalists were outraged by the inquiries into the AP and Fox News reporter James Rosen. In particular, members of the media took issue with the Justice Department labeling Rosen a possible ""co-conspirator"" in a leak case for the crime of trying to get a source to give up information.

The New Yorker reported on Tuesday that the investigation into Rosen was even broader than previously suspected, as the DOJ seized records from at least five different numbers used by Fox News and two different White House lines.

That followed the Associated Press' revelation that the DOJ had secretly obtained months of phone records for at least seven individual journalists across 20 phone lines while searching for the government official responsible for leaking information about a CIA-thwarted terror plot.

Obama's hyper-aggressive leak policy—and his administration's potential equation of routine journalistic interaction with criminality—is nothing new. But the fury in the pages and on the websites of elite outlets about these positions certainly is.

The Times' criticism echoed that of many other journalists and press freedom groups.

On Tuesday, the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists sent an outraged letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, in which it warned that the DOJ's secret subpoenas for over 20 AP phone lines ""represent a damaging setback for press freedom in the United States."" This came on the heels of a letter signed by over 50 media outlets which made similar arguments.

Wednesday also saw Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank lash out at Obama:

The Rosen affair is as flagrant an assault on civil liberties as anything done by George W. Bush’s administration, and it uses technology to silence critics in a way Richard Nixon could only have dreamed of. To treat a reporter as a criminal for doing his job — seeking out information the government doesn’t want made public — deprives Americans of the First Amendment freedom on which all other constitutional rights are based. Guns? Privacy? Due process? Equal protection? If you can’t speak out, you can’t defend those rights, either."

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations may be President Obama’s next national security adviser.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations may be President Obama’s next national security adviser.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations may be President Obama’s next national security adviser.

Susan E. Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who lost out in a bruising bid for the job of secretary of state, may have the last laugh.

Rice has emerged as far and away the front-runner to succeed Thomas E. Donilon as President Obama’s national security adviser later this year, according to an administration official familiar with the president’s thinking. The job would place her at the nexus of foreign-policy decision making and allow her to rival the influence of Secretary of State John F. Kerry in shaping the president’s foreign policy.

The appointment would mark a dramatic twist of fortune for Rice, whose prospects to become the country’s top diplomat fizzled last year after a round of television appearances in which she provided what turned out to be a flawed account of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya.

That episode ignited a firestorm of criticism from Senate Republicans, who questioned her honesty and vowed to oppose her nomination and exposed misgivings from more liberal detractors who questioned whether her temperament, her family’s investments and her relations with African strongmen made her unfit to lead the State Department.

In plotting her political rehabilitation, Rice has kept whatever disappointment she may have felt in check, employing humor to blunt the indignity of the experience.

At the same time, her staff has sought to erect a more protective shield around her, moving to restrict access by mid-level foreign delegates suspected of leaking details about her more controversial positions and sometimes undiplomatic remarks in confidential deliberations at the United Nations.

Last month, Rice marked her reentry onto the national political stage with an appearance on Comedy Central’s “Daily Show” with Jon Stewart, a sympathetic host who denounced the “malevolence” of her Republican critics and urged her to respond with her trademark cussing. “What would you say to them?” he asked. “And feel free to talk like a sailor.”

In December, just days after she withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of state, Rice made a showing at the U.N. Correspondents Association annual ball, where she assured U.N.-based reporters and diplomats she was not disappointed to be sticking around the United Nations for a while longer. “There is no place in the world I’d rather be tonight,” she said. The punch line appeared on a screen behind her: a picture of the State Department.

Rice made light of reporting highlighting her support for controversial African leaders, including Rwandan President Paul Kagame, whose government stands accused of backing a brutal insurgency in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo: “I’m amazed by some of the work you do — absolutely incredible. Some of you have been able to uncover things about me that I didn’t even know about myself. Seriously, even I didn’t know that I once lost a human-heart-eating contest to Idi Amin.”

Rice, 48, has largely fallen below the media’s radar, but her standing within the Obama administration remains secure, according to White House officials and Democratic lawmakers. Her U.N. colleagues are betting she will ultimately serve as Obama’s national security adviser, probably sometime after the United States assumes the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council in July.

“I think that Susan always maintains close relations with the president and his national security team, and that continues to be the case,” said Ben J. Rhodes, the spokesman for the National Security Council. “If anything, the way she handled the Benghazi situation — and then the withdrawal — only enhanced her relations here, because she did so with grace and good humor.”

Democratic lawmakers said they believe the controversy over Benghazi has largely subsided. The post of national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation, giving the president wider scope to appoint whomever he wants.

“I think people have moved on with Benghazi as it relates to Susan Rice,” said Rep. Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.), the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “In the general course of events, it has not weakened her at all. I think the president has confidence in her, and she serves at the pleasure of the president.”

Several Republican lawmakers, including Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), who previously made clear their opposition to Rice as secretary of state, did not respond to requests for comment for this article. Other conservative critics suggested the stain of the Benghazi remarks — in which Rice suggested the attack appeared to have grown out of a “spontaneous” protest over an ­anti-Muslim video — endures.

“I suspect that Ambassador Rice will never recover from her performance on Benghazi,” said Danielle Pletka, vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. “Luckily she’s a young woman, and there will be future administrations. But in this one, I suspect she’s not going to go anywhere that requires confirmation.”

At the United Nations, Rice — who is set to become the longest-serving U.S. ambassador to the United Nations since Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., who served from 1953 to 1960 — has continued to plow ahead, overseeing U.S. efforts to negotiate two sanctions resolutions on North Korea.

If the battle has left scars, her colleagues say they have not shown.

“Absolutely, chin up, raring to go,” said Hardeep Singh Puri, India’s U.N. ambassador. “She’s been very circumspect. The fact that something went wrong on this Benghazi matter is neither here nor there. The fact is that she is meant for big things.”

Diplomats say Rice’s bruising experience has not made her any softer, particularly in the case of a string of recent leaks.

After the disclosure of her opposition to sanctions against Rwanda, the United States lodged a complaint with France over suspicions of leaking and informed French officials that lower-level experts would not be allowed into meetings with Rice, according to Security Council diplomats. Her office also instructed the United Nations to restrict attendance to closed-door consultations of the Security Council after a leak detailing Rice’s support for a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali.

Rice declined to be interviewed for this article. Her spokeswoman, Erin Pelton, said: “Under Ambassador Rice, the United States negotiates privately and in good faith with our Security Council colleagues. We don’t leak the contents of often sensitive meetings because we don’t want to undermine the integrity and effectiveness of the negotiations.”

One council diplomat, describing Rice’s recent scrapes with other diplomats, said she remains “combative.” Rice herself is all too aware of such characterizations.

“People have called me brusque, aggressive, abrasive,” she joked at the U.N. correspondents ball. “Of course, they don’t say that to my face, because they know I’d kick their butts.”"

(CNN) —

A shaky video captured only a few moments of William D. Swenson’s actions during a brutal, hours-long battle in Afghanistan: Kissing a badly wounded comrade on the forehead as he helped load the soldier into a helicopter.

“This may be the first time we bear witness to a small portion of the action” of a Medal of Honor recipient, President Barack Obama said Tuesday as he awarded the now-retired Army captain the nation’s highest military honor for his actions in the Ganjgal Valley in 2009.

Swenson, 34, of Seattle, is the sixth living recipient from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to earn the honor, and this is only the second time in a half-century that two men from the same battle have been awarded the medal.

Swenson, who retired from the Army in 2011, is being awarded the medal for his actions on September 8, 2009, in the Battle of the Ganjgal Valley in Afghanistan’s Kunar province. The battle claimed the lives of four American soldiers, 10 Afghan soldiers and an Afghan interpreter.

A fifth soldier, Sgt. First Class Kenneth Westbrook – the man Swenson helped load onto the helicopter – later died from his wounds.

Swenson was working with Afghan security forces in the volatile Kunar province near Pakistan’s border when he and his troops came under fire.

Obama recounted to an audience of fellow soldiers and families of the fallen how Swenson braved enemy fire again and again to recover the bodies of the dead Americans and Afghans.

“In moments like this, Americans like Will remind us of what our country can be at its best, a nation of citizens who look out for one another, who meet our obligations to one another not just when it’s easy, but also when it’s hard,” Obama said. “Maybe, especially when it’s hard.”

Part of Swenson’s rescue efforts were recorded by a rescue pilot’s helmet camera. In the heat of battle, with bullets flying and dust blocking any clear vision of the surrounding situation, Swenson is seen helping Westbrook, who had been shot in the throat, back to a helicopter.

After placing him in the helicopter, Swenson bent down to kiss his forehead before running back to the battle to retrieve other fallen Americans and Afghan fighters.

“I was just trying to keep his spirits up. I wanted him to know it was going to be OK. And I wanted him to know that he had done his job, but it was time for him to go,” Swenson told CNN recently.

The road to this honor has not been easy for Swenson, whose nomination was “lost” for a time, prompting questions from lawmakers and an eventual internal Pentagon investigation.

Swenson spoke out after the 2009 battle, criticizing his leadership for failing to provide him with adequate air support after multiple radio requests. The Army later backed up his claims, reprimanding two commanding officers.

“What happened that day was a result of clouded judgment,” Swenson told CNN’s Barbara Starr in a recent interview. “It was a result of clouded judgment on behalf of people who did later receive letters of reprimand.”

The nomination statement, once found, was nothing short of glowing for Swenson, saying the soldier “braved intense enemy fire, and willfully put his life in danger against the enemy’s main effort, multiple times in service of his fallen and wounded comrades, his unit, his country, and his endangered Afghan partners.”

Army officials confirmed to CNN that Swenson has filed paperwork to return to Army active duty.

Dakota Meyer, a Marine, was honored for his actions in the same battle in 2011.

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/bombing-suspects-immigration-status-emerges-reform-bill-talks-160951186--election.html,,[],Bombing suspects’ immigration status could stall reform,"The immigration status of the Boston bombings suspects may become a stumbling block for a new bill that seeks to legalize nearly 11 million immigrants and increase the number of legal immigrants to the United States.

Opponents of the bill—which was crafted by a bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" in the Senate—and even some supporters, say the process of reforming the country's immigration system should be stalled until all the facts about the suspects' interactions with the immigration system are known.

Both Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the two brothers accused of the Boston Marathon bombings, emigrated to the United States legally from Russia as refugees a decade ago when they were children. The Tsarnaev family, which is ethnically Chechen, was granted asylum because it feared persecution in its home country, according to media reports.

Tamerlan's application for citizenship was put on hold in 2012 by the government, because he had been questioned by the FBI at the request of the Russian government for possible ties to Chechen terrorism, the New York Times reported. Dzhokhar's citizenship application was approved, and he naturalized in 2012.

At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing over the bill on Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano defended immigration officials' handling of the Tsarnaevs, saying the process for granting asylum is rigorous.

""In the past four years we have increased both the number and the coverage of the vetting that goes on,"" Napolitano said. As things currently stand, she noted, those who seek asylum must go through multiple screening interviews and submit biometric data to be checked across government databases. If granted asylum and legal status, immigrants must go through two more interviews if they want to become citizens when they become eligible five years later.

(Asylum applicants must show that they face government-sanctioned persecution in their home country stemming from their race, religion, nationality, political views or membership in a particular social group.)

Story continues

Napolitano argued that the immigration reform bill would make the country safer because the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country would be brought ""out of the shadows"" and screened. The bill requires immigrants to pass a background check before they are eligible for temporary legal status. They must pay fines and back taxes and enroll in English classes to gain permanent legal status.

Opponents of the immigration bill have argued that the Tsarnaevs' alleged crime suggests that the current immigration system is unable to weed out potential terrorists, and that the process of crafting the bill should be slowed down to address that. If the bill is stalled until next fall, opponents hope it will be close enough to the next election that on-the-fence lawmakers will withdraw their support, effectively killing the bill. President Barack Obama has said he hopes the bill will pass this summer.

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, one of the most prominent opponents of legalizing immigrants, said at Monday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that the legalization process in the bill could present a national security threat.

""The background checks in this bill are insufficient from preventing a terrorist from getting amnesty,"" Kobach said.

Supporters of the immigration reform bill say the argument is a specious excuse to delay the legislation.

""Unless we are able to design an immigration background check that can get into the minds of people and predict the future, then we won't be able to solve problems like this through immigration screening alone,"" said Lynn Tramonte of America's Voice, a pro-immigration advocacy group.

It's also unclear how the immigration system could have known what two children seeking asylum with their family would do 10 years later.

But even some lawmakers who have indicated their support for the bill have raised concern about the Boston suspects.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has been a vocal supporter of immigration reform, wrote in a letter to Majority Leader Harry Reid that the immigration reform process should stop until all the facts are known about the intersection between the immigration system and the Tsarnaev brothers.

""Why did the current system allow two individuals to immigrate to the United States from the Chechen Republic in Russia, an area known as a hotbed of Islamic extremism, who then committed acts of terrorism? Were there any safeguards? Could this have been prevented? Does the immigration reform before us address this?"" Paul asked.

He said Congress should debate whether immigrants from ""high-risk"" nations should face more ""scrutiny"" and whether student visas for people from certain ""high-risk"" countries altogether should be discontinued.

Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., said on ABC on Sunday that he hopes lawmakers will put the immigration debate ""on hold"" because of the bombing.

Roy Beck of NumbersUSA, a group that opposes illegal immigration and wants to dramatically lower rates of legal immigration, said he thinks it's significant that Paul and Coats have called for slowing down the bill.

""The Boston bombing gives them a little more of a public reason to try to get this to slow down,"" Beck said.

If the bill is delayed until the fall, Republicans and red-state Democrats might think it is too close to election season to support it, Beck predicts."

We Finally Have An Answer,"This morning I heard something that prospectively fleshed out an important part of Secretary Kerry's presentation a few hours later. With that I think I'm officially off the fence.

This morning on NPR retired Gen. Jack Keane explained something that cause me to change my mind. It was alluded to in John Kerry's speech this morning in which Kerry stated,



We know that the regime was specifically determined to rid the Damascus suburbs of the opposition, and it was frustrated that it hadn’t succeeded in doing so.

But the details of what Kerry was saying were not included in his speech. That detail was provided this morning by Gen. Keane.

Keane said that Assad's regime has been trying to clear the rebels from this Damascus suburb for some time without success using aircraft. Then a few weeks ago the rebels received a shipment of arms from Saudi Arabia that included shoulder fired antiaircraft weapons. Using those weapons the rebels shot down two of Assad's aircraft. Since then, no aircraft have flown. Instead, Assad tried continual barrages of conventional artillery but had no luck in dislodging the rebels. That is why he decided to use chemical weapons.

I have thought that the use of chemical weapons would be suicidal for Assad and that most regimes are not suicidal. That is why I was highly skeptical that Assad had use these weapons, believing it equally likely that this was a disinformation campaign. This had the feeling of a Syrian version of the Iraq curveball exercise, where the anti-Hussein factions used every conceivable form of deceit to dupe us into invading. However, it is not suicidal to use chemical weapons when they are your only choice in defeating an enemy. That is why Saddam Hussein use them when he was losing the war against Iran and apparently that is why Assad is using them now.

As a general matter I agree that ""dead is dead."" Generally it makes no difference what the means of your demise is. But chemical weapons are different in the sense that their affects are usually indiscriminate. And in this case they are being used deliberately against civilian targets. Additionally, the method of death can be important if it is one that causes long periods of extended suffering. That is what chemical weapons do. They often don't kill but leave the victims maimed. In the case of blister agents, they also leave the victims horribly disfigured and in terrible agony.

Since Assad has apparently decided that he can use chemical weapons I am now convinced it is incumbent upon someone, anyone, and if no one else, the United States, to tell him no. You are violating international norms and you will be held to account. You must understand that he cannot adopt a strategy of using chemical weapons against his people.

I believe the president makes this decision very reluctantly. I suspect that he may see it as the moral equivalent of Rwanda. But while he makes this decision reluctantly, I'm certain he feels he has no other choice.

Additional note. I did not write about Keane's NPR interview this morning because, though thought provoking, I had never heard it before. While he often has good inside information I'm a real skeptic when it comes to his policy judgements and recommendations. But confirmation came for me in Secretary Kerry's speech. He was briefly saying what Keane had said in more detail. That put me over the edge."

Meanwhile, the distractions and the continued scrutiny of government investigators — sure to make sources skittish — have hurt his ability to do his job. That’s a shame given the importance of his work: it was Mr. Risen and his Times colleague Eric Lichtblau who disclosed the Bush administration’s eavesdropping on American citizens without warrants, and the recent revelations of National Security Agency surveillance have built on that foundation.

The chilling ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said that even though a journalist has promised confidentiality to a source, “there is no First Amendment testimonial privilege, absolute or qualified, that protects a reporter from being compelled to testify by the prosecution or the defense in criminal proceedings about criminal conduct that the reporter personally witnessed or participated in.” National security necessitates that those who illegally leak classified information be brought to justice, the court said. It added that it saw no clear legal justification for treating a reporter differently than any other citizen, and that “other than Sterling himself, Risen is the only witness who can identify Sterling as a source (or not) of the illegal leak.”

Jill Abramson, executive editor of The Times, told me she was “bitterly disappointed in the court’s decision,” calling it a blow to “the ongoing important work that journalists do in holding powerful institutions and the government accountable to the people.”

The case has real-world consequences not only for journalists but for all Americans. It is part of a troubling trend that includes unprecedented numbers of criminal investigations involving leaked information; the obtaining of reporters’ phone records; and even one government claim that a journalist “aided and abetted” a leak.

Mr. Risen says investigative reporting that includes the use of confidential sources is “the only way to keep the government accountable.”"

The breach happened because of vulnerability in an Adobe Systems Inc. software program, ColdFusion, that has since been patched, court officials said. The hack happened sometime after September but wasn't caught until February, they said.

Telephone and email messages were left for Adobe representatives seeking comment.

Mike Keeling, the courts' information technology operations and maintenance manager, said officials were alerted to the breach by a business on the East Coast that had a similar intrusion.

""They recognized our information in their breach log,"" Keeling said, which led them to install the patch provided by Adobe and start an investigation.

When court officials were first alerted to the breach, they believed all of the information accessed was public record, and didn't think confidential information was taken, but following an investigation by the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the broader breach was confirmed in April, said courts spokeswoman Wendy Ferrell.

Court officials said a law enforcement agency also investigated the case but they declined to say which one. They said the investigation was concluded and there was no information on who might be to blame.

Keeling said he didn't believe the courts were a specific target.

""The hackers were probably opportunistic,"" he said. ""They were more than likely just fishing for data.""

Ferrell said that once the breach was confirmed, it took additional time to go through the files and increase security to the website, which is why there was a lag in notifying the public. The 94 known names breached are being contacted by letter, she said. The rest of the people who are potentially affected come from a defined group:

— Those booked into a city or county jail within the state of Washington between September 2011 and December 2012 may have had their name and Social Security number accessed.

— Names and driver's license numbers may have been obtained from people who received a DUI citation in Washington state between 1989 through 2011, had a traffic case in Washington filed or resolved in a district or municipal court between 2011 and 2012, or had a superior court criminal case in Washington state that was filed against them or resolved between 2011 and 2012.

Keeling acknowledged that confidential information should have been kept in a different area, ""and now they are.""

""I can say nothing more than it was an oversight on our part,"" he said.

Keeling said officials have added a number of additional security measures, including isolating anything that could be sensitive into more protected areas, implementing code to prevent hackers from getting to other parts of a server, and new encryption rules.

Ferrell said no one from the Administrative Office of the Courts or any court in Washington state will be asking for personal information over the phone or via email related to the breach.

State officials have set up a website and hotline to answer public questions about the break: http://www.courts.wa.gov/databreach and 1-800-448-5584.

Michael Cockrill, the state's chief information officer, said security experts have determined there were no breaches at state agencies, which are on a separate network.

""Cybersecurity and cyberterrorism attacks continue to rise in number and sophistication every year, affecting the private and public sector, and countless individuals,"" Cockrill said in a written statement. ""The AOC data breach is a sobering reminder for every branch and every level of government that protection of personal and confidential data entrusted to government is a paramount responsibility.""

Cockrill said Gov. Jay Inslee has directed his office and Consolidated Technology Services in the executive branch to assist the Office of the Courts to enhance the security of its judicial data.

Washington state Court Administrator Callie Dietz said that if any of the 94 people who are contacted by the court request credit monitoring, ""we certainly will provide whatever we can do for them."""

CIA whistleblower Kiriakou gets posh send-off to prison

By David Montgomery,

John Kiriakou stood in the ninth-floor banquet hall of the Hay-Adams hotel Thursday night and took in the spectacular view of the White House and the Washington Monument. He recalled briefing two presidents during his career with the CIA. “It’s ironic,” he said, spreading his arms as if to embrace the tableau. “This really is the reason I came to Washington 30 years ago in the first place.”

But next Thursday he will check into the Federal Correctional Institution in Loretto, Pa., to begin a 30-month sentence for divulging information that prosecutors said could harm his country.

Kiriakou, 48, seemed unbowed and almost content at the prospect of prison as he basked in the well wishes of about 100 supporters, who gathered for a posh send-off at the luxury hotel. The guests wore orange jumpsuits and other mock prison garb and serenaded Kiriakou with a reworked version of the protest anthem “Have You Been to Jail for Justice?”

“I’m proud of my career,” said Kiriakou, who lives in Arlington County. “I still love the CIA — crazy as that may sound. . . . I wear my conviction as a badge of honor.”

Kiriakou, who left the CIA in 2004, stepped into the limelight a few years later to confirm and describe in detail the harsh interrogation tactics, including waterboarding, that he said agency operatives employed. He was charged with several counts related to sharing sensitive information with reporters and pleaded guilty to a single count of disclosing a covert operative’s name. He was sentenced last month.

“My case was about torture,” he said. “The CIA never forgave me for exposing the torture program and saying it was U.S. government policy.”

The $20,000 farewell bash — open bar for two hours — was underwritten by Oakland, Calif.-based activist and heiress Naomi Pitcairn and co-hosted by Code Pink, the theatrical peace group.

“I don’t think any of my Republican ancestors would have stood for torture,” said Pitcairn, whose great-grandfather co-founded Pittsburgh Plate Glass in 1883. “Civilized people do not behave that way, and so we are honoring him for his civilized behavior in a very civilized location.”

The guests included left-wing luminaries, whistleblowers and protesters — from Dennis Roberts, one of the attorneys for the Chicago Eight, to retired Air Force Col. Morris “Moe” Davis, the former chief prosecutor at Guantanamo Bay, who resigned in 2007 because, as he said at the party, “I objected to the use of evidence obtained by torture.”

Kiriakou’s wife, Heather, resigned her own position as a senior CIA analyst last year under pressure from superiors, The Washington Post reported.

The couple have five children, ranging from 16 months to 19 years old. Kiriakou said that his children are worried about his looming absence but that the older ones understand and support him. He said he expects to be released with good behavior to a halfway house in less than 20 months. He said the prison will allow him to stay in regular e-mail and phone contact with his family.

“Even though it’s prison and we’ll be separated, it’s doable,” he said. “After 15 years in the CIA” — including as a case officer in the Middle East and South Asia — “I’ve lived in worse places than Loretto.”

Before the duo Emma’s Revolution took the stage Thursday to sing its danceable political folk music, Kiriakou clapped along to the Code Pink version of “Have You Been to Jail for Justice?”

Do you know John Kiriakou?

Well, he’s a friend of mine.

Blew the whistle on the CIA

And now he’s doin’ time."

He served as station chief in Saudi Arabia and in a variety of posts, including deputy executive director, during the Bush administration.

His tenure at the agency during Bush's presidency drew criticism from liberals when Obama considered naming him CIA director after the 2008 election. Brennan denied being involved in what the government called ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" during the Bush administration, but still withdrew his name from consideration.

In a letter to Obama at the time, Brennan said he was ""a strong opponent of many of the policies of the Bush administration, such as the pre-emptive war in Iraq and coercive interrogation tactics, to include waterboarding."" Many people consider waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods to be torture.

White House officials say they don't expect Brennan to face similar trouble this time around given his four years of service in the Obama administration.

...

However, Brennan's nomination will likely put a spotlight on the administration's controversial drone program. Brennan was the first Obama administration official to publicly acknowledge the highly secretive targeted killing operations."
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/liveblog-live/liveblog/shots-fired-at-capitol/,,['Mark Berman'],Shots fired at Capitol,"Ed O’Keefe sent this report on what happened at the Capitol after shots were reported on Thursday afternoon:

It was about 2:19 p.m., just as the House was wrapping up a series of votes on short-term spending bills.

That’s when Capitol Police radios began squawking and officers were seen rushing out of the Capitol. At the basement-level House Carry-Out, three officers were seen heading toward stairs to the first floor.

Up on the first floor, some of those officers ran outside while others helped guard a door that had been locked, sealing people inside and keeping others out. Within moments another rush of officers arrived in the first-floor corridor as police radios continued broadcasting information.

The officers began banging on doors, telling staffers for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) to shelter in place and lock their doors. When reporters standing in the hallway asked what they should do, an officer froze for just a moment. “Shelter in place. Just get to your office,” the officer said.

Around the corner near the crypt of the Capitol below the Rotunda, officers dressed in business suits were seen sprinting towards the exits carrying suitcase-sized bags. Rep. Jose Serrano (D-N.Y.) stood confused at the base of a winding staircase leading up to the Rotunda. Up in the rotunda, officers were seen closing large wooden doors facing East.

The situation seemed more under control on the Senate side, where Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) were seen walking around with staffers. Schumer, as head of the Senate Rules Committee, confirmed that shots had been fired near the Capitol but said he didn’t know anything else. Klobuchar said she had been told that shots were fired near the Hart Senate Office Building and that she had already heard from her concerned daughter.

The Senate remained in session for at least 15 minutes after the first reports of trouble, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) presiding. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was speaking about the situation in Syria at the first reports came in, according to Senate transcripts. He yielded to Sen. Benjamin Cardin (D-Md.), who when told about what was happening asked that the Senate adjourn.

From windows in the storied Ohio Clock Corridor outside the Senate Chamber, two sharpshooters could be seen on the West Front of the Capitol, near the spot where presidential inaugurations are held. One of the sharpshooters was on bended knee with his weapon aimed toward the Mall."

Now, in response to broad dissatisfaction with the hidden bureaucracy directing lethal drone strikes, there is an interest in applying the model of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court — created by Congress so that surveillance had to be justified to a federal judge — to the targeted killing of suspected terrorists, or at least of American suspects.

“We’ve gone from people scoffing at this to it becoming a fit subject for polite conversation,” said Robert M. Chesney, a law professor at the University of Texas. He said court approval for adding names to a counterterrorism kill list — at least for American citizens abroad — “is no longer beyond the realm of political possibility.”

A drone court would face constitutional, political and practical obstacles, and might well prove unworkable, according to several legal scholars and terrorism experts. But with the war in Afghanistan winding down, Al Qaeda fragmenting into hard-to-read offshoots and the 2001 terrorist attacks receding into the past, they said, it is time to consider how to forge a new, trustworthy and transparent system to govern lethal counterterrorism operations."

It’s Halloween season, and Republicans' fangs are out for the president (and when aren’t they?). This time they’re biting into a new Wall Street Journal report on his lack of engagement with the NSA surveillance program. National Review’s campaign correspondent Jim Geraghty leads the charge.

USA TODAY

Goals%3A To clarify NSA%27s authority%2C improve oversight%2C tighten restrictions on information use.

Obama aims to work with Congress on Patriot Act reforms.

More NSA documents will be declassified to improve transparency%2C Obama says.

Saying the nation deserves a ""vigorous public debate guided by our Constitution,"" President Obama outlined plans Friday to improve privacy protections within National Security Agency surveillance programs and to better explain to the public how the NSA operates.

""It's not enough for me as president to have confidence in these programs,"" Obama told reporters at the White House. ""The American people need to have confidence in them as well.""

While defending the programs in general -- it's ""an important tool in our effort to disrupt terrorist plots"" -- Obama said he also understands concerns about possible abuses of privacy.

Opening a news conference with a prepared statement, Obama outlined ""specific steps that we're going to be taking very shortly to move the debate forward.""

They include:

-- New talks with Congress to revise Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which governs NSA collections of telephone data. The goal would be to clarify the legal authority of the NSA, improve oversight of its actions and tighten restrictions on the use of information obtained by the Agency, all with the aim of improving public confidence in the programs.

-- Appointment of a civil liberties and privacy advocate to argue cases and challenge the government's position before the court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The advocate position is designed to push back on government applications for warrants on telephone and/or Internet communications.

Obama said he has confidence in the special court, but there is legitimate worry that it ""only hears one side of the story."" A new ""independent voice, in appropriate cases,"" can insure that ""the government's position is challenged by an adversary,"" he said.

-- Declassification of more NSA and FISA court documents to improve transparency. The Justice Department released a report on the legal rationale for NSA operations, while the NSA itself issued a statement detailing its authorities, how it collects information and what its restrictions are. Obama described these actions as something of a down payment on future transparency efforts, with the Justice Department and Director of National Intelligence working on disclosure reforms.

-- Appointment of a new high-level group of outside experts ""to review our entire intelligence and communications technologies,"" Obama said. ""We need new thinking for a new era.""

The advisory group will release an interim report within 60 days and a full report by the end of the year, he said.

Obama said he welcomes the debate over NSA surveillance programs and that he is seeking the right balance between national security and privacy concerns.

He and aides have had a series of meetings in recent weeks with lawmakers, privacy advocates, counter-terrorism officials and other stakeholders in the NSA controversy. Many of those proposals came from those meetings.

""We have to strike the right balance between protecting our security and preserving our freedoms,"" Obama said.

The president said he has long supported review of surveillance programs, but news leaks about NSA operations by Edward Snowden and others have launched the debate ""in a very passionate, but not always fully informed way.""

Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said much of the concern ""can be attributed to the president's reluctance to sufficiently explain and defend"" the NSA programs.

""Transparency is important, but we expect the White House to insist that no reform will compromise the operational integrity of the program,"" Buck said. ""Our priority should continue to be saving American lives, not saving face.""

As Obama outlined proposed reforms to the NSA surveillance programs, the administration also re-asserted its legal defense for the most controversial operation, the bulk collection of Americans' telephone records.

In a 22-page ""administration white paper'' issued by the Justice Department Friday, the telephone collection program was described as ""important to the government'' and that its operation was ""carefully limited'' to identify potential terrorists.

Although the document re-stated that contents of telephone calls are not collected, it also described a progressive or ""hop'' analysis used to track potential terror suspects.

Under orders by the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court, analysts can obtain information about the suspect by reviewing call records of those who have been in direct contact with suspect and the numbers of those who have been in indirect contact.

Amanda Voisard/For The Washington Post

Protesters travel from Dupont Circle to the White House to show support for the leaker, who was found not guilty of aiding enemy but guilty of espionage. Army Pfc. Bradley Manning used his access to classified information to disclose more than 700,000 documents to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks.

Two days before the Army opens the court-martial of Manning, accused of giving 700,000 classified government and military files to the anti-secrecy Web site WikiLeaks, protesters at Fort Meade in Maryland called for his release.

Two days before the Army opens the court-martial of Manning, accused of giving 700,000 classified government and military files to the anti-secrecy Web site WikiLeaks, protesters at Fort Meade in Maryland called for his release.

For more than three years, Army Pfc. Bradley E. Manning has been in detention awaiting court-martial for the largest leak of classified documents in U.S. history. When his trial finally opens Monday, it will be the latest and most high-profile in a series of leak prosecutions brought by the Obama administration.

Manning, a boyish-looking 25, is accused of passing more than 700,000 government and military files to the anti-secrecy Web site WikiLeaks. The material, which was widely disseminated, included videos of airstrikes that killed civilians, sensitive diplomatic cables and military reports from Iraq and Afghanistan.

He faces 22 charges, including a military charge of aiding the enemy, which could send him to prison for life without parole. He is also charged with violating the Espionage Act, a 1917 law created to try spies and traitors, which carries severe penalties.

There was a crowd of more than thirty Manning supporters protesting at the main gates of Fort Meade in Maryland in the rain to mark the start of the trial. Protesters held signs like “free Bradley Manning” and “Does America Have a Conscience.”

In pretrial proceedings, Manning admitted leaking the material, saying he intended to “spark a domestic debate over the role of the military and our foreign policy in general.” He has offered to plead guilty to 10 lesser charges relating to the misuse of classified information, which could send him to prison for 20 years.

The prosecution’s insistence on proceeding with the two most serious charges, with their harsh penalties, has led even some critics of Manning’s actions to question whether the government is going too far.

Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program, called Manning’s leaks “reckless” and “a data dump.” But she said that “he is not an enemy of the state” and that putting him behind bars for life “is overreaching.”

Michael Ratner, president emeritus of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said he was shocked the government proceeded after the plea offer. “It is like hitting Manning with a sledgehammer,” he said. “They have him for 20 years, and then they go for life. Twenty years is enough for a pound of Manning’s flesh.”

For its part, the prosecution said Manning must be held accountable. “Pfc. Manning was a U.S. analyst who we trained and trusted to use multiple intelligence systems . . . and he used that training to defy our trust,” Army Maj. Ashden Fein, a prosecutor, said in one pretrial hearing.

Manning, he said, “knowingly engaged in a six-month-long criminal enterprise of harvesting classified information” to send to WikiLeaks, “while knowing and understanding that enemies would have access to the information.” The enemies, Fein said, include al-Qaeda.

The differences of opinion over Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst, extend to the core of the case. Since his arrest in Iraq in May 2010, he has become a polarizing figure of international stature. Supporters see him as a heroic whistleblower; critics view him as a traitor who harmed the nation and put lives at risk. He is even a figure in a new documentary film that focuses on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid questioning in Sweden about sex crimes that two women have accused him of committing.

The treatment of Manning at times over the past three years — his clothes were taken away, and he was held in isolation — has led to international protests. And the military’s decision to withhold judicial rulings from the public has led to lawsuits.

Manning’s supporters held a protest march and rally outside Maryland’s Fort Meade on Saturday. Protesters carried signs, some reading “Free Bradley” and “Bradley Manning: Jailed for exposing war crimes.”

Now, after months of pretrial hearings, motions and disputes over the use of classified information and public access to proceedings, the trial will begin in a spare courtroom behind Fort Meade’s guarded gates.

Barring a last-minute plea deal, the court-martial will be one of the biggest military trials since the cases stemming from the My Lai massacre in the Vietnam War. The process is expected to last at least 12 weeks, and the government plans to call 150 witnesses — 24 of them in partially closed sessions to prevent what the judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, called “spillage of classified information.”

Manning opted to be tried by a judge rather than a jury of military members. Lind, who has presided over the pretrial hearings, has granted Manning 112 days’ credit toward his sentence if he is convicted, to compensate for his treatment.

Analysts are divided on how tough a challenge prosecutors face to win convictions on the most serious charges. The Brennan Center’s Goitein said that under a ruling by Lind, prosecutors will have to prove only that Manning had “reason to believe” that the documents disclosed could be used to harm the United States or to aid a foreign power. They need not prove that he intended to harm the United States.

“I suspect that the government can meet this burden on at least some of the counts,” Goitein said.

But some former prosecutors said it could be difficult to prove intent to harm the United States.

“A lot of times, you think something is damaging,” said Baruch Weiss, a former federal prosecutor and an expert on the Espionage Act, “and the reality proves to be otherwise.”

Even some of Manning’s critics argue that his disclosures served the public interest in some instances. They cite his leak of a video showing an Apache helicopter assault in Baghdad that killed Iraqi civilians and two journalists, the disclosure of risk assessments for several dozen Guantanamo Bay detainees showing no record of why they were transferred to the military prison, and accounts of unreported civilian deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq.

On the other hand, they argue that some disclosures put foreign relations or even lives at risk with no obvious benefit to public debate. One example is the disclosure of the names of Afghan informants cooperating with allied forces, which put them in danger and forced steps to find and protect them.

The secrecy surrounding the court-martial, while not unusual in military cases, has frustrated observers. Lind has read lengthy rulings from the bench but not made them available. More than 30,000 pages of classified and unclassified motions have been produced in the case, but none of the unclassified material has been released.

Even documents that Manning has admitted providing to WikiLeaks, and which have been published worldwide, remain classified and cannot be mentioned in open court."

Among them: Do not remove your shoes, light jacket or belt.

“I planned my whole wardrobe around having to take off my shoes!” exclaimed Rudisill, an Oregon traveler who had been randomly selected for PreCheck.

The Transportation Security Administration program, which launched in October 2011, rewards so-called trusted travelers with relaxed procedures reminiscent of the pre-9/11 days. The agents flip the usual script: They remind passengers to keep on clothing items that they would shed at traditional security outposts and instruct them to leave laptops and compliant liquids in their carry-on bags. Travelers also walk through old-fashioned metal detectors, not the newfangled body-image scanners. Dust off the disco ball, because airport security is going retro.

“I was pleasantly surprised at how fast it was and that I didn’t have to dig through my bag for my 3-1-1 liquids,” said Nancy Strahl, an Oregon-bound traveler and first-timer in the special lane. “I have to recommend it to everyone.”

The TSA hopes that you will.

Since its introduction, more than 20 million passengers have used PreCheck nationwide, according to the TSA. At Washington Dulles, about 5,000 of the daily 25,000 passengers walk the line. The program is rapidly expanding, with more than 100 airports participating, up from 40 earlier this year, in 42 states and two territories (Puerto Rico and Guam). Nine U.S. airlines, including Southwest and JetBlue, two recent additions, are involved. (Currently, only JetBlue passengers with mobile app boarding passes are eligible; the airline plans to expand to include paper boarding passes by the start of next year.)

Earlier this year, TSA Administrator John Pistole set an end-of-2013 goal to funnel 25 percent of all travelers through speedier security arrangements, which includes PreCheck and gentler processing for those 75 and older and children 12 and younger (both populations can leave their shoes and light coats on). He hopes to goose the number to 50 percent by the close of 2014.

The program benefits both civilians and government officials. Streamlined measures can help alleviate the stress on normal lanes, unclogging bottlenecks and brightening passengers’ moods. For security purposes, preapproving travelers will hopefully help officials weed out non-threatening fliers and heap greater attention on riskier individuals.

To achieve Pistole’s goal, the agency recently announced a more direct route to PreCheckdom. Previously, passengers have qualified for the service if they’ve already enrolled in a trusted-traveler program, such as Customs and Border Protection’s Global Entry, or are active members of the military. (Men and women in the U.S. armed forces can currently take advantage of the PreCheck program at 10 airports; it will be available to them at all participating facilities starting Dec. 20.) Airlines can also opt-in their frequent fliers.

More serendipitously, TSA may grant individuals whom it deems low-risk a PreCheck stamp on their boarding pass. “If you show up clean, you can be randomly selected by TSA,” said a department spokeswoman. “The more information you give us about yourself, the more likely you will be selected.” She added that “25 percent of passengers will be selected one way or another” through the various channels.

To attract more participants, the TSA plans to set up an online application and establish two enrollment centers in the Washington area and the Indianapolis airport for fingerprinting and supplemental interviews. The cost: $85 for five years, $15 less than Global Entry. The target date: end of the year.

Denise Leschinski of Sarasota, Fla., had been through PreCheck twice in one day, first in Sarasota and now at Dulles. “I think it’s wonderful,” she said.

Would she pay for the privilege?

“Not if I can get it for free,” she joked, referring to her luck in getting randomly selected. Then she thought again. She might sign up. “We do travel a lot.”

As the program gains momentum, PreCheck converts need to remember who’s the boss (TSA) and how the boss behaves (unpredictably). The agency may, without warning, bump participants to the standard line, just as it may pull non-members into the special lane.

“We always have to have the random possibility,” a TSA representative said.

Matt Bradford of Pasadena, Calif., received the perk on his last four or five flights. “I’m not sure how I got it,” he said. “It’s been fantastic.” However, his winning streak went bust when Dulles bouncers turned him away at the cordoned area and sent him back to the commoners’ section.

The message: TSA wants you to embrace PreCheck, but don’t grow too cozy with it.

Security line race

So, can the much-ballyhooed PreCheck stand up to the test of two travelers? Ready, set, go . . . to your respective lines.

A little after 11 on a recent Tuesday morning at Dulles, Becky and Andrea split up and set off in different directions. Andrea heads for the black-and-yellow PreCheck sign; Becky descends the escalator that will take her to the normal security area. May the fastest lane win.

The queue for the regular lanes isn’t filling up the whole waiting area, but it’s not short either. Becky follows protocol, slipping off her fleece jacket and her sneakers and removing the hand sanitizer from her bag and placing all the items in a bin. She enters the full-body scanner and throws up her arms in a frozen-jumping-jack pose.

Upstairs, Andrea skates through the PreCheck line to the sound of “beep, beep, beep” as attendants scan the boarding passes of those behind her to determine whether they belong in the queue. (If rejected, a traveler can follow a parallel path that adheres to normal security procedures. Families with non-PreCheck members may also use this parallel line so that everyone can stay together.) About five people precede her, and she doesn’t have to decelerate until she reaches the lectern where the official checks her ID.

At the X-ray machine, Andrea places her carrier containing her computer on the belt (no people jam!). She walks through the metal detector in rubber boots and a black trench coat. An alarm sounds. She flashes her heavy brass bracelets at the agent, who nods and lets her through.

Total time for Becky: 13 minutes.

Total time for Andrea: four minutes.

PreCheck claims victory.

But could this be a fluke? To quash such doubts, the pair schedules a second run in the afternoon. This time, they switch positions. Becky achieves an impressive race time of 3.5 minutes and zero trays in the PreCheck line; Andrea clocks in at eight minutes and three bins. PreCheck does it again.

Jacket and shoe confusion

PreCheck reigns in speed and efficiency, but it stumbles, too, especially in the sartorial department. Take shoes, for example.

Agents inform passengers to keep their footwear on, but they don’t make distinctions, such as between sneakers, which remain silent through the metal detectors, and steel-toed boots, which can cause a ruckus.

“It’s usually pretty good, but this time I had to take them off,” said Alison Taylor of Washington, who had to remove her boots. “But the nice agent said it happens to good shoes.”

The culprit: a metal shank in the heel.

The instructions pertaining to overcoats are also open for interpretation. Travelers can wear “light” overcoats, but the adjective is somewhat vague. When asked for clarification, a high-ranking security official at Dulles said that a suit jacket is acceptable, but puffy, bulky or heavy wool coats are not. Certain hats are also allowed, such as baseball or knit caps. A man in a Stetson, however, didn’t care to test the rules, placing his topper in a bin.

Officials also remind passengers to empty their pockets of metal objects such as phones, keys and coins. Men coughed up enough items to fill a treasure chest.

“Place it in the dog bowl,” an official repeated in an endless loop.

Large belt buckles, chunky jewelry and medical devices can also agitate the metal detector. After several failures, a passenger may have to submit to a pat-down.

“I think educating the public is key to making this successful,” said Oregon-bound traveler Strahl, who doesn’t fly with her computer because of the usual hassle but added, “I would rethink that now.”

Some travelers were unfamiliar with the program until an agent rerouted them to the special area. “It’s brand-new for us,” said Mary Lou Werner of Willmar, Minn.,“but it’s wonderful.”

As awareness grows, passengers may notice more PreCheck signs popping up in terminals. Dulles is the rare facility with a stand-alone section featuring multiple lanes and bold signs overhead. At BWI Marshall and Reagan National, the special lanes are integrated into the main security areas. Small postings direct passengers to the designated lane.

“It’s inconsistent,” said a Virginia traveler who works with the military and has sampled the service around the country. “Dulles is in the lead. It’s the smoothest.”

Still in its infancy, PreCheck continues to outpace the standard lines. On a Tuesday afternoon, the wait for the regular checkpoints clocked in at 20 minutes, about twice as long as for the new kid. But as the program grows, the zippy hare lanes could turn into slow tortoise tracks. If that occurs, one traveler has already devised a backup plan.

“When more people take it this way,” he said, “we’ll go back to the other.”"

Brennan, President Obama’s nominee for director of the Central Intelligence Agency, about the secrecy of the strikes, their legal basis and the reported backlash they have produced in Pakistan and Yemen.

Adding a new element to the roiling debate, the committee’s chairwoman, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said she would review proposals to create a court to oversee targeted killings. She gave no details but said such a court would be analogous to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which oversees eavesdropping on American soil.

Mr. Brennan was noncommittal, noting that lethal operations are generally the sole responsibility of the executive branch. But he said the administration had “wrestled with” the concept of such a court and called the idea “certainly worthy of discussion.”

On the same day two other administration officials, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, and Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee that a plan they had supported to arm Syrian rebels had been rejected by the White House, the notably aggressive questioning Mr. Brennan received seemed to underscore the increased scrutiny Mr. Obama’s national security policies are facing as he begins his second term."

A prototype shipboard laser will be deployed on a converted amphibious transport and docking ship in the Persian Gulf, where Iranian fast-attack boats have harassed American warships and where the government in Tehran is building remotely piloted aircraft carrying surveillance pods and, someday potentially, rockets.

The laser will not be operational until next year, but the announcement on Monday by Adm. Jonathan W. Greenert, the chief of naval operations, seemed meant as a warning to Iran not to step up activity in the gulf in the next few months if tensions increase because of sanctions and the impasse in negotiations over the Iranian nuclear program. The Navy released video and still images of the laser weapon burning through a drone during a test firing.

The laser is designed to carry out a graduated scale of missions, from burning through a fast-attack boat or a drone to producing a nonlethal burst to “dazzle” an adversary’s sensors and render them useless without causing any other physical damage."

Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi Initial tests on those envelopes detected the deadly poison ricin; additional tests under way

(CNN) —

An arrest has been made in connection with possibly contaminated letters sent to President Barack Obama and Sen. Roger Wicker, the Department of Justice said Wednesday.

Paul Kevin Curtis was arrested by the FBI at his home in Corinth, Mississippi, the department said in a statement.

Discovered Tuesday, the letters were addressed to Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, and to Obama. The justice department release said a third letter was sent to a Mississippi justice official.

The letters to Wicker and Obama were stopped at a government mail-screening facility after initial tests indicated the presence of the deadly poison ricin.

Because initial tests can be “inconsistent,” the envelopes have been sent off for additional tests, an FBI statement said. The FBI does not expect to receive results from the tests until Thursday, federal law enforcement sources told CNN.

The letters read: “To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.”

They were signed “I am KC and I approve this message,” a source said.

Reports of suspicious packages and envelopes also came into two Senate office buildings late Wednesday morning. Capitol Police evacuated the first floor of the Hart Senate Office Building for more than an hour and questioned a man in the area who had a backpack containing sealed envelopes, but the man was not taken into custody.

“It just reminds you that with public service comes the real possibility that you could be a target,” said Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kansas. “But on the other side of it, we have an excellent police force, and I think they’ll get to the bottom of it.”

What is ricin?

Beyond Washington, suspicious letters spotted

Sadie Holland, a judge in Lee County, Mississippi, told CNN Wednesday night that she received an envelope with a suspicious substance and a letter similar to the ones sent to the offices of Obama and Wicker.

Last Wednesday, the judge received and opened a typewritten letter – postmarked from Memphis, without a return address – that included “suspicious content,” Lee County Sheriff Jim Johnson told reporters. The letter had “great consistencies and similarities” to the letters sent to Obama and Wicker, he said. Investigators were testing the contents of the letter to determine whether ricin was inside, he said.

Holland told CNN the letter originally tested negative for ricin but was being retested Wednesday. Local authorities were awaiting the test results to determine whether to file state charges, Johnson said.

“The letter was handled, the chemical was handled by several different individuals in our justice court system,” Johnson said, but added that “we do not have any reason to believe that anyone’s life is in danger.”

Investigators are trying to determine whether suspicious letters found at Senate offices elsewhere in the country came from the same source, federal law enforcement sources said.

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said one of his home-state offices received a “suspicious-looking” letter and alerted authorities. “We do not know yet if the mail presented a threat,” said Levin, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

A staffer for Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake flagged “suspicious letters” at the freshman Republican’s Phoenix office, Flake spokeswoman Genevieve Rozansky said in a statement, but “no dangerous material was detected in the letters.”

Phoenix Fire Department spokesman Jonathan Jacobs said the envelope contained some type of powder. The person who initially found the envelope is being treated at a Phoenix-area hospital for a pre-existing condition and stress from the event, and others in the immediate vicinity were examined as well.

In a statement issued Wednesday, the FBI said it has no indication of a connection between the tainted letters and Monday’s bombings at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. But the discoveries further heightened security concerns at a time when Congress is considering politically volatile legislation to toughen gun laws and reform the immigration system.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president had been briefed on the letters.

“Obviously, he understands and we all understand that there are procedures in place, as the FBI has said. There are – there is is a process in place that ensures that materials that are suspicious or substances that are found to be suspicious at remote locations are then sent for secondary and more intense testing, and that process is under way now,” Carney said.

A Texas chiropractor’s words in the spotlight

While authorities in Washington investigated the letters, the wife of a Texas chiropractor said the wording in them caught her by surprise.

The phrase used in the letters is something chiropractor John Raymond Baker once said and has been widely quoted online, his wife, Tammy Bennett Baker, told CNN.

On Wednesday, she sounded surprised when told by CNN that the wording was included in the letters under scrutiny in Washington. She said she was not aware of the letters and that the phrase refers to her husband’s general philosophy of care. She said their office phone started ringing frequently Wednesday afternoon, and it was “kind of freaking out our other employee.”

A 2006 post on a blog for Baker’s office says the comment originally was a criticism of insurance companies. Since then, the site says, it “has been a quote that has been picked up and quoted (sometimes without attribution) around the net” and “people are using it about all kinds of injustices.”

The letter sent to Wicker had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address, Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terrance Gainer wrote in an e-mail to senators and aides Tuesday. Wicker has been assigned a protective detail, according to a law enforcement source.

A laboratory in Maryland confirmed the presence of ricin on the letter addressed to Wicker after initial field tests also indicated the poison was present, according to Gainer. However, the FBI said additional testing was needed because field and preliminary tests produce inconsistent results.

“Only a full analysis performed at an accredited laboratory can determine the presence of a biological agent such as ricin,” according to the bureau.

A law enforcement source said further tests would be conducted at the Army’s biomedical research laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland.

After the arrest was announced Wednesday night, Wicker released a statement thanking “the men and women of the FBI and U.S. Capitol Police for their professionalism and decisive action in keeping our family and staff safe from harm.” His offices in Mississippi and Washington “remain open for business to all Mississippians,” Wicker said in the statement.

Mail for members of Congress and the White House has been handled at offsite postal facilities since the 2001 anthrax attacks, which targeted Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and then-Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-South Dakota.

Senate mail service shut down

Senators were told Tuesday that the mail facility would be temporarily shut down “to make sure they get everything squared away,” Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, said Tuesday afternoon.

“The bottom line is, the process we have in place worked,” she said.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, also praised the postal workers and law enforcement officers for “preventing this threat before it even reached the Capitol.”

“They proved that the proactive measures we put in place do, in fact, work,” he said.

Ricin is a highly toxic substance derived from castor beans. As little as 500 micrograms – an amount the size of the head of a pin – can kill an adult. There is no specific test for exposure and no antidote once exposed.

It can be produced easily and cheaply, and authorities in several countries have investigated links between suspect extremists and ricin. But experts say it is more effective on individuals than as a weapon of mass destruction.

Ricin was used in the 1978 assassination of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov. The author, who had defected nine years earlier, was jabbed by the tip of an umbrella while waiting for a bus in London and died four days later.

A previous ricin scare hit the Capitol in 2004, when tests identified it in a letter in a Senate mail room that served then-Majority Leader Bill Frist’s office. The discovery forced 16 employees to go through decontamination procedures, but no one reported any ill effects afterward, Frist said.

Lewis, a computer security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The hacker got into the storeroom.”

In an age when terabytes of data can be stashed inside palm-size devices, the new details about Mr. Snowden’s training and assignments underscore the challenges that the N.S.A. faces in recruiting a new generation of free-spirited computer experts with diverse political views.

Mr. Snowden, who is now marooned at an airport in Moscow waiting to see if another country will grant him asylum, has said he leaked the documents to alert the public to the sweeping nature of the American government’s surveillance. He took a job as an “infrastructure analyst” with Booz Allen Hamilton in April at an N.S.A. facility in Hawaii, he has said, to gain access to lists of computers that the agency had hacked around the world.

Mr. Snowden prepared the résumé shortly before applying for that job, while he was working in Hawaii for the N.S.A. with Dell, the computer maker, which has intelligence contracts. Little has been reported about his four years with Dell, but his résumé, as described, says that he rose from supervising computer system upgrades for the spy agency in Tokyo to working as a “cyberstrategist” and an “expert in cyber counterintelligence” at several locations in the United States.

In what may have been his last job for Dell in Hawaii, he was responsible for the security of “Windows infrastructure” in the Pacific, he wrote, according to people who have seen his résumé. He had enough access there to start making contacts with journalists in January and February about disclosing delicate information. His work for Dell may also have enabled him to see that he would have even more access at Booz Allen."

The U.S. Navy plans to deploy a laser weapon aboard a warship for the first time, Navy leaders said on Monday.

The laser will be deployed on the USS Ponce in early 2014.

""The weapon's quick-reaction capability matches what we see as potential targets"" in the Persian Gulf, a Defense Department official said.

The laser has been tested against and destroyed drones and fast-moving small boats, the official said.



A second defense official said the laser is fully capable of being used against threats even though it is its first deployment.

""The system has been tested and proven. So while it's going on the Ponce as a demonstration, it is a system that can be used in real-world scenarios.""

The first official estimated the cost at roughly $31 million.

""That could go down in the future, accounting for an actual procurement order,"" that official said.

In announcing the laser on Monday, Chief of Naval Research Rear Adm. Matthew Klunder touted the technology.

He said the ""solid-state laser is a big step forward to revolutionizing modern warfare with directed energy, just as gunpowder did in the era of knives and swords.""

He also said it's expected to ultimately save the Navy money.

""Our conservative data tells us a shot of directed energy costs under $1,"" Klunder explained. ""Compare that to the hundreds of thousands of dollars it costs to fire a missile, and you can begin to see the merits of this capability.""

The laser does not require ""unique platforms"" and could potentially be deployed on a variety of ships, one of the officials said. But another also said it does have limitations.

It needs a ""line of sight"" for targeting. ""It does not curve, and cannot go over the horizon,"" the official said.

He also noted that bad weather can affect the beam, but added that ""bad weather can be a factor in many of our current weapons systems"" as well."
http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/25/officials-says-boston-bombing-suspect-described-terror-plot-before-miranda/,2013-04-25 00:00:00,[],Officials say Boston bombing suspect described terror plot before Miranda rights,"The surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings acknowledged to the FBI his role in the attacks but did so before he was advised of his constitutional rights to keep quiet and seek a lawyer, officials said Wednesday.

It is unclear whether those statements before the Miranda rights warning would be admissible in a criminal trial and, if not, whether prosecutors even need them to win a conviction. Officials said physical evidence, including a 9 mm handgun and pieces of a remote-control device commonly used in toys, was recovered from the scene.

The suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, told authorities that his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently recruited him to be part of the attack, two U.S. officials said. The CIA, however, named Tamerlan to a terrorist database 18 months ago, officials said Wednesday, an acknowledgment that will undoubtedly prompt congressional inquiry about whether investigators took warnings from Russian intelligence officials seriously enough.

The U.S. officials who spoke to The Associated Press were close to the investigation but insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case with reporters.

Tamerlan, whom authorities have described as the driving force behind the plot, was killed in a shootout with police. Dzhokhar is recovering in a hospital from injuries sustained during a getaway attempt.

Authorities had previously said Dzhokhar exchanged gunfire with them for more than an hour Friday night before they captured him inside a boat covered by a tarp in a suburban Boston neighborhood backyard. But two U.S. officials said Wednesday that he was unarmed when captured, raising questions about the gunfire and how he was injured.

More than 4,000 mourners at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology paid tribute to a campus police officer who authorities say was gunned down by the bombing suspects.

Among the speakers in Cambridge, just outside Boston, was Vice President Joe Biden, who condemned the bombing suspects as ""two twisted, perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis.""

Investigators have said the brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist group.

Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said.

How much of those conversations will end up in court is unclear. The FBI normally tells suspects they have the right to remain silent before questioning them so all their statements can be used against them.

Under pressure from Congress, however, the Department of Justice has said investigators may wait until they have gathered intelligence about other threats before reading those rights in terrorism cases. The American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concern about that.

Regardless, investigators have found pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and were analyzing them, officials said. One official described the detonator as ""close-controlled,"" meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs.

An FBI affidavit said one of the brothers told a carjacking victim during their getaway attempt, ""Did you hear about the Boston explosion? I did that.""

Officials also recovered a 9 mm handgun believed to have been used by Tamerlan from the site of a Thursday night gunbattle that injured a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer, two U.S. officials said.

The officials told the AP that no gun was found in the boat. Boston police Commissioner Ed Davis said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat.

Asked whether the suspect had a gun in the boat, Davis said, ""I'm not going to talk about that.""

Kurt Schwartz, director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, did respond to the report.

""Within half a mile of where this person was captured, a police officer was shot. And I know who shot him."" Schwartz said. ""And there were three bombs that went off, and I know where those bombs came from. ... To me, it does not change anything. This guy was captured alive and will survive. True or not true, it doesn't change anything for me.""

Dzhokhar's public defender had no comment on the matter Wednesday. His father has called him a ""true angel,"" and an aunt has insisted he's not guilty.

The suspects' parents, Anzor Tsarnaev and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, plan to fly to the U.S. from Russia on Thursday, the father was quoted as telling the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The family has said it wants to take Tamerlan's body back to Russia.

In Russia, U.S. investigators traveled to the predominantly Muslim province of Dagestan and were in contact with the brothers' parents, hoping to gain more information.

Investigators are looking into whether Tamerlan, who spent six months in Russia's turbulent Caucasus region in 2012, was influenced by the religious extremists who have waged an insurgency against Russian forces in the area for years. The brothers have roots in Dagestan and neighboring Chechnya but had lived in the U.S. for about a decade.

At MIT, bagpipes wailed as students, faculty and staff members and throngs of law enforcement officials paid their respects to MIT police Officer Sean Collier, who was ambushed in his cruiser three days after the bombing.

The line of mourners stretched for a half-mile. They had to make their way through tight security, including metal detectors and bomb-sniffing dogs.

Boston native James Taylor sang ""The Water is Wide"" and led a sing-along of ""Shower the People.""

Biden told the Collier family that no child should die before his or her parents, but that, in time, the grief will lose some of its sting.

""The moment will come when the memory of Sean is triggered and you know it's going to be OK,"" Biden said. ""When the first instinct is to get a smile on your lips before a tear to your eye.""

The vice president also sounded a defiant note.

""The purpose of terror is to instill fear,"" he said. ""You saw none of it here in Boston. Boston, you sent a powerful message to the world.""

In another milestone in Boston's recovery, the area around the marathon finish line was reopened to the public, with fresh cement still drying on the repaired sidewalk. Delivery trucks made their way down Boylston Street under a heavy police presence, though some damaged stores were still closed.

""I don't think there's going to be a sense of normalcy for a while,"" Tom Champoux, who works nearby, said as he pointed to the boarded-up windows. ""There are scars here that will be with us for a long time."""

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/22/obama-independent-spying-review-team-is-closely-tied-to-white-house/,2013-09-22 00:00:00,[],Obama's independent spying review team is closely tied to White House,"Stung by public unease about new details of spying by the National Security Agency, President Barack Obama selected a panel of advisers he described as independent experts to scrutinize the NSA's surveillance programs to be sure they weren't violating civil liberties and to restore Americans' trust.

But with just weeks remaining before its first deadline to report back to the White House, the review panel has effectively been operating as an arm of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the NSA and all other U.S. spy efforts.

The panel's advisers work in offices on loan from the DNI. Interview requests and press statements from the review panel are carefully coordinated through the DNI's press office. James Clapper, the intelligence director, exempted the panel from U.S. rules that require federal committees to conduct their business and their meetings in ways the public can observe. Its final report, when it's issued, will be submitted for White House approval before the public can read it.

Even the panel's official name suggests it's run by Clapper's office: ""Director of National Intelligence Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies.""

Its meetings in recent weeks with technology industry and privacy groups have been closed to the public even though no classified information was discussed, according to participants. Attendees told The Associated Press they raised concerns about the NSA's spying programs. During one session, two participants said, panel members said the group might hold a separate classified meeting soon with technology executives to discuss details of secret surveillance programs.

""No one can look at this group and say it's completely independent,"" said one attendee, Sascha Meinrath, director of the Open Technology Institute and vice president at the New America Foundation. Meinrath said the closed meetings ""leave the public out of the loop.""

Obama described the panel an Aug. 9 speech as an ""independent group"" and said its members would ""consider how we can maintain the trust of the people, how we can make sure that there absolutely is no abuse in terms of how these surveillance technologies are used.""

The formal White House memorandum days later -- effectively the legal charter for the group -- does not specify anything about its role being independent of the Obama administration. It directed the panel to emphasize in its review whether U.S. spying programs protect national security, advance foreign policy and are protected against the types of leaks that led to the national debate in the first place. The final consideration in the White House memo told the panel to examine ""our need to maintain the public trust."" There was no mention of the panel investigating surveillance abuses.

The review panel, in a statement released through the DNI's press office, confirmed to the AP that Clapper had exempted it from the U.S. Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires such committees to conduct open meetings and notify the public about their activities. It said Clapper made the decision because of the ""highly classified nature of their review,"" but added: ""We are conducting this review as openly and transparently as possible."" In private meetings so far, several attendees said their discussions did not mention any classified activities and that the panel members steered them away from doing so.

Four of the five review panel members previously worked for Democratic administrations: Peter Swire, former Office of Management and Budget privacy director under President Bill Clinton; Michael Morell, Obama's former deputy CIA director; Richard Clarke, former counterterrorism coordinator under Clinton and later for President George W. Bush; and Cass Sunstein, Obama's former regulatory czar. A fifth panel member, Geoffrey Stone of the University of Chicago, leads a university committee looking to build Obama's presidential library in Chicago and was an informal adviser to Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.

Stone wrote in a July op-ed that the NSA surveillance program that collects the phone records of every American every day is constitutional.

""We would have liked a more diverse group,"" said Michelle Richardson, an ACLU legislative counsel who attended one meeting for civil liberties groups.

The review panel overlaps with a similar effort by a second advisory group. In July, Obama asked the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to report on the NSA programs and their effects on civil liberties. While PCLOB's work is expected to take months and has no deadline, Obama ordered the review group to report interim findings within 60 days and provide a final report by Dec. 15.

'PCLOB chairman David Medine said recently that his group's purview was different because it was not subject to review by the White House. PCLOB's hearings so far have been conducted in public, although the group has been given classified briefings by national security officials.

""We're proceeding regardless of other groups' timelines,"" Medine said.

A spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, Caitlin Hayden, said the review group and civil liberties board have separate mandates. She said the review panel is looking at spy programs authorized under the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the USA Patriot Act, and references to the NSA collecting phone-records and obtaining copies of Internet messages from U.S. technology companies. The civil liberties board, however, is focusing on the same surveillance programs, according to a June 2013 Congressional authorization letter.

Obama has said in recent comments that he might be open to setting up public advocates who could oppose government lawyers at secret federal surveillance court proceedings -- similar to a proposal by Swire in 2004. But the administration has otherwise backed the surveillance programs as essential for national security.

Participants in one session held for the technology industry included lawyers and other figures from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook and Apple -- firms that reportedly have worked with the NSA in surveillance operations. No phone company executives attended, participants said. Technology executives pressed for more authority to tell computer users their private data is not being abused by the government, said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.

Neither session, according to participants, gave any hint of changes under consideration.

The American embassy in Baghdad was a likely target, according to unnamed U.S. officials quoted by the newspaper. The Journal said the officials did not describe the range of potential targets indicated by the intelligence. In addition, the State Department issued a warning on Thursday telling U.S. citizens to avoid all but ""essential"" travel to Iraq. President Barack Obama has asked the U.S. Congress to back his plan for limited strikes in response to a chemical weapons attack on civilians that the United States blames on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. The Journal reported that the Iranian message was intercepted in recent days and came from the head of the Revolutionary Guards' Qods Force. The newspaper said the message went to Iranian-supported Shi'ite militia groups in Iraq. The Journal reported that the message informed Shi'ite groups to be prepared to respond with force after any U.S. military strike on Syria. ""Travel within Iraq remains dangerous given the security situation,"" according to the State Department's warning, which replaced an earlier one ""to update information on security incidents and to remind U.S. citizens of ongoing security concerns in Iraq, including kidnapping and terrorist violence.""

Katherine Russell is undergoing a federal probe by investigators

She has added a New York criminal lawyer to her defense team

Tamerlan Tsarnaev%2C 26%2C died April 19 after a shootout with police

PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island (AP) — A new criminal defense lawyer for the widow of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev says his client will continue to cooperate with investigators but says he plans to keep quiet about the details of her case publicly because that could hurt the investigation.

New York lawyer Joshua Dratel, who has represented several terrorism suspects, joined Katherine Russell's legal team last week. He joins two Rhode Island-based lawyers who typically focus on civil cases.

Russell hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing, but she is under intense scrutiny by the FBI as it investigates the deadly April 15 bombing, which killed three people and injured more than 260. Authorities say the attack was carried out by her husband and his brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

Dratel told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he joined Russell's legal team because Russell needed someone who could navigate the criminal justice system and to protect her interests. He said she had spoken with investigators and planned to keep cooperating.

""I don't see that changing in the foreseeable future,"" he said. ""There's no inconsistency between that and her interests at this point.""

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is in a prison hospital facing charges that could bring the death penalty. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died April 19 after a shootout with police.

Russell, 24, had been living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with her husband and 2-year-old daughter, but has been staying with her parents in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, since the day her husband was killed. She has reverted to using her maiden name, switching from her married name of Tsarnaeva.

Among the questions about Russell is what she knew or saw in the weeks leading up to the bombing, and in the days after it. Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have told the AP that Dzhokhar told investigators the bombs were assembled in the small apartment Russell shared with her husband. One of her Rhode Island lawyers has previously said she was working long hours and was frequently away from the apartment.

Dratel would not discuss details of Russell's life or relationship with her husband, and would not be specific when asked about her contact with federal investigators, such as when she had spoken with them. He said in his experience, investigators do not want people speaking to the media and publicizing what they are focusing on.

""It would be counterproductive for the investigation and for Katherine's interests for us to be more forthcoming at this time with any of the details,"" he said. ""We wouldn't want to impair the investigation in any way.""

The sole focus of Russell and her legal team, he said, was on the investigation.

""It's a fluid situation,"" Dratel said. ""We're not at the end of it."""

US President Harry S Truman has dismissed General Douglas MacArthur as commander of United Nations and US forces in the Far East after disagreements over foreign policy in Korea. General MacArthur will be replaced by Lieutenant-General Matthew Ridgway, appointed as head of the 8th Army in Korea by General MacArthur himself last December. At 0100 local time, Washington issued the official announcement of the general's dismissal along with several documents showing he had ignored orders to refrain from making political statements. The move has shocked the American public and angered Republican politicians who revere General MacArthur as a distinguished soldier and leader. In a broadcast to the nation tonight, the president acknowledged the general was one of America's greatest military commanders. But he added: ""The cause of world peace is more important than any individual."" The cause of world peace is more important than any individual.

President Harry S Truman

Last month, General MacArthur called for an attack on China itself unless Communist forces laid down their arms in Korea. Tonight President Truman re-affirmed his belief that extending the battle beyond Korea could lead to a third world war if the Soviet Union decided to enter the fray. ""A number of events have made it evident that General MacArthur did not agree with that policy,"" he said. ""I have therefore considered it essential to relieve General MacArthur so that there would be no doubt or confusion as to the real purpose and aim of our policy."" He also made it clear he was ready to negotiate with the North Koreans on a peace settlement as long as fighting stopped. Republican leaders in Congress and the Senate expressed their anger saying the dismissal had endangered national unity and they called for Congress to investigate foreign policy in Korea. General MacArthur's successor, Lt-General Ridgway, is a highly respected paratrooper commander who jumped with his men in World War II during the invasion of Sicily and on D-Day. He earned many awards for bravery along with the nickname ""the fighting and jumping general"". Since his arrival in Korea last year, Lt-Gen Ridgway has regrouped retreating allied forces, boosted army morale and hit back at the enemy in what he calls a ""limited offensive"" pushing the Communists back north across the 38th parallel. British troops have compared him to General Montgomery in the way he inspires his men on the battlefield. His habit of wearing a hand grenade at his shoulder is as familiar to the troops as Montgomery's beret. Your Memories?

In Context When General MacArthur returned to the US he received a hero's welcome, and told Congress, ""Old soldiers never die; they only fade away."" He had been sent to Korea to stop North Koreans under Kim Il-Sung taking over the South. He succeeded in driving back the enemy beyond the 38th parallel but UN and US troops were pushed back south when Chinese Communist forces joined the war. General Ridgway agreed to ceasefire talks in July 1951 but they broke down. In 1952, some Republicans tried but failed to nominate General MacArthur for the US presidency after which he retired from public life. It was General Dwight D Eisenhower who was elected US President that year and General Ridgway took over his job as supreme commander of the Allied forces in Europe (Nato). Fighting did not stop until 1953 with the signing of the armistice on 27 July. But a peace deal has never been reached. American troops remain stationed in the de-militarized zone on and around the 38th parallel separating North and South Korea.

Former Vice President Dick Cheney revives a dispute with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in an upcoming documentary, criticizing his former President George W. Bush administration colleague for rebuffing him on a decision that Cheney said believed have returned the nation to Iraq War-era levels of greatness.

In an interview given for the Showtime documentary, ""The World According to Dick Cheney,"" which is set to air on March 15, Cheney spoke about the administration's deliberations over how to handle reports that Syria was developing a nuclear reactor in 2007.

Cheney wanted to bomb the site. Rice opted for a diplomatic route that involved taking the issue before the United Nations. The reactor was eventually destroyed by an Israeli air strike. Here's what Cheney said of the incident in the film, via Foreign Policy.

I thought [destroying the reactor] would reassert the kind of authority and influence we had back in '03 when we took down Saddam Hussein and eliminated Iraq as a potential source of WMD. Condi was on the wrong side of all those issues so we had significant issues.

As The New York Times reported, Cheney staked out this position before in his 2011 autobiography, ""In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir,"" recalling that he was the ""lone voice"" in favor of military action.

FP reached out to Rice, who defended the eventual outcome of the internal dispute.

""The situation turned out exactly how it should have,"" she told FP.

Cheney and Rice have publicly butted heads over Bush-era disagreements in the past. A passage of Cheney's ""In My Time"" claimed that Rice had ""tearfully admitted"" to the vice president that she had been wrong to urge Bush to apologize over false allegations about Iraq's attempts to develop weapons of mass destruction.

Rice pushed back on Cheney's claims at the time.

""It certainly doesn't sound like me, now, does it?"" Rice said. ""I would never -- I don't remember coming to the vice president tearfully about anything in the entire eight years that I knew him."""

USA TODAY

Revelations about NSA surveillance have spurred bipartisan concern

White House and congressional leaders opposed the amendment

Focus is on scaling back NSA authority to collect data on phone calls

WASHINGTON – The Obama administration and National Security Agency narrowly averted an embarrassing setback Wednesday as the House defeated an attempt to block the collection of massive volumes of telephone records on domestic calls.

By a 217-205 vote, the House defeated a proposal by Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., that would have limited the collection of so-called metadata by the NSA.

The proposal was among the first significant challenges to a program that has drawn scrutiny after a former NSA contract employee leaked details of it.

While unsuccessful, Amash drew together a diverse coalition of libertarian Republicans, law-and-order conservatives and liberals, who all said they were troubled by the NSA's collection of data on people who were not under criminal investigation.

The amendment, which was attached to a defense spending bill, would have required the government to show any collection of data is related to a specific individual.

Critics of the amendment said it would deal a death blow to a critical intelligence program that has helped disrupt planned terrorist attacks.

Disclosures by Edward Snowden, the NSA contract employee, have brought fresh scrutiny to the collection of so-called metadata. The data includes phone numbers and the duration of the calls, but not the substance of the calls.

Amash said his proposal would only stop the government from sweeping up data indiscriminately but would not interfere with the pursuit of legitimate terrorism investigations.

His proposal drew immediate criticism from the Obama administration and key lawmakers. ""This blunt approach is not the product of an informed, open, or deliberative process,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement.

""It ends the program,"" said Rep. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and former paratrooper in Iraq. ""It blows it up.""

Sen. Dianne Feinstein,D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, opposed the amendment.

Will Adams, an aide to Amash, said the breadth of the opposition from political leaders is proof that the amendment would be effective in stopping the indiscriminate collection of data.

""People with a stake in the program have come out with guns blazing against it,"" he said.

Critics say the NSA programs violate privacy and go beyond what was intended by the Patriot Act, which was designed to expand the ability of the government to investigate and prosecute terrorism cases.

Gen. Keith Alexander, head of the NSA, has said the collection of data has helped disrupt dozens of terrorist plots. Investigators are not allowed to comb through the data, but can use it when they have identified a foreign suspect through other intelligence collection.

The data allows investigators to then detect networks the suspect may have been tied into, which could lead to other suspects and the uncovering of secret cells.

""The court restricts what we can do with that data,"" Alexander said in a recent speech. ""We have to show some reasonable, articulable suspicion that the phone number that we're going to look at is associated with al-Qaeda or another terrorist group."""

It is also devastating to our overall ability to thwart terrorist threats, because it discourages our allies from working and sharing intelligence with us and deters would-be sources from providing intelligence about our adversaries. Unless we can demonstrate the willingness and ability to stop this kind of leak, those critical intelligence resources may be lost to us.

At the time the article was published, there were strong bipartisan calls for the Justice Department to find the leaker. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. gave that assignment to Ronald C. Machen Jr., the United States attorney for the District of Columbia, who is known for his meticulous and dedicated work. Importantly, his assignment was to identify and prosecute the government official who leaked the sensitive information; it was not to conduct an inquiry into the news organization that published it.

His office, which has an experienced national security team, undertook a methodical and measured investigation. Did prosecutors immediately seek the reporters’ toll records? No. Did they subpoena the reporters to testify or compel them to turn over their notes? No. Rather, according to the Justice Department’s May 14 letter to The A.P., they first interviewed 550 people, presumably those who knew or might have known about the agent, and scoured the documentary record. But after eight months of intensive effort, it appears that they still could not identify the leaker.

It was only then — after pursuing “all reasonable alternative investigative steps,” as required by the department’s regulations — that investigators proposed obtaining telephone toll records (logs of calls made and received) for about 20 phone lines that the leaker might have used in conversations with A.P. journalists. They limited the request to the two months when the leak most likely occurred, and did not propose more intrusive investigative steps."

First, let’s have the debate he sparked over surveillance and privacy. Then we can decide how history should remember him.

Snowden is the 29-year-old intelligence analyst and computer geek who leaked some of the National Security Agency’s most precious secrets to journalists from The Post and the Guardian. He is now on the lam, having checked out of the Hong Kong hotel where he holed up for several weeks as he orchestrated a worldwide media splash that shows no sign of ending.

Snowden betrayed his employer, the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, and his promise not to divulge classified information. He paints what he did as an act of civil disobedience, but he has decided to seek political asylum abroad rather than surrender to authorities and accept the consequences. In published interviews, he comes across as grandiose to the point of self-parody, a legend in his own mind.

He is an imperfect messenger, to say the least. But his message should not be ignored.

Did you know that the NSA is compiling and storing a massive, comprehensive log of our domestic phone calls? I didn’t. Nor did I know that the agency can access huge volumes of e-mail traffic and other electronic data overseas — not just communications originating in trouble spots such as Pakistan but also in countries such as Germany and Britain. I would have thought that anyone who accused the U.S. government of “omniscient, automatic, mass surveillance,” as Snowden did in an exchange with Post contributor Barton Gellman, was being paranoid. Now I’m not so sure.

Ann Telnaes animation: The NSA’s data gathering technique (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

As President Obama noted, nobody is eavesdropping on the phone calls of U.S. citizens and residents. I’m not certain this could be said about e-mail communications in other countries, some of which take privacy as seriously as we do. British Foreign Secretary William Hague felt obliged Monday to reassure Parliament that “our intelligence-sharing work with the United States is subject to Ministerial and independent oversight” and to legislative scrutiny.

But we have oversight of intelligence operations in this country, too. The problem is that the system works more or less like a rubber stamp.

The secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has to issue the orders that allow the NSA to collect “metadata” from telephone providers. But as far as I can tell — we are not allowed to know the content of the court’s rulings and have to make do with crumbs of, well, metadata — the court’s standard answer is yes.

In its 34 years of existence, the court has approved more than 30,000 government requests for surveillance authority while rejecting a grand total of 11. That is not what I’d call oversight.

The NSA’s snooping is also subject to scrutiny by the intelligence committees of the Senate and the House. The chairmen of those panels — Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) — have been among the NSA’s most vocal supporters in recent days. But since so much of the committees’ work is classified, they say they can’t tell us why.

And as for Obama, he said last week that “I welcome this debate and I think it’s healthy for our democracy.” Why, then, didn’t he launch the discussion rather than wait for Snowden’s leaks?

In the coming debate, someone should explain why a mid-level computer guy working for a private contractor had access to so many of the NSA’s most closely held secrets. Someone should explain why the intelligence court is evidently so compliant. Someone should explain — perhaps in French, German and Spanish — why our allies’ e-mails are fair game for the agency’s prying eyes.

It’s another thing altogether if the agency observes, say, patterns that suggest the birth of the next tea party or Occupy Wall Street movement.

Is that paranoia? Then reassure me. Let’s talk about the big picture and decide, as citizens, whether we are comfortable with the direction our intelligence agencies are heading. And let’s remember that it was Snowden, not our elected officials, who opened this vital conversation.

(CNN) —

We already knew that opponents of immigration reform had no good arguments in favor of preserving the status quo. Now we know they have no shame.

Some of them are deliberately mixing apples and oranges and trying to use the tragedy of the Boston Marathon bombing to scuttle efforts in Washington to achieve immigration reform.

All last week, my friends in the immigration reform community held their collective breath and hoped that – when investigators finally zeroed in on a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing – that person would NOT turn out to be foreign-born. Immigrants are blamed for enough in society; they need not be blamed for this tragedy.

Courtesy San Diego Union Tribune Ruben Navarrette Jr.

Besides, from the perspective of the reformers, the timing couldn’t be worse.

A few days after the bombing, the Senate’s “gang of eight” unveiled what is the most significant piece of immigration reform legislation in more than a quarter century. The Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 is an expertly crafted, bipartisan compromise that has a real shot at improving the lives of millions of people and fixing a broken system.

Yet, because of unrelated events, the legislation could wind up hanging by a thread. Why? Because the prime suspects in the Boston bombing are immigrants: 19-year-old Dzhokhar “Jahar” Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

The brothers are from the Russian Caucasus region and moved to Kazakhstan at a young age before coming to the United States. Tamerlan was killed Thursday night in a shootout with police. Dzhokhar escaped and was at large Friday until he was found in Watertown, Massachusetts, and apprehended by police.

According to what two sources told CNN, Tamerlan had been living in the United States legally on a green card. Dzhokhar first came to the United States as a tourist in the early 2000’s and later asked for asylum. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen just last year, on September 11, 2012.

There’s that infamous date again.

It’s worth noting that Americans started the long and difficult journey toward immigration reform on September 5, 2001, when President George W. Bush welcomed Mexican President Vicente Fox to the White House for a state dinner in his honor.

Earlier in the day, both leaders told reporters that they wanted to fix the immigration system and match willing employers in the United States with willing workers in Mexico. The reform was supposed to include a pathway to legal status for millions of illegal immigrants in the United States.

Six days later, our country was attacked and the world changed. Immediately, immigration reform was put so far onto the back burner that it eventually fell clear off the stove.

Most supporters of immigration reform, including many Latinos, believe that this was immensely unfair. The 19 hijackers were from the Middle East, and they came to the United States legally, many on student visas. So why would their evil acts have the effect of torpedoing the prospect of immigration reform that primarily affects millions of illegal immigrants from Latin America?

Now, here we are again. Earlier this week, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa – a vocal foe of immigration reform who has suggested the answer to securing the border is electrified fencing because, as he once said on the House floor, “we do this with livestock all the time” – suggested that the congressional debate on the immigration bill should go slow because the suspects in the Boston bombing might turn out to be foreign nationals.

That is just what happened. Was that a lucky guess? Or is that how this guy’s mind works – that every time something bad happens, an immigrant must be to blame?

On Friday, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa jumped into the fray during a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.

“Given the events of this week, it’s important for us to understand the gaps and loopholes in our immigration system,” he said. “How can we beef up security checks on people who wish to enter the United States? How do we ensure that people who wish to do us harm are not eligible for benefits under the immigration laws, including this new bill?”

Also piling on was conservative columnist Ann Coulter, who has made clear over the last few months that she opposes immigration reform because she thinks it would lead to the “end of America” since Latinos are busy “having illegitimate children and going on welfare.” She marked the shootout in Boston, and took a poke at the Florida senator who is leading immigration reform efforts, by mischievously tweeting:

“It’s too bad Suspect No. 1 won’t be able to be legalized by Marco Rubio, now.”

Again, the Tsarnaev brothers were immigrants, but they didn’t need to be “legalized.” They were already in the country legally. But, hey, why let facts in the way of a good screed?

In response, a spokesman for Rubio said in an e-mail to the Christian Science Monitor: “There are legitimate policy questions to ask and answer about what role our immigration system played, if any, in what happened. Regardless of the circumstances in Boston, immigration reform that strengthens our borders and gives us a better accounting of who is in our country and why will improve our national security. Americans will reject any attempt to tie the terrorists responsible for the attacks in Boston with the millions of decent, law-abiding immigrants currently living in the U.S. and those hoping to immigrate here in the future.”

Let’s hope that’s right, and that most Americans do see these tactics for what they are: desperate attempts to thwart reform.

Here is the predicament that the nativists and right-wing demagogues find themselves in, whether they realize it or not. They want to opportunistically use the fact that bombing suspects were foreign nationals to once again derail immigration reform. But, in doing so, they walk away from the table and wind up defending the current immigration system.

The Rubio spokesman had it right. We have to know who is in this country, and what their intentions are – whether they came legally or illegally. This is one of the things that immigration reform is about.

No reform plan is perfect, but the status quo is flatly not acceptable. We have to keep the debate going.

Venezuelan President Maduro said he offered humanitarian asylum

Maduro says he made the offer so Snowden can escape %27persecution from the empire%27

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said he would make the same offer %27if circumstances allow it%27

CARACAS, Venezuela — Presidents Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela said Friday they were willing to grant asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden.

Snowden has asked for asylum in several countries, including Nicaragua and Venezuela.

""We have decided to offer humanitarian asylum to the American Edward Snowden to protect him from the persecution being unleashed by the world's most powerful empire,'' Maduro said at the start of a military parade in the Venezuelan capital celebrating the 202nd anniversary of the South American country's declaration of independence.

Maduro said Snowden's only crime was to tell the truth.

Maduro said Snowden, who is wanted by the U.S. for leaking information about a number of secret U.S. espionage plans, could live in peace in the free country of (founding father Simon) Bolivar and (the late president Hugo) Chavez.''

In Nicaragua, Ortega said he was willing to make the same offer ""if circumstances allow it."" Ortega didn't say what the right circumstances would be when he spoke during a speech in Managua.

He said the Nicaraguan embassy in Moscow received Snowden's application for asylum and that it is studying the request.

""We have the sovereign right to help a person who felt remorse after finding out how the United States was using technology to spy on the whole world, and especially its European allies,"" Ortega said.

Maduro has repeatedly said that the fugitive leakster was being unfairly attacked by the U.S. government. Venezuela under Maduro and Chavez has been one of South America's most strident critics of U.S. policy.

Although the U.S. is the largest supplier of goods to Venezuela and the South American country's largest buyer of its crude, neither country has an ambassador in the other.

The offers came amid the ongoing flap about the rerouting of Bolivian President Evo Morales' plane in Europe earlier this week amid reports that Snowden might have been aboard.

Spain on Friday said it had been warned along with other European countries that Snowden, a former U.S. intelligence worker, was aboard the Bolivian presidential plane, an acknowledgement that the manhunt for the fugitive leaker had something to do with the plane's unexpected diversion to Austria.

It is unclear whether the United States, which has told its European allies that it wants Snowden back, warned Madrid about the Bolivian president's plane. U.S. officials will not detail their conversations with European countries, except to say that they have stated the U.S.'s general position that it wants Snowden back.

President Barack Obama has publicly displayed a relaxed attitude toward Snowden's movements, saying last month that he wouldn't be ""scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker.""

But the drama surrounding the flight of Bolivian President Evo Morales, whose plane was abruptly rerouted to Vienna after apparently being denied permission to fly over France, suggests that pressure is being applied behind the scenes.

Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told Spanish National Television that ""they told us that the information was clear, that he was inside.""

He did not identify who ""they"" were and declined to say whether he had been in contact with the U.S. But he said that European countries' decisions were based on the tip. France has since sent a letter of apology to the Bolivian government.

Meanwhile, secret-spilling website WikiLeaks said that Snowden, who is still believed to be stuck in a Moscow airport's transit area, had put in asylum applications to six new countries.

The organization said in a message posted to Twitter on Friday that it wouldn't be identifying the countries involved ""due to attempted U.S. interference.""

A number of countries have already rejected asylum applications from Snowden."

Recent leaks of classified documents have pointed to the role of a special court in enabling the government’s secret surveillance programs, but members of the court are chafing at the suggestion that they were collaborating with the executive branch.

A classified 2009 draft report by the National Security Agency’s inspector general relayed some details about the interaction between the court’s judges and the NSA, which sought approval for the Bush administration’s top-secret domestic surveillance programs. The report was described in The Washington Post on June 16 and released in full Thursday by The Post and the British newspaper the Guardian.

U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, the former chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, took the highly unusual step Friday of voicing open frustration at the account in the report and court’s inability to explain its decisions.

“In my view, that draft report contains major omissions, and some inaccuracies, regarding the actions I took as Presiding Judge of the FISC and my interactions with Executive Branch officials,” Kollar-Kotelly said in a statement to The Post. It was her first public comment describing her work on the intelligence court.

The inspector general’s draft report is among the many documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, touching off a roiling national debate about the proper balance between the government’s reach into Americans’ lives and the effort to protect the nation in the Internet age.

The document portrays the surveillance court as “amenable” to the government’s legal theory to “re-create” authority for the Internet metadata program that had initially been authorized by President George W. Bush without court or congressional approval. The program was shut down in March 2004 when acting Attorney General James B. Comey and senior leaders at the Justice Department threatened to resign over what they felt was an illegal program.

Kollar-Kotelly disputed the NSA report’s suggestion of a fairly high level of coordination between the court and the NSA and Justice in 2004 to re-create certain authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the 1978 law that created the court in response to abuses of domestic surveillance in the 1960s and 1970s.

“That is incorrect,” she said. “I participated in a process of adjudication, not ‘coordination’ with the executive branch. The discussions I had with executive branch officials were in most respects typical of how I and other district court judges entertain applications for criminal wiretaps under Title III, where issues are discussed ex parte.”

The perception that the court works too closely with the government arises in large part from the tribunal’s “ex parte” nature, which means that unlike in a traditional court, there is no legal sparring between adversaries with the judge as arbiter. Instead, a Justice Department official makes the case for the government agency seeking permission to carry out surveillance inside the United States. No one speaks for the target of the surveillance or the company that is ordered to allow its networks to be tapped or to turn over its customers’ data.

Some critics say the court is a rubber stamp for government investigators because it almost never has turned down a warrant application. However, that high batting average doesn’t take into account changes the court requires in some requests and other applications that the government withdraws.

For about 30 years, the court was located on the sixth floor of the Justice Department’s headquarters, down the hall from the officials who would argue in front of it. (The court moved to the District’s federal courthouse in 2009.) “There is a collaborative process that would be unnatural in the public, criminal court setting,” said a former Justice official familiar with the court.

Kollar-Kotelly, who was the court’s chief judge from 2002 to 2006, said she could not comment further on the matter because “the underlying subjects” in the report generally remain classified by the executive branch.

Other judges on the court have confided to colleagues their frustration at the court’s portrayal, according to people familiar with their discussion.

The inspector general’s report, combined with persistent refusals by the government to declassify the opinions, have left the public in the dark about the court’s legal justifications for approving the broad surveillance programs.

“The court is a neutral party, not a collaborator or arm of the government,” said one government official close to the court. “But the information out there now leaves people wondering how and why the court endorsed these programs.”

The court historically has authorized in secret hearings classified warrants to wiretap the calls and monitor the movements of suspected criminals. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, far-reaching programs to gather Internet and telephone content and metadata were launched under presidential authority, without congressional action or approval from the surveillance court.

The Internet metadata portion of that program had to be revamped after Comey and other Justice officials threatened to resign. Metadata are information indicating facts such as an e-mail’s sender and recipient and its time and date, but not its content.

In May 2004, the NSA briefed Kollar-Kotelly on the technical aspects of that program’s collection, according to the report. She also met with the NSA director, Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden, on two successive Saturdays during the summer of 2004 to discuss the issue, the report said.

“It was very professional,” Hayden said in an interview. “We of course had to explain to her what it was we had been doing, what it was we wanted to do, how we would do it, what kind of safeguards we felt able to put in. We left it to her judgment whether there was proportionality in terms of was this worth doing, in the balance between security and liberty.”

He said in response to her concerns, the agency made some technical adjustments so that “the odds were greater that you’d pick up fewer protected communications of U.S. persons.”

Said Hayden: “She wasn’t in league with us. We were down there presenting what we thought was appropriate.”

On July 14, 2004, the surveillance court for the first time approved the gathering of information by the NSA, which created the equivalent of a digital vault to hold Internet metadata. Kollar-Kotelly’s order authorized the metadata program under a FISA provision known as the “pen register/trap and trace,” or PRTT.

The ruling was a secret not just to the public and most of Congress, but to all of Kollar-Kotelly’s surveillance court colleagues. Under orders from the president, none of the court’s other 10 members could be told about the Internet metadata program, which was one prong of a larger and highly classified data-gathering effort known as the President’s Surveillance Program, or PSP.

But the importance of her order — which approved the collection based on a 1986 law typically used for phone records — was hard to overstate.

“The order essentially gave NSA the same authority to collect bulk Internet metadata that it had under the PSP,” the inspector general’s report said, with some minor caveats including reducing the number of people who could access the records.

On May 24, 2006, Kollar-Kotelly signed another order, this one authorizing the bulk collection of phone metadata from U.S. phone companies, under a FISA provision known as Section 215, or the ”business records provision,” of the USA Patriot Act.

As with the PRTT order, the Justice Department and NSA “collaboratively designed the application, prepared declarations and responded to questions from court advisers,” the inspector general’s report said. “Their previous experience in drafting the PRTT order made this process more efficient.”

The court also agreed in 2007 to permit the government to collect the content of e-mails and phone calls to and from the United States when “there is probable cause to believe” that one of the parties is a member of al-Qaeda or an associated terrorist group. That program, known today as PRISM and described in documents obtained by The Washington Post, eventually was authorized by Congress.

Kollar-Kotelly could be a stern taskmaster when she thought the NSA was overstepping its bounds. In 2004, she temporarily shut down the government’s surveillance program when she learned of a key NSA failure, The Post reported in 2006. The agency was not properly walling off information gained in warrantless surveillance and may have been using the information to obtain court warrants, which was forbidden. In 2005, the problem resurfaced and she issued a strong warning to the government that it had to fix the problem or would face trouble obtaining court warrants.

Kollar-Kotelly “understood the problems that the government, particularly the Defense Department and the intelligence community, were facing in trying to keep this country safe,” said Robert L. Deitz, former NSA general counsel under Hayden.

But, he said, the court was no rubber stamp. “The judges ask searching questions,” he said. “If they don’t get the right answer, they don’t stamp things ‘reject.’ They say, ‘I’m not signing this.’ Then we go back and say, ‘Okay, we’ve got to do this the following way.’ ”

Still secret are the 2004 decision accompanying the PRTT court order and the legal opinion accompanying the 2006 business records order.

A former senior Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the subject’s sensitivity, said he believes the government should consider releasing declassified summaries of relevant opinions.

“I think it would help” quell the “furor” raised by the recent disclosures, he said. “In this current environment, you may have to lean forward a little more in declassifying stuff than you otherwise would. You might be able to prepare reasonable summaries that would be helpful to the American people.”

Lawmakers and civil-liberties advocates have been pushing the Obama administration for several years to declassify these opinions and other opinions from Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel that explain the legal justification for these programs.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has led an effort to review these opinions to see what, if anything, can be declassified. But Robert S. Litt, ODNI general counsel, has argued that declassification can be difficult when so much of the legal reasoning is intertwined with facts that need to remain secret lest they tip off enemies about surveillance methods.

Still, the former official explained, segregating relevant facts from classified material is routinely done in criminal proceedings under the Classified Information Procedures Act. In those cases, the government can extract the information that is relevant to the defense, the judge approves it, and it is provided to the defense.

“This is not unheard-of in the unclassified world, and some kind of summary document can be generated,” the former official said. “Maybe that’s a middle ground that can be done.”

The executives — including top executives from Apple, Twitter, Netflix, Google, Facebook and Yahoo — met with Obama in the Roosevelt Room of the White House.

""We appreciated the opportunity to share directly with the President our principles on government surveillance that we released last week and we urge him to move aggressively on reform,” they said in a brief group statement.

Notably, that release did not include much of what the White House had said would be on the agenda — including efforts to get the federal Obamacare website working smoothly, federal information-technology improvements, boosting the economy and fighting income inequality.

Instead, they zeroed in on their biggest source of frustration with the White House: the unprecedented electronic spying on Americans and people overseas who are not suspected of criminal or terrorist acts or connections.

The White House, which is in the middle of reviewing the National Security Agency’s policies and has vowed to make some changes to American surveillance, said it would take the CEOs’ concerns into account.

But the White House summary of the meeting, unlike the version from the CEOs, insists that the group “discussed a number of issues of shared importance to the federal government and the tech sector, including the progress being made to improve performance and capacity issues with HeathCare.Gov.”

Obama also announced that former Microsoft executive Kurt DelBene will take over from Jeff Zients as the top troubleshooter for the botched federal health insurance website.

And “the group discussed the challenges (surrounding) federal IT procurement,” according to the White House.

Here is how Obama’s press office summarized the NSA component of the meeting — the only part the CEOs described in their summary:

“Finally, the group discussed the national security and economic impacts of unauthorized intelligence disclosures. This was an opportunity for the President to hear from CEOs directly as we near completion of our review of signals intelligence programs, building on the feedback we’ve received from the private sector in recent weeks and months. The President made clear his belief in an open, free, and innovative internet and listened to the group’s concerns and recommendations, and made clear that we will consider their input as well as the input of other outside stakeholders as we finalize our review of signals intelligence programs.”"

USA TODAY

Goals%3A To clarify NSA%27s authority%2C improve oversight%2C tighten restrictions on information use.

Obama aims to work with Congress on Patriot Act reforms.

More NSA documents will be declassified to improve transparency%2C Obama says.

Saying the nation deserves a ""vigorous public debate guided by our Constitution,"" President Obama outlined plans Friday to improve privacy protections within National Security Agency surveillance programs and to better explain to the public how the NSA operates.

""It's not enough for me as president to have confidence in these programs,"" Obama told reporters at the White House. ""The American people need to have confidence in them as well.""

While defending the programs in general -- it's ""an important tool in our effort to disrupt terrorist plots"" -- Obama said he also understands concerns about possible abuses of privacy.

Opening a news conference with a prepared statement, Obama outlined ""specific steps that we're going to be taking very shortly to move the debate forward.""

They include:

-- New talks with Congress to revise Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which governs NSA collections of telephone data. The goal would be to clarify the legal authority of the NSA, improve oversight of its actions and tighten restrictions on the use of information obtained by the Agency, all with the aim of improving public confidence in the programs.

-- Appointment of a civil liberties and privacy advocate to argue cases and challenge the government's position before the court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The advocate position is designed to push back on government applications for warrants on telephone and/or Internet communications.

Obama said he has confidence in the special court, but there is legitimate worry that it ""only hears one side of the story."" A new ""independent voice, in appropriate cases,"" can insure that ""the government's position is challenged by an adversary,"" he said.

-- Declassification of more NSA and FISA court documents to improve transparency. The Justice Department released a report on the legal rationale for NSA operations, while the NSA itself issued a statement detailing its authorities, how it collects information and what its restrictions are. Obama described these actions as something of a down payment on future transparency efforts, with the Justice Department and Director of National Intelligence working on disclosure reforms.

-- Appointment of a new high-level group of outside experts ""to review our entire intelligence and communications technologies,"" Obama said. ""We need new thinking for a new era.""

The advisory group will release an interim report within 60 days and a full report by the end of the year, he said.

Obama said he welcomes the debate over NSA surveillance programs and that he is seeking the right balance between national security and privacy concerns.

He and aides have had a series of meetings in recent weeks with lawmakers, privacy advocates, counter-terrorism officials and other stakeholders in the NSA controversy. Many of those proposals came from those meetings.

""We have to strike the right balance between protecting our security and preserving our freedoms,"" Obama said.

The president said he has long supported review of surveillance programs, but news leaks about NSA operations by Edward Snowden and others have launched the debate ""in a very passionate, but not always fully informed way.""

Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said much of the concern ""can be attributed to the president's reluctance to sufficiently explain and defend"" the NSA programs.

""Transparency is important, but we expect the White House to insist that no reform will compromise the operational integrity of the program,"" Buck said. ""Our priority should continue to be saving American lives, not saving face.""

As Obama outlined proposed reforms to the NSA surveillance programs, the administration also re-asserted its legal defense for the most controversial operation, the bulk collection of Americans' telephone records.

In a 22-page ""administration white paper'' issued by the Justice Department Friday, the telephone collection program was described as ""important to the government'' and that its operation was ""carefully limited'' to identify potential terrorists.

Although the document re-stated that contents of telephone calls are not collected, it also described a progressive or ""hop'' analysis used to track potential terror suspects.

Under orders by the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court, analysts can obtain information about the suspect by reviewing call records of those who have been in direct contact with suspect and the numbers of those who have been in indirect contact.

Special for USA TODAY

""They who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.""

— Benjamin Franklin, for the Pennsylvania Assembly, in its reply to the governor, 1755.

SAN FRANCISCO — In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the American people, through their elected representatives in Washington, chose to exchange a significant amount of freedom for safety.

But until a lone information-technology contractor named Edward Snowden leaked a trove of National Security Agency documents to the media this summer, we didn't know just how much we'd surrendered.

Now that we do, our nation can have a healthy debate — out in the open, as a democracy should debate — about how good a bargain we got in that exchange.

For facilitating that debate, at great risk to his own personal liberty, Snowden is this column's technology person of the year for 2013.

While a long line of so-called leaders of the tech industry were repeating the smug mantra that ""there is no privacy"" — all while secretly cooperating with the NSA's surveillance program — Snowden risked prosecution and jail to give Americans the chance to choose for themselves whether it still matters in the digital age.

Secrecy has long been a favorite tool of totalitarian regimes that want to stifle internal political debate.

Secret courts were a staple of Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union, used to exile dissidents to Siberian gulags.

They are still used today by China's communist government to silence its critics.

The U.S. also has secret courts, first created under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.

The FISA court was set up to allow American intelligence agencies to track foreign agents without allowing those agents to know about it, as they would if the warrant for monitoring their communications had to be approved in a public court.

On its surface, that rationale sounds reasonable.

Yet, like all secret courts, hidden from oversight, it was allowed to run amok.

After 9/11, it became a rubber stamp that approved massive surveillance programs that swept up the phone and Internet communications of ordinary Americans.

Whether that surveillance captured any actual communication or so-called metadata about phone calls and e-mails is a new argument that members of Congress and the NSA are now trying to use to confuse the debate.

But it misses the key point: If the government wants to know about the routine communication of law-abiding Americans, it should have to prove to a judge in an open courtroom that that surveillance is in the best interests of public safety.

This privacy safeguard is enshrined in the Fourth Amendment, which protects us all against ""unreasonable searches and seizures.""

Thanks to Snowden, this country can now argue and debate — in the federal courts and in the halls of Congress — whether the NSA's surveillance programs are constitutional.

Snowden also showed just how inept the NSA was in protecting even its own information.

Let's not forget the 9/11 terrorist attacks represented the worst intelligence failure in the nation's history.

Various government security agencies knew the names of many of the 9/11 terrorists before the attack. They also knew some were taking flying lessons, but failed to connect the dots.

Such a failure should have led to more oversight, not less.

But critics of that failure were soon bullied into silence by hysterical talk from those who needed to focus Americans' attention on our enemies, as when former secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously said people, ""need to be very careful about what they say.""

Not since Sen. Joseph McCarthy's Communist witch hunt of the 1950s had fear become so palpable in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

That was enough to cow most of the tech industry's largest companies into cooperating with the NSA.

Fortunately, some Americans are not so frightened of our enemies as Rumsfeld that they would trade liberty for safety.

Some believe that taxpayer-funded entities such as the NSA and the FISA court should have some measure of public oversight, to ensure they are helping to protect the U.S. Constitution, rather than undermining it.

Now that the scope of NSA spying has been exposed, let's have a debate about all of it.

And let's thank Edward Snowden for moving that debate into the public arena.

The sample of officers the RAND study looks at isn't representative, and the benchmark they use to determine the races of those stopped is derived from analysis of violent crimes, which make up a tiny fraction of stops.

This report seems to confirm fears that Obama has approached foreign policy in ways similar to those followed by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Baines Johnson during the Vietnam War. Like JFK, Obama had a brain trust through whom all decisions were “funneled.” And like LBJ, decisions were then made (or not made) based on how they would impact the political climate at home.

According to the report, during Obama’s first term:

The president had a truly disturbing habit of funneling major foreign policy decisions through a small cabal of relatively inexperienced White House advisors whose turf was strictly politics. Their primary concern was how any given action in Afghanistan or the Middle East would play on the nightly news, or which talking point it would give Republicans.

Because this tact was followed, promises of a 2014 troop draw-down have been promulgated to appease Americans who are tired of war. Yet the reality is that an undetermined number of troops, special forces, drones, and operators will remain in Afghanistan long after 2014.

In saying one thing but doing another, the Obama administration has told the American people exactly what they want to hear, just as LBJ did from 1963 until the TET Offensive in January 1968. And because of this, the war in Afghanistan will still be there for the next administration to end, just as LBJ left Vietnam for Richard Nixon to deal with.

As the report says, what is perceived as foreign policy prowess on Obama’s part is really not so much “about accomplishments in Afghanistan or the Middle East” as it is “with how U.S. actions in that region have been reshaped to accommodate partisan political concerns.”"

In a video made in captivity and released by As-Sahab, the media arm of al-Qaeda, Warren Weinstein urges the Obama administration to negotiate for his release. (As-Sahab)

A U.S. government contractor kidnapped by al-Qaeda militants in Pakistan in 2011 has recorded a video message calling on the Obama administration to negotiate with his captors, saying he feels “totally abandoned and forgotten.”

Warren Weinstein looked ashen and sounded lethargic as he pleaded for renewed interest in his case and asked the U.S. government to consider releasing

al-Qaeda militants in its custody. The 72-year-old development expert from Rockville, Md., began his address by urging President Obama to step up efforts to get him released.

“You are now in your second term as president of the United States and that means that you can take hard decisions without worrying about reelection,” said Weinstein, who was recorded sitting against a white wall wearing a gray tracksuit top and a black woolen hat. No one else appeared in the video.

The video, which included the yellow logo of As-Sahab, al-Qaeda’s media production outlet, was sent in an anonymous e-mail to several journalists who have reported from Afghanistan. Included were links to a handwritten note that purports to be from Weinstein, saying “Letter to Media” at the top. The note is dated Oct. 3. It is not clear when the video was made.

A State Department spokeswoman and a member of Weinstein’s family said Wednesday night that they had not independently received the note or video. The Washington Post provided a copy to both of them.

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf later said that U.S. officials were “working hard to authenticate” the contents of the message.

“We reiterate our call that Warren Weinstein be released and returned to his family,” she said in a statement. “Particularly during this holiday season — another one away from his family — our hopes and prayers are with him and those who love and miss him.”

Al-Qaeda leader Ayman

al-Zawahri said in a statement issued in December 2011 that Weinstein would be freed if Washington stopped launching air strikes in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen. He also demanded the release of all imprisoned members of al-Qaeda and the Taliban. The following year, Zawahri urged followers to kidnap Westerners to gain more leverage in al-Qaeda’s bid to get prominent jihadists freed from U.S. custody. Among the top priorities for the group is the release of Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, a blind Egyptian who was convicted of orchestrating the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

The Obama administration has said it will not negotiate with al-Qaeda for Weinstein’s release. The United States as a matter of policy generally does not negotiate with kidnappers, but the government devotes resources to finding Americans kidnapped overseas.

The new video appeared to be the captive’s first proof of life since a video statement released in September 2012. In that statement, Weinstein appealed to Israel’s prime minister “as one Jew to another,” asking him to help build support to meet al-Qaeda’s demands for his release.

Weinstein did not say what specific steps the Obama administration could take to secure his release. He did say, however, that his captors have agreed to arrange for relatives to visit him in custody if the United States releases unspecified prisoners as part of a “quid pro quo.”

Weinstein also addressed Secretary of State John F. Kerry, telling him his captors have kept him abreast of peace deals that the top U.S. diplomat has sought to broker. Weinstein said a “first step” to getting him released would require taking “action with respect to their people who are being held as prisoners.”

“If anyone in the Obama government can understand my predicament it is yourself,” Weinstein said. “I hope that one day soon I will be able to meet you as a free man and thank you for your efforts.”

Weinstein appeared troubled that the media have not covered his case more extensively. The handwritten note pleaded with journalists to keep his case in the news, to ensure “that I am not forgotten and just become another statistic.”

At the end of the video, he addressed his relatives, saying: “I would like them to know I love them very much and I think about each and every one of them every moment of every day.”

Weinstein was the Pakistan director of J.E. Austin Associates, a USAID contractor, when he was taken hostage in Lahore, Pakistan, on Aug. 13, 2011.

Weinstein said in the video that he is suffering from a heart condition and acute asthma.

“The years have taken their toll,” he said."

(CNN) - Call it the bromance, part two.

President Barack Obama and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie team up Tuesday to survey recovery efforts along the Jersey shore, seven months after Superstorm Sandy slammed into the Garden State and neighboring New York, causing billions in damage.



The destructive storm hit the northeast just over a week before last November's presidential election, forcing both Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney to put their campaigns on hold briefly while the heavily-populated region recovered.

The president traveled to New Jersey a few days after Sandy hit to observe federal recovery efforts, touring the damage with Christie, who at the time was a top Romney surrogate.

Standing next to the president, Christie praised Obama, saying ""I cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state and for the people of our state.""

Some political pundits say that the storm, which put the campaign on hold, and the federal government's response to the storm, were a couple of the many contributing factors that helped the president win re-election just a few days later. While Christie's own approval rating in New Jersey soared after Sandy, and has remained high to date as he runs for re-election this year, some commentators in his own party blasted him for his praise of Obama.

“He’s fat and a fool. Don’t listen to Governor Christie. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about,” said conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh.

Christie himself dismissed the critics, saying his actions after the storm weren't in any way motivated by politics – including a potential bid for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. He reiterated that mindset last week, saying on NBC's ""Today"" he wasn't worried about how Obama's visit might affect his political future.

""If the president wants to come back here and see the progress himself, I never worry about that stuff,"" Christie said Friday morning."" ""I worry about doing my job.""

""The bottom line is you can't experience the way you're experiencing it right now unless you're here and you see it for yourself,"" Christie added. ""The fact of the matter is he's president of the United States and if he wants to see the people of New Jersey, I'm the governor and I'll be here to welcome him.""

Christie political adviser Mike DuHaime said the governor was putting his constituents' needs ahead of partisan politics.

""Governor Christie has always put the best interests of the people who elected him first, well ahead of any political calculations,"" DuHaime said. ""If some people do not agree with putting your constituents first in a time of crisis and natural disaster, then so be it. He will always put the people who elected him first.""

In New Jersey, Obama and Christie will tour areas hit hard by last year's storm, which caused an estimated $38 billion in damage to the Garden State. Hundreds of thousands of homes were either damaged or destroyed, with many ocean-front businesses also sustaining significant harm from the high winds and storm surge.

Those businesses on the Jersey Shore are still working to recover at the beginning of the busy summer tourist season, which in years past has brought billions of dollars in revenue to the state.

Millions have been spent rebuilding boardwalks and restoring destroyed businesses, but thinner crowds are expected this summer as towns continue to work toward getting back to normal.

In Asbury Park, the iconic hometown of Bruce Springsteen, Obama will deliver remarks and ""highlight the extensive rebuilding efforts to date,"" the White House said.

They added Obama will ""underscore his administration's ongoing commitment to stand with the impacted communities as the important work of recovery continues.""

""It's a pretty vivid illustration about the president's commitment to seeing these things through,"" deputy press secretary Josh Earnest said Sunday.

""The president made a promise, in the aftermath of that storm, that he would continue to focus on that recovery effort and that the federal government would continue to focus on that recovery effort long after the nation's attention, or at least the media's attention had turned elsewhere,"" Earnest added.

Even as Christie enjoys a healthy lead over his Democratic rival in this year's governor's race, many wonder how his public embrace of Obama - both last fall and now - will affect his presidential chances in 2016. Christie, who has said he's not interested in running for president, is nonetheless widely speculated to be a potential candidate.

Rich Galen, a GOP political analyst who advised Fred Thompson during his 2008 presidential bid, said Christie has a number of ""institutional problems"" aside from his relationship with Obama. He hails from the East Coast, and doesn't particularly align with the GOP's major factions.

""That being said, if it looks, two years down the road, like he can win and no one else can, all else will be forgiven,"" Galen said. ""Obama's not running again, but Christie is so I suspect that other than the ideologues, he'll be fine.""

""Republicans are still furious at Governor Christie, but not as mad as they are at President Obama,"" noted GOP strategist Alex Castellanos. ""If Christie demonstrates that he can wrest the White House back for Republicans and reverse the leftward shift of Obama's 8 years, many Republicans will forgive his sins.""

Tuesday's trip will mark the second time in just three days Obama has traveled to the site of a natural disaster – he toured tornado-inflicted damage in Moore, Oklahoma on Sunday and encouraged further Congressional support for programs that bolster emergency management systems for municipalities.

""Training, education, both for citizenry but also for first responders, is absolutely critical,"" Obama said. ""And we've got to make sure that those resources remain in place. So I know everybody in Congress cares deeply about what's happening, and I'm confident that resources will be forthcoming when it comes to rebuilding.""

Obama praised the Federal Emergency Management Agency for its quick response to the Moore tornado, just as he did last fall when Sandy struck the East Coast. Long the object of scorn for its missteps in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, FEMA has been commended by localities for responding quickly to disasters and reducing some of the bureaucratic hurdles of the past."

“This failure originated from two practices that we need to reverse,” Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said at a security forum at the Aspen Institute.

“In an effort for those in the intelligence community to be able to share with each other, there was an enormous amount of information concentrated in one place,” he said. “That’s a mistake. Loading everything onto a server creates a security risk.”

Second, he said, “You had an individual who was given very substantial authority to access that information and move that information.… We’re acting to reverse both of those things.”

Carter said the NSA was moving to a system under which no single person could move large amounts of sensitive data without another person signing off, an arrangement common to nuclear weapons controls.

The Snowden disclosures of NSA surveillance systems were a prime topic at the Aspen Security Forum, which features a series of panel discussions by current and former intelligence officials. Snowden, charged with violating the Espionage Act, has been stuck in the international zone of a Moscow airport since June 23, and has asked for temporary asylum in Russia.

Among Snowden’s revelations was that the NSA had assembled a giant database of telephone calling logs of nearly every American.

Raj De, the NSA’s general counsel, said Congress was fully briefed on that program through classified “white papers” sent to lawmakers in 2009 and 2011. In recent weeks, some lawmakers have said they do not believe the Patriot Act allows such a broad collection of domestic records.

De and other current and former government officials defended the surveillance as narrow, legal and useful. Under questioning from reporter Barton Gellman, who wrote about some of the Snowden disclosures for the Washington Post, Dennis Blair, the former director of national intelligence, argued there was no evidence of abuses or Americans being wrongfully targeted.

Americans have been more inconvenienced by having to take off their shoes at airports than they have by NSA snooping, Blair said.

“I would be more outraged if I had found a story in which the activities of the NSA have caused inconvenience or harm or damage to an American,” he said. “I have not seen that story yet.”

Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said Snowden had done the country a service by forcing a debate on surveillance programs that had been kept from the American people. Current and former US intelligence officials disagreed, but Blair said he wished the U.S. government had disclosed some of the surveillance in general terms years ago.

“If we had more fully explained these programs … I think we would be in much better-off shape,” Blair said. “As it is, we are whipsawed by revelations … that make it appear as if we have much more to hide.”

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-halted-nsa-spying-imf-world-bank-headquarters-224926342--sector.html,,[],Obama halted NSA spying on IMF and World Bank headquarters,"By Mark Hosenball WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency to stop eavesdropping on the headquarters of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank as part of a review of intelligence gathering activities, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter. The order is the latest move by the White House to demonstrate that it is willing to curb at least some surveillance in the wake of leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden of programs that collect huge quantities of data on U.S. allies and adversaries, and American citizens. The NSA's surveillance of the Washington-based IMF and World Bank has not previously been disclosed. Details of such spy programs are usually highly classified. In response to Reuters inquiries, a senior Obama administration official said, ""The United States is not conducting electronic surveillance targeting the headquarters of the World Bank or IMF in Washington."" The Obama administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not address whether the NSA had eavesdropped on the two entities in the past. The first official said Obama had ordered a halt to such practices within the last few weeks, about the same time he instructed the NSA to curtail eavesdropping on the United Nations headquarters in New York. The IMF and the World Bank both declined to comment. Representatives of the NSA and the Office of Director of National Intelligence had no immediate comment. Loch K. Johnson, a former congressional oversight aide who is now a professor of international relations at the University of Georgia, said Obama made the right decision by curbing eavesdropping on international organizations and friendly foreign leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""I think it's a good idea to cut back on surveillance"" of economic-related targets, Johnson said. ""The enemy is terrorism and we should focus on that. We have to focus almost all of our resources on Al Qaeda and its affiliates,"" he said. Paul Pillar, a former senior analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency, said that U.S. policy makers have to weigh the value of collecting intelligence on an organization like the IMF against the risk it will become public. ""In this instance the gain from that information is likely to be minimal,"" Pillar said. ""Sound analysis on international economic issues of concern to U.S. policymakers is apt to draw more from other sources of information, both secret and public, and from tapping relevant expertise both outside and inside government, than from eavesdropping on conversations at the IMF,"" he added. It is no secret that U.S. spy agencies historically have collected and analyzed information related to economic affairs - in public briefings to Congress, top intelligence officials have discussed assessments of economic issues. But a former senior U.S. intelligence official said that the Obama Administration had put greater emphasis and resources than predecessors into collecting and assessing economic information. In February 2009, shortly after Obama entered the White House, the Central Intelligence Agency began producing a new ""Economic Intelligence Brief"" for him to review along with the regular President's Daily Brief on international security and threats. Leon Panetta, Obama's first CIA director, said at the time the change was aimed at understanding the implications of the global economic crisis, and that the agency was considering hiring more economic analysts. The former U.S. intelligence official noted that insider detail on economic policy developments - for example, financial crises affecting the economies of European countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain, and the stability of the Euro - is the type of critical information U.S. policymakers welcome. The desire by U.S. policymakers for such information could help explain why NSA collected information on foreign leaders such as Merkel. Her cellphone number was listed in a NSA targeting document, which German media outlets apparently obtained from Snowden's cache. U.S. officials have now indicated that much NSA eavesdropping on Merkel and other allied leaders is likely to be curtailed if not halted.

Delivers Cash to Afghan Leader’s Office,"It is not clear that the United States is getting what it pays for. Mr. Karzai’s willingness to defy the United States — and the Iranians, for that matter — on an array of issues seems to have only grown as the cash has piled up. Instead of securing his good graces, the payments may well illustrate the opposite: Mr. Karzai is seemingly unable to be bought.

Over Iran’s objections, he signed a strategic partnership deal with the United States last year, directly leading the Iranians to halt their payments, two senior Afghan officials said. Now, Mr. Karzai is seeking control over the Afghan militias raised by the C.I.A. to target operatives of Al Qaeda and insurgent commanders, potentially upending a critical part of the Obama administration’s plans for fighting militants as conventional military forces pull back this year.

But the C.I.A. has continued to pay, believing it needs Mr. Karzai’s ear to run its clandestine war against Al Qaeda and its allies, according to American and Afghan officials.

Like the Iranian cash, much of the C.I.A.’s money goes to paying off warlords and politicians, many of whom have ties to the drug trade and, in some cases, the Taliban. The result, American and Afghan officials said, is that the agency has greased the wheels of the same patronage networks that American diplomats and law enforcement agents have struggled unsuccessfully to dismantle, leaving the government in the grips of what are basically organized crime syndicates.

The cash does not appear to be subject to the oversight and restrictions placed on official American aid to the country or even the C.I.A.’s formal assistance programs, like financing Afghan intelligence agencies. And while there is no evidence that Mr. Karzai has personally taken any of the money — Afghan officials say the cash is handled by his National Security Council — the payments do in some cases work directly at odds with the aims of other parts of the American government in Afghanistan, even if they do not appear to violate American law.

Handing out cash has been standard procedure for the C.I.A. in Afghanistan since the start of the war. During the 2001 invasion, agency cash bought the services of numerous warlords, including Muhammad Qasim Fahim, the current first vice president."

Washington (CNN) - President Obama is expected to nominate former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel as the next Defense Secretary, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The nomination is likely to occur early next week, other sources told CNN.

The White House told some senior members of Congress to expect the tapping of Hagel, according to a knowledgeable source. Another source with knowledge of the nomination called it ""locked down.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Some in the defense industry were told to expect the Hagel nomination as early as Monday, one source with knowledge of the discussions told CNN.

A Republican, Hagel represented the state of Nebraska in the US Senate from 1997 until January 3, 2009 when he retired.

The White House has previously said that the president has made no final decisions. One source told CNN Thursday that the president was ""mulling"" over appointments in Hawaii this week.

A White House source told CNN's Wolf Blitzer the president ""has not offered the job to anyone.""

In an interview that aired on NBC December 30, Obama allowed he had not then made a decision on who to nominate, but said in making the choice his ""number one criteria will be who's going to do the best job in helping to secure America.""

""I've served with Chuck Hagel. I know him. He is a patriot,"" Obama said on ""Meet the Press. ""He is somebody who has done extraordinary work both in the United States Senate. Somebody who served this country with valor in Vietnam. And is somebody who's currently serving on my Intelligence Advisory Board and doing an outstanding job.""

His comments came as Hagel has undergone criticism from high-profile figures in Washington and other groups taking issue with some of his past positions–namely, his former opposition to sanctions against Iran and comments he made that led some pro-Israel lobbyists to argue he was not supportive of the Jewish state. He was also not in favor of the surge of troops in Iraq pushed by the Bush administration.

""A lot of Republicans and Democrats are very concerned about Chuck Hagel's position on Iran sanctions, his views toward Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah, and that there is wide and deep concern about his policies,"" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Sunday on Fox News.

The source with knowledge of the nominations adds that White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew is likely to be nominated as Treasury Secretary, perhaps as early as next week. This source says that while Lew is expected to be confirmed, there is some consternation in the business community about Lew, who is known as a ""numbers guy"" but has ""little or no market and business experience.""

The administration is believed to be searching for a person with business expertise to run the Commerce Department, but there seems to be no first-in-line name circulating at this point. Gene Sperling is expected to stay as Director of the National Economic Council.

Former Washington state governor Christine Gregoire, former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland and former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm are also being considered for cabinet posts.

Tim Giardina has been suspended and under investigation for issues related to gambling

He is the No. 2 officer at the military command in charge of all U.S. nuclear war-fighting forces

He was suspended on Sept. 3%2C but the suspension was not publicly announced

WASHINGTON (AP) — The No. 2 officer at the military command in charge of all U.S. nuclear war-fighting forces has been suspended and is under investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigation Command for issues related to gambling, officials said Saturday.

The highly unusual action against a high-ranking officer at U.S. Strategic Command was made more than three weeks ago but was not publicly announced.

Air Force Gen. Robert Kehler, who heads Strategic Command, suspended the deputy commander, Navy Vice Adm. Tim Giardina, from his duties on Sept. 3, according to the command's top spokeswoman, Navy Capt. Pamela Kunze. Giardina is still assigned to the command, but he is prohibited from performing duties related to nuclear weapons and other issues requiring a security clearance, she said.

Kehler recommended to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel that Giardina be reassigned, Kunze said. Giardina has been the deputy commander of Strategic Command since December 2011. He is a career submarine officer, and, prior to starting his assignment there, was the deputy commander and chief of staff at U.S. Pacific Fleet.

Two senior U.S. officials familiar with the investigation said it is related to gambling issues. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the probe in incomplete.

Strategic Command oversees the military's nuclear fighter units, including the Navy's nuclear-armed submarines and the Air Force's nuclear bombers and nuclear land-based missiles. It is located near Omaha, Neb.

Kunze said Strategic Command did not announce the Sept. 3 suspension because Giardina remains under investigation and action on Kehler's recommendation that Giardina be reassigned is pending. The suspension was first reported by the Omaha World-Herald.

The spokeswoman said a law enforcement agency, which she would not identify, began an investigation of Giardina on June 16. Kehler became aware of this on July 16, and the following day he asked the Naval Criminal Investigation Service to begin a probe.

The suspension is yet another blow to the military's nuclear establishment. Last spring the nuclear missile unit at Minot Air Force Base, N.D., pulled 17 launch control officers off duty after a problematic inspection and later relieved of duty the officer in charge of training and proficiency. In August, a nuclear missile unit at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Mont., failed a nuclear safety and security inspection; nine days later an officer in charge of the unit's security forces was relieved of duty."

During his daily briefing, Carney read aloud a short letter that went out Thursday afternoon from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who waged a 13-hour filibuster on Wednesday over Obama's secret use of drones to carry out targeted killings. Throughout the effort, Paul, along with a dozen other Republican senators, demanded to know whether Obama believed he had the right to order drone strikes on U.S. citizens on U.S soil.

Carney said the answer is no.

""It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: 'Does the president have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?,'"" Carney read aloud. ""The answer to that question is no.""

The administration sparked a furor over the matter earlier this week when, in another letter to Paul, Holder said the administration could technically use military force to kill an American on U.S. soil in an ""extraordinary circumstance"" but has ""no intention of doing so."" Republican outrage peaked with Paul's hours-long filibuster of John Brennan's Senate confirmation to the CIA. The White House stayed mum throughout the filibuster, as did most Senate Democrats.

Carney said Holder's latest letter should ease the ""great deal of confusion"" over the president's authority over drones in the United States, which is ultimately regulated by the Constitution.

""The president has not and would not use drone strikes against Americans citizens on American soil,"" Carney said. ""The legal authorities that exist to use lethal force are bound by, constrained by, the law and the Constitution. The issue here isn't the technology .... Whether it's a drone strike or a gun shot, the law and the Constitution apply in the same way.""

Paul said later that Holder's letter had satisfied his concerns and that he was prepared to let Brennan's nomination vote proceed.

""Hooray!"" Paul said on Fox News, where he learned of the letter and its contents. ""For 13 hours yesterday, we asked him that question. So there is a result and a victory. Under duress, and under public humiliation, the White House will respond and do the right thing.""

Shortly after, Paul said during a CNN appearance that he is ""quite happy"" with Holder's response, and that he only wished it didn't take so long to get an answer.

""I'm disappointed it took a month and a half and a root canal to get it,"" he said.

It was intercepted at an off-site facility in Landover where congressional mail has been examined before delivery since anthrax-laced letters were sent to Capitol Hill in 2001.

The letter was addressed to Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and initially tested positive for ricin, but officials familiar with the case said it was undergoing further testing late Tuesday. The officials gave no indication why the letter was sent to the second-term senator.

In a statement, Wicker thanked federal authorities “for their hard work and diligence in keeping those of us who work in the Capitol complex safe.”

During an afternoon briefing on the attacks at Monday’s Boston Marathon, senators were told that there is no suspected link between the letter and the attacks.

Senate Sergeant at Arms Terrance Gainer, who oversees Senate security, said that the suspicious letter was discovered Tuesday and that authorities conducted multiple field tests, followed by laboratory confirmation tests.

“I have confidence in our procedures, our personnel, the United States Capitol Police response personnel, the strength and weaknesses of field testing and the need for laboratory confirmation,” Gainer said in an e-mail.

But FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said late Tuesday that “initial field tests produced mixed results, so the substance is in the process of undergoing further analysis at an accredited laboratory. Only after that test result can a determination be made about whether the substance is ricin.”

A U.S. Capitol Police statement said that preliminary tests indicated the substance found was ricin but that the letter was being forwarded “to an accredited laboratory for further analysis.”

Gainer had briefed senators on the letter and outlined steps they should take to reassure staffers how to handle suspicious mail. “While we have no indication that there are other suspect mailings, it is imperative to follow all mail handling protocols,” Gainer wrote in a letter sent to all Senate staff Tuesday evening.

The off-site facility that screens mail will be closed for several days for further testing and examination by federal investigators, delaying delivery of mail to the Capitol and Senate office buildings.

Previous incidents have led to negative tests of suspicious letters. A false positive happened in 2004, when a letter to then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) was believed to contain ricin.

Ricin, a toxin found in castor beans, is poisonous if inhaled, injected or ingested, according to the National Counterterrorism Center. Treatment is available, but long-term organ damage is the likely result of exposure.

Eleven years ago, anthrax spores delivered in letters killed five people, injured 17 and changed how the U.S. Postal Service thinks about mail safety.

In his letter to staff members, Gainer gave no insight into any suspects. He said the letter, postmarked from Memphis, contained no return address and no “outwardly suspicious” markings.

Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), however, told reporters that the investigators are focusing on a person who has regularly written to members of Congress in the past.

The U.S. Postal Service spends about $100 million annually to screen every piece of first-class mail sent or received by U.S. households and mail sent to federal addresses in Washington, say officials familiar with the process.

Mail destined for the White House, Congress and federal agencies requires closer scrutiny. In the past, postal officials have said that once mail with federal addresses is sorted at a Washington facility, it is trucked it to a New Jersey irradiation facility operated by a private firm operating medical sterilization equipment. The Postal Service spends about $12 million annually on irradiation, say officials familiar with the process.

Mark Brady, a Prince George’s County Fire/EMS Department spokesman, said federal authorities notified local crews Tuesday morning that they were investigating a “potential package” at the facility in Landover. Several hours later, federal authorities requested crews come assist in that investigation by having an ambulance on standby to possibly treat those working on the package.

Such incidents, Brady said, are typical — occurring once or twice a day.

Southern Poverty Law Center tracks militias%2C %22patriot%22 groups

Number rose 7%25 to 1%2C360 last year

Fear of more gun restrictions is behind the increase

Radical anti-government ""patriot"" groups and militias, galvanized against gun control, will continue to grow even as the number of groups operating in the USAreached an all-time high in 2012, a report Tuesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center finds.

The center tracked 1,360 radical militias and anti-government groups in 2012, an eightfold increase over 2008, when it recorded 149 such groups. The explosive growth began four years ago, sparked by the election of President Obama and anger about the poor economy, the center says. That growth is likely to continue as the groups recruit more members with a pro-gun message, the center's senior fellow Mark Potok said.

President Obama's second term and a gun control movement bolstered by the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School is intensifying anti-government rage and will lead to more growth for the groups, Potok said.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit civil rights advocacy group based in Montgomery, Ala., defines the patriot movement as groups of people who believe the federal government is conspiring to confiscate Americans' guns and curtail liberties to create a socialist government or ""new order."" Most are non-violent citizens groups. Some groups also include militias, which arm themselves and conduct military-style training, the center said.

Conservative critics say the center uses its rhetoric to undermine right-wing and conservative groups.

The Southern Poverty Law Center uses its extremism report as a way to raise funds, says Bill Hahn, a spokesman for the John Birch Society, a conservative, anti-communist group based in Appleton, Wis, that advocates limited government. The group is on the center's list of anti-government groups.

The center ""is very adept at creating the specter that armed groups will overthrow the government or that the continuously dying supremacy movement is lurking behind every rock,"" Hahn said in a written statement. ""The SPLC will continue to utilize fear to fill their bank accounts.""

The John Birch Society opposes violence and urges its members to take action to restore and preserve constitutional freedoms, Hahn said.

Everett Wilkinson, whose Florida-based National Liberty Federation is not listed in the report, says many of the groups simply engage in peaceful rallies and letter-writing campaigns aimed at promoting free markets, fiscal responsibility and limited government.

""The Southern Perversion Law Center is a liberal organization that likes to spread propaganda about right-wing and conservative groups,"" Wilkinson said.

He recently sent an e-mail addressed to ""Patriots"" seeking land ""to hold training sessions for prepping, Constitution classes, militia training, medical, alternative communications, etc."" Wilkinson said some of his members had expressed interest in firearms training.

""We do respect people's right to defend themselves, but we are not a military-type organization or anything like that,"" he said. ""We're a grassroots activist organization focused on legislative issues and changing what's happening in government. We've had thousands of rallies since 2009 and we've yet to have a violent incident.""

The patriot groups' rhetoric and some groups' threats of domestic terrorist plots mirror the mood in the six months before the Oklahoma City bombing, a domestic terror attack in 1995 by anti-government militia sympathizer Timothy McVeigh that killed 168 people, center President J. Richard Cohen said in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. The center has called for a task force to assess the groups.

""In the last four years we have seen a tremendous increase in the number of conspiracy-minded, anti-government groups as well as in the number of domestic terrorist plots,"" Cohen wrote. ""We now also are seeing ominous threats from those who believe that the government is poised to take their guns.""

The number of anti-government groups grew 7% from 1,274 in 2011 to 1,360 in 2012. The center gathers its data from the groups' publications, websites, law enforcement, news reports and other sources.

Daryl Johnson, a former domestic terror intelligence analyst at the Department of Homeland Security whose report on the resurgence of the radical right in April 2009 was withdrawn by the department after criticism by conservative groups, said the center's estimate of radical anti-government groups is low and does not account for some of the most radical groups that operate underground.

Some groups stockpile weapons and their ""ability to inflect mass violence is quite high,"" Johnson said.

A January study from the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point found a dramatic rise since 2007 in the number of attacks and violent plots originating from people and groups identified with the far right of American politics.

The Southern Poverty Law Center's latest count surpasses the record number of groups formed in the 1990s in response to the passage of sweeping gun-control measures in 1993 and a ban on assault weapons in 1994. In 1996, the number of patriot groups peaked at 858, then declined until 2009, the center reports.

Recently, some of the groups have threatened politicians who have proposed gun-control measures, the report says. In one instance, neo-Nazi Craig Cobb posted Rep. Diana DeGette's address and photograph on the racist, anti-Semitic VanguardNews Network forum after the Colorado Democrat proposed a ban on high- capacity magazines, the report says.

The report cites groups that predicted civil war and tyranny after Obama's executive orders on gun control, including Fox News Radio host Todd Starnes, who tweeted, ""Freedom ends. Tyranny begins"" and ConservativeDaily.com's Tony Adkins, who wrote, ""Martial law in the United States now a very real possibility.""

The center quotes the United States Patriots Union, which in a letter to legislators in several states called the federal government ""a tool of International Socialism now, operating under UN Agendas not our American agenda."" The group said states should defend freedom and liberty ""or we are headed to Civil War wherein the people will have no choice but to take matters into their own hands.""

""Their rhetoric is a barometer of the rage that is building in certain quarters,"" Cohen said."

(CNN) —

American intelligence leaker Edward Snowden has more damaging information that could be a “nightmare” for the U.S. government, a journalist who first published his documents said.

Glenn Greenwald of the Guardian told an Argentine newspaper, La Nacion, that releasing more information to hurt the United States is not Snowden’s goal.

However, he said, Snowden has a “large number” of documents about software people use “without consciously agreeing to surrender their rights to privacy.”

Snowden has given copies of the papers to several people, Greenwald told the paper, according to an English translation.

“The U.S. government should be on their knees every day praying that nothing happens to Snowden, because if something happens, all information will be revealed and that would be their worst nightmare,” he said.

Others have suggested this before.

Kristinn Hrafnsson, a WikiLeaks spokesman, said last month that other secrets may be revealed.

“There is more to come,” he said.

What are the odds of a Snowden getaway?

Snowden is a former computer technician for U.S. defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton.

In June, he gave Greenwald and colleague Ewen MacAskill a 12-minute video interview on why he provided the Guardian the classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs.

Following his revelation, he fled to Hong Kong, then headed to Russia, where he is in political limbo in the transit area of a Moscow airport. He has requested asylum from Russia while he awaits safe passage to Latin America, according to WikiLeaks.

No application from Snowden has yet been received, the head of the Russian Federal Migration Service, Konstantin Romodanovsky, told the nation’s news agency, Interfax.

The presidents of Venezuela and Bolivia have said their countries would give him asylum, and Nicaragua’s president said he would offer it “if circumstances permit.”

Snowden faces espionage charges in the United States.

He met with human rights activists and lawyers Friday at the airport. It was his first public appearance since he left Hong Kong on June 23.

“I announce today my formal acceptance of all offers of support or asylum I have been extended and all others that may be offered in the future,” he said in a statement.

“As we have seen, however, some governments in Western European and North American states have demonstrated a willingness to act outside the law, and this behavior persists today. This unlawful threat makes it impossible for me to travel to Latin America and enjoy the asylum granted there in accordance with our shared rights.”

In his remarks, Snowden also sought to defend his actions in leaking documents to the media that exposed U.S. mass surveillance programs.

“I did what I believed right and began a campaign to correct this wrongdoing. I did not seek to enrich myself. I did not seek to sell US secrets. I did not partner with any foreign government to guarantee my safety. Instead, I took what I knew to the public, so what affects all of us can be discussed by all of us in the light of day, and I asked the world for justice,” he said.

“That moral decision to tell the public about spying that affects all of us has been costly, but it was the right thing to do and I have no regrets.”

The United States has reached out to the Russians regarding Snowden’s meeting with human rights groups, two senior State Department officials told CNN.

The two unions represent a total of 20,000 employees in the Department of Homeland Security who would play a central role in carrying out the ambitious legislation, either by reviewing applications from millions of immigrants who could gain new legal status through the bill or by expelling illegal immigrants who did not qualify.

A letter to Congress that excoriates the Senate proposal, and that the immigration officers’ union signed for the first time, reveals simmering unrest among Homeland Security employees, who have been asked to carry out broad and fast-paced immigration policy shifts by the Obama administration. Deportation agents have been instructed to focus heavily on removing serious criminal offenders, while immigration officers have been urged to accelerate their decisions on granting legal papers and reprieves from deportation.

The criticism of the bill from inside the system gives new political fuel to its most staunch opponents — among them Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama — when they had been battling on the defensive."

Scott Applewhite, file)

WASHINGTON -- How was it that Stanley McChrystal, a revered combat leader who reached the pinnacle of his career as the four-star general commanding the longest and perhaps most complex political-military conflict in American history, fell so fast, so dramatically, so quickly?

And why is it that three and a half years after McChrystal took command in Afghanistan, with yet another new military campaign plan designed to win the war, that the United States seems no closer to a satisfying end to the conflict?

In a new memoir, My Share of the Task, to be published Monday, McChrystal comes at these questions only obliquely. But he acknowledges a critical error: Unlike previous successful wartime leaders -- Dwight Eisenhower comes to mind -- he maintains that he wouldn't and didn't play politics. A reader finishing these nearly 400 pages suspects he disdained the political machinations that in Washington were determining the course of the war he was prosecuting thousands of miles away.

""I resolved to try to steer clear of politics,” he explains. “That wasn't easy."" Nor, he acknowledges, 31 months after he was forced to resign, was it smart.

McChrystal insists that he sought to emulate the traditional ideal of the professional soldier -- to operate as far as possible outside of the sometimes-messy business of backroom statecraft.

But, as his memoir makes clear, his attempt to avoid politics created a deeper problem. In the fall of 2009, McChrystal was assembling an ambitious new counterinsurgency strategy for Afghanistan, just as the Obama White House was struggling to extricate itself from the deeply unpopular war. It was a time of intense and sometimes ugly partisan infighting with leaks and rumors raging through the White House, Pentagon, Capitol Hill and the 24-hour media.

At issue was the very course of the war: Shut it down and bring the troops home, or ramp up the effort to win.

What the nation badly needed at that critical juncture was a wartime commander who could not only inspire troops in battle, but could lead in the political arena as well. It needed a warrior who understood what was possible in Afghanistan and how to do it, someone who could knit together a coalition of support from such antagonists like Vice President Joe Biden, who favored a massive troop withdrawal, and Sen. John McCain, who was thundering for a massive troop increase.

In hindsight, McChrystal writes in an exasperatingly passive voice, ""there were political realities outside my view ... I recognized, perhaps too slowly, the extent to which politics, personalities and other factors would complicate a course that, under the best of circumstances, would be remarkably difficult to navigate.""

That a man so clearly talented -- a brilliant combat leader, most would acknowledge -- a voracious reader of history, a warrior fiercely dedicated, fanatically hardworking, demanding of and tender toward his troops -- could be blindsided by political intrigue and his own missteps, mirrors the ancient truths of Greek tragedy.

There was bad blood between the White House and the military long before McChrystal handed in his resignation in June 2010.

That was hours after Rolling Stone portrayed the lean, four-star commando as ""The Runaway General"" who coerced an intimidated President Barack Obama into sending more warfighters to Afghanistan and then engaged his staff in a few rounds of bashing the clueless civilian-politicians in Washington.

It's hard to imagine how a seasoned professional soldier -- a West Pointer who studied Clausewitz (""War is not merely a political act, but also a real political instrument""), who dramatically expanded and led secretive hunter-killer teams across Iraq and two dozen other countries, who served in Washington as director of the Joint Staff and had risen to four-star rank -- never seems to have developed the political antenna to warn of approaching threats, or to have mastered the basic mechanics of political maneuver.

Things got so bad, McChrystal relates, that he was shocked to find that while he was trying to fine-tune the Afghanistan War strategy, the Obama White House in the late fall of 2009 was still grappling with the question on the minds of most Americans: What exactly was the U.S. trying to accomplish in Afghanistan?

Or, as an exhausted infantryman put it to McChrystal during one of the general's battlefield tours: ""Why are we here, Sir? What's the point?""

At just under 400 pages, McChrystal's memoir, written in 22 months and approved after an exhaustive Pentagon review, never clears up that question -- and dances away from other issues with scant explanation.

Many readers, for instance, might skip to the episode (page 387) in which he and his staff allowed Michael Hastings, a reporter for Rolling Stone -- a magazine known for its anti-war passion -- generous and extended access to their operations and private lives.

Apparently, McChrystal never gave this decision a second thought until he was awakened at 2 a.m. on June 22, 2010, with the news that the article had been published and ""it's really bad.""

His first thought: ""How in the world could that story have been a problem?""

McChrystal takes just a page and a half to recount the incident, from that moment to the president's acceptance of his resignation. Readers will search in vain for an explanation of whether the general and his staff did and said what had been reported; if they did, why; or why precisely they allowed Hastings such unrestricted access. In short, were they guilty, and if so, what the heck were they thinking?

In true stoic warrior form, McChrystal simply takes responsibility: ""Regardless of how I judged the story for fairness or accuracy, responsibility was mine. And its ultimate effect was immediately clear to me.""

In similar fashion, McChrystal skips lightly over issues which deserve fuller explanation.

In April 2004, for instance, Spec. Pat Tillman of the Army's 75th Ranger Regiment was accidentally shot and killed by fellow troops during a firefight in eastern Afghanistan. McChrystal says he immediately advised the Special Operations and Central Commands that an investigation was underway but that early evidence pointed to friendly fire as the cause of his death.

Under intense pressure from the Bush White House, which wanted to portray Tillman as a combat hero, Tillman's family was led to believe that he died courageously under enemy fire. That misleading explanation was drafted by McChrystal's staff and approved by the general.

But he dismisses the entire episode by concluding that ""any errors, which I should have caught, were not the result of any intention to misrepresent or mislead … to this day I am saddened by Ranger Tillman's death, as I am for the loss of every service member I served with, and for the pain such losses cause each family.""

Only rarely in his memoir does McChrystal allow a glimpse behind his public persona as the stoic, unfeeling warrior. In one telling anecdote, he relates going on a daytime raid with Army Rangers on a house of suspected insurgents in Ramadi, Iraq.

The Rangers moved quickly and gathered a group of local men from inside and around the buildings on the concrete parking areas in the front. To ensure security, as they moved to identify each man, they had him lie on the pavement with his hands behind his head. One Iraqi was notably older than the others, and a young Ranger, without instruction, retrieved a white plastic chair for him from an automotive maintenance shop. As was normally the case, even in daytime, there were no women in the immediate area. But I saw a boy, probably about four years old, standing near one of the men, no doubt his father.

As the Rangers motioned for the men to lie down on the ground, I watched the boy. He stood quietly, as if confused, then, mimicking his father, the child lay down on the ground. He pressed one cheek flat against the pavement so that his face was turned toward his father and folded his small hands behind his head.

As I watched, I felt sick.

I could feel in my own limbs and chest the shame and fury that must have been coursing through the father, still lying motionless. Every ounce of him must have wanted to pop up, pull his son from the ground, stand him upright, and dust off the boy's clothes and cheek. To be laid on the ground in full view of his son was humiliating. For a proud man, to seemingly fail to protect that son from similar treatment was worse.

As I watched, I thought, not for the first time: It would be easy for us to lose.

But the war went on. ""We could only hope the residents understood these raids were necessary,"" McChrystal writes, and a few pages later adds: ""Our war demanded relentless focus and a hardening of natural emotions.""

Yet it comes as no surprise that a man who devoted eight years to combat in two brutal and bloody wars, himself the son of an Army general who fought in Korea and Vietnam, feels profoundly the valor of shared sacrifice among men at war. Of war itself, McChrystal has almost nothing to say: no musing, at the end of his long career of service, about why he fought, and to what end, whether in the future the use of violent force could be or should be avoided. Or, more usefully, how to bridge the gap of mistrust between senior military leaders and the civilians they serve.

In a mea culpa of sorts, McChrystal offers that he sought as a senior commander to follow the ethic proposed by Samuel Huntington in his classic 1957 work, The Soldier and the State.

Huntington, McChrystal writes, ""argued that a military commander should endeavor to operate as independently of political or even policy pressures as possible. And yet I found, as much as I wanted my role to be that prescribed by Huntington, the demands of the job made this difficult. The process of formulating, negotiating, articulating and then prosecuting even a largely military campaign involved politics at multiple levels that were impossible to ignore.""

The counterpoint to his distaste for politics is one which readers might ponder. At a time when few Americans volunteer to serve, when the military seems a world away from the American mainstream, he takes just a moment to reflect on the nature of war and the community of those who volunteer to take part in it.

On a long helicopter flight north across Iraq on Christmas Eve 2009, hunched against the cold blast of air from an open hatch, he reflects that this is where he feels most comfortable.

I knew from history that war comes with frightening regularity, often fought over the same ground and similar causes as previous conflicts. Wars often begin with enthusiastic vigor but typically settle into costly, dirty business characterized for soldiers by fear, frustration and loneliness.... I felt the unbroken tradition of commitment to a mission, and a fierce commitment to one another. Like the generation they followed and those they now led, they came forward when called and sacrificed when needed. They did so quietly, often in shadows, with no expectation of reward. They were no better than their grandfathers, and not a bit worse."

USA TODAY

Two federal district courts to consider injunctions this week

Separate Supreme Court challenge won%27t be heard by justices

Judges could put temporary stop to government snooping

WASHINGTON — The federal government's once-secret telephone and Internet surveillance programs face crucial court hearings in Washington and New York this coming week, but the Supreme Court won't reconsider the decisions of a secret federal court.

The challenges, brought by liberal, conservative and privacy watchdog groups, raise the prospect that a federal judge could order at least a temporary halt to the National Security Agency's snooping on millions of Americans.

U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon on Monday will hear former Reagan administration lawyer Larry Klayman's request for preliminary injunctions against both of the government's major surveillance programs. One sweeps up telephone companies' data from domestic call records, even though the targets are foreign terrorists. The other goes after cellphone and computer data from major wireless companies and Internet service providers.

""This whole NSA thing unites both political ideologies,"" Klayman says. ""The whole country is outraged.""

Four days later, U.S. District Judge William Pauley will hear the American Civil Liberties Union's request for a preliminary injunction against the telephone surveillance program. The ACLU case, based on First and Fourth Amendment protections of speech and privacy, contends that the USA Patriot Act does not authorize such widespread spying.

""Neither the statute nor the Constitution permits the government to engage in that kind of dragnet surveillance of hundreds of millions of people who haven't done anything wrong,"" says Jameel Jaffer, the ACLU's deputy legal director.

A third case denied Monday by the Supreme Court was brought directly there by the Electronic Privacy Information Center. While the target in the other cases is the government, EPIC went after the top-secret court that authorized the surveillance of Verizon phone records under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

""The FISA court exceeded its authority under current law,"" says Marc Rotenberg, the group's executive director. His brief to the court noted that everyone — even Supreme Court justices — could be swept up in the phone surveillance program.

The Supreme Court request was considered a long shot because the justices rarely accept cases that don't filter up from lower courts. Rotenberg noted that only the Supreme Court can review the FISA court's actions, but the justices declined.

In all the cases, the Justice Department argued that the challengers lack standing to bring the lawsuits because they were not directly involved or cannot prove their records were examined.

The solicitor general's briefs also defend the surveillance on national security grounds. Its Supreme Court brief says the program ""authorizes the production of business records where there are 'reasonable grounds to believe' that the records are 'relevant' to an authorized and properly predicated ongoing FBI investigation of specific terrorist organizations.""

Amnesty International and other civil libertarians brought the last Supreme Court challenge to government surveillance programs in 2012. But in February, the justices ruled 5-4 that the challengers lacked standing because they could not prove they had been wiretapped.

""This theory of future injury is too speculative,"" Justice Samuel Alito said in announcing the decision, calling it ""hypothetical future harm.""

Since then, however, leaks from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden have led the government to make much of the programs public, enabling challengers to claim their privacy was invaded.

The person with the most direct claim may be Jamshid Muhtorov, 35, a refugee from Uzbekistan living in Aurora, Colo. His lawyers were told last month by the Justice Department that terrorism-related charges against him stemmed from the warrantless surveillance program.

Muhtorov was arrested in January 2012 on a charge of providing and attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. The FBI alleged that he planned to travel overseas and fight on behalf of the Pakistan-based Islamist Jihad Union, which has conducted suicide attacks in Uzbekistan and claims responsibility for attacks against coalition forces in Afghanistan.

Based on the insistence of Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, the Justice Department plans to notify other criminal defendants as well when their charges are based on warrantless surveillance. That makes the prospect of a future Supreme Court case more likely.

""All of these cases are different vehicles for trying to get into the courts the issue about large-scale electronic surveillance and the Constitution,"" says Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor and founding dean at the University of California-Irvine School of Law."

Cisco Systems has said it is seeing customers, especially overseas, back away from American-branded technology after documents revealed that the NSA enlisted tech firms and secretly tapped into their data hubs around the world as the agency pursued terrorism suspects. Companies such as IBM, AT&T and Verizon Communications are facing angry shareholders, some of whom have filed lawsuits demanding that the companies disclose their participation in NSA intelligence programs.

The companies also pressed the need for transparency and for limits on surveillance to restore the credibility of the U.S. government. They wanted an explanation of what the NSA was doing overseas to collect their data and to be able to talk about it, said industry and U.S. officials briefed on the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss it freely.

“Most companies” in the room pressed this point, “and they did so loudly,” said one U.S. official.

Obama said that he heard their message and that the White House would consider the group’s views as it completed a review of NSA surveillance programs.

Silicon Valley has been a critical driver of the economic recovery and has long represented the face of American ingenuity around the world. Many of these companies say they are still trying to assess the damage caused by Edward Snowden’s leak of NSA documents showing their work with intelligence officials.

But some shareholders say Silicon Valley has been slow to recognize the reputational crisis that is developing around the world for these companies. “Verizon and AT&T are not managing this crisis effectively,” said Jonas Kron, director of shareholder advocacy at Trillium, an investment advisory firm. “Now is the time for these companies to demonstrate that they will protect user privacy.”

The morning meeting at the White House, held in the Roosevelt Room, took on added import given a federal judge’s ruling Monday that the NSA’s counterterrorism program to collect Americans’ phone records appears to be unconstitutional. That, along with the outcry from Silicon Valley and civil liberties advocates, some of whom belong to Obama’s party, is increasing pressure on the administration to curb NSA surveillance efforts.

The gathering was scheduled for two hours but went well over the allotted time, with the majority of the discussion focused on the companies’ demands for changes to NSA spying programs, according to tech industry officials.

Several of the executives came to the meeting particularly angered over a Washington Post report in late October that revealed the NSA and its British counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, were gaining access to the data connections that link Google and Yahoo servers around the world, industry officials said.

Their message was to say: “What the hell are you doing? Are you really hacking into the infrastructure of American companies overseas? The same American companies that cooperate with your lawful orders and spend a lot of money to comply with them to facilitate your intelligence collection?” said one industry official familiar with the companies’ views.

The NSA has stressed that its overseas collection is carried out lawfully, under executive authority. Any data on Americans are handled according to rules that protect their privacy, including the requirement to obtain a warrant to target an American’s communications, officials say.

In the meeting, the executives reiterated a list of demands that had been sent to the White House in a letter last week calling on the administration to cease bulk data collection of e-mails, online address books and other personal information; to impose limits on how easily the NSA can obtain court orders for Internet data; and to allow the companies to be more transparent about government intelligence requests.

Several participants acknowledged that the White House had to balance the companies’ business concerns against national security considerations.

Senior administration officials described the meeting with the 15 executives as “constructive, not at all contentious.”

“This was an opportunity for the President to hear from CEOs directly as we near completion of our review of signals intelligence programs, building on the feedback we’ve received from the private sector in recent weeks and months,” the White House said in a statement.

One participant suggested the president pardon Snowden. Obama said he could not do so, said one industry official. White House officials have said that Snowden is accused of leaking classified information and faces felony charges in the United States, and that he should be returned as soon as possible to the United States, “where he will be accorded full due process and protections.”

Senior executives from AT&T, Yahoo, Apple, Netflix, Twitter, Google, Microsoft and Facebook were among those in attendance.

“We appreciated the opportunity to share directly with the President our principles on government surveillance that we released last week and we urged him to move aggressively on reform,” the technology firms said in a joint statement after the meeting.

Many of these firms have played a key role in boosting Obama’s political fortunes. Tech companies pumped nearly $7.8 million into his campaign in the last cycle, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Some of the top officials meeting with the president Tuesday served as bundlers for his 2012 bid. Yahoo’s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, raised between $100,000 and $200,000, according to the center, and Shervin Pish­evar, co-founder of the Sherpa technology investment fund, raised more than $500,000. Mark Pincus, Zynga’s chief product officer and chairman, gave $1 million to Priorities Action USA, the super PAC that supported Obama.

Still, some of these executives, as well as their shareholders, are fretting about the ­bottom-line impact of the NSA intelligence programs.

In Cisco’s earnings report last month, executives explained that disappointing sales in emerging markets were partly tied to the NSA leaks, which may have “caused a number of customers to pause and reevaluate,” Cisco’s head of sales, Robert Lloyd, said at the time.

Last week, IBM shareholders sued the company in a New York federal court, saying that it harmed investors with its secret participation in NSA programs.

“IBM’s association with the NSA presented a material risk to the company’s sales and, in particular . . . sales in China that were of critical importance to investors,” the Louisiana Sheriffs’ Pension and Relief Fund said in its lawsuit. “Despite that knowledge . . . IBM misrepresented to investors that it was a market leader in the Asia-Pacific region and that IBM expected solid improvement in the sales of its hardware division.”

Last month, shareholders of Verizon and AT&T demanded that the companies disclose their participation in NSA intelligence programs.

The $160.7 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund filed a resolution with AT&T’s board to make public its participation in government intelligence programs. The pension fund argued that customers can too easily switch to another wireless carrier amid concerns that AT&T is sharing telephone data and other information with the government.

The meeting at the White House was the second time top Silicon Valley and telecommunications leaders have convened with Obama since Snowden began to release portions of a trove of top-secret documents detailing NSA spying programs.

Obama tried to keep the tenor friendly, even cracking jokes, an industry official said.

At one point, he asked Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings if he brought advanced copies of the second season of “House of Cards,” a satire-drama of Washington politics, according to a pool report of the meeting.

Hastings laughed and invited Obama to do a cameo appearance on the show. Obama said of the ruthless lead character, a congressman played by Kevin Spacey, “This guy’s getting a lot of stuff done.”

“I wish things were that ruthlessly efficient,” Obama said, to laughter from all the tech executives.

As midlife sets in, maintaining a healthy weight often becomes harder. Tricks that worked in the past, like cutting down on wine or sugar, no longer seem to work, either. Even slender Samantha Cameron, now 50, has apparently been affected. In her 30s and early 40s, staying in shape was easy, she said this weekend, “but then I hit 43, I just put on three-quarters of a stone. Suddenly you don’t quite fit any of your things and I got really bloated.” At first she tried doing the 5:2 diet – eating normally five days a week, then having just 500 calories on the other two – but “I just couldn’t do it, I literally couldn’t speak in the evening, I had to go to bed at 7pm.” She has recently found a solution: the 5:2 principles, but with 800 calories on the “fast” days, and says she’s “loving it” and “the bloating’s gone”. Alongside three weekly workouts, she says it’s helping to keep her trim: her goal is “to hit my 50s in almost as good shape as I hit my 40s.” If you’re struggling to maintain your weight and fitness post-50, here’s why – and what to do about it: Muscle mass Every decade after the age of 30, we on average lose three to eight per cent of our muscle mass. At first, this might not be noticeable, but by 50 or 60, will make a considerable difference. This is bad news if you want to lose weight, because muscle burns on average three times more calories than fat per day, even at rest. What to do: Incorporate resistance training into your weekly routine to reduce muscle loss. The NHS recommends two sessions of strength training a week, which could include activities as varied as gardening or lifting weights. Don’t underestimate the good that exercise can do: a 2018 study shows that regular exercisers over the age of 55 kept up their muscle mass considerably more than inactive people. Staying active In England, half of 16 to 24-year-olds are doing the recommended amount of weekly exercise, but only one in 10 people aged 65 to 74 are doing so. If injuries have accrued, and your work and social life is less busy than it once was, you may be leading a more sedentary lifestyle than you realise. The role of exercise in weight loss is much-debated, but it can be crucial in maintaining your weight. A famous 2016 study followed participants in American weight loss competition The Biggest Loser during and after filming, and found that most regained a lot of weight after the cameras stopped rolling due to a higher appetite and slower metabolism. However, a follow-up study in 2017 found that the contestants who kept the most weight off were those who had remained committed to a fitness regimen. This was particularly interesting given that more exercise didn’t equal more weight loss during the show, when those who lost the most focused on diet over working out. What to do: Try to stick to the NHS guidelines on exercise, which recommend 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, or a mixture of both. Make sure you are doing something appropriate for your body, too. As we get older, high-impact workouts like running may place unwanted stress on your joints, so think about lower impact options like swimming or cycling. Hormones Menopause changes where fat is stored on the body. Higher oestrogen levels in the fertile years cause fat to be stored on your legs, hips and behind, but after oestrogen drops, fat can move to your middle, even if you remain exactly the same weight. This can be an issue, as fat around your trunk is more likely to contribute to Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart issues than fat on your hips and legs. Men are affected by hormone changes as they age, too: after the age of 40 they lose roughly one per cent of their testosterone a year. This matters for weight, as testosterone is linked to the amount of muscle you have and where you store fat. What to do: For women, several studies suggest that HRT can help to stop the shift of fat from your bottom half to around your middle as you go through menopause. An Italian study followed two groups of equal weight post-menopausal women for a year, putting half of them on HRT, with the rest going hormone-free. At the end of the year, the HRT group stayed almost the same weight, and hadn’t put on any extra fat around their middles or arms. In the untreated group, things were different: they had put on three and a half pounds, and had increased the amount of fat around their waists and arms. HRT isn’t suitable for everyone, so make sure you consider your options and discuss with your doctor first. In men, hormones are linked to a variety of lifestyle factors, including body fat and waist size, which can increase the amount of oestrogen in your body. Keeping active is also vital for men’s hormones: a 2018 study found that regular cyclists aged 55 to 74 kept their testosterone levels up compared with inactive men. Your sleep is also a partial predictor of your testosterone levels: most of the hormone is released while we doze, so if you’re not getting enough hours in bed, your body has less chance of boosting its stores. Getting enough sleep is key for maintaining your weight for other reasons, too: not getting enough is shown to make you gravitate towards sweet foods, and muscle growth occurs largely while we’re resting at night. More stress For many, juggling looking after children and caring for parents with work can mean life post-50 requires navigating a huge amount of stress. Even if you eat exactly as you did before, stress can cause weight gain. In 2015, American researchers found that after eating a large meal, women who reported more stress in the previous day burned 104 fewer calories than women who weren’t stressed. Stressed women also had higher levels of insulin, which is linked to gaining fat. This may not sound significant, but burning 100 fewer calories a day could lead to a loss of 10lbs of fat over a year. What to do: Reducing stress is often one of the hardest lifestyle changes to make, as you may have little control over the issues at work or home. However, you can change how you react, which can reduce your stress levels even without anything changing in your external environment. Exercise is an incredibly effective way of lowering cortisol levels, as well as burning calories, which could lead to a double effect on your weight. There is also robust evidence that simply slowing your breathing can dramatically reduce stress in both the short and long term, as well as giving a range of other benefits like better sleep. “Slow” counts as anything less than 10 breaths a minute, and six breaths is even better. The NHS recommends inhaling for up to a count of five, then exhaling for the same length of time."

Rice has called or come to a secluded contemporary house here, intelligence reports at hand, to brief President Obama about the chaotic world that has followed him on vacation.

On Wednesday, Ms. Rice, the national security adviser, delivered a particularly troubling report: Egypt’s military had begun a bloody operation to clear two camps of demonstrators protesting on behalf of that country’s ousted president, Mohamed Morsi. Among the options she laid out was a plan already on the table to pull the United States from joint military exercises with Egypt.

After Mr. Obama left to play golf, Ms. Rice, 48, returned to her own lodgings to consult with aides at the White House. After 5 p.m., the two spoke again, and Mr. Obama signed off on the plan.

The turmoil in Egypt, which erupted in early July just as she took up her job, has presented the toughest test yet for Ms. Rice, who in six weeks has already dealt with a terrorist scare that prompted the closing of embassies across the Middle East and with the latest chapter in deteriorating relations with Russia: the saga of Edward J. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, which led Mr. Obama to cancel a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/15/news/economy/military-recruiting/index.html,2013-05-15 00:00:00,['Annalyn Kurtz'],Getting into the military is getting tougher,"In a typical week, about 10 applicants will walk into a recruiting center in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, hoping to enlist in the United States Army. Sergeant First Class Israel Herrera doesn't like to turn them away, but he often finds that six out of 10 simply don't measure up to military standards.

Just like private-sector employers, the military is seeking higher-skilled recruits these days.

It's no longer enough to be a patriotic, able-bodied young person. A high-school diploma, above-average score on the military entrance exams, and a clean slate -- free from prior drug use or criminal conduct -- are practically required now. Thanks to high youth unemployment and the drawdown from both Iraq and Afghanistan, Uncle Sam can afford to be a bit pickier.

""There's a lot more competition,"" said Herrera, who signed up himself 13 years ago. ""There are not many opportunities out there, but the Army provides employment and stability, and that makes it an attractive option.""

The Pentagon estimates that only one in four of today's youth are fit for military service. More than 20% of high-school students fail to graduate. Obesity and other medical conditions disqualify about 35% of candidates. Prior drug and alcohol involvement disqualify another 19%, and criminal records disqualify 5%.

It wasn't always this way. Just six years ago, during the Iraq war surge, the military had lower standards. Only about 86% of new recruits had high-school diplomas, and just 67% of recruits scored in the top 50th percentile on the Armed Forces Qualification Test. Waivers excusing health issues and prior misconduct -- even felonies -- were not uncommon.

Those waivers were needed to hit enrollment targets. The Army fell short of its recruiting goal by about 7,000 people in 2005, but like the other military branches, it has had a surplus of recruits every year since then.

""Before 2009, we would probably be able to give you an example of a young man or young woman who got in with a simple possession of marijuana charge,"" Herrera said. ""They would not get a waiver these days.""

Over the last couple years, the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines have enlisted their highest-quality recruits since at least 1973, when the military discontinued the draft.

Now a whopping 99% of recruits have a high-school diploma -- an all-time high. Even candidates with GEDs are often turned away and encouraged to complete at least 15 college credits before re-applying.

There are roughly two applicants for every slot the military is trying to fill.

Two key factors are driving the trend. First, the military is recruiting fewer active-duty soldiers overall, as it reduces troop levels in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In fiscal 2012, the military enlisted about 155,000 new recruits, the smallest cohort on record in the post-World War II period.

Top military officials also credit the sluggish job market for their hiring success. A slow economy ""makes recruiting less challenging, and operates to the advantage of those who are hiring, including the U.S. military,"" Acting Under Secretary of Defense Jessica Wright said last month in a prepared statement before the Senate Armed Forces Committee.

The weak economy over the last few years was enough to convince Tony Coleman II, an 18-year-old from East Stroudsburg, Pa., to enlist. In his hometown, the unemployment rate is hovering near 10%.

""After high school, I figure not a lot of jobs will open for me,"" he told CNNMoney. ""Money is tight around here, and there are fewer kids getting jobs. Plus, it's a gateway to college.""

Coleman works at McDonald's now, but dreams of eventually working as a detective for the FBI. He expects to graduate from high school in June and is already preparing to ship off to basic training in Ft. Jackson, S.C., in July. He says he enlisted for three main reasons: ""to make mom proud,"" to fund his college education, and to avoid the weak civilian job market.

As of April, the national unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds was 16.1%, more than double the national average for the broader U.S. population.

Military pay also works in the recruiters' favor. It tends to exceed that of comparable civilian jobs, once you factor in all the extra benefits like health care, tuition assistance, housing and food allowances.

For new recruits, the starting pay is around $1,400 a month. By the time they've reached 18 months of service, their pay is often boosted to about $1,800 to $2,000 a month.

The housing allowance is substantial. For even the most junior enlistee, an E1 with less than six months of service, it ranges from about $800 a month in Fort Hood, Texas, to $2,300 a month in New York City.

Compare that to the average 16- to 19-year-old civilian worker's monthly pay of about $1,400, according to Labor Department data -- and it's safe to say most of those jobs don't include health insurance or housing, much less tuition reimbursement.

As the economy improves, will the military need lower its recruiting standards again? Officials are keeping a watchful eye on their candidate pool.

""As we see signs of economic improvement, we must remain vigilant and continue to monitor impacts on our recruiting efforts,"" Wright told Congress."

Gathers Data on Social Connections of U.S. Citizens,"WASHINGTON — Since 2010, the National Security Agency has been exploiting its huge collections of data to create sophisticated graphs of some Americans’ social connections that can identify their associates, their locations at certain times, their traveling companions and other personal information, according to newly disclosed documents and interviews with officials.

The spy agency began allowing the analysis of phone call and e-mail logs in November 2010 to examine Americans’ networks of associations for foreign intelligence purposes after N.S.A. officials lifted restrictions on the practice, according to documents provided by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor.

The policy shift was intended to help the agency “discover and track” connections between intelligence targets overseas and people in the United States, according to an N.S.A. memorandum from January 2011. The agency was authorized to conduct “large-scale graph analysis on very large sets of communications metadata without having to check foreignness” of every e-mail address, phone number or other identifier, the document said. Because of concerns about infringing on the privacy of American citizens, the computer analysis of such data had previously been permitted only for foreigners.

The agency can augment the communications data with material from public, commercial and other sources, including bank codes, insurance information, Facebook profiles, passenger manifests, voter registration rolls and GPS location information, as well as property records and unspecified tax data, according to the documents. They do not indicate any restrictions on the use of such “enrichment” data, and several former senior Obama administration officials said the agency drew on it for both Americans and foreigners."

As a result of his decision to seek refuge in the embassy, ""I have been able to work in relative safety from a U.S. espionage investigation,"" said Assange, according to the text of the speech.

""But today, Edward Snowden's ordeal is just beginning.""

Assange's words came hours after Snowden was charged by U.S. federal prosecutors with espionage and theft of government property, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in Virginia on Friday.

Snowden, 30, has admitted in interviews that he was the source behind the leak of classified documents about the NSA's surveillance programs. Those leaks were the basis of reports this month in Britain's Guardian newspaper and The Washington Post.

He is believed to be in hiding in Hong Kong. The United States has asked authorities there to detain the former National Security Agency contract analyst on a provisional arrest warrant, The Washington Post reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials.

Assange, in his published speech, said the espionage charge had come ""like clockwork,"" making Snowden the eighth ""leaker"" to be charged with that count by the Obama administration.

""Two dangerous runaway processes have taken root in the last decade, with fatal consequences for democracy,"" he said.

""Government secrecy has been expanding on a terrific scale. Simultaneously, human privacy has been secretly eradicated ... The U.S. government is spying on each and every one of us, but it is Edward Snowden who is charged with espionage for tipping us off.""

Also among the eight ""leakers"" is WikiLeaks source Bradley Manning, Assange said. Manning is being court-martialed on charges he aided U.S. enemies by leaking documents he obtained as an Army intelligence analyst.

Prosecutors: Bradley Manning 'craved' notoriety

He named the others as Barrett Brown, Jeremy Hammond, Aaron Swartz, Gottfrid Svartholm and Jacob Appelbaum.

Assange suggested Obama was the real ""traitor"" for his failure to live up to his promises of hope, change and transparency in government. And he warned that the U.S. government will lose the battle if it tries to take on the tech-savvy people now calling its actions into question.

""Edward Snowden is one of us. Bradley Manning is one of us. They are young, technically minded people from the generation that Barack Obama betrayed. They are the generation that grew up on the Internet, and were shaped by it,"" he said.

""The U.S. government is always going to need intelligence analysts and systems administrators, and they are going to have to hire them from this generation and the ones that follow it.

""One day, they will run the CIA and the FBI. This isn't a phenomenon that is going away.""

Assange added that charging Snowden ""is intended to intimidate any country that might be considering standing up for his rights"" and appealed for efforts to find asylum for him to be intensified."

(CNN) —

The Mississippi man accused of making a potent toxin found in letters mailed to President Barack Obama and other officials will be held without bond pending a preliminary hearing later this week, a federal magistrate ruled Monday.

Federal authorities arrested James Everett Dutschke, 41, on Saturday on charges of possessing and using ricin after initially charging – and then clearing – another man with whom Dutschke has sometimes feuded.

Wearing an orange jumpsuit, and his hands and feet shackled as he entered the courtroom, Dutschke told Magistrate S. Allan Alexander that he understood what he had been charged with.

His attorney, George Lucas, told Alexander that they had not yet had time to go through the complaint.

Alexander agreed to order Dutschke held without bond on grounds he could be a danger to the community or could try to run.

She set a preliminary hearing for Thursday.

Both Lucas and Assistant U.S. Attorney Chad Lamar declined to comment.

While the eight-minute proceeding produced no new details, the public could learn more about the accusations when the criminal affidavit in support of the complaint is unsealed.

That is now expected to occur at the preliminary hearing, according to the Justice Department.

Dutschke’s arrest was the latest head-scratching twist in what could be a tale of small-town intrigue that blew up to become international news.

The letters – sent to Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and Sadie Holland, a local judge, arrived April 16 and touched off anxieties in Washington and elsewhere in the wake of the bombing of the Boston Marathon. The two incidents were unconnected, officials said.

Before police settled on Dutschke as a suspect, they took into custody a Corinth, Mississippi, man named Paul Kevin Curtis, who makes his living impersonating Elvis, Buddy Holly and Randy Travis.

Curtis vehemently denied sending the letters, said he was framed and identified Dutschke as a potential culprit.

What is ricin?

The ties that bind

Dutschke used to work for Curtis’ brother at an insurance company, under the direction of Curtis’ ex-wife.

Curtis has said that while Dutschke worked for his brother, the two talked about collaborating on the publication of a book but later had a falling out.

He has accused Dutschke of stalking him online, a claim the latter has denied.

In an April 22 court hearing before the charges were dropped, Curtis said he was being framed and identified Dutschke as a potential culprit.

Dutschke told reporters last week that he did not know Curtis well.

“He’s just a little nutty,” he said. “I don’t have a relationship with him.”

The ties that bind II

So where do the lawmakers fit in?

Dutschke can be linked to Sadie Holland through her son, Democratic state representative Steve Holland.

Dutschke failed in a bid as a Republican to unseat the younger Holland.

As for Curtis, Sadie Holland presided over a 2004 assault hearing involving Curtis, who says he has been in jail “over 20 times,” but never convicted.

And Wicker?

Dutschke said he once met Wicker.

Suspect No. 1

The letters read, in part: “To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.”

They were signed “I am KC and I approve this message,” a source told CNN.

Each letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address.

The very next day, authorities arrested Curtis.

His attorney, Christi McCoy, said he’d been framed by someone who used several phrases Curtis likes to use on social media.

The FBI said the letters tested positive for ricin, a toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote.

The very next week, authorities dropped the charges against Curtis after they said they had new information.

“I think now, how many people are thrown in jail because of circumstantial evidence and someone can frame you that easily,” he told CNN last week after being cleared.

Suspect No. 2

The feds then turned their attention to Dutschke.

Agents searched his residence and former martial arts studio. Dutschke told CNN affiliate WMC-TV that he agreed to the FBI search “to help clear my name.”

“I had absolutely nothing to do with those letters,” he said.

Early Saturday, he was arrested without incident at home. He was charged with possession and use of a biological agent as a weapon in connection with the letters.

More trouble

This isn’t his only brush with the law.

Dutschke faces molestation charges in an unrelated case.

According to a grand jury indictment handed up this month and obtained by CNN, Dutschke is accused of molesting three girls under the age of 16. He has repeatedly denied the charges in interviews with local media and pleaded not guilty in court this month.

Dutschke closed his tae kwon do studio after the allegations were made public.

Dutschke was previously convicted on indecent exposure charges in another case and sentenced to 90 days in jail.

A song in his heart

As for Curtis, he told CNN he’s “just glad it’s over.”

When he learned Dutschke had been arrested, he took a deep breath and felt like “a weight had been taken off.”

“I just want to return to my kids and my music,” Curtis said.

During another interview with CNN last week, he said the public attention could “thrust him into the limelight.”

And then, at the urging of reporter Chris Cuomo, he burst into song.

The naturalization ceremony in Baltimore, attended by 72 other tearful immigrants from 35 countries, was a moment I had dreamed about since the day I arrived in America with little more than $50 and a set of cooking knives, determined to belong. I eventually settled in Washington, where my partners and I have been fortunate to build a restaurant business that now employs thousands of Americans across the country.

And yet, I have become a citizen at a time when legislation is stalled in Congress that would afford millions of other immigrants the chance to earn their citizenship, too. With this bill, which already has the support of many Republican and most Democratic senators, we are closer than ever to achieving immigration reform. So I’d like to address the members of Congress who still have concerns about passing the bill:

I understand that this is a difficult and complicated issue. But we are not asking for an open-door policy that allows unregulated immigration. Indeed, the bill before Congress would do more to secure our borders than any other law in history. What we’re asking is to give the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are already part of America’s DNA a chance — a chance to prove they are worthy of citizenship; a chance to contribute more to this incredible country; a chance to belong.

The fellow immigrants I’ve known and worked with over the years, those with legal status and those without, are here for the right reasons. They don’t want to cause any trouble, take any handouts or steal anyone’s job. Many already pay taxes and have jobs — tough, dirty, exhausting work that America depends on, such as picking our tomatoes, cleaning our fish or canning our products on cold factory floors for low wages and no benefits.

Because many of us took great risks to come here and support our families, immigrants tend to have an especially strong work ethic. My friend Rodolfo started his career in America tiling the floors at Jaleo, our first restaurant. But he soon began washing dishes and baking bread overnight, sometimes holding two or three jobs while he learned how to cook. And today, that construction worker from Bolivia is a head chef, a restaurant investor, a wonderful father and a proud American citizen.

If other immigrants had the chance to pursue their dreams like Rodolfo, all of America would benefit. As legal residents, immigrants would contribute more in taxes, spend more at our businesses, start companies of their own and create more jobs. Immigration is not a problem for us to solve but an opportunity for America to seize.

As immigrants, we understand better than most that to be an American is a privilege that conveys not just rights but responsibilities. Some of those responsibilities are pledging allegiance to our flag, obeying our laws and learning a new language. But we also have an obligation to give something back — to enrich the American mosaic with our unique cultures, traditions and ideas. It is for this reason I plan to reopen my restaurant, America Eats in a new location in celebration of the culinary contributions that immigrants have stirred into our nation’s ever-churning melting pot.

For the menu, I researched some of the earliest recipes brought to America, and as I came across one labeled “Gaspacho ” in an early-19th-century book titled “The Virginia Housewife,” I couldn’t help but think of the past — not just the first time I saw America as a sailor in the Spanish navy but the first time a Spaniard ever arrived on America’s shores.

Five hundred years have passed since Juan Ponce de León set foot in Florida looking for gold, and today I can proudly say that I have found mine: my wife and daughters, my friends and colleagues, and the new citizenship my wonderful country has given me. While I will always be proud of where I come from, I have never been more certain of where I belong.

Right now, the House of Representatives has a chance to make a difference in the lives of millions by allowing a vote on immigration reform, a difference that would benefit America for generations to come. I don’t envy Speaker John Boehner’s difficult position. I know he loves this country dearly, and I imagine the hopes he had when sweeping the floor of his father’s Cincinnati bar were not so different than those of a young Spanish sailor who believed that if he loved America, America would love him back. All I ask is that he considers the millions of immigrant families who hold those same hopes.

We may all come from different places and backgrounds, but we still look with awe to that same remarkable sky, and we want nothing more than the simple chance to reach for our own American dream.

From “The Virginia Housewife,” by Mary Randolph (1824): “Put some soft biscuit or toasted bread in the bottom of a salad bowl, put in a layer of sliced tomatas with the skin taken off, and one of sliced cucumbers, sprinkled with pepper, salt, and chopped onion; do this until the bowl is full, stew some tomatas quite soft, strain the juice, mix in some mustard and oil, and pour over it; make it two hours before it is eaten.”"

Lonnie Snowden was ""reasonably confident"" his son, who faces espionage charges in the United States for alleged leaking of secret surveillance information, would return if certain conditions were met, the June 27 letter said. It was written by a lawyer on Snowden's behalf, and was obtained by Reuters.

The younger Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, should not be detained or imprisoned before trial, should not be subject to a gag order, and should be tried in a venue of his choosing, the letter said.

Edward Snowden, a U.S. citizen, fled the United States to Hong Kong in May, a few weeks before publication in the Guardian and the Washington Post of details he said he provided about U.S. government surveillance of Internet and phone traffic.

He has not been seen since he arrived in Moscow on Sunday, but Russian officials said he was in a transit area at Sheremetyevo airport. He has requested political asylum in Ecuador.

Representatives for the Justice Department could not be reached immediately for comment on the letter.

Lonnie Snowden said he was concerned that his son was being manipulated by others, including people from the anti-government secrecy group WikiLeaks, he said in an interview on NBC television earlier on Friday.

""I am concerned about those who surround him,"" he told NBC. ""Wikileaks - if you look at past history - their focus isn't necessarily the Constitution of the United States. It's simply to release as much information as possible. So that alone is a concern for me.""

Snowden's father said he has not had contact with his son since April, NBC reported.

""I love him. I would like to have the opportunity to communicate with him. I don't want to put him in peril,"" he said in the interview.

Snowden said he did not think his son had committed treason, even though he said Edward Snowden broke U.S. laws in releasing details about the federal monitoring programs.

""He has betrayed his government, but I don't believe that he's betrayed the people of the United States,"" he said.

The letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address

It was addressed to Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi

Ricin is a highly toxic substance derived from castor beans

An envelope that tested positive for the deadly poison ricin was intercepted Tuesday afternoon at the U.S. Capitol's off-site mail facility in Washington, congressional and law enforcement sources tell CNN.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he was told the letter was addressed to the office of Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi. A laboratory in Maryland confirmed the presence of ricin after initial field tests indicated the poison was present, according to Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terrance Gainer.

However, the FBI said additional testing is needed as field and preliminary tests produce inconsistent results.

""Only a full analysis performed at an accredited laboratory can determine the presence of a biological agent such as ricin,"" according to the bureau. ""Those tests are in the process of being conducted and generally take from 24 to 48 hours.""

A law enforcement source said more tests would be conducted at the Army's biomedical research laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland.

The letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address, Gainer wrote in an e-mail to senators and aides.

Sen. Claire McCaskill told reporters after a briefing for lawmakers that a suspect has already been identified in the incident, but a knowledgeable source said no one was in custody Tuesday night.

Wicker, the junior senator from Mississippi, has been assigned a protective detail, according to a law enforcement source.

Postal workers started handling mail at a site off Capitol Hill after the 2001 anthrax attacks that targeted then-Majority Leader Tom Daschle and Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, among others. Senators were told the post office would be temporarily shut down ""to make sure they get everything squared away,"" McCaskill, D-Missouri, said Tuesday afternoon.

""The bottom line is, the process we have in place worked,"" she said. Members will be warning their home-state offices to look out for similar letters, she added.

A previous ricin scare hit the Capitol in 2004, when tests identified a letter in a Senate mailroom that served then-Majority Leader Bill Frist's office. The discovery forced 16 employees to go through decontamination procedures, but no one reported any ill effects afterward, Frist said.

Ricin is a highly toxic substance derived from castor beans. As little as 500 micrograms -- an amount the size of the head of a pin -- can kill an adult. There is no specific test for exposure and no antidote once exposed.

It can be produced easily and cheaply, and authorities in several countries have investigated links between suspect extremists and ricin. But experts say it is more effective on individuals than as a weapon of mass destruction.

Ricin was used in the 1978 assassination of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov. The author, who had defected nine years earlier, was jabbed by the tip of an umbrella while waiting for a bus in London and died four days later.

Wicker, 61, was first appointed by former Republican Gov. Haley Barbour to the U.S. Senate in December 2007 after the resignation of then-Sen. Trent Lott. He was then elected to the seat in 2008 and won re-election in 2012 to a second term.

Before joining the Senate, he was a U.S. representative in the House from 1995 to 2007. Before that, he served in the Mississippi Senate."

The top military leader spoke exclusively with The Post’s Rajiv Chandrasekaran about why he's deciding to step away from service. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

Four months after taking office, President Obama approved the firing of the four-star Army general leading the war in Afghanistan. The following summer, the president sacked his replacement, Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, for making intemperate remarks to a reporter. McChrystal’s successor, Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, often disagreed with Obama on troop levels and war strategy.

It was not until Marine Gen. John R. Allen took command of the war in July 2011 that Obama found a general with whom he clicked. Allen demonstrated more flexibility on troop numbers and shifts in strategy than his predecessors. Obama’s aides, in turn, were far more willing to listen to Allen’s views on how the war needed to be waged.

Obama had wanted to give Allen, who relinquished command in Kabul this month, the military’s most prestigious overseas assignment — supreme allied commander in Europe. But on Tuesday morning, Allen announced that he planned to retire from the military because his wife is seriously ill.

The decision deprives the president of a four-star general with whom he had built a close wartime relationship and forces the White House to find a new candidate to oversee U.S. and NATO operations in Europe.

“I told General Allen that he has my deep, personal appreciation for his extraordinary service over the last 19 months in Afghanistan, as well as his decades of service in the United States Marine Corps,” the president said in a statement after meeting with the general at the White House.

In an interview Monday evening, Allen said he wants to focus on helping his wife, Kathy, cope with a combination of chronic health issues, which include an autoimmune disorder.

“Right now, I’ve just got to get her well,” Allen said. “It’s time to take care of my family.”

In Afghanistan, Allen oversaw the strategic shift from troop-

intensive counterinsurgency operations to the development of local security forces. As he orchestrated that change, he managed the removal of 33,000 U.S. troops from the country and the response to a spate of attacks on coalition personnel by members of the Afghan security forces.

Allen, who relinquished command of the war nine days ago, said his decision was not influenced by a Pentagon investigation into e-mail messages he exchanged with Tampa socialite Jill Kelley, who was involved in the scandal that prompted Petraeus to resign as CIA director last year. Allen was cleared of wrongdoing last month after investigators combed through the messages.

Although senior Defense Department officials described the content of some of the missives as racy and flirtatious, the Pentagon’s inspector general determined that Allen had not violated military prohibitions against conduct unbecoming an officer. Allen’s allies have described the investigation as overblown, arguing that his e-mails to Kelley, which included words such as “sweetheart,” reflected nothing more than friendship.

The messages were uncovered during an FBI investigation into a set of harassing e-mails Kelley had received. The bureau eventually determined that those messages had been sent by Petraeus’s biographer, Paula Broadwell, and that Petraeus and Broadwell were having an affair.

“The investigation took a toll on her,” Allen said of his wife.

He said that his wife’s condition has been deteriorating for a few years and that he thinks it would have been problematic for her to receive the necessary medical authorization from the military to travel to Belgium, where NATO is based. The couple’s two adult daughters, who have helped to care for Kathy Allen, also live in Northern Virginia.

“For a long time, I told her, ‘When you can’t bear this anymore, just tell me and I’ll drop my [resignation] letter right away,’ ” Allen said. But he said he no longer wants to place the pressure of that decision on her. “Now I need to be the one who takes this out of her hands.”

Allen, 59, was the first Marine ever selected to command a theater of war. Leading the multinational military campaign in Afghanistan was “the honor of a lifetime,” he said.

He said the strategic shift away from counterinsurgency, the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the attacks by Afghan security forces and the months-long closure of supply routes through neighboring Pakistan “tried to wrench the campaign off the tracks.”

“We managed to hold on, but it was a herculean effort,” he said.

Even so, violence in Afghanistan is higher than it was before Obama ordered a surge of U.S. forces into the country, according to the most recent Pentagon assessment. The report also stated that just one of the Afghan army’s 23 brigades is able to operate without support from the U.S. military or NATO allies, making it difficult for the Afghans to take the lead in fighting the Taliban despite U.S. efforts to hand over that responsibility.

The path to the president’s decision to withdraw 34,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan by February 2014, announced during last week’s State of the Union address, illustrates the relationship between Obama and Allen, according to senior U.S. officials familiar with the matter. Allen’s staff had recommended that no more than 25,000 troops be removed this year, an assessment the general initially supported.

But when the White House made it clear to Allen that the president wanted to remove half of the 68,000 troops now in the country, the general developed a plan to satisfy Obama: Allen recommended the withdrawal of 34,000 troops, but he also asked Obama to push the deadline back by two months — from the end of the year to February 2014, allowing his successor, Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., to avoid pulling out more than 25,000 troops by the autumn, when Taliban fighters typically begin their winter rest.

Obama concurred with Allen’s plan. That allowed both parties to get what they wanted: White House officials could say that the decision to remove 34,000 troops was in line with Allen’s recommendation, while the general could remain close to his initial withdrawal target.

Allen, a native of Warrenton, was the first Marine to serve as the commandant of midshipmen at the Naval Academy. He spent two years in Iraq’s Anbar province, where he led an effort to reach out to Sunni tribal leaders to try to persuade them to stand against al-Qaeda militants — a shift that helped turn the course of the war in western Iraq.

Allen informed Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta several weeks ago that his wife’s condition might lead him to decline the Europe nomination, but Allen said he did not come to a final decision until the past few days.

His command responsibilities and other military assignments have kept him away from home for much of the past decade. He had only a week of leave between his Iraq and Central Command jobs and only a week off before he went to Afghanistan, much of which was spent moving and preparing for his confirmation hearing. He said he and his wife have not had a vacation since their daughters were young.

“All I am seeking now is time with Kathy,” he said. “I want to be home on a regular basis.”

Dear colleagues,

The recent news about the FBI’s seizure of the phone and email records of Fox News employees, including James Rosen, calls into question whether the federal government is meeting its constitutional obligation to preserve and protect a free press in the United States. We reject the government’s efforts to criminalize the pursuit of investigative journalism and falsely characterize a Fox News reporter to a Federal judge as a “co-conspirator” in a crime. I know how concerned you are because so many of you have asked me: why should the government make me afraid to use a work phone or email account to gather news or even call a friend or family member? Well, they shouldn’t have done it. The administration’s attempt to intimidate Fox News and its employees will not succeed and their excuses will stand neither the test of law, the test of decency, nor the test of time. We will not allow a climate of press intimidation, unseen since the McCarthy era, to frighten any of us away from the truth.

I am proud of your tireless effort to report the news over the last 17 years. I stand with you, I support you and I thank you for your reporting with courageous optimism. Too many Americans fought and died to protect our unique American right of press freedom. We can’t and we won’t forget that. To be an American journalist is not only a great responsibility, but also a great honor. To be a Fox journalist is a high honor, not a high crime. Even this memo of support will cause some to demonize us and try to find irrelevant things to cause us to waver. We will not waver.

As Fox News employees, we sometimes are forced to stand alone, but even then when we know we are reporting what is true and what is right, we stand proud and fearless. Thank you for your hard work and all your efforts.

Sincerely,

Roger Ailes

Obama “received a detailed review of a range of potential options he had requested be prepared for the United States and the international community to respond to the use of chemical weapons,” his press office said.

Senior aides have publicly ruled out sending American troops into Syria or establishing a “no-fly” zone over pockets of the country – but the use of force,potentially missile strikes from ships or airplanes outside Syrian territory -- were very much on the table.

“We have a range of options available, and we are going to act very deliberately so that we're making decisions consistent with our national interest as well as our assessment of what can advance our objectives in Syria,” a White House official told reporters by email before the meeting.

“In coordination with international partners and mindful of the dozens of contemporaneous witness accounts and record of the symptoms of those killed, the U.S. intelligence community continues to gather facts to ascertain what occurred,” the White House said after the meeting.

Rebels fighting to oust Bashar Assad have charged that more than 1,300 people, many of them children, were killed this week by the regime.

Assad's government has denied responsibility, and countered that the rebels themselves were behind it. On Saturday, it also warned the United States against military action, saying that would send a “ball of fire” through the Middle East.

The White House meeting participants, either in person or via secure communications, included Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, National Security Advisor Susan Rice, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey.

Story continues

It also included U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, Deputy Attorney General James Cole, Deputy National Security Advisor Antony Blinken, Homeland Security and Counterterrorism advisor Lisa Monaco, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications Benjamin Rhodes and Biden National Security Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Why so many lawyers? Obama has emphasized the need to act in a way that does not violate international law.

The president also spoke to British Prime Minister David Cameron.

""The president and prime minister will continue to consult closely regarding this incident, as well as possible responses by the international community to the use of chemical weapons,"" the White House said. ""The United States and UK stand united in our opposition to the use of chemical weapons.""

Obama and Hagel have publicly said that America’s response will come soon.

“I think the international community is moving swiftly, first, in getting the facts, what did happen, and getting the intelligence right, and all the other factors that go into a decision that I believe will be made swiftly, should be made swiftly,” Hagel told reporters aboard his plane on the way to Malaysia.

“If, in fact, this was a deliberate use and attack by the Syrian government on its own people using chemical weapons, there may be another attack coming,” Hagel said.

Obama signaled an escalation of the U.S. role in Syria in a CNN interview aired Friday , noting that confirmation of a mass chemical weapons attack would threaten “core national interests” of the United States. At the same time, the president and other senior officials have repeatedly said that they are mindful of the potential downsides of any military action, including getting pulled into a deeper role and stoking anti-U.S. sentiment in the region.

Meanwhile, top military officers from the United States, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Britain and France were set to meet in Jordan in the coming days. A White House official called it a “regularly occurring, long-planned conference.”"

Two U.S. senators say Dzhokar Tsarnaev should be questioned without a lawyer

Federal terrorism charges against Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev could be filed soon, even as he remains hospitalized, a Justice Department official told CNN on Saturday. The 19-year-old could also face murder charges at the state level.

At the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where Tsarnaev was in serious condition while being held in federal custody, federal prosecutors were formulating the charges.

The development came amid questions as to what's next for the suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings.

""There are still many unanswered questions,"" Obama said Friday night. ""Why did these young men who grew up and studied here as part of our communities and our country resort to such violence? How did they plan and carry out these attacks? And did they receive any help? The families of those killed so senselessly deserve answers.""

Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are accused of setting off bombs at the marathon Monday, killing three people and wounding more than 170.

On Thursday night, they allegedly killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer before the older brother was killed during a shootout with police.

Dzhokar Tsarnaev was captured Friday night after he was found hiding in a boat in a backyard in Watertown, Massachusetts.

When will the suspect be in court?

Tsarnaev could be in a courtroom for an arraignment soon.

Ordinarily at an arraignment, the suspect is provided a lawyer, and the defense and prosecution try to make a case for whether he should be released on bail.

""He will not get bail obviously,"" said senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.

""They will set a preliminary hearing that could happen in the next 30 days. He will be indicted with the grand jury. And that's when the case will begin.""

After the charges are filed, the Federal Public Defender Office in Boston will be appointed to represent Tsarnaev, according to Miriam Conrad, the federal public defender for the Massachusetts district.

Should bomber suspect be questioned without a lawyer?

For now, the government is invoking the public safety exception, a designation that allows investigators to question Tsarnaev without reading him his Miranda rights, a Justice Department official told CNN on condition of anonymity.

In ordinary cases, a suspect is told by police he has the right to remain silent and he has the right to a lawyer.

But this is not an ordinary case, say U.S. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham.

They urged that Tsarnaev be held as an ""enemy combatant,"" a designation that allows a suspect to be questioned without a lawyer and without being informed of his Miranda rights.

""Now that the suspect is in custody, the last thing we should want is for him to remain silent. It is absolutely vital the suspect be questioned for intelligence gathering purposes,"" the senators said. ""Under the law of war we can hold this suspect as a potential enemy combatant not entitled to Miranda warnings or the appointment of counsel.""

But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Saturday that the suspect should not be held as an enemy combatant.

""I am not aware of any evidence so far that the Boston suspect is part of any organized group, let alone al Qaeda, the Taliban, or one of their affiliates -- the only organizations whose members are subject to detention under the Authorization for Use of Military Force, as it has been consistently interpreted by all three branches of our government,"" he said.

""In the absence of such evidence I know of no legal basis for his detention as an enemy combatant. To hold the suspect as an enemy combatant under these circumstances would be contrary to our laws and may even jeopardize our efforts to prosecute him for his crimes.""

Alan Dershowitz, a prominent defense attorney and Harvard law professor, scoffed at the Republican senators' statement.

""Impossible. There's no way an American citizen committing a domestic crime in the city of Boston could be tried as an enemy combatant,"" he told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""It could never happen. And that shows absolute ignorance of the law.""

Dershowitz also said statements made by police in Boston seems to contradict the government's reasons for invoking the public safety exception.

""The police have said there's no public safety issue; it's solved, it's over,"" Dershowitz said. ""There are no further threats. But the FBI is saying there's enough further threats to justify an exception.""

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said the federal government may have known about international threats about which state officials were not aware.

""You would have to know the internals of what they have before you can assess whether there is a sensible invocation or not,"" Giuliani said.

If the government had prior knowledge of Tsarnaev's activities, it hasn't disclosed it. It did say that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been on the FBI's radar in the past

FBI agents interviewed Tamerlan two years ago and also looked at his travel history, checked databases for derogatory information and searched for Web postings. The agency found no connection with terror groups, an FBI official told CNN.

Two key Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee -- Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas, the panel's chairman; and Rep. Peter King of New York -- will press the Obama administration for details about the FBI's questioning of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, according to a GOP congressional source.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was not a U.S. citizen, traveled to Sheremetyevo, Russia, in January 2012, according to travel records provided by a U.S. official. He returned six months later.

Federal or state trial?

Dershowitz said there are many arguments that can be made to try the case in state court. It may be hard for a prosecutor to prove which crimes were committed by Tsarnaev or his older brother, Dershowitz said.

""If he says my intent was to please my brother, they could raise the question of federal jurisdiction,"" Dershowitz said.

This fight over federal or state jurisdiction could mean life or death.

Massachusetts does not have the death penalty.

There's another big question: The National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 requires temporary military custody of certain terrorist suspects, but Dzhokar Tsarnaev is a U.S. citizen, and the act doesn't apply to Americans.

What is the reaction in the suspects' homeland?

Tsarnaev's family lives in the Russian republic of Dagestan, which is next to the suspects' homeland of Chechnya, located in the North Caucasus region of southern Russia.

Russia's investigative committee in Dagestan said it will not engage with the Tsarnaev family unless there is ""an order from above"" to do so, spokesman Rasul Temerbekov told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Saturday.

A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said Saturday that Russia wants to get official information from the United States about the bombing suspects, and he wants there to be contact between investigators in both countries."

Hong Kong Police Commissioner%3A The case will be dealt with according to the law

It is not known if the U.S. government has made a formal extradition request to Hong Kong

Hong Kong legislators said Saturday that the Chinese government should make final decision on extradition

Federal authorities have charged a former defense contractor with espionage and theft in connection with the disclosure of details about two secret surveillance programs managed by the National Security Agency, a government official confirmed Friday.

The official, who is not authorized to comment publicly, confirmed that the charges against Edward Snowden were filed in a sealed complaint released late today and that authorities were seeking the cooperation of Hong Kong officials to assist in his detention.

It is not known if the U.S. government has made a formal extradition request to Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong government had no immediate reaction to the charges against Snowden. Police Commissioner, Andy Tsang, when was asked about the development, told reporters only that the case would be dealt with according to the law, AP reports.

The charges against Snowden were first reported Friday by The Washington Post.

Snowden, who turned 30 on Friday, has been the focus of a criminal investigation since he acknowledged to the Post and the Guardian newspapers earlier this month that he was the source of materials detailing surveillance programs that collected telephone records for millions of Americans and a separate operation that targeted the Internet communications of non-citizens abroad who were suspected of terrorist connections.

The news came hours after the Guardianreported that Britain's GCHQ spy agency had secretly tapped into the fiber-optic cables that carry the world's phone calls and Internet traffic and is sharing information with the NSA.

Snowden, who was employed by Booz Allen Hamilton as an NSA systems analyst in Hawaii, fled to the Chinese territory last month with top-secret documents and court orders on government surveillance operations.

The one-page complaint -- marked ""UNDER SEAL"" -- was filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, which the Post said has ""a long track record in prosecuting cases with national security implications.""

The formal charges, which were filed June 14, are unauthorized communication of national defense information; willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person; and theft of government property.

The espionage charge carries a maximum prison term of 10 years.

The United States has an extradition treaty with Hong Kong, and Snowden could fight extradition if he is arrested. But, as the Post pointed out, the treaty has an exception for political offenses, and espionage ""has traditionally been treated as a political offense.""

The Post writes:

Snowden's defense team in Hong Kong is likely to invoke part of the extradition treaty with the United States, which states that suspects will not be turned over to face criminal trial for offenses of a ""political character.""

Snowden could also remain in Hong Kong if the Chinese government decides that it is not in the defense or foreign policy interests of the government in Beijing to have him sent back to the United States for trial.

Snowden could also apply for asylum in Hong Kong or attempt to reach another jurisdiction and seek asylum there before the authorities in Hong Kong act.

Snowden told the Guardian that Hong Kong provided him the ""cultural and legal framework to allow me to work without being immediately detained.""

The British returned the former colony to China in 1997. Although it has own legal system, Hong Kong ultimately answers to the national leadership in Beijing.

According to AP. Hong Kong legislators said Saturday that the Chinese government should make the final decision on whether Snowden should be extradited to the United States

A prominent former politician in Hong Kong, Martin Lee, the founding chairman of the Democratic Party, said he doubted whether Beijing would intervene at this stage.

""Beijing would only intervene according to my understanding at the last stage. If the magistrate said there is enough to extradite, then Mr. Snowden can then appeal,"" he said.

Lee said Beijing could then decide at the end of the appeal process if it wanted Snowden extradited or not.

On Wednesday, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said that his organization was helping Snowden to try to broker asylum in Iceland because of the country's values, including protecting Internet freedom.

Were he to apply for asylum in Hong Kong, Snowden would not be given preferential treatment, an official with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees told the South China Morning Post.

Hong Kong's government and residents have been unsettled by Snowden's claims that since 2009 the NSA has been attacking computers belonging to Hong Kong officials, universities, businesses and students.

Hundreds turned out to protest the alleged surveillance, which the territory's leaders said last week they would be investigated.

""The government will follow up on any incidents related to the privacy or other rights of institutions or people in Hong Kong being violated,"" said C.Y. Leung, Hong Kong's chief executive.

President Obama to nominate ex-Pentagon official as Homeland Security secretary

Jeh Johnson served as Pentagon general counsel

Johnson must be confirmed by Senate

President Obama plans to nominate former Pentagon attorney Jeh Johnson as the next secretary of Homeland Security, a White House official said Thursday.

Johnson, general counsel for the Defense Department during Obama's first term, will be introduced by the president at a ceremony on Friday.

If confirmed by the Senate, Johnson would replace Janet Napolitano, who left the administration to run the University of California education system.

""The president is selecting Johnson because he is one of the most highly qualified and respected national security leaders, having served as the senior lawyer for the largest government agency in the world,"" the official said.

The official said that during his tenure at the Defense Department, Johnson exhibited ""sound judgment"" and provided ""prior legal review and approval of every military operation approved by the president and secretary of Defense.""

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because Obama has not yet made his public announcement.

Johnson would be the fourth head of the Department of Homeland Security, created in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

The White House official described Johnson as ""a critical member of the president's counterterrorism team,"" and someone who worked closely with Homeland Security officials during his years at the Pentagon.

His specialties include cybersecurity, the official said. He played a key role in repealing the Pentagon's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy that banned openly gay servicemembers.

Johnson, who left his Pentagon post in 2012, also provided legal guidance in the use of unmanned drones against terrorism suspects overseas, and in the use of military commissions — rather than civilian courts — to try suspects.

The Homeland Security nominee also led a crackdown on unauthorized news leaks at the Defense Department, including a warning to a former Navy SEAL who wrote a book about the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden.

During a speech at Britain's Oxford University last year, Johnson said that the nation's war on terrorism should not be endless, and the focus should shift to law enforcement and intelligence operations.

""War must be regarded as a finite, extraordinary and unnatural state of affairs,"" Johnson said. ""In its 12th year, we must not accept the current conflict, and all that it entails, as the new normal.""

These and other subjects could well surface at a Senate confirmation hearing.

Elisa Massimino, president of Human Rights First, said Johnson ""grappled with the challenges of protecting national security while respecting human rights and upholding American ideals"" during his time at the Pentagon.

""These are key issues in the Department of Homeland Security, and we would welcome the opportunity to work with him should he be confirmed to lead DHS,"" she said in a statement.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., criticized Obama for nominating a ""loyalist and fundraiser"" to lead what he called a ""mismanaged"" department.

""This is deeply concerning,"" Sessions said. ""This huge department must have a proven manager with strong relevant law enforcement experience, recognized independence and integrity, who can restore this department to its full capability.""

An early political supporter of Obama, Johnson — a native of Wappingers Falls, N.Y. — also served as general counsel to the Air Force during President Clinton's administration.

Kerry arrived in Beijing on Saturday in hopes of turning the Chinese government’s obvious frustration with North Korea’s nuclear program into decisive action.

Kerry’s debut trip to East Asia as secretary has been shadowed by ominous threats from North Korea of nuclear attacks against the U.S. mainland and Washington’s allies in the region.

The Chinese have been unusually vocal in their condemnation of their old communist ally, with many prominent scholars saying it is time to cut the ties forged by Mao Tse-tung back in the Cold War era.

Touching down in Seoul on Friday afternoon, Kerry met with South Korea’s new president, Park Geun-hye, and Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se. Despite some tough talk directed at North Korea, the tone was more conciliatory than in recent weeks, with Kerry and the South Koreans suggesting there was an opening for the government in Pyongyang to return to negotiations over its nuclear program.

“The real goal should not be reinforcing the fact that we will defend our allies, which we will, but it should be emphasizing for everybody the possibilities of peace, the possibilities of reunification, the possibilities of a very different future for the people of the Republic of Korea and ultimately North Korea,” Kerry said, referring to South Korea by its official name.

As Kerry spoke, U.S. and South Korean intelligence were reporting that North Korea had moved as many as five missiles into launch position on its east coast. The most worrisome of them is a new medium-range missile known as the Musudan, which could potentially reach Guam and U.S. bases in Japan.

North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, the world’s youngest head of state at age 30, is hosting festivities this weekend for the April 15 birthday of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, the nation’s founder. Analysts believe that the missile tests could be timed for the birthday, which is a major public holiday in North Korea.

“It is a huge mistake for him to choose to do that [a missile test] because it would further isolate his country and further isolate his people, who are frankly desperate for food, not missiles,” Kerry said in Seoul.

After weeks of joint military exercises by the U.S. and South Korea, including mock bombing by B-52s and stealth aircraft, there has been an effort to mute the drumbeats of war.

South Korea’s Park was quoted by her aides Friday as saying she was willing to “listen to what North Korea thinks.” Earlier this week, she suggested talks to salvage a jointly run industrial park in Kaesong, just north of the demilitarized zone, which had been a showpiece of inter-Korean cooperation before the North pulled all its workers. Yun, the foreign minister, also said South Korea was open to resuming humanitarian aid to its chronically famished neighbor.

Previous North Korea crises exposed rifts between the United States and South Korea, particularly during the George W. Bush administration, but this time the alliance is holding strong, foreign policy analysts say.

“We are pretty much in agreement about how to deal with them,” said Han Sung-joo, a former South Korean ambassador to Washington. “Together we have a strong defense, but if North Korea shows a change of attitude, both the United States and the Republic of Korea are willing to talk to them.”

The Chinese also have also moved measurably closer to the U.S., South Korea and Japan in condemning North Korea’s belligerence. A poll in Saturday’s Global Times, a Communist Party newspaper, said that 33.9% of Chinese living near the Korean border were afraid of war breaking out. State media has shown images of schoolchildren participating in air raid drills.

But U.S. policymakers want China to be more proactive in using its considerable economic leverage against Pyongyang. North Korea receives most of its fuel oil and consumer goods from China, and trading companies linked to the Pyongyang leadership keep funds in Chinese banks.

Like South Korea, China has a new leader, Xi Jinping, the general-secretary of the Communist Party who was elevated to the presidency last month. Assessing his views of Pyongyang will be a key element of Kerry’s brief visit here.

Kerry travels to Japan on Sunday.

County Sheriff S Department.']",Officials call for probe of sale of bulletproof vests,"Local officials Tuesday called for investigations into the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department funneling hundreds of bulletproof vests to Cambodia through the city of Gardena.

Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas requested an audit to determine whether officials violated the law in shipping the vests a decade ago to the Southeast Asian country. A Gardena official also said she would be asking for an investigation into her city being used as an intermediary for the unusual transaction.

The announcements Tuesday were prompted by a Times investigation published over the weekend that found that sheriff’s ballistic vests were shipped to Cambodia and not declared to customs officials, as required by federal law. Instead, they were stuffed inside one of a number of patrol cars that the Sheriff’s Department was shipping directly to Cambodia, avoiding the rigorous vetting process the U.S. government requires to prevent body armor from getting into the wrong hands abroad.

Sheriff’s media representatives gave The Times differing accounts about the transaction, initially denying any sheriff’s officials were involved in sending the vests to Cambodia, then offering explanations contradicted by records and interviews. The officials involved in the transaction refused to discuss it.

“Federal, state and local statutory, legal and policy violations may have occurred with these transactions,” read a motion by Ridley-Thomas.

Gardena Mayor Pro Tem Rachel Johnson said she was troubled by the alleged role that the city’s mayor, Paul Tanaka, played in the sales. Tanaka is the second-in-command at the Sheriff’s Department.

She said she also wanted to know why her city manager approved the transaction. Records showed the city manager pledged under the penalty of perjury that the vests were intended for Gardena, despite later telling federal authorities he knew they would be diverted to Cambodia.

“I’m concerned about the appearance of a cover-up,” Johnson said in an interview with The Times.

It is not unusual for U.S. law enforcement agencies to donate used or obsolete equipment to other departments, including foreign ones. But in this case, the vests were shipped using an intermediary and were not declared on their way out of the country. The vests were ostensibly sold to Gardena, but were never claimed by the city before being shipped to Cambodia.

The U.S. Customs Service launched an investigation into the sale of the vests in 2002, and federal agents were told that the transactions were coordinated by Tanaka, according to records obtained by The Times. A sheriff’s spokesman called Tanaka’s role minimal, saying it was a former undersheriff who called the Gardena city manager to coordinate the sales.

Advertisement

Customs agents decided not to seek criminal charges, concluding that there wasn’t enough evidence to show that anyone involved in the transactions knew the relevant export laws. One expert told The Times that that rationale was “curious” because authorities don’t have to prove knowledge of the law to press charges.

After closing the case, federal authorities referred the matter to sheriff’s investigators, but the department did not conduct its own investigation. But a sheriff’s spokesman said the department did nothing wrong and sent the vests through Gardena because they were under the mistaken impression that county rules prevented them from dealing directly with foreign nations. Prompted by The Times’ inquiry, Sheriff Lee Baca asked the county auditor-controller’s office to examine the sale, and Baca’s spokesman called that review “a complete vindication.” But Baca only told the auditor-controller that the vests were sold to Gardena, not that Gardena was a go-between to get the vests to Cambodia.

Advertisement

The audit Ridley-Thomas proposed would include that, and determine if any sheriff’s or Gardena officials committed “any fraudulent or illegal activity.” If his motion is approved and the audit is launched, the final report would be forwarded to county and federal prosecutors for further action.

Johnson, who is running to replace Tanaka as mayor of Gardena, said she was a city clerk at the time of the transactions and never knew about them. “I’m very disappointed that [Tanaka] has involved our city manager, our city resources in these questionable practices,” she said.

Sheriff’s spokesman Steve Whitmore said that both Baca and Tanaka do not object to the new probes: “Don’t forget this has been looked at by the feds and they said nothing was wrong.”

In addition, a majority lacks trust in the federal government, and an increasing number of people say it’s too big.

These are just some of the findings of a Fox News poll released Wednesday.

Sixty-two percent of voters say the government secretly collecting the phone records of millions of Americans is an “unacceptable and alarming invasion of privacy rights.”

That’s nearly twice as many as think it’s an “acceptable government action to help prevent terrorism” (32 percent).

Republicans (by 74-18 percent) and independents (by 67-26 percent) think the NSA surveillance of Americans is unacceptable. Democrats split: 48 percent say it’s acceptable, while 46 percent say unacceptable.

Views are similar on the U.S. Department of Justice monitoring certain reporters as part of its leak investigation. By a 34 percentage-point margin, more voters think the government’s seizure of journalists’ records was mainly done for political reasons (63 percent) as opposed to national security reasons (29 percent).

The Justice Department secretly obtained phone records and emails from some news organizations that had broken stories based on government leaks.

In general, when asked how much “trust and confidence” they have in the federal government, 37 percent of voters say they have a great deal (5 percent) or a fair amount (32 percent). Sixty-three percent say they have not much confidence (41 percent) or none at all (22 percent).

Meanwhile, the portion of voters saying the federal government is too big is growing: 64 percent feel that way, up from 56 percent in 2009. That’s more than double the number who feel government is the right size (29 percent).

The NSA and Justice Department programs have more voters thinking the president has broken his promise to lead “the most open and transparent administration ever.”

The poll finds 35 percent think the Obama administration has been less open and transparent than previous administrations. That’s up 10 points since last year when 25 percent felt that way (June 2012). The change comes mainly from an increase in the number of Republicans (+16 points) and independents (+14 points) saying the White House is less transparent.

At the same time the number of voters believing the administration is more open and transparent has dropped to 24 percent down from 32 percent a year ago. This shift comes more from an across-the-board decline, as fewer independents (-14 points), Democrats (-8 points) and Republicans (-6 points) say this White House is more open than others.

The largest portion of voters -- 39 percent -- says the transparency of this White House is about the same as previous administrations. And that’s unchanged from 39 percent last June.

There is good news in the poll on the economy: 18 percent of voters say the economy is in excellent or good shape, which is double the 9 percent who felt that way in January.

In addition, the number saying the country is in a recession has dropped 14 points: 27 percent today, down from 41 percent a year ago (June 2012).

Those numbers, however, haven’t boosted President Obama’s job performance rating.

Obama’s current 44 percent approval rating is the lowest he’s received in more than a year. Some 45 percent of voters approved last month and 47 percent approved in January.

Opinions are split over whether Obama is honest and trustworthy as equal numbers -- 48 percent -- say yes and no. In May, 49 percent of voters said Obama was honest, and 51 percent said so last year (July 2012). His highest honesty rating was 73 percent in April 2009.

The Fox News poll is based on landline and cell phone interviews with 1,019 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from June 9 to June 11. The full poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points."

They were likely not right-wing Americans, as some on the left had predicted and hoped.

We do not yet know whether they are part of a larger cell or whether these attacks were directed from abroad versus being exclusively the idea of these two terrorist brothers. Experts note that on one hand terrorist groups have put information on the Internet on how to make the specific types of bombs used in the attack, but also say it is very possible these brothers also received terrorist training overseas. We may learn the answers to these questions in coming days.

Either way, it’s disconcerting that the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) was “sharing intel“ with authorities in the investigation of this bombing. SPLC is the ultra-left group that has a habit of demonizing conservative organizations as “domestic hate groups,” but has now been linked in federal court to a convicted terrorist. Even some outspoken liberals take issue with the SPLC’s outrageous bias, saying SPLC is “essentially a fraud.”

Recently, a U.S. army officer used SPLC’s material to say the military should watch out for soldiers thought to support various Christian organizations targeted by the SPLC, as well as immigration-reform groups (suggesting they’re “anti-Muslim”) and Tea Party groups.

It’s critically important to recognize that there are countless peaceful and patriotic Muslim Americans, and they must not be lumped in with terrorists. But given our history, it’s not “anti-Muslim” to note when a terrorist is Muslim and motivated by fanatical religious beliefs.

The Obama administration’s decision to prosecute the Ft. Hood shooter, Maj. Nadal Hasan, as a perpetrator of “workplace violence” instead of a terrorist attack–while refusing to give military honors, such as Purple Hearts to those shot by Hasan–showcases a profoundly disturbing political correctness that has no place in national security circles.

As the recent sentencing of convicted terrorist Floyd Corkins, who confessed that he planned his terrorist attack based on information provided by SPLC, approaches on Apr. 29, it is increasingly important that no law enforcement agency lends any credibility to the SPLC. Its partisan agenda focuses so much energy going after conservatives and Christians instead of real terrorists.

USA TODAY

Capt. William Swenson is the second Medal of Honor recipient from September 2009 battle

Swenson is sixth living recipient of military%27s highest honor

Swenson was critical of delay in getting close air support to troops in battle

An earlier version of this story misstated the number of times that multiple surviving U.S. servicemembers have received the Medal of Honor for heroics in the same battle over the last 50 years. It has happened three times.

WASHINGTON — President Obama took a break from dealing with the fiscal crisis on Tuesday to award former Army captain William Swenson the Medal of Honor, making him the first Army officer to receive the military's highest honor since Vietnam.

Obama suggested that Washington could learn from Swenson, as he briefly reflected during the ceremony on the ongoing government shutdown and the precipice of default if Congress doesn't raise the nation's $16.7 trillion debt ceiling.

""At moments like this, Americans like Will remind us what our country can be at its best — a nation of citizens who look out for one another, who meet our obligations to one another not just when its easy but also when it is hard,"" Obama said. ""Will, you are an example to everyone in this city and to our whole country of the professionalism and patriotism we should strive for if we wear a uniform or not.""

Swenson became sixth living recipient of the honor from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was honored for his heroics in Afghanistan's Ganjgal Valley, where he was helping lead a column of American soldiers and Marines, and their Afghan counterparts, to meet a group of village elders. Swenson and his team were ambushed by some 60 well-armed Taliban fighters.

The American troops would face a barrage of rocket-propelled grenade, mortar and machine gun fire. Swenson would quickly coordinate a response of fire, while calling in artillery and aviation support, but the U.S. forces would become surrounded on three sides by the enemy. An hour into the fight communication with lead elements was lost.

At one point in the chaos, Swenson coordinated helicopter support, returning fire on the enemy and treating a critically wounded comrade, Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth Westbrook.

Obama remarked about combat video from the helicopter that came to evacuate Westbrook, which showed Swenson emerge from a cloud of dust. The video, which the Army released last month, captures Swenson in a ""simple act of compassion and loyalty"" to his wounded comrade, Obama said.

""He helps carry that wounded soldier to the helicopter and helps place him inside and then in the midst the whipping wind and deafening roar he does something unexpected,"" Obama said. ""He leans in and kisses the wounded soldier on the head.""

Swenson and the Americans would fight for at least six hours and took more casualties and were even denied artillery fire and air support, but they never relented as Swenson led the recovery of the dead and wounded, Obama said.

The recognition of Swenson for his gallantry marks only the third time in the last 50 years that at least two surviving American servicemembers have received the Medal of Honor for actions in the same battle.

In 2011, Dakota Meyer, a Marine sergeant who also is now a civilian, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in that Sept. 8, 2009, battle in Afghanistan.

Swenson's medal comes with some controversy. Some, including Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., questioned whether the Defense Department purposely slow walked approval of the high honor. During an internal investigation of what happened at Ganjgal battle, Swenson expressed dismay that his repeated calls for close air support were denied.

The Army later acknowledged that close air support was improperly denied, and two Army officers who were at the combat operations center when the calls came in received reprimands.

Meyer told the Marine Corps Times before he was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2011 that it was ""ridiculous"" Swenson already hadn't received some form of valor award.

""I'll put it this way,"" Meyer said of Swenson. ""If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be alive today.""

In brief remarks to reporters following the ceremony, Swenson said the honor belongs not just to him, but all those who fought beside him.

""This award was earned with a team, a team of our finest,"" Swenson said. ""This medal represents them; it represents us.""

http://news.yahoo.com/texas-actress-charged-obama-ricin-threat-230606198.html,,[],Texas actress charged in Obama ricin threat,"TEXARKANA, Texas (AP) — A pregnant Texas actress who first told the FBI that her husband sent ricin-tainted letters to President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, then allegedly said she sent them because her husband ""made her"" do it, was charged Friday with threatening the president.

Shannon Guess Richardson, 35, appeared in a Texarkana courtroom after being charged with mailing a threatening communication to the president. The federal charge carries up to 10 years in prison, U.S. attorney's office spokeswoman Davilyn Walston said.

Richardson, a mother of five who has played bit roles on television and in movies, was arrested earlier Friday for allegedly mailing the ricin-laced letters last month to the White House, Bloomberg and the mayor's Washington gun-control group. The letters — which authorities determined were mailed from Richardson's hometown of New Boston or nearby Texarkana and postmarked in Shreveport, La. — threatened violence against gun-control advocates, authorities said.

However, Richardson's court-appointed attorney, Tonda Curry, said there was no intention to harm anyone. She noted that it's common knowledge that the mail is checked before it reaches the person to whom these letters were addressed.

""From what I can say, based on what evidence I've seen, whoever did this crime never intended for ricin to reach the people to which the letters were addressed,"" said Curry.

Curry said she has met with Richardson only briefly and has had no extensive talks with her.

According to an FBI affidavit, Richardson contacted authorities on May 30 to implicate her estranged husband, Nathaniel Richardson. She later failed a polygraph test, and investigators looking into her story found numerous inconsistencies, the document said.

Among the inconsistencies: Nathaniel Richardson would have been at work at a time when Internet searches tied to the letters were made on the couple's laptop and at the time they were postmarked.

Story continues

During an interview with authorities Thursday, Shannon Richardson admitted mailing the letters knowing they contained ricin, but she said her husband had typed them and made her print and send them, the affidavit said.

No charges have been filed against Nathaniel Richardson. His attorney, John Delk, told The Associated Press Friday that his client was pleased with his wife's arrest and was working with authorities to prove his innocence.

Delk said he wasn't anticipating that Nathanial Richardson would be arrested. ""But until I'm sure they're not looking at him being involved, I can't say much more,"" he said.

Delk previously told the AP that the couple is going through a divorce and that the 33-year-old Army veteran may have been ""set up"" by his wife.

FBI agents wearing hazardous material suits were seen going in and out of the Richardsons' house on Wednesday in nearby New Boston, about 150 miles northeast of Dallas near the Arkansas and Oklahoma borders. Authorities conducted a similar search on May 31.

The house is now under quarantine for ""environmental or toxic agents,"" according to a posting at the residence. Multiple samples taken from the couples' home tested positive for ricin, according to the affidavit. Federal agents also found castor beans — the key ingredient in ricin — along with syringes and other items that could be used to extract the lethal poison, the affidavit says.

Bloomberg issued a statement Friday thanking local and federal law enforcement agencies ""for their outstanding work in apprehending a suspect,"" saying they worked collaboratively from the outset ""and will continue to do so as the investigation continues.""

Shannon Richardson appears in movies and on TV under the name Shannon Guess. Her resume on the Internet movie database IMDb said she has had small television roles in ""The Vampire Diaries"" and ""The Walking Dead."" She had a minor role in the movie ""The Blind Side"" and appeared in an Avis commercial, according to the resume.

She was seen leaving a Texarkana hospital on Friday shortly before the court hearing. A hospital spokeswoman didn't return a phone message seeking comment. Curry, her attorney, said she was taken to the hospital because it's federal marshals' standard procedure to have pregnant prisoners examined by doctors.

She also said it's her understanding that authorities have no intention of arresting Nathaniel Richardson at this point.

Delk said the Richardsons were expecting their first child in October. Shannon Richardson also has five children ranging in age from 4 to 19 from other relationships, four of whom had been living with the couple in the New Boston home, the attorney said.

Nathaniel Richardson works as a mechanic at the Red River Army Depot in Texarkana, Texas, a facility that repairs tanks, Humvees and other mobile military equipment. He and Shannon were married in October 2011.

According to court records, Shannon Richardson is in federal custody. The government is requesting that she be held without bond, and a detention hearing is scheduled for next Friday, the records show.

The FBI is investigating at least three cases over the past two months in which ricin was mailed to Obama and other public figures. Ricin has been sent to officials sporadically over the years, but experts say that there seems to be a recent uptick and that copycat attacks — made possible by the relative ease of extracting the poison — may be the reason.

If inhaled, ricin can cause respiratory failure, among other symptoms. If swallowed, it can shut down the liver and other organs, resulting in death. The amount of ricin that can fit on the head of a pin is said to be enough to kill an adult if properly prepared. No antidote is available, though researchers are trying to develop one.

prev Image 2 of 2

In the backyard of his remote Southern California home, Bernie Jones is etching an unconventional blueprint: a construction plan to build his underground survival shelter. It won't be the typical, cramped Cold War-era bunker. It will hold 20 people.

Part of a small but vocal group of survivalists in Menifee, some 80 miles east of Los Angeles, Jones, 46, has pushed for the right to build a bunker on his 1-acre property for nearly a year. He wants to be ready for anything, be it natural disaster or a nuclear attack.

""The world is taking a change,"" he says. ""I want to be prepared. I want my family to survive.""

Residents of the small city once known for its farming and mining can begin applying for permits to build their subterranean housing this month after the City Council passed a hotly contested ordinance allowing the practice.

Americans have been building underground bunkers for decades, their interest in such shelters waxing and waning with current events. Many dug backyard fallout shelters during the Cold War, fearing a nuclear war.

More On This... Bunker Mentality: The booming business of Doomsday

This next generation of bunkers comes as many survivalists face heightened concerns of a terrorist attack, economic meltdown and for some, even solar flares or meteor showers.

""The bunker is a type of security blanket,"" says Stephen O'Leary, an expert in apocalyptic and end-of-the-world theories at the University of Southern California. ""They are concerned with what's happening in the world on a massive scale.""

The move to allow below-ground bunkers has created waves among city officials who are concerned with earthquake faults in the area, safety of police and first responders answering emergency calls and the potential for owners to hide criminal activity, such as drug manufacturing.

""Most people are going to use their bunkers for good reason, but you do have some sick people out there,"" Deputy Mayor Wallace Edgerton says. ""Children have been held in bunkers.""

Last February, a 5-year-old boy was held hostage for six days in an Alabama underground bunker, which was rigged with explosive devices.

City Councilman Tom Fuhrman calls the ordinance a victory for property rights, not for those looking to break the law. ""Criminal activity isn't going to be stopped by not allowing people to build bunkers,"" Fuhrman says. ""A criminal will find a place to commit crime.""

There are signs survival bunkers are making a comeback throughout the country.

Ronald Hubbard, who runs Atlas Survival Shelters near Los Angeles, ships his luxury bunkers out of state. Unlike Cold War-era shelters, he builds ones that are half the length of a basketball court and have a master bedroom, dining nook and a couch to watch a 47-inch flat screen TV.

Hubbard says his phones rang nonstop last December as people attempted to prepare for the end of the world that never came. A 5,125-year cycle in the Mayan calendar passed by, sans disaster.

The Perseid meteors soaring through the sky last month had customers calling him constantly, looking for a way to stay safe in case one hit Earth — even though it's an annual celestial event. He insists his customers are practical people — not radical doomsday preppers.

""I'm not fear mongering,"" Hubbard said, standing beside a $65,000 shelter in his warehouse. ""Why do we buy insurance? Just in case.""

The Vivos shelter networks in Indiana and Kansas offer the equivalent of doomsday timeshares in underground communities in the event of the apocalypse. The network aims to protect its inhabitants for up to a year from myriad catastrophes, including a nuclear disaster.

Preppers — who dedicate their time to ensuring they are ready for a host of deadly scenarios — even have their own reality TV show.

People should spend time preparing for likely disasters instead of Armageddon, said Steve Davis, president of emergency management company All Hands Consulting.

""In California, you have earthquakes. On the East Coast, you have winter storms,"" Davis says. ""People should be focusing on basic preparedness.""

Jones, who has six children and seven grandchildren, says he simply wants to protect his loved ones. The contractor has already stocked his home with medical kits and enough food for his family to survive for about three months should a disaster strike.

He keeps a bag in his truck at all times, packed with five days' worth of food and water, a raincoat, a thermal and ""the world's smallest sleeping bag.""

""It's all part of being ready for whatever happens,"" Jones says."

He said that Russia believed in the importance of the relationship for ensuring regional and global security, but he shifted the onus to the Obama administration. “You cannot dance tango alone,” he said.

By late Thursday night, Mr. Snowden’s whereabouts remained unclear. He left the international transit zone at Sheremetyevo airport unexpectedly at 3:30 p.m. after his lawyer, Anatoly G.

Mr. Kucherena delivered him a passport-like document issued Wednesday and valid until July 31, 2014, granting him status as a “temporary refugee” in Russia.

Mr. Kucherena, in an interview, said he would not disclose Mr. Snowden’s whereabouts, though he expected that he could make a public appearance soon. “I cannot give out details,” he said in an interview.

WikiLeaks said that Mr. Snowden was accompanied by one of its representatives, Sarah Harrison, who appears to have remained with him since his flight began in Hong Kong in June. Mr. Kucherena said in television interviews that while he would continue to act as counsel, he was not involved in arrangements for Mr. Snowden’s housing in Russia.

Mr. Snowden, 30, could still decide to seek permanent asylum in another country. According to Mr. Kucherena, he has not officially applied for permanent political asylum in Russia and could simply remain until he is able to fly elsewhere, though the logistics of that have been complicated by intense pressure from the Obama administration on countries to block his transit."

Chuck Hagel should he get nominated for secretary of defense, while Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he is reserving judgment.

Texas Sen. John Cornyn had the most strident remarks, saying President Obama nominating Hagel sends “the worst possible message” to Israel and other U.S. allies in the Middle East.

“I will not support Chuck Hagel’s nomination,” Cornyn said in a release, citing in part Hagel’s views on Israel and his opposition to Iranian sanctions.

However, he did not say whether he would try to block Hagel’s potential nomination during a Senate confirmation hearing.

A congressional aide said Senate Democrats have been given a heads-up from the White House that Hagel's selection is imminent. And an administration official told Fox News the announcement will be made Monday.

Hagel, a decorated Vietnam combat veteran, would replace Pentagon chief Leon Panetta in Obama's second-term Cabinet.

Newly-elected Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told “Fox News Sunday” that “it is very difficult to imagine the circumstance in which I could support his confirmation.”

Cruz also cited Hagel’s views and statements about Israel and Iran and questioned why Obama might pick Hagel in the face of tough opposition.

“The president seems bound and determined to proceed down this path despite the fact that Hagel's record is very, very troubling on the nation of Israel,” Cruz told Fox. “I do think it is interesting that the president seems hell-bent on nominating him despite the fact that a number of prominent Republicans have criticized him and the Democratic senators have been surprisingly silent on it.”

Hagel said in 2006 that ""the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people"" on Capitol Hill, then added, ""I'm not an Israeli senator, I'm a United States senator.""

McConnell, R-Ky., said any defense nominee must have ""a full understanding of our close relationship with our Israeli allies, the Iranian threat and the importance of having a robust military.""

McConnell told ABC's ""This Week"" that Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who left the Senate in 2009, has ""certainly been outspoken in foreign policy and defense over the years. The question we will be answering, if he's the nominee, is do his views make sense for that particular job?""

McConnell said he would ""wait and see how the hearings go and see whether Chuck's views square with the job he would be nominated to do.""

He added: ""I'm going to take a look at all the things that Chuck has said over the years and review that, and in terms of his qualifications to lead our nation's military.""

Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that Hagel ""is a serious candidate if the president chooses to name him.""

Hagel has criticized discussion of a military strike by either the U.S. or Israel against Iran. He also has backed efforts to bring Iran to the table for talks on future peace in Afghanistan.

""This is a controversial pick,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told CNN. ""He is an antagonistic figure when it comes to the state of Israel. It's a signal you're sending to Iran at the worst possible time and to our allies.""

Officials close to the White House have talked up Hagel as a patriot who served in the military with distinction during Vietnam and someone who shares the president's skepticism about potential conflict with Iran and a large U.S. footprint in Afghanistan.

Liberals have expressed anger over an anti-gay remark Hagel made in the Clinton administration for which he recently apologized.

As hundreds of commuters emerged from Amtrak and commuter trains at Union Station on a recent morning, an armed squad of men and women dressed in bulletproof vests made their way through the crowds. The squad was not with the Washington police department or Amtrak’s police force, but was one of the Transportation Security Administration’s Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response squads—VIPR teams for short—assigned to perform random security sweeps to prevent terrorist attacks at transportation hubs across the United States.

The Transportation Security Administration has quietly expanded itsreach beyond airports:Included in those ""transportation hubs"" are highway weigh stations, train terminals, sporting events, music festivals and ... rodeos.

The debate is not an exact parallel to those of the Bush era, and Mr. Obama can point to ways he has tried to exorcise what he sees as the excesses of the last administration. But in broad terms, the conversation generated by the confirmation hearing of John O. Brennan, his nominee for C.I.A. director, underscored the degree to which Mr. Obama has embraced some of Mr. Bush’s approach to counterterrorism, right down to a secret legal memo authorizing presidential action unfettered by outside forces.

At the same time, a separate hearing in Congress revealed how far Mr. Obama has gone to avoid what he sees as Mr. Bush’s central mistake. Testimony indicated that the president had overruled his secretaries of state and defense and his military commanders when they advised arming rebels in Syria."

The bill largely has withstood the assaults of those who oppose it, including a union of federal immigration application officers, which announced their opposition Monday.

Senators have dispatched more than 100 amendments, turning back those that would derail the bipartisan compromise engineered by a group of eight senators and accepting others to potentially pick up broader support.

Convening for a fourth hearing Monday, the committee met for another day-long session, as rows of immigrants-rights activists and business representatives filled the Senate hearing room.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

One area of continued concern has been how to keep track of those immigrants who overstay their visas – a problem at the center of the illegal immigration debate.

Many senators have said they would like to see an exit visa system that relies on biometric controls, such as fingerprints, to screen immigrants as they leave the country. But efforts to immediately mandate such a system have been rejected as too cumbersome and, airlines argued, costly.

On Monday, the senators approved a compromise: A biometric exit visa system would be required at 10 of the nation’s 30 busiest international airports to screen visa holders before they board outbound flights. The system would need to be running within two years of the immigration bill becoming law and online for the rest of the airports within six years.

Opponents, including Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), pushed for a mandatory system at more airports.

Supporters, though, called it a good first step.

“I don’t look at this, Sen. Sessions, as a fig leaf; I look at it as a start,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) as she voted for the measure.

Sessions has led Republican opposition to the 844-page bill, and offered an amendment that would block the earned-income tax credit for those immigrants who apply for legal status. It was rejected.

The bill involves political and policy trade-offs that would beef up border security, launch a new guest-worker program and require employers to verify the legal status of all workers. In exchange, the estimated 11 million immigrants who entered the country illegally or overstayed visas would be offered a 13-year path to citizenship, after they pay fines, taxes and learn English.

Democrats have a majority on the 18-member Judiciary Committee and are expected to approve the bill with the help of two Republicans who were part of the bipartisan effort that drafted the legislation. A vote could come as soon as Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has indicated the full Senate would take up the bill once Congress returns from its break, in early June.

Federal prosecutors said brothers Eric and Ryan Jensen were arrested on misdemeanor charges of introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce. Each man faces six counts.

They pleaded not guilty in federal court and were released on unsecured bonds. Trial is scheduled for Dec. 2.

Prosecutors said the federal Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined the Jensens didn't adequately clean the cantaloupe.

Criminal charges in food poisoning cases are rare, said attorney William Marler, who represents many of the listeria victims in civil cases against Jensen Farms. Only four other people have faced such charges in the past decade, he said.

The FDA has said the melons likely were contaminated in Jensen Farms' packing house. It concluded that dirty water on a floor, and old, hard-to-clean equipment probably were to blame.

The epidemic was the deadliest outbreak of foodborne illness in 25 years, and it delivered a serious blow to Colorado cantaloupe farmers.

A number of lawsuits were filed by people who were sickened or who had a family member die after the outbreak.

Eric Jensen, 37, and Ryan Jensen, 33, could face up to six years in prison and up to $1.5 million in fines each if convicted of all counts against them, prosecutors said.

The Jensens' farm in southeastern Colorado filed for bankruptcy after the outbreak.

After Thursday's hearing, the men released a statement calling the outbreak a ""terrible accident"" and saying they were shocked and saddened by it. The statement said the charges do not imply they knew about the contamination, or that they should have known about it.

Jeff Dorschner, a spokesman for federal prosecutors, said the misdemeanor ""was the best, most serious charge we could find.""

Felony charges would have required prosecutors to show the contamination was intentional.

""The real significance of the case against the Jensens is they are being charged with misdemeanors, which do not require intent, just the fact that they shipped contaminated food using interstate commerce,"" Marler said.

Dorschner said prosecutors decided to pursue the case because so many people were affected.

""It was the magnitude of the number of people who were hospitalized and the number of people who died,"" he said. Prosecutors said people in 28 states ate the cantaloupe, and 147 people were hospitalized.

The illnesses quickly were linked to the Jensens' farm, with the FDA saying on Oct. 19, 2011, that the outbreak probably was caused by pools of water on the floor and old, hard-to-clean packing equipment there. The agency said contamination at the packing facility likely was to blame. Investigators found positive listeria samples on equipment and fruit there.

The FDA said Jensen Farms had recently purchased used equipment that was corroded and hard to clean. The agency said the way the cantaloupes were cooled after coming off the fields might also have contributed to listeria growth.

Asked why it took so long to file charges, Dorschner said officials needed time to develop the case.

The outbreak was a setback for farms in Colorado's revered Rocky Ford cantaloupe region, where hot, sunny days and cold nights produce fruit known for its distinct sweetness.

Jensen Farms was about 90 miles away from Rocky Ford, but the Jensens used the Rocky Ford name, and sales dropped across the region. Later, Rocky Ford farmers registered Rocky Ford Cantaloupe as a trademark, hired a full-time food safety manager and built a central packing operation where melons are washed and rinsed.

Tammie Palmer, whose husband, Charles, became ill after eating the cantaloupe, said she hopes the Jensens never return to farming.

The Palmers, represented by Marler, filed a lawsuit against Jensen Farms seeking $2 million. The suit was still pending when Charles Palmer died this year of cancer.

""I was hoping everything would be settled and I could do something with my husband, but that's not going to happen,"" she said."

Story highlights NEW: The Brazilian government does not plan to respond to open letter, an official says Snowden has agreed to testify via video to a European Parliament panel, sources say His open letter was posted online in two places, according to journalist Glenn Greenwald Snowden mentions the need for asylum

(CNN) —

National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden has written an “open letter to the people of Brazil” offering to help investigate U.S. surveillance of Brazilian citizens.

The letter was posted on the website pastebin and on the Facebook page of David Michael Miranda, partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald, according to a tweet from Greenwald.

In the letter, Snowden says he has told Brazilian lawmakers that he is willing to help investigate “suspected crimes against Brazilian citizens.”

“I have expressed my willingness to assist wherever appropriate and lawful, but unfortunately the United States government has worked very hard to limit my ability to do so – going so far as to force down the Presidential Plane of Evo Morales to prevent me from traveling to Latin America!

“Until a country grants permanent political asylum, the U.S. government will continue to interfere with my ability to speak.”

Morales challenges U.S. after Snowden rumor holds up plane

The Brazilian government does not plan to respond to Snowden’s letter, according to an official in the press office of the Foreign Ministry.

At this point, no new request for asylum has been received, so authorities also will have have no comment on speculation surrounding the possibility one could be forthcoming, the official said.

An initial request was received in July, but it was a letter sent not by Snowden himself, but by Amnesty International to several countries. Brazil said then that it was not going to respond to the generic letter.

Consternation in South America

Brazil has been in an uproar over reports of U.S. spying.

In September, Brazilian lawmakers said they planned to send a commission to Russia to speak with Snowden, who had allegedly leaked information about U.S. spying against the country’s president.

Foreign Minister Luiz Alberto Figueiredo called the situation “an inadmissible and unacceptable violation of Brazilian sovereignty.”

Last month, Brazil acknowledged its own past snooping. The newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo revealed that Brazil spied on foreign diplomats inside Brazil in 2003 and 2004. Its targets included officials from Russia, Iran and the United States.

“I see the situations as completely different,” Brazilian Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo told the paper.

Judge: NSA domestic phone data-mining unconstitutional

In his letter, Snowden, a former NSA contractor, writes, “Today, if you carry a cell phone in Sao Paolo, the NSA can and does keep track of your location: they do this 5 billion times a day to people around the world. When someone in Florianopolis visits a website, the NSA keeps a record of when it happened and what you did there. If a mother in Porto Alegre calls her son to wish him luck on his university exam, NSA can keep that call log for five years or more. They even keep track of who is having an affair or looking at pornography, in case they need to damage their target’s reputation.

Opinion: Who really broke the law, Snowden or the government?

“American Senators tell us that Brazil should not worry, because this is not ‘surveillance,’ it’s ‘data collection.’ They say it is done to keep you safe. They’re wrong. There is a huge difference between legal programs, legitimate spying, legitimate law enforcement – where individuals are targeted based on a reasonable, individualized suspicion – and these programs of dragnet mass surveillance that put entire populations under an all-seeing eye and save copies forever. These programs were never about terrorism: they’re about economic spying, social control, and diplomatic manipulation. They’re about power.”

Snowden to testify to panel of European Parliament

Snowden has agreed to testify, via teleconference, before a civil liberties committee of the European Parliament, sources in the Parliament say.

Some within the Parliament opposed the invitation, but the majority supported the idea, the sources said. The testimony may take place in January, they said.

It’s unsure whether Snowden would testify live or would be pre-recorded, the sources said, adding that his testimony is expected to cover all aspects of NSA surveillance internationally.

Movie stars aren’t expected to understand the intricacies of nuclear weapons policy, but the commander-in-chief should know better than to follow this path.

For decades, nuclear weapons have played a critical role in U.S. security, deterring potential aggressors from attacking our homeland and troops deployed abroad. Our allies have relied on has U.S. nuclear umbrella, as well. It’s been so effective—and so reliable—most of our allies have foregone developing nuclear weapons of their own.

[pullquote]

While “Demand Zero” may sound great on red carpets in Hollywood and Manhattan, it sure doesn’t ring true in Tokyo and Seoul. People living there know they face a real threat: nuclear-armed North Korea.

Pyongyang has repeatedly threatened to turn South Korea – and the United States – to “a sea of fire.” Kim Jong Eun already has ballistic missiles that can reach Japan and U.S. troops deployed throughout the region. The need for deterrence remains.

But President Obama has been hitting the Road to Zero for years.

In February 2011, his negotiating team signed off on the New START—a treaty with Russia that limits each nation to no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads.

For the U.S., that means reducing our nuclear arsenal by 250 warheads over a seven-year period.

For Russia, it means zero reductions; they don’t have that many strategic warheads… yet. (The treaty did, however, allow them to keep their 10-1 advantage over the U.S. in tactical nukes.)

Now, the president wants to cut deeper. In Germany, he proposed slashing the number of American strategic nuclear weapons by up to a third—to as low as 1,000.

Many argue that, if the U.S. reduces its stockpile of nuclear weapons, other nations will follow its lead. That is magical thinking. There is absolutely no historical evidence to support the Field of Dreams-like notion that “If we scrap ‘em, they will too.”

Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. has eliminated around 80 percent of its nuclear arsenal. No other nation has followed suit.

Yes, South Africa gave up its nukes, but that happened while the U.S. was still testing its weapons and expanding its arsenal. But since we began drawing down our stocks, North Korea and Pakistan have emerged as new nuclear powers—and Iran is nipping at their heels.

The world may take its cues from Hollywood on matters of fashion and style, but world leaders don’t follow their advice—or the president’s example—when it comes to geopolitics.

Other nations will not follow the U.S. lead in anything—unless they think it’s in their interest. To assume that they will “do as the U.S. does” is both arrogant and contrary to the historical evidence.

Heck, we don’t know how those New START reductions will impact other states yet. While the treaty codified unilateral U.S. reductions, it left Russia room to build up. And since signing the treaty, Russia has launched the most extensive nuclear weapons modernization program since the end of the Cold War.

This puts the U.S. in dramatically weaker position for the new round of negotiations the President now is seeking.

Meanwhile, the U.S. remains the only nuclear power without a substantive nuclear weapons modernization program. This alone should make Washington think twice before ridding ourselves of weapons that have prevented mass slaughters for more than six decades.

As for our allies, no one can blame them if they start feeling a little antsy about the future of the protective “nuclear umbrella.” When seeking Senate ratification of New START, President Obama certified he would follow through with all phases of the Phased Adaptive Approach—his missile defense plan to protect the U.S. and Europe. But this March, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced that won’t happen. He gutted the last Phase.

What if the Russians, who objected strenuously to the president’s Phased Adaptive Approach, balk at going along with a proposal that would actually cut their nuclear arsenal as well as ours?

Would the president be willing to jettison U.S. nukes unilaterally?

Or might he will offer concessions not even the Russians can refuse. After all, he did promise former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev some second-term “flexibility.”"

Meanwhile, the distractions and the continued scrutiny of government investigators — sure to make sources skittish — have hurt his ability to do his job. That’s a shame given the importance of his work: it was Mr. Risen and his Times colleague Eric Lichtblau who disclosed the Bush administration’s eavesdropping on American citizens without warrants, and the recent revelations of National Security Agency surveillance have built on that foundation.

The chilling ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said that even though a journalist has promised confidentiality to a source, “there is no First Amendment testimonial privilege, absolute or qualified, that protects a reporter from being compelled to testify by the prosecution or the defense in criminal proceedings about criminal conduct that the reporter personally witnessed or participated in.” National security necessitates that those who illegally leak classified information be brought to justice, the court said. It added that it saw no clear legal justification for treating a reporter differently than any other citizen, and that “other than Sterling himself, Risen is the only witness who can identify Sterling as a source (or not) of the illegal leak.”

Jill Abramson, executive editor of The Times, told me she was “bitterly disappointed in the court’s decision,” calling it a blow to “the ongoing important work that journalists do in holding powerful institutions and the government accountable to the people.”

The case has real-world consequences not only for journalists but for all Americans. It is part of a troubling trend that includes unprecedented numbers of criminal investigations involving leaked information; the obtaining of reporters’ phone records; and even one government claim that a journalist “aided and abetted” a leak.

Mr. Risen says investigative reporting that includes the use of confidential sources is “the only way to keep the government accountable.”"

Criminal cases will rely more on public as thousands take pictures and videos, he says

Unmindful of privacy, he says, a community worked together for a greater good

Kessler: Crowdsourcing in criminal investigation will happen more and more

The Boston Marathon bombing investigation made use of crowdsourcing to collect photos and video from cell phones and surveillance cameras at an unprecedented level. These pictures were made public a little more than 72 hours after the explosions and the second suspect was arrested 29 hours later.

Forensics is the use of scientific or technical information to answer questions in a court of law. Digital forensics is the branch that focuses on the identification, acquisition and analysis of information found on digital devices: computers, cell phones, digital cameras or any computer-based system.

The concept of law enforcement posting photos of wanted individuals in a public place and asking for assistance is hardly new; walk into any post office and you will still see the FBI Most Wanted poster. Why the post office? Because it used to be the social center of a town, a place where the government and the people regularly came together.

Fast forward to 2013 and we have thousands of people taking pictures and videos of what everyone expected to be an every day event. Law enforcement agencies were able to use these images to observe the comings and goings of hundreds of people at a certain site at a certain time in order to detect a pattern of behavior with which to identify the two suspects. And most of this imagery came from private citizens.

Gary Kessler

Personal computers have been around for nearly 30 years. The Internet has been commercially available for 20 years. Mobile phones have been pervasive for more than 10 years and smartphones, in particular, for more than five. Computers, networks and cell phones have increasingly become the record keeper, instrument or target of criminal activity over the last few decades.

Smartphones are everywhere and offer the equivalent of a portable Internet terminal. Not only do cell phones contain a phone book, call history and text messages, but also Web browser history, email, Global Positioning System and other location information. And surprisingly high-quality pictures and video.

All of this information will be of value to investigators. They will want to know who the suspects might have been communicating with in the immediate aftermath of the bombings and, again, in the aftermath of their pictures being posted in the media. The larger investigation will undoubtedly examine their text and email messages, social media postings, Web sites visited and calls made over the last few months and years. This digital forensic evidence will help piece together patterns of behavior that could provide insights into the suspects' thoughts and deeds, and even provide new leads.

What does this mean for privacy rights? Consider that when a municipality wants to put up a new camera at an intersection, or purchase a drone, there is often a public outcry. Is the camera an invasion of privacy? Where will it be looking? How will the government use the data? How long will the data be kept? Will it be used to track my movements? At some level, these are good and important questions because this kind of discourse is necessary to frame our Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches.

Yet, in Boston, a lot of the images came not from public-sector cameras but from private-sector cameras: our fellow citizens. Fellow citizens who voluntarily shared their information so that law enforcement could do its job.

Were these people violating the rights of others by sharing their pictures? Well, no, considering that the Bill of Rights was intended to protect us against a tyrannical government rather than from each other. Indeed, it is not clear that the government could have compelled these citizens to turn over their pictures just in case they might be useful; imagine persuading a judge to sign a search warrant on such pure speculation.

Yet, citizens stepped forward to offer their help, a clear sign of a community willing to work together for a greater good and one that does not distrust the government.

Although some might claim that these people were surrendering their rights for an element of security, it was the same instinct that made some people run toward the carnage so that they could provide assistance and comfort to friends, family and strangers. They were not surrendering their rights when they helped law enforcement but were empowering themselves as a community.

The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly offer citizens a right of privacy, although many court decisions certainly support such an ideal. Indeed, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis is well known for his observation, ""The right to be left alone -- the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.""

Your personal privacy has more to fear from the likes of Facebook and Google than from the government. Commercial entities such as social media sites offer free services and yet make money. How?

We, our information, have become their commodity. They have more money, motivation and resources to use our collected information for their own purposes than the government does. We, as users of social media, self-exploit; we post our information voluntarily. Yet, once posted, we usually lose exclusive ownership of the information and always lose control over it.

Although the use of the crowdsourcing metaphor may be new as it applies to a criminal investigation, it is almost certain we will see more of this in the future. And it is sure to renew questions about how we all are invading each other's privacy and personal space.

It also points to the incredible resiliency of the U.S. Constitution and its ability to guide us in a modern era, yet why it needs constant interpretation. As technologies evolve that the Founders could not have possibly anticipated -- from fully automatic weapons and thermal imagers to satellites and digital technologies -- we have to figure out how to balance our rights as individuals and needs as a society."

The revelation came after Bush family photos and excerpts of email exchanges were posted online Thursday by the Smoking Gun, which attributed them to a hacker known as “Guccifer.” Guccifer claimed on the website to be a veteran hacker already being sought by “the feds” for hacking hundreds of accounts.

“This is just another chapter in the game,” he wrote.

The website reported that at least six email accounts had been hacked, including the AOL account of Dorothy Bush Koch, sister of George W. Bush, as well as former First Lady Barbara Bush’s brother and the elder Bush’s sister-in-law.

The hacked emails, sent between 2009 and 2012, apparently contained security codes and a list of family addresses, emails and cellphone numbers.

The leaked photos included intimate moments: a snapshot of George H.W. Bush that appeared to have been taken during his recent stay at a Houston hospital, a shot of George W. Bush posing with a cardboard cutout of himself wearing a beret, and paintings by the younger Bush of himself showering and in a bathtub.

According to the leaked emails, the elder Bush’s hospitalization prompted his son and other relatives to discuss funeral arrangements.

The Smoking Gun reported that, “The former president’s chief of staff wrote his children to inform them that ‘your dad’s funeral team is having an emergency meeting at 10 a.m. just to go through all the details.’ The Bush aide, Jean Becker, noted that this information ‘fell under the broadening category of things NOT TO TELL YOUR MOTHER.’”

The Smoking Gun also reported that George W. Bush wrote he was “thinking about eulogy” and “solicited stories that best illustrated their father’s sweet nature, favorite jokes, and acts of kindness. ‘Hopefully I’m jumping the gun,’ noted Bush.”

Secret Service spokesman George Oglivie told the Los Angeles Times that the agency was investigating, but would not confirm that Bush family emails had been hacked.

Jim McGrath, a Bush family spokesman in Houston, told The Times, “There’s a criminal investigation and that’s the extent of my knowledge. I know they’re looking into who might have done this”

A spokeswoman for the FBI in Houston, where the elder Bush lives, referred questions to the Secret Service, refusing to confirm whether they are investigating a cyber security breach.

The Guccifer controversy is only the latest political hacking scandal.

Last year, a group of hackers known as the D33D Company hacked and released a list of user names and passwords for more than 450,000 email accounts, including more than 25,000 AOL accounts. It was not immediately clear whether the Bush family’s AOL accounts were among these.

In 2010, a college student in Tennessee, David Kernell, was convicted on federal charges of hacking then-vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin’s private emails weeks before the 2008 presidential election.

“Hacking has become a serious problem,” said U.S. Rep. Randy Weber, a Republican from the Houston area. “Unfortunately, there are those who mean ill will to decent, honest, hardworking Americans. My heart goes out to the Bush family over this invasion of their privacy. One of the things we first learned in Congress is that there are millions of attempts each year to hack into the federal government’s computers.”

Dr. Bhavani Thuraisingham, executive director of the Cyber Security Research and Education Center at the University of Texas at Dallas, said the attack shows how pervasive hacking has become.

“It is a lot easier. It’s getting so dangerous these days,” she said, particularly noting malware that can allow hackers to access personal information remotely. “By the time you find a problem, it’s already changed and attacked your email .... Anti-virus software cannot keep up with the changes. We have to be one step ahead of the hackers, and the hackers are also getting very smart.”

“It can happen to anyone, it’s not just the Bush family. This is all cyberspace — they are as vulnerable as you and me,” Thuraisingham told The Times. “They’re just a bigger target.”

UNITED NATIONS, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff on Tuesday criticized the United States for spying, using the opening speech at the U.N. General Assembly to announce Brazil would adopt legislation and technology to protect it from illegal interception of communications.

Rousseff last week called off a high-profile state visit to the United States scheduled for October over reports that the U.S. National Security Agency had been spying on Brazil and Rousseff's email.

After opening with diplomatic pleasantries and a condemnation of the shopping mall attack in Kenya, Rousseff launched into a blistering attack on U.S. spying, calling espionage among friendly nations ""totally unacceptable.""

""Meddling in such a manner in the lives and affairs of other countries is a breach of international law and, as such, it is an affront to the principles that should otherwise govern relations among countries, especially among friendly nations,"" Rousseff told the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations.

U.S. President Barack Obama was en route to the United Nations while Rousseff spoke. He then followed Rousseff on the podium as the first and second national leaders to address the General Assembly.

Postponing the state visit, which as to have included a dinner at the White House, was a rare and diplomatically severe snub by Brazil. No new date has been set.

The report by Brazil Globo's news program Fantastico on National Security Agency spying was based on documents that journalist Glenn Greenwald obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Greenwald, who lives in Rio de Janeiro, was one of the journalists to first report Snowden's leaks of classified information on previously secret U.S. telephone and internet surveillance efforts.

Rousseff's state visit was conceived to highlight cooperation between the two biggest economies in the Americas and Brazil's emergence over the past decade as a regional power.

Rousseff said Brazil will adopt legislation and technology to protect it from illegal interception of communications."

Story highlights Two documents describe scope of NSA data collection programs Their release is part of pledge by Obama adminstration to be transparent Critics have argued that the data collection violates privacy rights

(CNN) —

The Obama administration released two documents on Friday describing the scope of National Security Agency data collection programs, a bid to quiet criticism they violate privacy rights.

An NSA memorandum describes the beginnings of the agency’s collection of so-called telephone metadata of nearly every American under a provision of the Patriot Act, and the agency’s monitoring of foreign Internet traffic.

The agency says in the memo that its systems monitor 1.6% of the world’s Internet traffic, and its analysts review .00004% of global traffic.

Published accounts drawn from leaked documents provided by admitted NSA leaker Edward Snowden have portrayed a much broader eavesdropping system under section 702 of the Patriot Act.

Another document from the Justice Department describes the legal basis for collecting the telephone metadata, such as the numbers dialed, the length and time of the calls. The government says the NSA phone data collection operated under court supervision, and that the database is only accessed for specific searches in counterterrorism investigations.

The document also explains why government lawyers say the program carried out under section 215 of the Patriot Act respects constitutional First and Fourth Amendment freedoms, which protect free speech rights and prohibit the government from unreasonable search and seizure.

The release of the documents came as President Barack Obama held a news conference where he addressed the Snowden leaks, and promised greater transparency about the government’s surveillance programs.

See NSA document (PDF)

He defended the NSA programs which he said have been incorrectly portrayed as an invasion of privacy and said they were key to protecting national security.

Still, the president promised to consider changes to help reassure the public that the Patriot Act wasn’t leading to abuses.

The NSA memo describes how the agency was monitoring conversations between one of the hijackers that carried out the September 11, 2001, terror attacks and people in an al Qaeda safe house in Yemen.

The agency says it didn’t have the ability to find out that the hijacker was already in the United States living in San Diego, and therefore couldn’t tell the FBI. According to the memo, the data collection programs were begun to address those shortcomings.

The NSA memo also for the first time explains some of the confusion over various agency codenames for its collection programs.

According to the NSA, the agency uses different code names for data collected from each communications company.

“Some that have been revealed in the press recently include FAIRVIEW, BLARNEY, OAKSTAR, and LITHIUM. While some have tried to characterize the involvement of such providers as separate programs, that is not accurate,” the memo says.

The Justice white paper released Friday argues that “The vast majority of the telephony metadata is never seen by any person because it is not responsive to the limited queries that are authorized. But the information that is generated in response to these limited queries could be especially significant in helping the government identify and disrupt terrorist plots.”

The document also says that the phone data doesn’t “involve tracking locations from which telephone calls are made.”

The government’s three branches, including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and Congress, help oversee the programs, the Justice memo argues.

Critics have argued that the data collection violates privacy rights, and that the government should require warrants to collect such information.

The Supreme Court last year restricted the government’s use of GPS trackers on cars of suspects under investigation, making it necessary to seek warrants.

The Justice Department says the phone metadata is different and that “Supreme Court precedent makes clear that participants in telephone calls lack a reasonable expectation of privacy for purposes of the Fourth Amendment in the telephone numbers used to make and receive their calls.”

In any case, the Justice memo says “any arguable privacy intrusion arising from the collection of telephony metadata would be outweighed by the public interest in identifying suspected terrorist operatives and thwarting terrorist plots.”

The Justice memo also argues that the government’s rules “expressly prohibits the collection of records for an investigation that is being conducted solely on the basis of protected First Amendment activity, if the investigation is of a U.S. person.”"

Combat aircraft from multiple commands are flying again after the service obligated $208 million for flight hours from a $1.8 billion shift in budget allocations authorized by Congress, the Air Force said Monday in a statement.

Although the Thunderbirds will resume training flights, the squadron won’t be restoring its canceled schedule of air shows for this year. It is acting “with the anticipation that it may be able to resume a limited number of aerial demonstrations next calendar year,” Maj. Darrick Lee, a spokesman for the Thunderbirds, said in a separate statement on its Web site.

The cancellation of pilot flying hours for training began soon after the automatic budget cuts, called sequestration, were triggered in March. The Pentagon is absorbing about $37 billion in cuts through Sept. 30, the end of this fiscal year.

More than 650,000 civilian Defense Department workers have also been forced to take 11 unpaid days off under sequestration.

“Since April we’ve been in a precipitous decline with regard to combat readiness,” Gen. Mike Hostage, commander of the Air Combat Command at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia, said in the statement. “Returning to flying is an important first step, but what we have ahead of us is a measured climb to recovery.”

About 300 combat and training aircraft from multiple combat units will have flying hours restored, Lt. Col. Edward Sholtis, an Air Combat Command spokesman, said by e-mail.

Planes may be grounded again after Oct. 1, when the beginning of a new fiscal year will require an additional $52 billion in Defense, unless Congress and President Obama agree on a deficit-reduction alternative.

Hostage said the shift in funds to finance flight hours means less money for investments to modernize the force.

“We are using investment dollars to pay current operational bills, and that approach is not without risk to our long-term effectiveness,” he said in the statement. “We can’t mortgage our future.”

Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, issued a statement praising the Air Force for “working creatively to keep our pilots in the skies, if only temporarily, but this decision is a Band-Aid solution that cannot be sustained.”"

Hagel announced decision Friday afternoon

WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Friday the Pentagon would bolster missile defense of the U.S. homeland with the addition of 14 interceptor missiles in the face of a growing threat from North Korea.

The additional 30 missiles will bring to 44 the number of interceptors defending the United States as part of a network in California and Alaska, Hagel told reporters in a Pentagon briefing.

The decision expands the system's ability to shoot down long-range missiles in flight before they could reach U.S. territory.

James Miller, defense undersecretary for policy, said in a speech Tuesday that the Pentagon has the ability to deploy up to 14 additional missile interceptors, ""if needed."" He did not say in the speech that a decision had been made to do so.

""As we think about our homeland missile-defense posture, we do not have a 'just-in-time' policy,"" Miller said. ""Our policy is to stay ahead of the threat — and to continue to ensure that we are ahead of any potential future Iranian or North Korean ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) capability.""

Miller noted that last December, North Korea launched a satellite into space, demonstrating its mastery of some of the same technologies required for development of an intercontinental ballistic missile.

""Our concern about Pyongyang's potential ICBM capability is compounded by the regime's focus on developing nuclear weapons. North Korea's third nuclear test last month is obviously a serious concern for all nations,"" he said.

North Korea recently threatened to reduce Seoul to a ""sea of fire"" and stage pre-emptive nuclear attacks on Washington.

""North Korea's shrill public pronouncements underscore the need for the U.S. to continue to take prudent steps to defeat any future North Korean ICBM,"" Miller said in his speech on Tuesday.

He quotes W.H. Auden to make his point: “to whom evil is done/do evil in return.”

Richard Falk is the UN’s “Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967.” He has held the post since 2008, despite exposure as a 9/11 conspiracy theorist.

In his latest rant, published online on April 21, 2013 by foreignpolicyjournal.com Falk repeats the libel that prior to 9/11 President George W. Bush was seeking a “pretext” for war, and that anything Israel is the opposite of “justice and peace.”

And then he attacks Bostonians head-on. The police action in Boston was a “hysterical dragnet.” Boston’s dead were “canaries” that “have to die” because of America’s “fantasy of global domination.”

Falk explains the attacks as justifiable “resistance.” In his words: “The American global domination project is bound to generate all kinds of resistance in the post-colonial world.”

He minimizes the crime and predicts worse if America doesn’t change its ways to better accommodate the demands of “the Islamic world.” As he puts it: “In some respects, the United States has been fortunate not to experience worse blowbacks, and these may yet happen…”.

For years, Falk has been espousing the worst forms of antisemitism from his UN perch, and for his efforts has been rewarded with repeated opportunities by the Council to lecture others on his world view.

That world view is shared by the 56 member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), who only a week ago at UN Headquarters refused to define terrorism unless an exception clause was created for “legitimate struggle.”

The OIC controls the balance of power at the UN’s top human rights body, by holding majorities in both the African and Asian regional groups. Africa and Asia, in turn, control 26 of the 47 seats on the Council. With the backing of the OIC, therefore, Falk has been encouraged and protected.

The Obama administration has long championed the UN Human Rights Council, which it decided to join as one of its first foreign policy moves in 2009. Thanks to the Obama administration, U.S. began a second three-year term on the Council this past January. At the opening of the Council’s most recent session in March, Assistant Secretary of State Esther Brimmer traveled to Geneva to address what she called “this esteemed body.”

There is nothing about a “human rights” body that countenances the likes of Richard Falk that is “esteemed,” and the United States should resign–effective immediately."
