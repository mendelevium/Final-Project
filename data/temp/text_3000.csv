It's Tuesday, and here are “5 Things to Know for Your New Day.""

Every weekday morning around 6, we’ll hit the top five stories of the day, clue you in on a few other buzzy items, and let you know about some of the must-watch stories coming up on CNN’s new morning show, “New Day.”

1. SYRIA CIVIL WAR

Tick tock tick talk: Congress goes back in session September 9. Which means the White House has the rest of this week to talk lawmakers into green-lighting an attack on Syria. The maneuverings began over the weekend, when President Barack Obama asked Congress to approve the attack, saying it's the right thing to do after the regime allegedly used chemical weapons. Obama said he doesn’t need Congress’ blessing – but he’d like it. Lawmakers, in turn, are saying: Convince us. Here's a quick Q&A to get you up to date.

Now is the time for Pres. Obama to reshape public opinion. Why does Syria matter? American people won't/don't follow an uncertain trumpet. — Lindsey Graham (@GrahamBlog) September 2, 2013

Meanwhile, there's more bad news out of Syria. This morning, the U.N. refugee agency offered up this grim stat: The number of Syrians who've fled the country has now risen above 2 million. Put another way, every 15 seconds, a Syrian becomes a refugee.

We’ll cover all angles of the debate all morning. Brianna Keilar and John King are in Washington. Barbara Starr is at the Pentagon. Mohammed Jamjoom reports from Beirut. Sen. John McCain joins us at 7 and Lindsey Graham at 8.

2. DIANA NYAD

If at first you don't succeed ...: Try, try, try, try, try again. If she hadn't made it this time, Diana Nyad was ready to hang up her goggles. She vomited from salt water. She shivered. She sang lullabies to calm herself down. But she made it to Key West from Cuba. 103 miles. Good thing, because she was not going to put herself through the kind of torture ever again. ""I never knew I would suffer the way I did,"" she told Dr. Sanjay Gupta.

Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us at 6, and Diana Nyad talks about her historic swim at 7.

3. SURVEILLANCE FALLOUT

I spy with the eye in the sky: The electronic surveillance scandal just doesn't seem to quit. Microsoft and Google seem to have forced the U.S. government's hand on transparency. The U.S. may release more info on the controversial electronic surveillance programs today, trying to beat the tech giants who're thinking of releasing info of their own. Meanwhile, add Brazil and Mexico to the 'We're not gonna take it' club, after media reports that the U.S. spied on their presidents.

4. FUKUSHIMA RADIATION

Drip, drip, drip of bad news: The Fukushima nuclear plant meltdown two years ago ruined a lot, including the power company that runs it. Japanese taxpayers had to bail TEPCO out. And now they'll have to fork over $470 million to take care of the radioactive mess that the company's been unable to. Look for some folks to be seriously upset about this.

5. RODMAN IN NORTH KOREA

Do me a solid, Kim. Or don't: North Korea’s dictator seems to have a thing for former basketball superstar Dennis Rodman. That may be a stroke of luck for imprisoned American Kenneth Bae. Or not. Rodman's back in Pyongyang today. Will he dare to bring up Bae? This is Rodman last week to the Huffington Post: ""I will definitely ask for Kenneth Bae's release. I will say, 'Marshal, why is this guy held hostage?'"" This is Rodman yesterday to Reuters: ""I'm not going to North Korea to discuss freeing Kenneth Bae. I've come out here to see my friend (Kim) - and I want to talk about basketball.""

I'm calling on the Supreme Leader of North Korea or as I call him ""Kim"", to do me a solid and cut Kenneth Bae loose. — Dennis Rodman (@dennisrodman) May 7, 2013

Story highlights Campus Pride says it received philanthropic foundation's tax forms WinShape Foundation quit funding some controversial groups in 2011, official says Chick-fil-A president sparked debate last year with comments on same-sex marriage Campus Pride's leader says he's developed relationship with Chick-fil-A chief

Chick-fil-A restaurants’ philanthropic WinShape Foundation no longer funds the most controversial and politically charged anti-same-sex-marriage groups and has not since 2011, according to Campus Pride, a leading national LGBT campus organization.

Campus Pride issued a statement Monday claiming that Chick-fil-A gave the organization’s executive director, Shane Windmeyer, access to WinShape’s 2011 “990” tax documents.

He said they show that the nearly $6 million in outside grant funding “focuses on youth, education, marriage enrichment and local communities” and that in the list of the foundation’s beneficiaries, “the most divisive, anti-LGBT groups are no longer listed.” Among those groups were the Family Research Council, Eagle Forum and Exodus International.

Windmeyer acknowledged that WinShape continues to fund groups that don’t condone same-sex marriage based on biblical beliefs but says these groups, such as the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, don’t operate with the same hard-nosed political agenda the other groups are known for.

Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy sparked controversy last July when he weighed in on same-sex marriage, telling The Baptist Press, “We are very much supportive of the family – the biblical definition of the family unit.”

Gay rights groups were most incensed about the chain’s financial support for what they called anti-gay groups.

The ensuing debate included politicians from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum.

Some proponents of same-sex marriage called for a boycott of the chain, which had annual sales of more than $4.1 billion last year. It has more than 1,615 locations in 39 states and Washington, and they are closed on Sundays.

Many who agreed with Cathy took the opportunity to share their beliefs on August 1, dubbed “Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day” by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Their purchase of chicken sandwiches and nuggets to show their support for the restaurant chain and its president brought the restaurant chain record sales.

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation then promoted a National Same-Sex Kiss Day at Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country on August 3.

“Students on college campuses have been concerned with the giving practices of Chick-fil-A for years,” Windmeyer said. “Those comments just added fuel to the fire.”

Students protested on both sides of the issue, and some schools weighed the possibility of removing Chick fil-A from cafeterias and dining halls. However, Windmeyer says many people – perhaps even himself – did not take the opportunity to embrace the opportunity for civil discussion on the issue.

“There was a lot of divisiveness and hate on both sides,” said Windmeyer. “It was like the Chick-fil-A brand was a chicken sandwich with purpose.”

What does free speech mean to you? Chick-fil-A debate strikes nerve

Windmeyer says Cathy called him August 10. He expected an argument, yelling, anger, maybe even a lawyer to jump on the line, but instead there was an hour-long private conversation.

After months of conversations, e-mails and text messages, Windmeyer says, he has developed a personal relationship with Cathy, met his family and even attended the Chick-fil-A Bowl, a college football game on New Year’s Eve.

“It is about opposing viewpoints, not opposing people,” Windmeyer said. “Dan cares about young people and was upset to hear how his company was being used to hurt LGBT students.”

Campus Pride says that after Windmeyer and Cathy began to discuss their beliefs and points of view, it suspended a national college campaign against the restaurant in an “effort to find common ground” around the values of respect and dignity Chick fil-A published on its website.

“The Chick-fil-A controversy continues to impact the lives of LGBT students and provides an opportunity for every college campus to assess their LGBT institutional commitment,” Windmeyer said. “Administrators have a responsibility to ensure a safe learning environment and should recognize the toll of the controversy by committing resources and services to ensure LGBT students feel safe and welcome on campus.”

Neither Chick-fil-A nor the WinShape Foundation returned calls seeking comment.

According to its website, Chick-fil-A – a privately held chicken restaurant chain – has more than 1,615 locations in 39 states and Washington, D.C., with annual sales of over $4.1 billion in 2011.

Opinion: The right way and the wrong way to protest Chick-fil-A

WinShape Foundation filed the tax forms on November 15, according to Campus Pride, and they are public information that will be released by the IRS when it deems fit.

Tax-exempt organizations and nonprofits such as the WinShape Foundation must file 990 documents each year and release a list of organizations that received support."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/20/al-jazeera-america-launches_n_3786393.html,2013-08-20 00:00:00,[],Al Jazeera America Officially Launches With Sharp Jabs At Competitors (VIDEO),"After months of buildup, Al Jazeera America officially came into being on Tuesday, taking sharp jabs at its competitors in the cable news world and promising viewers a different approach to TV journalism.

The network launched with an hour-long introduction to what it will be offering. The main message that the promo hammered home over and over again was that Americans were being denied the news they deserved on television.

Clips of Bill O'Reilly and Al Sharpton were played, and people in different towns were filmed talking about how underserved they felt.

""Americans want wider coverage and more real news,"" Richelle Carey, one of the anchors hosting the promo, told viewers.

The network also touted its 12 bureaus across the country and vowed to tell stories that weren't airing on its rival channels.

The problem for Al Jazeera America is that many millions of people don't have access to those stories.

Though the network is available in 40 million households, Al Jazeera America faces a distribution challenge. The network recently took its request directly to viewers, asking potential audience members to ask their cable providers for Al Jazzera America if they do not already provide it.

The network's highly anticipated debut was more than 8 months in the making. In January, former Vice President Al Gore and Joel Hyatt sold Current TV to Al Jazeera. The Doha-based news network said it would replace Current TV's programming and launch a new cable network called Al Jazeera America, which would be based in New York City.

The announcement was met with some hostility, as many criticized Gore for selling to a network backed by oil money. ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart described the deal as an ""odd move"" and grilled the former vice president on his decision to sell the network to a ""fossil-fuel-based buyer.""

Upon news of the sale, Time Warner Cable, which accounts for 12 million households, dropped the low-performing Current TV. Hyatt told staff in a memo that Time Warner Cable ""did not consent to the sale to Al Jazeera.""

Al Jazeera also has a well-known image issue with viewers who stubbornly associate it with anti-Americanism. The initial promo tried to address this head-on, playing clips of Hillary Clinton and John McCain praising Al Jazeera, and showing a man on the street who said, ""It's a business. They're entitled to set up a business.""

Originally set to launch in June, Al Jazeera America had to push its launch back a few months as it searched for New York office space, a news director and top talent. The network eventually hired hundreds of employees and plucked some top talent from competing cable news networks."

Because it was so funny, many will miss the dual message.

The first was the necessity for regulation not only on food but for the burning of coal. The second was an environmental message.

Unlike times when his rants seem a bit overdone with his attacks on our food being poison (high fructose corn syrup, GMO, insecticides, and other chemicals), this rant had a prescient point.

Bill’s opening remark puts the onus on the citizen.

If you are one of the millions of Californians who voted against labeling genetically modified food, you can't complain when it turns out there is horse meat in your hamburger.

He goes on to make the case that much of the food being eaten is mislabeled, in a funny and satirical manner.

Did you know your Chilean sea bass is neither Chilean, nor bass, nor from the sea? …. And your Mahi-Mahi is really made of mercury drenched bottom feeders like tile fish …. And if you like sushi, you really don’t know what you are eating because those fish are mislabeled 74% of the time.

He then proceeds to show that many countries we will view as not as advanced in food safety, actually require precise labeling (e.g., Saudi Arabia, China, Japan). He then proceeds to use reverse reasoning for America’s failure to take food labeling & safety as serious as it should.

It’s actually a good thing America don’t care what they put in their mouth. Because in the future, thanks to overpopulation, and overfishing, and global warming, and Chris Christie, we are running out of the food we do like to eat… You know why there is so much fish mislabeling now? They don’t have the heart to tell you the fish you like are gone…. You know where fishermen can no longer find cod? Off of Cape Cod.

His closing line?

Enjoy eating your chemically process crap now America because it won’t be long before lunch is dung beetles and soylent green, and when all that runs out, I am afraid it’s Papa Johns.

Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who said if he was the Senate leader he’d move toward a rules change. “Support is growing for changing the rules when they play these games.” “The pattern of ‘obstruct and delay’ has returned as the norm in the U.S. Senate with today’s filibuster of two highly qualified nominees,” said Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) “It proves once again the need to reform the Senate’s rules.”

“I’m going to file cloture on two other D.C. Circuit [nominees] and then make a decision. I’m not making it today,” Reid told reporters following a closed-door Democratic lunch. When informed that Republicans don’t believe Reid will invoke the nuclear option, Reid said, “Well, time will tell, won’t it?”

So much for gentlemen's agreements with Senate Republicans. Once again, Republicans filibustered two of President Obama's nominees—Rep. Mel Watt at the Federal Housing Finance administration and Patricia Millett for the D.C. Circuit court—Thursday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will bring the two nominees back, as well as two more D.C. Circuit nominees, and some Democrats are calling for him to use the nuclear option to break the filibuster.Senators from Jeff Merkley (D-OR) to Kay Hagan (D-NC) sounded their frustration after these votes, frustration that's going to just build, something Reid might be counting on. Reid apparently wants to give Republicans more rope with other pending nominations, particularly Janet Yellen at the Federal Reserve, a nomination Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham are threatening over Benghazi (because that makes sense).Reid had the votes and the will of his caucus to end the filibuster for executive nominations this summer, when Republicans backed down and allowed some long-blocked nominees through. He might not have the votes right now for ending the filibuster on judicial nominations, but more specious opposition from Republicans could force a change of mind among the handful of reluctant Democrats."

When the leaders of the globe’s two great powers meet, scribblers pay attention.

But for one middle-class constituent who almost landed on Obama’s agenda, the quick Western swing will be forever remembered for the meeting that did not happen, a subsequent tumble into the politico-media mulcher and what Paul Scott now hopes will be a mostly happy ending.

All Scott, a 60-year-old car salesman from Santa Monica, wanted was to promote the virtues of electric cars. He co-founded the nonprofit Plug In America and had a featured role in the 2006 documentary “Who Killed the Electric Car?”

So when an email invitation arrived for Friday’s Democratic National Committee fundraiser in Santa Monica — with a $32,400 donation opening the door to a special reception and a few minutes of face time with the president — Scott thought about it a little. He’d given a few hundred dollars before. This time, he decided to go all in.

It was an outsized play for a guy who earns $50,000 to $60,000 a year and doesn’t have a huge savings account. “This was the biggest thing I had ever done in my life,” said Scott, who simply had to tell the president how much more he could do to talk Americans out of their gas guzzlers and into electric vehicles.

To get maximum voltage out of his investment, the silver-haired salesman wrote a column and emailed it to dozens of news outlets. In “My Lunch with Obama,” he wrote about why he was willing to pay “a large percentage of my retirement savings” for the chance to ask the president a question or two.

Scott calculated that in little more than a decade, he had saved $16,000 by harnessing solar energy at his home and funneling some of it to his electric-powered Nissan Leaf, just like the ones he sells at a downtown dealership.

“It begs the question,” he wrote, “what would our planet and political process look like if millions of Americans stopped giving hundreds of billions to polluting industries and spent their savings instead on locally generated, renewable electricity and local goods and services?”

USA Today and several automotive publications picked up the story. That, in turn, provoked a second wave of interest from conservative commentators. Their focus was on the appearance that the Democrats were selling access to the president.

Conservative firebrand Michelle Malkin’s website headlined: “Electric car advocate pays $16k a minute to personally ask Obama to push carbon tax.” The story blew up online when it was picked up by the Drudge Report.

On Monday, Scott received another email from the Democratic National Committee, informing him he was no longer welcome at the luncheon and his $32,400 would be returned. “They insinuated that I did it to gain media attention,” Scott said.

On that count, he pleads guilty. “I support Democratic politicians and I certainly support the president; he is a fantastic president,” Scott said. “But I also have a message that is crucially important for our society and I have to get that message out any way I can.”

Officials at the DNC did not respond to a request for comment.

The party’s earlier email to potential donors said $10,000 would get a seat at Friday’s lunch, $16,200 a picture with the president and $32,400 a photo and “a very special one-hour round table discussion with the President after the luncheon.”

Kelly R. Olsen, a former Santa Monica City Council member, planned to make a video of his friend’s thoughts about his presidential encounter. Olsen helped move the city’s vehicle fleet to clean-burning fuels in the 1990s. He calls Scott “a human being who is dedicated and believes in something ... and was willing to put his money where his mouth is.”

Olsen thinks Scott got blackballed because he “pulled back the curtain” on the way politicians exchange access for contributions.

Scott does not want to dwell on the negative. He said it was never his intention to point out the unseemly side of money in politics. He is not a man who believes in half-measures. A onetime marathoner and self-taught gymnast, he spends long sessions on the rings and parallel bars next to the Santa Monica Pier.

He will sell only the electric Leaf and directs customers who want an internal-combustion vehicle to co-workers. “I won’t sell a gas car,” he said. “My goal in life is to get as many of them off the road as humanly possible.”

Advertisement

He rattles off petroleum industry statistics: $700 billion spent per year in America on oil products, an estimated $80 billion annually for military protection of oil assets and $10 billion in subsidies for the industry. That’s not counting increased healthcare costs from dirtier air or for environmental cleanups after oil spills, he adds.

He wants a tax on carbon — and thus gasoline — to cover those indirect societal costs. That’s one of the things he hoped to discuss with Obama. Another was the benefits of “hyper-miling,” the practice of efficiently accelerating and coasting that Scott says can improve fuel efficiency by as much as 30%.

“I am terribly disappointed to not see the president,” Scott said, “but the most important thing is getting the message out. We have got to move the needle on this issue.”

Randy Forbes (R-VA) grilled Defense Sec. Chuck Hagel on a Pentagon email warning Army officers to watch out for soldiers who do not support gay marriage or who disfavor Muslims, equating them with the Ku Klux Klan and Neo-Nazis.

The Pentagon officer who sent this email reportedly got his information from a radical, leftist anti-Christian organization linked to a convicted terrorist.

As reported by Fox News’ Todd Starnes, Lt. Col. Jack Rich at Ft. Campbell sent an email warning Army officers to be on the lookout for soldiers connected with “domestic hate groups.” In his 14-page email, Rich identified groups that support traditional marriage or advocate strict border enforcement regarding illegal aliens as domestic hate groups.

This story is disturbing for several reasons, one of which is this U.S. military email was reportedly using the “domestic hate group” list created by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). This radical-left organization has listed Christian organizations such as the American Family Association and Family Research Council (FRC), immigration reform groups such as FAIR, and various Tea Party organizations as “hate groups.” The SPLC publicly claims they are no different than the KKK and Neo-Nazis, groups that engage in extreme violence and acts of terrorism.

Yet SPLC has itself now been linked to a domestic terrorist. As we covered in detail, on Aug. 15, 2012, Floyd Corkins attempted to go on a mass-shooting spree at FRC headquarters in Washington, D.C. with 100 rounds of ammunition. Corkins shot building manager Leo Johnson, yet the wounded Johnson disarmed Corkins, who was then captured alive.

As part of a plea deal, Corkins signed a full confession in which he admitted that he selected his targets from SPLC’s hate group list and used the map SPLC put on its website to find FRC with the intent of murdering everyone in the building (several dozen people). He called himself a political activist and was going to kill everyone in the FRC building because FRC opposes redefining marriage to include gay marriage.

Corkins was convicted on Feb. 6, 2013, of committing acts of domestic terrorism.

It is profoundly disturbing that anyone in the U.S. military would use material from such ultra-left zealots, who label organizations that disagree with them on a range of issues–not just social issues like marriage, but also national security issues (immigration) and economic issues (Tea Party groups)–as “hate groups.”

Yet SPLC is the only group here that has actually been linked to a terrorist, one who was inspired to commit his despicable crime by none other than the same SPLC whose material the Obama administration’s military command is now using.

The terrible Boston bombing is a reminder what real terrorism looks like. The Obama administration needs to deal with this threat, not associate with radical-fringe organizations that convicted terrorists cite as their enablers.

(CNN) —

In a recent interview on Ketchikan Public Radio in Alaska, Rep. Don Young, the state’s only congressman, offered this unhelpful tidbit:

“My father had a ranch; we used to have 50-60 wet—- to pick tomatoes. It takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It’s all done by machine.”

There it is – the equivalent of what Groucho Marx used to call “the secret word.” It’s a word that is so offensive that I won’t say or write it in the long form – although many people do so freely, which is a problem.

Just as Americans have been conditioned to refer to the “n-word” as a sanitized alternative to the filthy and hurtful long-form version, so we too should start referring to the “w-word” when describing that ethnic slur used to describe Mexican immigrants who came here, shall we say, without proper documents.

I started this crusade in April 2007 with a column for CNN.com. In it, I pointed out that the w-word is used with reckless abandon by right-wing cable talk show hosts but also left-wing journalists and celebrities. I couldn’t imagine these folks using the long form of the n-word even if they were merely repeating what someone else had said. Yet they did not hesitate to use the w-word.

This tells us at least two things.

One, for many Americans, the w-word isn’t as ugly or offensive as the n-word.

And two, in the minds of the uninformed, Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the Southwest don’t have the same legacy of racism, discrimination and mistreatment that affected African-Americans.

The experiences aren’t identical, of course. But given that Mexicans in states such as California, Arizona and Texas endured Jim Crow-style segregation, job discrimination, inferior public schools, lynchings and hate crimes and repression by racist law enforcement organizations, there are similarities.

Liberals couldn’t wait to pounce on Young’s remarks, spreading the word (literally) and making sure the media knew that – gasp! – a Republican congressman had referred to Mexican immigrants using the w-word. For Democrats, who are used to getting Hispanic votes without having to earn them and want to keep it that way by pointing out how bad Republicans are, it was like Christmas in springtime.

It didn’t help the GOP that Young was clueless about what he done wrong. After the first round of criticism, the lawmaker tried to brush off the controversy by saying only that he had “used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in Central California” and that he “meant no disrespect.”

That’s funny. I grew up around farms in Central California. And, I can tell you, that term is all about disrespect.

After fellow Republicans blasted Young for his comments and demanded that he apologize, the congressman swallowed his pride. In a statement, Young wrote: “I apologize for the insensitive term I used during an interview in Ketchikan, Alaska. There was no malice in my heart or intent to offend; it was a poor choice of words. That word, and the negative attitudes that come with it, should be left in the 20th century, and I’m sorry that this has shifted our focus away from comprehensive immigration reform.”

If Young’s comments did shift the focus, it wasn’t for long.

Over the weekend, business groups and organized labor signaled a major breakthrough on the road to comprehensive immigration reform when they announced they had finally struck a deal on guest worker visas, a major obstacle. All that remains now is for the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” to unveil their bipartisan legislation by their April 8 deadline.

I’m glad to see Republicans jumped on Young for his comments. But where is this outrage when other GOP lawmakers flirt with ethnic demagoguery?

And what about Democrats? They were in such a hurry to condemn Young for using the w-word that they missed the fact that they were repeating the word over and over again, which suggests either that they’re tone deaf or that they weren’t as offended as they pretended to be.

What we learn is that while leadership on matters of race and ethnicity is hard to find in either party, political opportunism is alive and well.

Let’s face it. Americans are not good when it comes to condemning the loaded language of race and ethnicity. We’re not careful. We’re not consistent. And we’re not sincere. It’s part of an overall breakdown in civility in our society and how dismissive we have become of anyone who raises concern. We’re too mean, too childish, too petty and too personal.

Just look at the shameful way that MSNBC commentator Toure Neblett recently lit into Dr. Ben Carson, a pediatric neurosurgeon and black conservative who has been critical of President Barack Obama. Toure all but called Carson an Uncle Tom, insisting that this accomplished individual who spoke his mind was Republicans’ token “black friend” because he helps white people “assuage their guilt.”

It’s never a good idea for one person of color to assess the authenticity of another – especially if it’s just for ratings.

Carson likewise stepped in it when he offered his opinion on gay marriage by drawing comparisons that were harsh and inappropriate.

During a recent interview on Fox News Channel, he said this: “Well, my thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It’s a well-established, fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality. It doesn’t matter what they are. They don’t get to change the definition.”

Insisting that marriage be defined in a certain way is fine. Equating same-sex marriage with behavior that society has declared deviant and criminal is not.

It turns out that elected officials aren’t the only ones who sometimes cross the line with their words and should apologize for it.

There's not much to add, except that this homophobe got his ass handed to him by Wahls and walked away from the segment looking like a complete jackass. Watch and enjoy:

For those who can't watch, here's a transcript:



Whelan: Not at all. In fact, I think the example I give indicates exactly the opposite. Look, what's at issue here is that we have an organization that has long stood in defense of traditional, American, moral values, and it's attracted supporters and parents from churches precisely because it has stood in defense of those values. The Supreme Court has held that the Boy Scouts have a First Amendment constitutional right to pursue their values and to exclude leaders whose presence would be inconsistent with those values. That includes, by the way, not just gays, but atheists. Now, we can respect, and we do respect, our fellow citizens who are gays or atheists. We love our relatives or friends who are gays or atheists. But we are not obligated to regard them as suitable to be Scout leaders.

Host: Hm. All right, well let me ask Zach to weigh in here. Zach?

Wahls: Yeah, I think it's interesting that Ed is going to this, you know, traditional, moral values framework. I think what he is trying to do is define this as some particular biblical, literal, fundamentalist tradition that has become popular in the U.S. over the last forty years. The reality is that there are Christians of all different denominations who are applauding the BSA for this proposed policy change, including the United Church of Christ, one of the BSA's top eight church sponsors, which on Friday issued a statement saying, ""The ban is inconsistent with the values of dignity and respect which serve as the foundation of the Scouting program,"" and we couldn't agree more. Even though Ed may be talking about respect, respect for him is a one-way street. Nobody is calling for the exclusion of Baptists or Mormons or Catholics or, frankly, anybody who even holds Ed's point of view. What we're trying to say is that Scouts should be an inclusive program experiencing, you know, a large amount of inclusivity because we believe in the values that constitute the program.

Host: Let me ask you about this woman, Ed--Jennifer Tyrell. She was kicked out of the Scouts. She is a lesbian mom who was a den leader for her son. Is she a threat?

Whelan: Look, the question here is whether a private organization can have its own standards for for its leaders.

Host: But answer that question first, if you will. Is she a threat?

Whelan: I don't know this particular woman. How could I possibly judge whether she's a threat? The fact of the matter is that organizations have all sorts of general rules that they adopt because the rules are sensible, and we don't have to defend every single application of every particular rule. The problem here is that the Boy Scouts, if they adopt this notion that different troops can have different policies, it's completely unworkable, it's going to invite legal attacks on the troops that maintain the traditional policies, and Zach and his cohorts are not going to call a peace truce. They're going to realize that the Boy Scouts can be intimidated, and they're going to continue to intimidate them, and this is an unstable stopping point--it's just a path to further surrender.

Wahls: Speaking as an Eagle Scout and somebody who actually spent twelve years in the organization, I simply have to disagree. We're appealing to the traditional values that have been a part of the Boy Scouts from their very inception in 1903, and I feel that, moving forward, this is going to be a part of the program that is fostering inclusiveness, and applying the values and the lifelong principles of the Boy Scouts to the entire, you know, population of young American men, not just those who happen to be straight. And further, on your point of whether or not this is something that is an unworkable legal solution, on a national call with the key three of the Boy Scouts earlier this week, the president of the board said, ""With the current ban in place, we don't want to find ourselves in a position in which a judge is telling us that we need to expand our policy even further than we're going here."" So even though you might be, you know, looking at this in one specific way, the BSA certainly isn't taking that position at all.

Host: Ed, let me ask you, because I know you mentioned this change in policy would deprive the troops of protection. Protection from what? What do they need protection from?

Whelan: They need protection from legal challenges to their decision to exclude gay leaders. The national Supreme Court organization won that victory thirteen years ago. They're throwing it away in a way that would expose local troops and volunteer leaders to lawsuits by activists like Zach.

Host: Would you want your son to be in the Scouts if he was gay?

Whelan: [long pause] Uh, I think a question like that directed at my son is a rude question, but let me answer it this way. I would not have put my son in a troop with an openly gay leader or an openly atheist leader. And lots and lots of other parents, the most vibrant part of the Boy Scouts, feel the same. So Zach can cite, you know, one liberal denomination that is satisfied with this proposal. There are plenty of other folks who aren't, and I think the Boy Scouts--

Wahls: That's an interesting point--

Whelan: Please let me finish. This, I think, would be an epic failure in leadership if they were to cave to the financial pressure that Zach and others are putting on them. This isn't a decision being made on the merits--this is a decision that is being made in the face of financial pressure, the almighty buck, and what sort of lesson is it to Scouts that the national organization would cave because of financial pressure rather than adhere to principle?

Host: Let me let Zach jump in here with the final word.

Wahls: I mean, yeah, to be clear, it's not just the UCC that has weighed in. Currently, the Mormon Church and Catholic Church, hardly denominations known for their liberal stances, have both declined to comment. Only the Baptists--

Whelan: [angrily] They're not going to approve this! Don't you dare suggest they're going to approve this!

Host: Ed, let Zach finish.

Wahls: No, I mean, the point is simply that, while there may be some who are, you know, very opposed to this policy position, there is a vast difference between being opposed to gay marriage and opposing the enrichment and development of young men because they happen to be not straight. So while I think Ed's position is, you know, certainly one that I will respect, and we're not going to remove his son from the program, I think he should understanding that Scouts is about respecting the opinions of all the people who want to be members, not just some.

Whelan: You're not respecting it, you're trying to--

Host: Appreciate your time. Appreciate both of you discussing this this morning. Thank you."

Huppke', 'Cynthia Dizikes', 'Chicago Tribune Reporters']",Gay marriage bill fails to go to vote in Illinois House,"SPRINGFIELD -- For Illinois' gay marriage proponents, it was supposed to be a historic week culminating in a collective ""I do"" from Springfield lawmakers.

Thousands tuned in to social media and live streams throughout the day Friday, sending tweets and other messages of hope as they waited for the Illinois House to call a vote on the legalization of gay marriage. Gay couples who had traveled to the state Capitol were invited to view the action from the speaker's gallery. And during breaks, families paused to snap smiling pictures with sponsoring Rep. Greg Harris, D-Chicago.

But as the hours wore on, the optimism and energy dissolved in the face of strong opposition from Catholic and conservative African-American church groups, leading Harris to rise on the floor and tearfully announce that he would not call the bill — there wasn't enough support after all.

His speech was greeted by the angry shouts of dozens of supporters who had been waiting all day to watch the history-making event.

""It felt like someone knocked me to the floor,"" said Robyne O'Mara, who has been in a same-sex relationship for the past three decades and took off work Friday to be at the Capitol. ""They failed us.""

Illinois had appeared poised to become the 13th state to approve same-sex marriage. Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn promised to sign the bill. Democrats held veto-proof majorities in the House and Senate. President Barack Obama called for its passage during a Thursday night fundraiser in his home city, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was a major backer as well.

As anticipation reached a frenzied level Friday, so too did Harris' lobbying efforts. He spent hours going desk to desk surveying colleagues, occasionally stepping out of the chamber to hold meetings and huddling on the floor with House Speaker Michael Madigan and with Sen. Heather Steans, D-Chicago, who shepherded the measure through the Senate on a 34-21 vote on Feb. 14.

In the end, however, Harris declined to point the finger at any one group of lawmakers for the failure to vote, saying individual members had to make up their own mind and that several colleagues had asked to have the summer to weigh the issue in their district, with the promise they would return in November prepared to support same-sex marriage.

""This was the hardest thing I've done in my life,"" Harris said of the decision to wait.

Under the bill, the definition of marriage in Illinois would have changed from an act between a man and a woman to one between two people. Civil unions could have been converted to marriages within a year of the law going on the books. The legislation would not have required religious organizations to perform a marriage of gay couples, and church officials would not have been forced to allow their facilities to be used by gay couples seeking to marry.

The legalization of same-sex marriage in Illinois would also have far broader impact on couples if the U.S. Supreme Court overrules the Defense of Marriage Act. The court is expected to rule in June. If the act is struck down, the federal government will recognize same-sex marriages, giving gay couples the full array of rights available to married heterosexual couples.

The push for gay marriage comes just two years after Illinois legalized civil unions for same-sex couples and reflects shifting attitudes in favor of same-sex marriage.

For years, gay rights activists in Illinois fought for legalization of civil unions while slowly working toward a marriage bill. The marriage bill got nowhere, but civil unions were legalized in 2011, giving gay couples across Illinois the opportunity to have the same state-level rights as married couples.

After passage of the civil unions bill, thousands of Illinois couples took advantage of the new law, but many said they weren't satisfied and felt the civil union classification created a second class that wasn't quite marriage.

While advocates have brought forth a lengthy lineup of religious leaders who endorse gay marriage, Catholics and conservative African-American church groups have provided fierce opposition. They argue that same-sex marriage violates the basic tenets of the Bible, which call for marriage to be only between a man and a woman.

In the wake of Friday's nonvote, Bishop Larry Trotter, co-chairman of the African American Clergy Coalition, released a statement applauding members of the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus for ""showing extreme courage in their defense of traditional marriage in Illinois.""

""Today our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has won!"" Trotter wrote. ""Pastor James Meeks, Bishop Lance Davis and I are so proud of the God fearing Black Caucus members who withstood the pressure of the LGBT forces and allowed God's word concerning marriage to remain between one man and one woman in Illinois.""

Advocates argue that a prohibition on gay marriage goes against American values of equality and fairness.

Jim Bennett, Midwest regional director of the gay rights group Lambda Legal, said Friday that he was profoundly disappointed.

""I was completely shocked,"" Bennett said. ""Even the signs going in today and even past lunch we were all feeling very good.""

The dismay resonated beyond Springfield.

In Chicago, Mona Noriega had been glued to her computer and smartphone all week, anxiously awaiting the expected vote.

""I warned my people in my office that I had my computer on in the background and I might just have to stop (the meeting) if they got to marriage equality,"" Noriega said Friday afternoon.

But by the evening, Noriega received a Facebook message that the efforts to bring a vote had imploded.

""Oh, oh what a disappointment,"" she said.

Harris said efforts weren't helped by Quinn's repeated demands to call the bill in recent weeks. Quinn insisted there were enough votes to pass the bill, a situation Harris noted could peel votes off if lawmakers felt their ""yes"" wasn't needed to get the measure over the top.

Other gay rights advocates contended Harris didn't do enough to reach out to minority lawmakers during the negotiation process, noting that African-American and Latino lawmakers were heavily targeted by the Roman Catholic Church and conservative black church groups opposed to gay marriage."

McClurkin was scheduled to perform in the D.C.-government-sponsored concert with other singers at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial during the “Reflections on Peace: From Gandhi to King” event. But at the request of Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D), who fielded concerns from activists Friday, the Grammy-winning singer decided not to perform, according to the mayor’s office.

“The Arts and Humanities Commission and Donnie McClurkin’s management decided that it would be best for him to withdraw because the purpose of the event is to bring people together,” said Doxie McCoy, a spokeswoman for Gray. “Mayor Gray said the purpose of the event is to promote peace and harmony. That is what King was all about.”

McClurkin disputed that account, saying he was “asked not to attend” the concert. In a lengthy video statement posted online Saturday, McClurkin said Gray “uninvited me from a concert that I was supposed to headline.”

“There should be freedom of speech as long as it’s done in love,” McClurkin said in the video, adding that he believes it is unfortunate that in today’s world, “a black man, a black artist is uninvited from a civil rights movement depicting the love, the unity, the peace, the tolerance.”

In 2002, McClurkin wrote on a Christian Web site that he struggled with homosexuality after he was molested by male relatives when he was 8 and 13. “I’ve been through this and have experienced God’s power to change my lifestyle,” he wrote. “I am delivered and I know God can deliver others, too.”

Phil Pannell, a local gay rights activist and civil rights advocate, said he raised objections with the mayor’s office Friday because he thinks McClurkin’s comments on homosexuality have not been in the spirit of the “beloved community” about which King spoke.

“I take no joy that he is not performing,” Pannell said. “I really admire Donnie McClurkin’s artistry, but this is a situation where a political polemic obscured his artistry.”

But Nolan Williams, the concert’s director, said he would have preferred McClurkin to have performed.

“Even in Tiananmen Square, they were singing ‘We Shall Overcome.’ The fight for human rights is a global fight that has to bring us together,” Williams said. “That has to bring us together whenever there are differences of opinions or differences in views. We still need to find a place to come together even when we don’t agree.”

Saturday’s concert was among a series of events scheduled to take place in Washington through Aug. 28 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, at which King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

During the concert, India’s ambassador to the United States, Nirupama Rao, noted that Bayard Rustin, one of the organizers of the March on Washington, is to be posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. Rustin, who died in 1987, was gay and has been heralded by gay rights activists as a trailblazer for civil rights.

Referring to Rustin and King, Rao said: “All these great personalities came to India and saw the power of Mahatma Gandhi’s message and in turn inspired a young African American leader from the late ’40s of the 20th century to learn about Mahatma Gandhi and take and internalize that philosophy and that creed so that he could lead the African Americans in this country in their struggle for civil rights.”"
http://money.cnn.com/2013/11/07/news/economy/obamacare-marriage-penalty/index.html,2013-11-07 00:00:00,['Jeanne Sahadi'],Decoding the Obamacare 'marriage penalty',"There's a lot to recommend marriage. But if you're trying to score the biggest break on the new Obamacare insurance exchanges, it could make sense to say ""I don't.""

That's because unmarried couples may end up paying less for subsidized insurance than if they were married.

A primary reason are the federal poverty levels, which are used to determine the new subsidies to pay for premiums.

This ""marriage penalty,"" as some conservative critics are calling it, is hardly unique to federal health reform.

""Any [federal benefit] structured based on poverty will have that effect,"" said Gary Claxton, a vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

That includes Medicaid and various benefits administered through the tax code.

To qualify for one of Obamacare's premium tax credits -- as the main health insurance subsidy is known -- your income must be between poverty level and four times that amount for your household size. The higher up that scale you go, the smaller the subsidy.

The marriage penalty results largely from the fact that the combined salaries of couples can push them out of the range of eligibility faster than if they were unmarried and their paychecks were treated separately.

Here's why: The federal poverty level of a two-person household ($15,510) is less than double that of a one-person household ($11,490).

Take a couple who combined make $40,000 and don't have access to employer-sponsored insurance. Both partners are 35, each makes $20,000 and they don't have kids.

They will pay nearly $1,300 less for two silver-level plans in the exchanges after accounting for federal subsidies than if they were married, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's health insurance subsidy calculator.

And that holds true whether they live in New York City, Las Vegas, Louisville, or Lawrence, Kansas.

Related: Some families left out in the cold by Obamacare

Couples, of course, don't usually make the exact same salaries. Say one partner in the couple making $40,000 brings in $29,000, and the other brings in $11,000.

As an unmarried couple they could pay much less for their coverage than if they take a walk down the aisle. The higher earner would pay close to $1,000 less for a silver plan and $625 less for a bronze plan. And the partner making $11,000 would qualify for Medicaid if they live in a state that has expanded eligibility for the program.

As a result, the partner on Medicaid would pay very little for that coverage since there's almost no cost-sharing of expenses involved, Claxton said.

But if they didn't live in a state with expanded Medicaid, the calculation is different.

Say that same unmarried $40,000 couple live in Kansas.

The $29,000 earner would pay $957 less for a silver plan than if she had applied for premium tax credits as part of a married couple.

But here's the rub: The $11,000 earner would not qualify for Medicaid or a subsidy on the exchange.

So, in that instance, if health coverage for both partners is important, they might be better off getting married and applying for subsidized coverage as a couple, even if it costs more."

When Clara Foltz began studying to become a lawyer in the late 1860s, she was trying to feed her five children. Foltz’s husband had run off, and she’d turned in succession to teaching, sewing and taking in boarders, but none of it brought in much income. Hoping for better, she studied law with the help of her father, who was an attorney in San Jose. Foltz needed his aid because the top lawyer in town refused to take her on, calling her ambition a “foolish pursuit” that would bring “ridicule if not contempt.”

California in those days had no rules about what aspiring lawyers had to study or for how long — the state merely required residency for six months. Plus male anatomy. Lacking that, Foltz had to beg. “I coaxed, I entreated,” she said of her lobbying of the California legislature. “I almost went down on my knees before them asking for the pitiful privilege of an equal chance to earn an honest living in a noble profession.”

A bill to admit women to the state bar squeaked through the legislature in 1878, by a vote of 37 to 35. As Jill Norgren tells it in “Rebels at the Bar,” her conscientious history of the country’s first female lawyers, Foltz then “virtually flung herself at the governor, called out the number of the bill, and held her breath until he signed it into law.” California joined only Wisconsin and the District of Columbia in allowing qualified women to practice law.

In one sense, Foltz and her fellow pioneers were asking to take the essentially conservative step of joining a middlebrow profession that primarily offered the prospect of financial gain. But the simple fact of their sex meant, of course, that they could not become lawyers without provoking broader change. It’s a lesson that also applies to the drive today to legalize same-sex marriage. Gay couples who want to get married are claiming the conventional mantle of the institution — they want the same rights as straight couples — while at the same time, of course, remaking marriage in their own image. Female lawyers once did the same. Sometimes, it takes a social revolution to change the box to be checked on a form from “male” to “female” (or vice versa).

Foltz, who is also the subject of an excellent biography by Stanford law professor Barbara Babcock, went on to petition for curtailing husbands’ power over property acquired during marriage and for granting women the right to vote. She also argued for the first parole board, created in California in 1893, and for a constitutional right to counsel for criminal defendants — “an entirely new and original solution,” as Norgren writes, which the Supreme Court adopted many decades later in Gideon v. Wainwright (which turned 50 years old this spring).

Foltz is one of eight barrier-breaking women Norgren profiles. The collection allows her to showcase the women’s variety; they followed no common script in terms of upbringing or marriage. While Foltz had a deadbeat husband and supportive parents, Belva Lockwood’s father refused her request to go back to school at 18, after she spent four years as a rural teacher. It was her second husband who stood by her while she waged a long struggle for a legal education, culminating in a sharp letter to President Ulysses S. Grant, the nominal president of her university, demanding the diploma she was denied after completing her courses. Later, as a widow, Lockwood fought another years-long battle, this time with Congress, to become the first woman admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court bar. (She was also the first woman to ride a bicycle around the capital, a bit of daring that prompted President Grover Cleveland to instruct the wives of his Cabinet officers not to follow her example.)

Once Lockwood won her battles for recognition as a lawyer, she “felt free to link her support for equality of professional opportunity and woman suffrage,” Norgren writes. “If women are allowed to be physicians, clergymen, and last, but not least, lawyers . . . why should they not be allowed to vote?” Lockwood asked.

It was a good question. When the 14th and 15th Amendments passed after the Civil War, forbidding states to abridge “the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States” and to deny the vote to black men, suffragists were crushed because women had been left out. As Norgren points out, the early female lawyers argued that the 14th Amendment implicitly granted women the full privileges of citizenship.

Myra Bradwell tried this idea on the U.S. Supreme Court in 1873, six years before Lockwood’s victory in Congress. Locked out of the Illinois bar by the state courts, Bradwell appealed to the Supreme Court, where her lawyer — a man, of course — urged the justices to find that denying membership in the state bar on the basis of sex violated the privileges of citizenship guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Bradwell lost, 8 to 1. In an infamous concurring opinion, Justice Joseph P. Bradley wrote that women did not have the freedom to work that men did, because “the natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of civil life.”

Bradley’s words drew laughs when he read them aloud in the courtroom. But the prejudice he embedded in the court’s precedents held sway beyond the passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote in 1920. It was not until the 1970s that the Supreme Court struck down state laws that treated men and women differently for no good reason.

The lawyer who brought those crucial challenges was Ruth Bader Ginsburg. When she became a justice of the Supreme Court, she hung a photograph and a political cartoon of Belva Lockwood outside her chambers. The women who went first — whose stories Norgren so capably tells — matter deeply to the ones who came after.

Harris as containing “no new arguments that could deny same-sex couples their constitutionally protected civil rights. The federal injunction is still in effect, and it requires all 58 counties to perform same-sex marriages.”

The county Board of Supervisors sought to distance themselves from Dronenburg’s action, which was filed for him by Charles S. LiMandri, a Rancho Santa Fe attorney and leader of the bid to restrict marriage between men and women.

“The county clerk has acted independently on this matter,’' said board chairman Supervisor Greg Cox. “No one else from the county was consulted or had any part of this court action, including the Board of Supervisors. The county’s position is and always has been that we, the county, will follow applicable law with regards to same-sex marriage.”

The weddings resumed June 28, two days after the U.S. Supreme Court effectively allowed a lower-ruling against Proposition 8, the measure that banned gay marriage, to become law.

The petition argues that the state does not have the right to order counties to perform same-sex marriages because the question of Proposition 8’s legality is still before the courts.

Supervisor David Roberts said that as soon as he heard what Dronenburg had done, he immediately demanded a meeting to find out his motives.

“I was livid, to say the least,” Roberts said. “As the first LGBT supervisor, with a married partner, I felt this was a slap in the face. But he says that’s not what this is about. We’ll see.”

Roberts said that Dronenburg told him that he merely wants legal clarification and has no intention of refusing to issue licenses to same-sex couples. If that occurs, Roberts said, the county supervisors will immediately move to prevent it.

“We aren’t going to let that happen,” Roberts said. “We believe in the law.”

Dronenburg, 69, was elected in 2010 as the county’s recorder/assessor/clerk. A Republican, he is a former member of the state Board of Equalization for 20 years.

[Updated at 5:50 p.m.: Randy Thomasson, president of SaveCalifornia.com, commended Dronenburg for “keeping his oath to ‘support and defend’ … the California Constitution.”

In a statement, Thomasson called same-sex marriages “completely illegal and unconstitutional, despite what tyrannical statewide officials or judges have opined.”]

[Updated at 5:30 p.m.: Gov. Jerry Brown is traveling out of the country, but his spokesman issued a statement supporting same-sex marriage.

“We remain confident that the federal injunction applies to all 58 counties and same-sex marriage remains legal in California,’’ said the governor’s spokesman, Evan Westrup.]

Please vomit when you see me.,"Our mixed ancestral genesis, and demographics here on these shores, in the Caribbean, Latin America, and even in Europe, or in Africa itself (for example ""Cape Coloureds"" in South Africa) exhibits no inability on the part of ""whites"" to mingle sperm and ova with ""blacks"" or any other form of cross-ethnic fertilization and birth. We are homo sapiens sapiens, not different species. But it took until 1967 for the Supreme Court here in the U.S. to validate the right to marry across racial lines as the law of the land. The irony of Loving v. Virginia, which ended legal discrimination is in the surname ""Loving.""

I'm fed up with the denial about, and excuses made for Teapublican Christians who talk about Jesus's love on a Sunday morning out of one side of their mouth and excoriate ""race mixing"" out of the other. The path to the pews should carpeted in the vile retching of hypocrites.

Chief Justice Earl Warren ruled:

Marriage is one of the ""basic civil rights of man,"" fundamental to our very existence and survival. [...] To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State ... There is patently no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this classification. The fact that Virginia prohibits only interracial marriages involving white persons demonstrates that the racial classifications must stand on their own justification, as measures designed to maintain White Supremacy.

Many couples across the U.S. now celebrate "" Loving Day .""

I know the history of so-called race mixing in the U.S. quite well. It has been standard practice since the pilgrims and colonists arrived on these shores with penises wielded as weapons of rape and ethnocide against Native Americans. Children were often born from these violent encounters. The rape statistics for Native American women do not abate, and those rapes are perpetrated mostly by white men.

What should be making us all puke is the continued abuse of women.

Hoax pamphlet whose author coined the tern ""miscegenation""

From the genesis of the hoax perpetrated by two news reporters which spawned the term ""miscegenation"" to the theories of the sterility and depravity of human ""mules"" or mulattoes, to the ideology of white supremacy that unleashed a reign of racial terror typecasting black men as rapists hell-bent on defiling the flowers of white womanhood, to the histories of many free people of color in southern climes due to sexual congress and often love between black men and mainly Irish indentured servant women, to the elite founders, like Thomas Jefferson who sired children with his white wife's half-sister Sally Hemings—race mixing has been as American as apple pie.

Black women were portrayed as demon temptresses exuding savage sexual heat, always available for white men's courser needs, when they were not cast as mammies providing a teat to nurse white babies. Some were ""privileged"" to be raised to be sold-off as concubines in elaborate quadroon balls of the plaçage system. Others were bred ""light"" or ""bright"" for the fancy trade and sold to bordellos.

As long as ""union"" was illicit, it proliferated. Yet it is the placing of a legal stamp of matrimony on this intercourse that so offended the sensibilities of the pious. Their bigotry has been bolstered by a long history of racialist pseudo science.

As genetic science has progressed in recent years, we accumulate more data on the geographical ancestry of those of us called ""African-Americans"" or blacks.

The popular PBS miniseries African-American Lives featured this data.

With the help of geneticists, Henry Louis Gates, Jr. put African-American ancestry in these terms:

• 58 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5 percent European ancestry (equivalent of one great-grandparent);

• 19.6 percent of African Americans have at least 25 percent European ancestry (equivalent of one grandparent);

• 1 percent of African Americans have at least 50 percent European ancestry (equivalent of one parent); and

• 5 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5 percent Native American ancestry (equivalent to one great-grandparent). Critics suggested the program did not fully acknowledge or inform guests (and the audience) that not all ancestry may show up in the tests. The genetic tests done on direct paternal or maternal line evaluate only a few ancestors among many. Ancestral information markers (AIM) must also be done to form a more complete picture of a person's ancestry. For instance, MtDNA testing is only of direct maternal ancestors. Unless other ancestry is evaluated, a person may miss a paternal line's connection to Europe. This gives a false impression that the person has little heritage of another ethnic group. AIM markers are not as clearly defined for all populations as suggested, and depend on data still being accumulated. Historic populations migrated, which also influences results. Particularly, critics note that genetic analysis is incomplete related to Native Americans, and new genetic markers for these populations may be identified.

We know that racialist pseudo science is not buried in the past. The internet has a sewer-full of sites that tout opposition to ""race-mixing"" and intermarriage. The comment sections of websites from Faux News, redstate, freerepublic, and even mainstream news agencies are chock-full of upchuck linking to, or quoting so-called ""authorities.""

Like this one: ""The health consequences of race mixing"" which has links to ""studies"" and throws in anecdotal observations, and ""data"":

It is commonly observed that a disproportionate number of white women who end up with black men are obese. Obese women tend to have elevated testosterone levels. Some portion of testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which amplifies the effect of testosterone at certain targets. DHT is also one of the culprits in the genesis of acne. Therefore, a higher incidence of, say, acne in black/white-mixed offspring with a white mother could simply reflect inheritance of the genetics of elevated androgens from the obese white mother rather than an effect of race mixing.

Pure claptrap and bigot babble.

When a Richard Cohen, or any other public pundit asserts ""today's GOP is not racist"" I admit I'm pleased to see the swift and immediate pushback. More important will be how GOP racism will translate into ballots cast against them in upcoming 2014 elections around the nation. They seem to be in denial that in spite of gagging bigots, we elected a black man of mixed ancestry to two terms in the White House.

Here's hoping we can retire quite a few more gagger-baggers from statehouses and the Congress.

Let them go home and vomit to their hearts content as private citizens, and while gagging invite Richard Cohen over to share a conventional meal.

(CNN) —

I went online this morning to see the Mountain Dew ad – the one some are calling the most racist in history – expecting to see some really offensive stuff. Instead, I saw some really silly stuff.

The goat’s funny.

The names of some of the black men in the lineup are hilarious.

ESPN LZ Granderson

The premise: ridiculous.

And I would think that’s the point of a commercial with a talking goat. It’s meant to be ridiculous and not taken seriously. It’s comedy of the absurd, along the lines of Del Shores’ “Sordid Lives,” Jerry Seinfeld’s parents on “Seinfeld” or “Dude, Where’s My Car?”

Does it play on stereotypical imagery?

Yes, and because of that, I can see how some could be a bit put off by a police lineup featuring all black men before a frightened white woman. But come on, one of the suspects’ names is “Beyonte.”

The circumstances surrounding the scene in the commercial are so outrageously over the top, I found myself snickering more than anything. Similar to the way I snickered during a skit featuring Dave Chappelle, who was making fun of racism with the creation of his character Clayton Bigsby, a blind white supremacist in the South.

And he’s black.

“You’ve never left this property, have you, Mr. Bigsby?”

“No, sir, not in many years.”

“What if I were to tell you that you are an African-American?”

“Sir! Listen! I’m gonna make this clear. I am in no way, shape or form involved in any n***erdom!”

Classic Chappelle.

The Mountain Dew commercials’ brand of frat-boy physical humor isn’t everyone’s thing. It could be seen as callous or making light of battered women. For me, though, the presence of a talking goat put me in a different “South Park”-ish mindset. There’s a reason “South Park” remains a high-rated show, why “The Simpsons” is the longest-running sitcom in history, why a third installment of “The Hangover” is being released: A lot of people like dumb, frat-boy humor draped in fantasy.

Thus I find the controversy to be as laughable as the Rev. Jerry Falwell saying the Teletubbies were bad for children because the purple one was gay. LZ Granderson

And I’m not trying to say Tyler, the Creator (whose real name is Tyler Okonma) scripted a commercial that is as brilliant as anything we’ve seen on the “Chappelle Show.” And because of the rape fantasies in his music and liberal use of homophobic slurs on Twitter, I question why the advertising executives at Mountain Dew thought it was a good idea to partner with him in the first place. But with all of that being said, I doubt his intent behind the commercial was to demonize black men.

And that’s the difference: intent.

A commercial that uses stereotypes has the potential to make any minority group featured in it uncomfortable, but is the Mountain Dew commercial really on par with, say, “Birth of a Nation,” a film that blatantly uses disparaging caricatures of black men to slander and promote fear? No, it isn’t, so can we please step back from the ledge?

In fact, I would dare say the images of black men in many of Tyler Perry’s movies, which are widely supported by the black community, are far more offensive than what I saw in that commercial.

Why? Because in Perry’s films, the dramatization is intended to be based in reality, while a thirsty gangsta goat by the name of Felicia is not.

Thus I find the controversy to be as laughable as the Rev. Jerry Falwell saying the Teletubbies were bad for children because the purple one was gay.

You know, sometimes images in pop culture are obviously insensitive or offensive, such as Lil Wayne usurping the murder of Emmett Till to make a vulgar reference about sex. And sometimes it’s all one giant inkblot, like a Rorschach test. No right or wrong answers, just a peek inside the skull of the people who consume pop culture.

The ad was pulled. I can’t help but feel it’s a sad, sad day when the policing of comedy gets to the point where we can’t even laugh at a talking goat.

The media, which is always ready to destroy any black man who dares think for himself, uniformly pounced today. In response to the manufactured uproar, the soft-spoken Carson (who was a hero to the left until he came out as a conservative), did the interview rounds on cable Friday, including Andrea Mitchell’s show on MSNBC and Wolf Blitzer’s on CNN.

In both appearances, Carson apologized for what he said and made clear that he wasn’t comparing gay couples to pedophiles or those erotically charged by animals. His point was that God defined what marriage is, not man, and if man changes that definition, it can lead to anything.

Carson also said he was in favor of giving same-sex couples the same rights as married couples, short of marriage.

NBC News obviously wants to destroy the threat of any independent-thinking black man as quickly as possible. So it should come as no surprise that, by the time Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart filled in for MSNBC’s Martin Bashir, Carson’s apology was treated as far from sufficient. In short, Capehart and his guests, Toure’ and Krystal Ball, treated the apology as a lie.

This is all par for the course at NBC News.

Sadly, so is the chryron pictured above — “Blinded by the White” — which was used as the clip of Dr. Carson played during the segment.

NBC News is notorious for using this kind of race-baiting to further its left-wing agenda, including fraud:

During last year’s GOP primary, Ed Schultz edited video of Texas Governor Rick Perry to make him look racist.

In April of last year, the “Today Show” was caught editing audio of a 9-1-1 call to make George Zimmerman look racist.

In August of 2009, Contessa Brewer sliced and diced a photograph so it wouldn’t look like a black man attended a Tea Party carrying a firearm.

So it was only a matter of time before they went after Carson in this way for his apostasy.

Both MSNBC and NBC simultaneously aired legal correspondent Pete Williams' take on the case. Williams said that the Court had struck down a ""key part"" of the Act by ruling that one of its sections was unconstitutional.

""It's a huge defeat for the civil rights community on the most important civil rights law ever passed,"" he said.

That view was echoed across other networks. ABC's Terry Moran, for instance, said that ""right now, there is no Voting Rights Act operative in the United States.""

Speaking on MSNBC, Al Sharpton called the news ""devastating."" Later, he said the Court had ""revoked"" and ""canceled"" part of Martin Luther King's ""dream.""

CNN and Fox News were slower in getting to the news. CNN, in particular, waited about eight minutes to dive into the details of the ruling. Both networks infamously got the Court's ruling on the Affordable Care Act wrong in 2012, so it was perhaps not a surprise that they waited a bit to get the details right."

At the time Atty. Gen. Eric Holder, who had previously defended the law, said the Justice Department determined that DOMA was no longer constitutional.

Holder today called the Supreme Court’s ruling on DOMA “an enormous triumph for equal protection under the law for all Americans.”

Holder said in a statement that the Department of Justice would work “expeditiously” to implement the court’s decision.

“Despite this momentous victory, our nation’s journey – towards equality, opportunity and justice for everyone in this country – is far from over,” Holder said. “ Important, life-changing work remains before us. And, as we move forward in a manner consistent with the Court’s ruling, the Department of Justice is committed to continuing this work, and using every tool and legal authority available to us to combat discrimination and to safeguard the rights of all Americans.”

12:20 p.m.: Celebrities took to Twitter today to express their satisfaction with two Supreme Court decisions on gay marriage. Many of Hollywood’s elite have supported marriage equality for years, helping to raise money and awareness for the cause as they promote their work.

Neil Patrick Harris supported marriage equality and tweeted soon after the Supreme Court released its decision.

“Huzzah! Christmas comes six months early this year! (Less one day…),” Harris said.

Lady Gaga has a history of donating a percentage of her concert proceeds to LBGT advocacy groups.

“We stand tall today.#DomaStruckDown So many fought for so long. Be proud, the prejudice are now the minority. pic.twitter.com/teni7GREDY,” she said on Twitter.

Meanwhile, television host Ellen DeGeneres called Wednesday “a supremely wonderful day for equality.”

“Prop 8 is over, and so is DOMA,” she tweeted. “Congratulations everyone. And I mean everyone.”

Perhaps actress Kristen Bell’s reaction took things the farthest. Bell and her fiance, Dax Shepard, both advocates for marriage equality, formally announced their engagement following the decisions.

Bell proposed to her husband over Twitter: ”.@daxshepard1 will you marry me? Xo #marriageequality #loveislove,” she wrote to Shepard.

His reply, also via Twitter, “DOMA is dead. Prop 8 is dead. Now let’s bring my big, gay marriage to @IMKristenBell to Life!!!!”

11:32 a.m.: More than 16 years after he signed the Defense of Marriage Act, former President Bill Clinton completed his about face on Wednesday, applauding the Supreme Court’s decision to strike it down.

As he campaigned for reelection in 1996, Clinton signed DOMA, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman under federal law.

Advertisement

The former president has gradually retreated from his action in the years since he signed the bill into law. And finally this month, Clinton disowned the DOMA altogether and urged the Supreme Court to overturn it.

In a joint statement issued with his wife Hilary Clinton on Wednesday, the former President said that the court’s decision “recognized that discrimination towards any group holds us all back in our efforts to form a more perfect union.

“We are also encouraged that marriage equality may soon return to California,” the Clintons said.

11:05 a.m.: Religious leaders, drawing on their faith traditions and beliefs, are commenting on the U.S. Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage rulings:

Advertisement

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in a statement, said that it was “irrevocably committed to strengthening traditional marriage between a man and a woman.”

“By ruling that supporters of Proposition 8 lacked standing to bring this case to court, the Supreme Court has highlighted troubling questions about how our democratic and judicial system operates,” said the church, which heavily backed the Proposition 8 ballot measure that banned same-sex marriage in California. “Many Californians will wonder if there is something fundamentally wrong when their government will not defend or protect a popular vote that reflects the views of a majority of their citizens.“

Advertisement

Catholic Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York and Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco, in a joint statement, called Wednesday “a tragic day for marriage and our nation.”

“The Court got it wrong,” the pair’s statement said. “The federal government ought to respect the truth that marriage is the union of one man and one woman, even where states fail to do so.”

Advertisement

The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, in its own statement, said its belief in marriage between one man and one woman was “unalterable” but bowed to the court’s ruling, stating that “Judaism teaches respect for others and we condemn discrimination against individuals.”

“We do not expect that secular law will always align with our viewpoint,” the union said. “Ultimately, decisions on social policy remain with the democratic process, and today the process has spoken and we accord the process and its result the utmost respect.”

Advertisement

The Rev. J. Bennett Guess, executive minister of the United Church of Christ’s Local Church Ministries, applauded the decisions outright.

“This is a great day for marriage equality, for all couples, gay or straight, because the Supreme Court has underscored the central point that marriage is ultimately about deep commitment between two people who love one another, not prescribed gender roles,” Guess said. “While we still yearn for the day when equal marriage is fully legal, granted and protected in all 50 states, this is a significant step toward full freedom and recognition for LGBT people by the U.S. federal government.”

10:42 a.m.: Conservatives bemoaned the U.S. Supreme Court’s rulings on same-sex marriage Wednesday.

“Jesus wept,” former Arkansas Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee tweeted after the rulings. “5 people in robes said they are bigger than the voters of CA and Congress combined. And bigger than God. May He forgive us all.”

Advertisement

Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann said that the court’s action “will undermine the best interest of children and the best interests of the United States.”

“For thousands of years of recorded human history, no society has defended the legal standard of marriage as anything other than between man and woman,” she said. “Only since 2000 have we seen a redefinition of this foundational unit of society in various nations. … Today, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to join the trend, despite the clear will of the people’s representatives through DOMA.

Advertisement

Conservative media personality Glenn Beck, on his radio program, worried about dissolving the definition of marriage as being between one man and one woman: “Who are you to say that if I’m a devout Muslim, and I come over here and have three wives, who are you to say -- if I’m an American citizen -- that I can’t have multiple marriages?”

While the rulings were a setback, the Supreme Court’s did not hand down a decision about other states’ gay-marriage ban, prompting conservative leaders to urge same-sex marriage opponents to take their fight to a state-by-state level.

“It is my hope that states will define marriage as the union between one man and one woman,” Republican U.S. House speaker John Boehner said in a statement.

10:06 a.m.: NEW YORK -- At a news conference Wednesday, Edith Windsor, 83, the lesbian widow from New York who brought the case against the Defense of Marriage Act, remembered her deceased spouse Thea Spyer, saying “Thea would have been so happy and proud to see how far we have come in our fight to ensure that all gay and lesbian couples are treated with the dignity and respect that they deserve.”

Windsor filed the suit after she was required to pay $363,000 in estate taxes after the death of her longtime partner and spouse. A surviving spouse would not owe any such tax if the government had recognized their marriage as legal.

“DOMA violated the fundamentally American principles of fairness and equality "" she said. “Because of today’s Supreme Court ruling every child born today will be able to grow up in a world without doma -- a world where the federal government won’t discriminate against their marriages no matter who they are.

Windsor said she cried in joy upon hearing the ruling and never let herself become too sure she would win.

“I thought our arguments were sound and everyone else’s were insane” said Windsor, clad in a black pantsuit and long string of pearls. She said she had prepared two speeches: “One was a total win. One was total loss.”

Asked what prompted her at her age to launch the fight, Windsor described the heartbreak after Spyer’s death, followed by the anger at getting a $360,000 bill from the IRS. She said she was “overwhelmed by a sense of injustice and unfairness” and decided to “sue to get my money back.”

Windsor described the legal battle as “joyous” because of the activism it sparked. “If I had to survive Thea, what a glorious way to do it.”

9:45 a.m.: Elected officials from California and states across the nation that already allow gay marriage voiced their support following two landmark Supreme Court decisions.

Wednesday, the court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act and cleared the way for gay marriages in California in a procedural decision.

Advertisement

Senator Barbara Boxer said her spirits were “soaring” following the decisions. The Supreme Court, she said, “reaffirmed the promise of America by rejecting two blatantly unconstitutional measures that discriminated against millions of our families.”

In Los Angeles, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa called the decisions “another momentous step on the path to full equality.”

Advertisement

“By striking down the Defense of Marriage Act, the Supreme Court has affirmed a basic American truth: bigotry and bias have no place in our laws,” he said.

Meanwhile, politicians from Massachusetts and New York, where gay marriage is already legal, lauded the high court.

“In the weeks and months ahead, the nation will realize what we in Boston and Massachusetts have long known: we should be free to marry the person we love,” Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said in a statement. “We are one Boston – a victory for our gay and lesbian friends is a victory for all of us.

New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo called the decisions “groundbreaking civil rights victories for the LGBT community.”

Advertisement

“It is my hope that today’s breakthrough decisions will propel our nation forward and finally allow all Americans to be granted the same rights and protections under the law,” he said.

9:07 a.m.: President Obama applauded the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act Wednesday, calling it “discrimination enshrined in law.”

Advertisement

“It treated loving, committed gay and lesbian couples as a separate and lesser class of people. The Supreme Court has righted that wrong, and our country is better off for it. We are a people who declared that we are all created equal – and the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.”

Obama said he has directed his staff to “review all relevant federal statutes to ensure this decision, including its implications for Federal benefits and obligations, is implemented swiftly and smoothly.”

Advertisement

However, he also nodded to the sensitivity of the issue, acknowledging that “our nation’s commitment to religious freedom is also vital.”

“How religious institutions define and consecrate marriage has always been up to those institutions,” he said. “Nothing about this decision – which applies only to civil marriages – changes that.”

Advertisement

Still, the President called the rulings “a victory” for couples that have fought for equal treatment.

“The laws of our land are catching up to the fundamental truth that millions of Americans hold in our hearts: when all Americans are treated as equal, no matter who they are or whom they love, we are all more free.”

8:44 a.m.: Supporters of Prop. 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act released statements Wednesday criticizing the Supreme Court’s decisions, saying the rulings stripped power from voters and lawmakers.

Andy Pugno, general counsel for ProtectMarriage.com, the official proponent of Proposition 8 said his organization was “pleased that the Supreme Court has reversed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals’ misguided decision that sought to invalidate Proposition 8.”

Advertisement

“For the more than seven million Californians who have seen their vote stripped away from them, little by little, over the course of five years, that decision is gratifying.”

He continued: “While it is unfortunate that the Court’s ruling does not directly resolve questions about the scope of the trial court’s order against Prop 8, we will continue to defend Prop 8 and seek its enforcement until such time as there is a binding statewide order that renders Prop 8 unenforceable.”

House Speaker John Boehner issued a reminder that “Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis and President Clinton signed it into law.”

Advertisement

“While I am obviously disappointed in the ruling, it is always critical that we protect our system of checks and balances. A robust national debate over marriage will continue in the public square, and it is my hope that states will define marriage as the union between one man and one woman.”

8:24 a.m.: California Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom tweeted his praise of the ruling Wednesday morning:

Love rules the day. #prop8 #doma #marriageequality #SCOTUS — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) June 26, 2013

8:08 a.m.: Many of the most important players in the cases that unfolded this morning held a news conference outside the Supreme Court Wednesday morning.

Attorney David Boies, who argued the Prop. 8 case before the court, called Wednesday “a wonderful day.”

“This is a wonderful day for our plaintiffs,” he said. “It’s a wonderful day for everyone around this country, and in California in particular, that wants to be able to marry the person they love. But it’s a wonderful day for America because we have now taken another important step toward guaranteeing the promise that is in our constitution … that all people are created equal.”

Kris Perry, a plaintiff in the Prop. 8 case, said the decision sends a message to the nation’s children.

“We believe that the importance of this case was to send a message to the children of this country that you are just as good as everybody else no matter who you are, no matter who your parents are,” she said. “Today we can go back to California and say to our own children – all four of our boys – your family is just as good as everybody else’s family.”

7:35 a.m.: The Supreme Court today opened the door for same-sex marriages to resume in California by turning away the defenders of Proposition 8.

The court’s procedural action sends the case back to California, where state and federal judges and the state’s top officials have said they support gay marriage as a matter of equal rights.

7:25 a.m.: President Obama this morning tweeted:

Today’s DOMA ruling is a historic step forward for #MarriageEquality. #LoveIsLove — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) June 26, 2013

7:17 a.m.: The Democratic National Committee says “Today is a very good day.”

In a statement, the committee said:

“Today is a very good day -- both for the married couples who will finally enjoy the federal benefits and protections they’ve been denied for years, and for all Americans who want to live in a country where everyone is treated equally under the law.

By striking down the unconstitutional Defense of Marriage Act, the Supreme Court took an important step toward equality -- but we still have so much further to go.

Equality shouldn’t be a partisan issue, but unfortunately, right now it is. The Republicans oppose marriage equality in their official party platform, and the vast majority of my Republican colleagues in Congress agree with that position.

Given how much progress we’ve made on this issue in such a short period of time, it’d be easy to think that achieving full equality for all Americans is inevitable.

But that’s not true. If we hadn’t fought for it, today wouldn’t have happened.”

7:07 a.m.: The Supreme Court struck down a key part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act today, ruling that legally married same-sex couples are entitled to the same rights as all other married couples.

The decision voids the section of the 1996 law that denied tax breaks and other federal benefits to more than 100,000 gay couples who have married legally.

7:05 a.m.: The U.S. Supreme Court‘s ruling on gay marriage and Proposition 8 is being eagerly awaited Wednesday morning by both sides.

The court could resolve the case in a variety of ways.

It could uphold or reject Proposition 8, dismiss the case as improvidently granted, return the case to an appeals court for reconsideration or rule that ProtectMarriage, the sponsors of the marriage ban, did not have legal standing to bring the appeal.

Supreme Court justices sounded closely split on gay marriage when the Prop. 8 case was argued before them in March. Much attention fell on Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who, in the run-up to Wednesday’s expected decision, has beenwidely seen as the swing vote on a deeply divided court.

The court is expected to issue a decesion between 7 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. Wednesday.

Ed Sullivan Jr. of Mundelein said Sunday he will support a bill to allow gay marriage in Illinois, becoming the second House Republican to do so and first among leadership.

Sullivan, who is chairman of the House Republican campaign organization, said his decision to back same-sex marriage represented a personal and family evolution on the issue. Previously an opponent of civil unions, Sullivan told the Tribune that his mother-in-law, who lives in the southwest suburbs, has been in a same-sex relationship.

""The first reaction from people might be, 'Well he might be voting for that just because of his mother-in-law,'"" Sullivan said. ""The reality is, because my mother-in-law is gay, I have more of an understanding and familiarity with same-sex couples.""

A state representative since 2003, Sullivan and state Rep. Ron Sandack of Downers Grove are the only House Republicans to publicly announce their backing of the same-sex marriage bill, which already passed the state Senate. With House lawmakers returning to Springfield on Monday after a two-week break, supporters of the measure have said they were within a dozen votes of the 60 needed to pass it.

Sullivan said he believes more Republicans among the 47 in the House will sign on.

""There is tremendous momentum leading up to this vote. I think we're very close,"" he said. ""There's many of my colleagues that have talked about this, that have said it's the right thing to do.""

Same-sex marriage has been controversial for Republicans in the state. Illinois GOP Chairman Pat Brady urged lawmakers to pass the bill, but some social conservatives unsuccessfully sought his ouster because his position conflicted with a plank in the state Republican platform opposing same-sex marriage.

Recently, U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, a Brady supporter, announced his support for gay marriage, becoming the second U.S. Senate Republican to do so.

""This issue for me … goes to the core of fairness — marriage equality for all people. I think it is in line with … what I believe, and I personally believe it is in line with what our party believes, and that's trying to treat people with fairness,"" Sullivan said.

Sullivan said he believes his decision follows the wishes of voters in his northwest suburban district. He acknowledged that opponents cite their religious beliefs but said the bill contains strong religious protections.

""I try to err on the side of being a public servant and serving my district as opposed to potentially being a politician and just serving that subset (opposed based on religion) and those within my party who don't necessarily want this to pass,"" he said. ""I look at this as a freedom, as a conservative view of treating people equally.""

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/19/supreme-court-refuses-to-block-texas-abortion-restrictions/,2013-11-19 00:00:00,[],Supreme Court refuses to block Texas abortion restrictions,"The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to block controversial Texas abortion restrictions that have been called some of the strictest in the country and have led a dozen abortion clinics in the state to stop performing the procedure.

The court by a 5-4 vote denied a request by Planned Parenthood to block a ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, allowing key parts of the Texas abortion law to stay in effect while the lawsuit challenging the restrictions moves forward.

The four liberal justices who voted in favor of the request said they would have overturned the appeals court's Oct. 31 ruling that allowed the law to take effect.

In its 20-page ruling, the panel of appeals court judges acknowledged that the law's provision requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital ""may increase the cost of accessing an abortion provider and decrease the number of physicians available to perform abortions.""

However, the panel said that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that having ""the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate"" a law that serves a valid purpose, ""one not designed to strike at the right itself."" The provision has led at least 12 clinics in the state to stop performing abortions since the ruling.

A spokeswoman for the Texas Attorney General's Office said Tuesday said the office is ""pleased"" with the Supreme Court's ruling.

""These are commonsense - and perfectly constitutional - regulations that further the state's interest in protecting the health and safety of Texas women,"" Lauren Bean said.

Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry also said he was happy with the court's decision.

""This is good news both for the unborn and for the women of Texas, who are now better protected from shoddy abortion providers operating in dangerous conditions,"" Perry said.

The appeals court panel left in place a portion of a previous judge's order that prevents the state from enforcing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration protocol for abortion-inducing drugs in cases where the woman is between 50 and 63 days into her pregnancy. Doctors testifying before the court had said such women would be harmed if the protocol were enforced.

The appeals court's order is temporary until it can hold a complete hearing, likely in January.

The restrictions gained notoriety when Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis launched a nearly 13-hour filibuster against them in June.

The law also bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and beginning in October 2014 requires doctors to perform all abortions in surgical facilities.

During the trial, officials for one chain of abortion clinics testified that they've tried to obtain admitting privileges for their doctors at 32 hospitals, but so far only 15 accepted applications and none have announced a decision.

Many hospitals with religious affiliations will not allow abortion doctors to work there, while others fear protests if they provide privileges.

Many have requirements that doctors live within a certain radius of the facility, or perform a minimum number of surgeries a year that must be performed in a hospital.

(CNN) – New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner issued an apology Thursday after a woman he was speaking to referred to his Democratic primary rival, Christine Quinn, using a gay slur.

Weiner said he had admonished the woman at the time, but was apologizing if anyone was left with the impression he condoned what she said about Quinn, who is a lesbian.



""Homophobia is vile and destructive and something I have fought against for the entirety of my career, including being a vocal supporter of gay marriage since 1998 and standing up on the floor of Congress for transgender Americans,” Weiner said in a statement that was distributed by his campaign on Twitter.

“I admonished the woman amid a large crowd on a street corner and by no means believe that anything about her comment was appropriate. If the impression is that I did, I apologize because behavior like this will absolutely not be tolerated in my administration,"" he said.

The exchange, which came while Weiner was canvassing New Yorkers for signatures on his ballot petition, was captured by a reporter for the Washington Post.

“You a registered Democrat?” Weiner asked a woman the Post described as elderly.

“I am, and I’m not voting for uh, what’s her name? The dyke,” the woman responded.

Weiner asked the woman to sign his petition before saying, “You really shouldn’t talk that way about people.”

After she apologized, the Post said Weiner responded, ““It’s okay. It’s not your fault.”

When asked about the exchange with the woman later, Weiner said he has “admonished her to not say anything further,” but that he had “no memory of saying anything beyond that.”

Weiner is making a political comeback attempt. He left Congress in 2011 after getting caught up in a lewd messaging scandal.

Polls have shown him trailing Quinn in their race for a spot on the ballot in November. Other Democrats in the race include New York City Public Advocate Bill de Balsio's and former City Comptroller Bill Thompson.

If she wins the Democratic primary and goes on to win the general election in November, Quinn would become New York’s first female and first openly gay mayor."

http://news.yahoo.com/promises-promises-obamas-promises-conflict-130242036.html,,[],"PROMISES, PROMISES: When Obama's promises conflict","WASHINGTON (AP) -- Absent a magic potion or explosive economic growth, it was all but inevitable President Barack Obama would have to break some of his campaign promises to keep others. If there's one thing that distinguished them besides their ambition, it was their incompatibility.

Cut a staggering $4 trillion from deficits while protecting big benefit programs, subsidizing more health care, plowing extra money into education and avoiding tax increases on everyone except the rich? Not on this Earth.

The postelection reality is starting to shake out now, though how it will all settle can't yet be known.

To reach for his promised deficit reduction, Obama has proposed breaking his tax promise. Toward the same end, his pledge from four years earlier that he wouldn't trim cost-of-living benefits in Social Security has given way to a proposal to do just that.

None of that might happen.

Republicans, who oppose tax increases, and Democrats, who object to curbs on entitlements, could block his path and in doing so save Obama from breaking his own promises.

If they do, though, that big pledge to bring down deficits by $4 trillion would surely have no hope at all.

That's the overarching dilemma in a catalog of campaign promises facing varying prospects over the next few years.

Obama is driving toward success on his energy goals. He's got a decent chance of achieving an immigration overhaul. Activists who once ridiculed his promise to be a ""fierce advocate"" of gay rights say he's come around and become just that.

Much else is bogged in the budget swamp or is a nonstarter for one reason or another. Anything costing big money comes with big obstacles, and one promise that cost relatively little, gun control, is dust. Yet Obama, in powering through with his health care overhaul, financial regulation and stimulus spending in his first term, has shown that tough causes aren't always lost ones.

A look at Obama's leading promises and what's happening with them:

Story continues

Debt:

The promise: Cut deficits by $4 trillion over a decade.

Prospects: Deals with Congress to cap spending and raise taxes on wealthier people, along with the resulting savings on interest payments on the debt, have already achieved a projected $2.6 trillion in deficit reduction for the years ahead. But the rest of the $4 trillion will be tough. To get there, he proposes a 10-year $583 billion tax increase, an additional layer of tax increases from slower indexing of tax brackets for inflation and modest curbs to federal health care programs, all helping to produce further interest savings.

Republicans are so far standing firm against further tax increases and liberal Democrats are a tough sell on trimming entitlement programs and other spending. This, as the Congressional Budget Office warns that ""such high and rising debt would have serious consequences"" if unchecked. Among those consequences are reduced national savings and investment, a potential fiscal crisis and higher interest costs for the government.

___

Economy:

The promise: An approach to deficit reduction that doesn't undermine the recovery or unduly burden the middle class. Also, cut some corporate tax rates, penalize those who shift work overseas and create 1 million manufacturing jobs by 2016.

Prospects: Obama has had mixed success cutting the deficit without slowing growth. He struck a deal with Congress to avoid the ""fiscal cliff,"" a set of tax increases and spending cuts in January. Businesses responded by stepping up hiring and spending.

But he and Republican leaders allowed Social Security taxes to rise, cutting take-home pay for nearly all working Americans. He wasn't able to avoid $85 billion in automatic spending cuts that started March 1.

Manufacturing has been creating more jobs but adding 1 million more by 2016 is unlikely. That would require 250,000 new factory jobs per year, nearly double the current pace. Overall, the unemployment rate dropped to 7.5 percent in April, the lowest in four years of recession and ragged recovery. The economy is growing modestly but steadily. It expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter.

___

Education:

The promise: Raise the high school graduation rate from 78 percent to 90 percent by 2020 and make the country No. 1 in college graduates by that year. Cut federal money to colleges that don't control tuition costs.

Prospects: A rocky path at best. There's little momentum in Congress for the spending required, his pledge to make the U.S. first in college graduates is a long shot and tuitions are climbing without the promised federal penalty.

Obama has proposed $36 billion for Pell Grants in 2013. Yet those grants now cover less than one-third of the cost of a four-year public college. In 1980, they covered 69 percent of the costs.

___

Energy:

The promise: Cut oil imports by half by 2020.

Prospects: He could well deliver on this promise. New drilling technologies have unlocked enormous domestic reserves of crude oil and natural gas. Policies that mandate increasing use of renewable fuels and better vehicle fuel economy have helped slash demand. That has translated into a dramatic reduction in oil imports and increase in diesel and gasoline exports.

But oil and gasoline are global commodities. If Mideast turmoil disrupts oil production there, prices worldwide will rise, even if the U.S. gets little or no oil from that region. The U.S. economy won't ever be free from the effect of high oil prices. It just may be able to get much less oil from abroad.

___

Entitlements:

The promise: No cuts in Social Security cost-of-living increases. Protect Medicare from Republican proposals to turn it into a voucher-like program.

Prospects: Obama is ready to break his Social Security pledge from the 2008 campaign. He favors a new measure of inflation that would gradually trim benefit increases in Social Security, Medicare and other programs. The change, if adopted, eventually would cut Social Security benefits $560 a year for an average 75-year-old, $136 for a 65-year-old.

His approach to Medicare savings is different from one proposed by House Republicans to transform the program. He'd cut Medicare payments to service providers and is proposing that a growing share of seniors pay higher premiums over time, based on their incomes. Such Medicare changes were foreseen before the 2012 election. Meantime, Washington is expanding Medicaid to bring in more of the low-income uninsured.

For years, budget hawks have insisted that huge entitlements must be on the table for true fiscal discipline to be achieved. They're on the table now.

___

Gay rights:

The promise: Be a ""fierce advocate"" for gay rights. Obama endorsed gay marriage in 2012.

?Prospects: The course for gay marriage will be shaped by the Supreme Court, expected to rule on the matter in June. It's allowed in 10 states and the District of Columbia; many other states seem unlikely to follow suit unless forced by Congress or the court. But cultural attitudes are changing, as did Obama's views. His administration argued in favor of gay marriage rights to the court.

It seems unlikely the court will order gay marriage to be legalized in all states but its ruling could help same-sex married couples on estate taxes, Social Security benefits and other tangible matters. In his first term Obama lifted the ban on gays serving openly in the armed forces.

___

Global warming:

The promise: ""Continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet.""

Prospects: Obama probably will take more steps to reduce the pollution blamed for climate change, but they are unlikely to be of the scale needed to help much in slowing the heating of the planet. Any policy to reduce heat-trapping pollution will target coal burned by power plants and oil refined for automobiles; those industries have powerful protectors in both parties.

Obama has acted on his own, to increase mileage standards and impose pollution control on future power plants. More such executive action is likely; a law is not.

___

Gun control:

The promise: Ban assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, expand background checks, and more, a postelection pledge made after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

Prospects: Obama said he would ""put everything I've got into this."" His everything wasn't enough. Entrenched support for gun rights and a powerful campaign by the National Rifle Association blocked efforts to pass a single aspect of Obama's package, the first attempt to significantly change the nation's gun laws in over two decades.

Polling found as many as 90 percent of those questioned supported expanded background checks, but even that fell short in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

___

Health care:

The promise: Ensure access to affordable insurance for all and no gutting of Medicare or Medicaid.

Prospects: Obama is likely to achieve his goal of extending coverage to the uninsured. Affordability is another question. Costs are expected to go up, not down, contrary to what Obama promised in his first term.

Some Medicare cuts Obama is willing to enact would hit beneficiaries. Well-to-do seniors and growing numbers of upper middle-class retirees could face higher monthly premiums.

___

Immigration:

The promise: Overhaul the immigration system to provide eventual citizenship to those who came here illegally, tighten borders and smooth legal immigration.

Prospects: Obama failed to deliver on his first-term promise to rework immigration law. His chances of pulling that off are much better now.

Even with a bipartisan Senate group having released legislation to accomplish those goals, however, success is not certain. Even so, the political climate is ripe for change thanks to a shift in Republican attitudes in 2012, when Latino and Asian voters backed Obama in record numbers.?

___

Iran:

The promise: ""Do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.""

Prospects: Sanctions are destroying Iran's economy but not its will to enrich more uranium. By his own timeline, Obama has about a year left to see if diplomacy and sanctions can get Iran to slow its enrichment of uranium and assure the world its nuclear program is peaceful. If the U.S. and its partners cannot succeed, the stage may be set for an American or Israeli military intervention.

___

Taxes:

The promise: Raise taxes on individuals making more than $200,000 and married couples making more than $250,000. No tax increases for people making less. Ensure millionaires pay at least 30 percent of their income in federal taxes.

Prospects: Obama's 2014 budget, if passed, would break his promise to avoid any tax increases for middle and low-income people. He proposes a new inflation yardstick that would expose most people to higher income taxes, especially poorer workers.

He kept his promise to raise taxes on the rich, though at different income levels than he laid out in the campaign: $400,000 for individuals, $450,000 for couples. Republicans dismiss his proposed minimum rate for millionaires as a gimmick.

Technology and partisanship have transformed the State of the Union over the past century. Here’s a look back.

President Obama is considering a series of new executive actions aimed at working around a recalcitrant Congress, including policies that could allow struggling homeowners to refinance their mortgages, provide new protections for gays and lesbians, make buildings more energy-efficient and toughen regulations for coal-fired power plants, according to people outside the White House involved in discussions on the issues.

One of the first orders is expected this week, when the Obama administration will call for the creation of new standards on what critical private-sector companies should do to protect their computer systems from hackers.

The moves underscore Obama’s increasingly aggressive use of executive authority, including 23 administrative actions on gun violence last month and previous orders that delayed deportations of young illegal immigrants and will lower student loan payments.

These and other potential actions suggest that Obama is likely to rely heavily on executive powers to set domestic policy in his second term. One White House official said that while the president does not see the actions as substitutes for more substantial legislation, he also wants to move forward on top priorities.

But the approach risks angering Republican lawmakers in Congress, who say they are leery of granting the executive branch too much power and have already clashed with Obama over the issue. In a ruling last month, a federal appeals court said Obama exceeded his constitutional powers in naming several people to the National Labor Relations Board while the Senate was on a break.

“It is a very dangerous road he’s going down contrary to the spirit of the Constitution,” Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a recent interview. “Just because Congress doesn’t act doesn’t mean the president has a right to act.”

The administration declined to provide details on timing of the possible actions; one White House official said the moves to boost housing, retrofit buildings, offer same-sex protections or issue new environmental rules were not imminent. Obama may touch on some of the actions in broad terms during his State of the Union address Tuesday, but he is unlikely to lay them out in detail.

One of the more significant moves under consideration is in housing. Obama is weighing whether to use his executive authority to give more of the country’s nearly 11 million struggling homeowners a chance to refinance at today’s ultra-low interest rates, according to the Treasury Department and others in talks with the administration on the issue.

Obama already has used his executive powers to make refinancing easier for people with loans backed by government-financed mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But the new plan could extend the opportunity to people who are underwater on their privately backed mortgages, which have not been eligible for the same relief.

The plan, if adopted, would likely be aimed at homeowners who have otherwise kept up with their mortgage payments but have been unable to refinance because the loan against their home exceeds its depressed value. Many Republicans in Congress have balked at the idea amid concerns over the cost to taxpayers.

Michael A. Stegman, a senior Treasury Department official, said late last month that the administration would “consider non-legislative means at our disposal to help responsible . . . homeowners access these low rates.” But he added, “the legislative route would be preferable.”

The White House is also reviewing whether the president should issue an executive order offering protections to gays and lesbians who work for government contractors. Obama decided against issuing such an order during the presidential campaign last year, disappointing many gay-rights activists.

But two people familiar with White House thinking said the president may reverse that decision and issue the order if Congress does not pass broader legislation offering protection for gays in the workplace.

In trying to slow climate change, Obama is considering acting through the Environmental Protection Agency to issue new rules governing carbon emissions by existing power plants, according to three people familiar with White House discussions. The move would face fierce corporate opposition but is among the top goals of environmentalists.

The executive order calling for new cybersecurity standards would apply to industries such as transportation that are regulated by executive branch agencies. It also would increase the amount of computer threat data that the government shares with companies.

Throughout his first term, Obama turned frequently to the use of executive powers in the national-security arena, pursuing a campaign to overturn Libya’s government and making use of drones to kill suspected terrorists overseas. Lawmakers of both parties have sparred with the administration this week over secretive anti-terrorism programs employing drone strikes and targeted killings.

Obama’s moves on domestic policies began more recently after he concluded that Republicans in Congress were unlikely to pass many of the major items on his agenda.

Under the slogan “We Can’t Wait,” Obama took actions beginning in late 2011 to boost the housing market, lower payments on student loans and delay deportation of young illegal immigrants. He also installed key officials in regulatory agencies without congressional approval, producing loud complaints from Republicans.

In the months ahead, some people close to the White House said Obama must weigh the prospect of making progress on his priorities with the risk that acting aggressively could hurt the chances for more substantial legislation on Capitol Hill.

“That has to be part of an analysis of what are his powers under the Constitution and statutes of the United States,” said John D. Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, who used executive actions in the face of a hostile Congress in his second term. “I think given where he wants to go and where Congress has blocked and stalled and Republicans are recalcitrant to do anything . . . he’s going to move.”

In the realm of economic policy, Obama may expand a program — the Better Buildings Initiative — which seeks to hire workers to rehab federal and private-sector buildings to make them more efficient. Officials say the cost of the program is offset by energy savings.

On climate change, EPA is due this spring to issue final carbon-emission regulations for new power plants, using powers under the Clean Air Act. But Obama is also considering moving beyond that effort toward regulating carbon emissions from existing power plants.

A more ambitious plan to develop a market-based system known as “cap and trade” to control carbon emissions died in his first term, and appears unlikely to resurface soon.

On social policy, Obama is reconsidering whether to issue an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. When he decided not to issue such an order last year, the White House said it would prefer to pass a law applying to gays and lesbians in the workplace.

But if Congress seems unlikely to act on the broader legislation — called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act — officials have signaled to people working on the issue outside the administration that the president would likely consider issuing an executive order, which can only affect government contractors.

(CNN) – Democratic gubernatorial hopeful and U.S. Representative Mike Michaud of Maine announced Monday he's gay, writing about his personal life in an opinion piece for newspapers in his state.

If Michaud wins in 2014 and unseats Republican incumbent Gov. Paul LePage, he would become the first openly gay candidate to be elected governor.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

The six-term U.S. Congressman's announcement makes him the 8th openly gay member of Congress, with seven in the House and one in the Senate.

Michaud, who announced he was running for governor in August, says he made his decision to come out in response to ""whisper campaigns, insinuations and push-polls"" from his political opponents.

""Allow me to save them the trouble with a simple, honest answer: 'Yes I am. But why should it matter?'"" he writes.

He's not the only ""out"" candidate running for governor next year. Others include Democratic state Rep. Heather Mizeur in Maryland and independent Todd Giroux in Rhode Island. Both states allow same-sex marriage.

While Michaud says his opinion piece may ""seem like a big announcement to some people,"" he adds ""it's just a part of who I am, as much as being a third-generation mill worker or a lifelong Mainer.""

""One thing I do know is that it has nothing to do with my ability to lead the state of Maine,"" he writes.

Michaud first served in the Maine state legislature, before being elected to the U.S. House in 2002.

""I write this now merely to let my opponents and the outside interests who fund them know that I am not ashamed of who I am,"" he says in the opinion piece. ""And if seeing someone from my background, in my position openly acknowledge the fact that he's gay makes it a little bit easier for future generations to live their lives openly and without fear, all the better.""

Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), was intern Daniel Hernandez Jr., who helped save his congresswoman's life. Later that year, he continued his public service when he was elected to the school board for the Sunnyside Unified School District, which covers southern Tucson and adjacent areas in Pima County.

Now, however, Hernandez is facing not only a recall campaign, but an anonymous anti-gay smear campaign as well.

On one side are the two opponents of superintendent Manuel Isquierdo -- including Hernandez. On the other side are the superintendent's supporters, who include board president Louie Gonzales. Hernandez and fellow board member Buck Crouch voted against extending Isquierdo's contract in June, after news broke about his financial and legal issues.

Community members launched a recall effort against Gonzales and another Isquierdo supporter, Bobby Garcia, a month ago. Last week, supporters of Gonzales began a retaliatory recall effort against Hernandez and Crouch.

But flyers being passed around to constituents, first reported by Right Wing Watch, go after Hernandez for being gay and for supporting gun control measures.

""Put a REAL Man on the Sunnyside Board,"" reads one flyer, with a picture of Hernandez speaking at an Equality Forum event. ""Daniel Hernandez is LGBT. We need someone who will support Sports and cares about our kids. We don't need someone who hates our values. RECALL Daniel Hernandez TODAY.""

The second flyer claims that Hernandez ""cares about only one things [sic] taking your guns away.""

Hernandez told The Huffington Post several parents had alerted him to the flyers, which were being distributed outside at least five of the 23 schools in the district.

""I've had a target on my back from my fellow board members for awhile because I don't go with the flow, and if something doesn't sound right or make sense, I call them out on it,"" Hernandez said.

Hernandez said he first heard the ""real man"" attack during his 2011 campaign, when he ran against Garcia, who was voted onto the board in a subsequent election.

The Hernandez recall campaign is being run by Marcos Castro, the campaign manager for Gonzales.

Castro told The Huffington Post he had nothing to do with the Hernandez flyers, although he received one at his house.

""I don't have nothing to do with it,"" he said.

Multiple requests to the office of the Sunnyside School Board to speak with Gonzales were not returned.

Hernandez's opponents need to collect 1,300 signatures by Dec. 14 to get the recall vote on the ballot.

""My governing board president has started the recall process on me, with the people who are his friends and closest allies in the community. I'm not overly concerned they're going to get the 1,300 signatures, but just the negative tone and nature of the way they're doing it has been really bothersome and upsetting,"" said Hernandez.

""It's disheartening that this is where we are in 2013, that people think it's okay to put out these kinds of flyers about anybody,"" he added.

UPDATE: Aug. 27 -- Gonzales told The Huffington Post that he was not at all involved in the flyers and does not support anti-gay attacks. He added that he believed Hernandez and his allies were actually the ones behind them, in a subterfuge attempt to make his opponents look bigoted.

""He's trying to turn this whole thing around,"" said Gonzales, adding, ""We're not anti-gay or gun control by any means.""

Gonzales said he supported the superintendent because he believed he should be judged strictly on his performance in the schools, regardless of his financial and legal issues.

""I think Mr. Hernandez may be a bit immature and young, and he's using all the resources ... and doing that, and it's kind of embarrassing,"" he said.

Hernandez later replied that he wasn't surprised his opponents are denying a role in creating the flyers, stating, ""If they truly have nothing to do with it, I ask that they renounce these attacks, drop this sham of an election and attend sensitivity training.""

Also on Tuesday afternoon, Giffords tweeted in support of Hernandez:

Daniel Hernandez (@djblp) is #ArizonaStrong. He helped save my life. We all benefit from his courage & strength. #StandWithDaniel — Gabrielle Giffords (@GabbyGiffords) August 27, 2013

(CNN) – Democratic gubernatorial hopeful and U.S. Representative Mike Michaud of Maine announced Monday he's gay, writing about his personal life in an opinion piece for newspapers in his state.

If Michaud wins in 2014 and unseats Republican incumbent Gov. Paul LePage, he would become the first openly gay candidate to be elected governor.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

The six-term U.S. Congressman's announcement makes him the 8th openly gay member of Congress, with seven in the House and one in the Senate.

Michaud, who announced he was running for governor in August, says he made his decision to come out in response to ""whisper campaigns, insinuations and push-polls"" from his political opponents.

""Allow me to save them the trouble with a simple, honest answer: 'Yes I am. But why should it matter?'"" he writes.

He's not the only ""out"" candidate running for governor next year. Others include Democratic state Rep. Heather Mizeur in Maryland and independent Todd Giroux in Rhode Island. Both states allow same-sex marriage.

While Michaud says his opinion piece may ""seem like a big announcement to some people,"" he adds ""it's just a part of who I am, as much as being a third-generation mill worker or a lifelong Mainer.""

""One thing I do know is that it has nothing to do with my ability to lead the state of Maine,"" he writes.

Michaud first served in the Maine state legislature, before being elected to the U.S. House in 2002.

""I write this now merely to let my opponents and the outside interests who fund them know that I am not ashamed of who I am,"" he says in the opinion piece. ""And if seeing someone from my background, in my position openly acknowledge the fact that he's gay makes it a little bit easier for future generations to live their lives openly and without fear, all the better.""

Some of Michaud's fellow members of Congress welcomed the news on Monday.

""My #gaydar missed it, but happy to welcome @RepMikeMichaud to team,"" Rep. Jarid Polis, D-Colorado, wrote on Twitter.

Mary Cheney, one of ex-Vice President Dick Cheney’s two daughters, has taken to Facebook to blast her older sibling, Elizabeth, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for the latter’s stance on same-sex marriage, The New York Times is reporting.

Mary Cheney, openly lesbian and married to Heather Poe since 2012, reportedly posted to her personal page on the social media site: “For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage.

“Freedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all families — regardless of how they look or how they are made — all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other.”

[pullquote]

The Times reports Liz Cheney on Friday first articulated her position on the controversial subject, saying it should be something for voters to decide on a state-by-state basis, and not a matter for “judges” or “legislators.”

“I am not pro-gay marriage,” Liz Cheney reportedly said. “I believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states, and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.”

Her sister replied by pulling no punches.

“It’s not something to be decided by a show of hands,” Mary Cheney reportedly wrote on her personal Facebook page, concluding her internecine post by saying, “Please like and share if you agree.”

Elizabeth Cheney declared in July she plans to challenge incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, also a Republican, in the state’s Republican primary. The election is slated for 2014.

Former Vice President Cheney has publicly voiced support for same-sex marriage and, mirroring Elizabeth’s stance, has reportedly said the matter should be decided on a state-by-state basis."

http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/political-intelligence/,2013-02-06 00:00:00,"['David Brooks', 'Gail Collins', 'Errol Morris', 'The Conversation', 'The End', 'The Great Divide', 'All Contributors', 'Series']",Political Intelligence,"In The Conversation, David Brooks and Gail Collins talk between columns every Wednesday.

David Brooks: Gail, let me start out with a troubling issue before I get to a bunch of encouraging ones. How would you vote on the Chuck Hagel nomination for secretary of defense? I would probably still vote yes, but only because I think a president should be given enormous deference to fill out his team.

Gail Collins: If I was a Republican senator, I would vote no just because voting no always works. You can never get into trouble for voting no.

David: I have doubts, after that hearing, about whether Hagel can now be an effective secretary of defense. I don’t think the White House is going to want to send him out on the Sunday shows or to various global forums to represent U.S. policy. I’m not sure Senators of either party will defer to him or fear him when it comes to making choices about where to spend or where not to spend. I’m not sure the military will treat him with genuine fear and respect, beyond what is required by their code.

Gail: David, if our bottom line is that in this age, a secretary of defense has to be good at spin, then you’re right that the Hagelian future does not look bright. He’s lucky that some of the Republican senators were so unnecessarily nasty in that committee hearing. If they had managed to look wise and concerned instead of partisan and hectoring, he’d probably have been cooked.

David: I say that glumly, genuinely liking Hagel. But leadership involves a certain performance element and it involves a certain demonstrated ability to master a brief. Hagel didn’t pass those tests. If I were him I’d call up the president and ask if he was still confident he’d made the right nomination. If Hagel doesn’t have Obama’s full confidence, then he won’t be successful, and then what’s the point of taking the job?

Gail: Cannot argue with that last point. But you know that when presidents really want somebody to go away, they have ways of making that happen.

Obama picked Hagel because he wanted a secretary of defense who thinks the way he does about what military preparedness will mean in the future: drone-prone with a real aversion to putting boots on the ground. Hagel seems to have been successful in his one-on-one encounters with the senators. If he can work successfully on the inside, there are plenty of glib people around who can do the rounds of the talk shows. We’ll just call him the quiet secretary.

David: That issue aside, a lot of positive things are happening in Washington. I’m moderately encouraged about the prospects of us getting an immigration bill this year. The Republican leaders seem to be drifting toward a sensible position, at least judging by Eric Cantor’s speech this week. The president is doing a good job raising the profile of the issue without trying to dictate terms. Various effective legislators, like Schumer, Rubio and McCain, are involved. It’s all coming together.

Gail: Yeah. So far.

David: There are two main dangers, it seems to me. The first is the supposedly moderate position that Republicans are now striking. This involves giving current illegal immigrants a legal status in this country without giving them a path to full citizenship. This idea sounds like something Peter Skerry proposed in National Affairs. Personally, I would be very wary about creating a class of lifelong American citizens who are not citizens and have no way to become citizens. We do not want to regularize a class of legal helots.

Gail: I’ll bet most of the Republicans would agree with you in a heartbeat, if they could just find some way out of that anti-amnesty wall they’ve built. They’re trapped because the approach they’ve railed against for their last several campaigns is actually the right approach. They just can’t admit it.

The Democrats will never agree to limit reform to a path to legal non-citizenship. And if the Republicans kill the bill over it, they’ll be stuck with the consequences in future elections.

David: The other main danger is that the whole debate will be sidetracked by some second-order issue. The main reason to do immigration is to improve the country’s ability to lure the best global talent — both high- and low-skill. A lot of people in Washington don’t see it that way. They are worrying about how many links should be in the Mexican fence, what border security measure will trigger what, how various gay partnership issues will be resolved.

This is a complete inability to distinguish side issues from the main one.

Gail: Border security is a red herring. If Obama was a Republican, the party would be cheering over the way he’d expanded the patrols, and drones, as well as the ratcheted-up deportation of lawbreakers over the last four years.

As to side issues like gay partnership, I guess it depends on who you are. The Violence Against Women Act is hung up on the question of who should prosecute men accused of domestic violence on Indian reservations. It might sound like a minor matter – unless you happen to be an American Indian woman living on a reservation.

David: I’m also moderately encouraged about the Republican Party. Republican donors are rallying to prevent future Todd Akins. Every day another party leader gives a speech trying to sound sensible. The Tea Party isn’t dead the way Occupy is, but it’s not self-confident either. I wrote one of my usual pieces on the need for a more moderate party that can win on the coasts and of course there was criticism, but there was also a much more respectful hearing on conservative talk radio than I’m used to getting.

Change is slow, and it will not be led by our elected leaders in Washington. But there are good signs.

Gail: I could be negative and point to the new emerging craziness that is Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Or the Iowa boomlet for the ultra-loopy Representative Steve King for Senate. But I’d rather follow your positive wave and praise you for being one of the most helpful and influential voices for moderation.

David: Finally, President Obama is visiting the Middle East. This will be his chance to see firsthand the current state of Israeli politics, which is hopeless prosperity. Every Israeli knows that all the political trends are pointing in a bad direction and there is no visible way to escape them. Peace is further away, the demographics stink. Public opinion is polarizing. And yet the economy booms and life gets sweeter. How long can a society live in hopeless prosperity? I’m guessing a century or so.

Gail: I was very, very modestly encouraged by the good showing of the new centrist Yesh Atid party in the recent elections. Their success suggests that there might be a future majority of Israelis who don’t feel they’re getting their share of that sweet life and who are tired of wasting tax money subsidizing the religious right and the West Bank settlement expansion.

I know that’s a stretch, but it’s at least a thought. And we’ve gotten through a whole conversation without hitting a single stone wall of implacable political stupidity. Do you think it’ll last? It’d be great for the country, but then we’ll have nothing to write about."

Conservatives are increasingly split on gay marriage

Annual conservative conference hosted a gay marriage discussion

Some Republicans say it is not a key issue for GOP voters

WASHINGTON — A day after advocating greater federal rights for same-sex couples, Republican mega-donor Foster Friess took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference Friday and told the crowd, ""Chick-fil-A values are American values!""

That's fast food chain Chick-fil-A, which was the center of controversy last year when its president said in an interview that he supported ""traditional"" marriage.

Add gay rights to the list of issues Republicans are wrestling with at CPAC, where the libertarian strain of politics mixes with Christian conservatism, sometimes in the same person.

On Thursday, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman announced he now supports same-sex marriage; a pro-same sex marriage panel discussion drew a supportive crowd at CPAC; and Friess said in an interview that he felt the federal Defense of Marriage Act shouldn't restrict the right to inherit a gay partners' assets tax-free.

""I think it's unfair that people can't give assets to whoever they want,'' Friess told the news site BuzzFeed. ""When I die, my assets can go to my wife. And a gay person — you ought to have a system where maybe you can just say, 'You can give your assets to anybody you want.' ""

When Florida Sen. Marco Rubio spoke, he phrased the matter of gay marriage as an issue for states to decide, although he has previously said he opposes same-sex unions. ""Just because I believe that states should have the right to define marriage in a traditional way does not make me a bigot,'' he said — and got a big ovation. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, another possible 2016 candidate who whipped up the crowd here, has also said he thinks the question belongs to the states and the federal government should not regulate marriage at all. Portman said he changed his views on the issue after his son told him he was gay.

The gay marriage discussion at the conference was not even an official CPAC event — instead it was hosted by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an event sponsor.

""There are a few people in our movement who just don't like gay people. In 2013, that's just not OK any more,'' said Jimmy LaSalvia, founder of GOProud, a gay conservative organization that was not invited to CPAC but was included in the panel discussion.

The question is whether same-sex marriage rises to the level of a ""gateway issue"" — that is, whether opposition to same-sex marriage causes voters not to consider supporting Republicans.

Republican consultant Liz Mair cited an analysis of polling by Freedom to Marry, an organization supporting same-sex marriage, showing 51% of Republicans under age 30 support gay marriage. ""There's something that needs to be addressed here, and it needs to be addressed now,"" she said

LaSalvia told the CPAC crowd that the perception of intolerance ""contributes more to conservatives' image problem than anything else.""

In an interview, John Brabender, political consultant for former presidential candidate Rick Santorum, who opposes same-sex marriage, says a focus on the issue would distract from Republicans' economic message.

""There's a segment of Republicans that probably has shifted on that,"" Brabender said. ""The mistake we can make is making this (issue) the core battle."" For most Americans, same-sex marriage is not a top issue, he says. For Republicans to focus on it — like focusing too much on maintaining corporate tax breaks — ""gives the sense to too many Americans that we don't care about their lives.""

Republican support of gay marriage might draw new supporters, National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg said during the panel discussion, but at a cost. ""You're going to have to show me where we're going to replace the 30 million evangelicals and social conservatives who will leave,"" if the party embraces gay marriage."

Rand Paul won last weekend’s presidential straw poll, cementing the Kentucky Republican’s status as a favorite of the conservative movement.

So it’s with some trepidation that I confess that I, too, Stand with Rand.

For the moment, I am Standing with Rand on one leg only; his isolationist foreign policy and his calamitous plan to eliminate federal deficits in five years make it imprudent to jump in with both feet. But consider:

On Tuesday, Paul endorsed a version of immigration reform that would allow the 11 million or so undocumented immigrants in this country to become legal.

Last week, he outlined an idea that would end government discrimination against gay marriage.

Pete Marovich/Getty Images Wait 1 second to continue.

The week before, Paul defied the hawks in his party to lead a 13-hour filibuster in protest of the Obama administration’s secrecy over its drone warfare program — a stance Democrats would have championed if a Republican were president.

And the week before that, he was one of only four Republicans voting to confirm Chuck Hagel as defense secretary.

Taken together, these pleasant surprises suggest that Paul is more complex than his tea-party caricature and more savvy than the libertarian gadfly his father had been. In his speech to CPAC, the younger Paul didn’t even mention the Federal Reserve or the gold standard. He has spoken, instead, of reaching out to minorities, young voters and other Democratic constituencies.

“I’ve never met a new immigrant looking for a free lunch,” he told the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday, calling on his party to embrace higher levels of immigration. Paul proposed “acknowledging we aren’t going to deport 12 million illegal immigrants. If you wish to work, if you wish to live and work in America, then we will find a place for you.”

At CPAC, Paul told the activists: “We must stand for something so powerful and so popular that it brings together people from the left and the right and the middle. We need a Republican Party that shows up on the South Side of Chicago and shouts at the top of our lungs: ‘We are the party of jobs and opportunity.’ ”

It would be naive to think that Paul, as he prepares for a 2016 presidential run, will pull off a mass conversion of Republicans to his libertarianism. But the senator, if he chooses, has the potential to build a force that could shake up politics — not a third party but perhaps an informal coalition that occupies a space between religious conservatives and tax-and-spend liberals.

Paul won’t get far if he persists with the foreign policy he laid out earlier this year at the Heritage Foundation; he describes himself as a “realist,” but his form of realism might have sounded good to Senate Republicans in the 1930s. And, like his father, he makes politically expedient exceptions to his libertarianism; last week he introduced the Life at Conception Act, which would effectively outlaw abortion.

Still, his message has the power of the early tea party’s theme before the movement was hijacked by religious and corporate interests. And it is powerful enough to have Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, fearing the junior senator from his home state. “Rand reminded the world that politics isn’t just about tactics,” McConnell gushed at CPAC, praising the filibuster he belatedly supported. “It’s about standing up for your values and your principles. It’s about courage. . . . It was truly inspiring.”

But will McConnell be inspired by the principles Paul advocated last week? That’s when Paul told reporters, in a session hosted by National Review, that even though he supports the “historical definition” of marriage, “I’m not for limiting contracts between adults.” He floated an idea “to make the tax code more neutral, where it doesn’t mention the word marriage.”

And will McConnell praise the courage and values Paul showed Tuesday, when he proposed legal status for illegal immigrants? Paul outlined a probationary system under which they could “get in line” for citizenship. “This is where prudence, compassion and thrift all point us toward the same goal: bringing these workers out of the shadows and into being taxpaying members of society.”

Paul said that Republicans, in “our zeal for border control,” have “sometimes obscured our respect and admiration for immigrants.” This was similar to his CPAC speech, in which he charged that “the GOP of old has grown stale and moss-covered.”

It’s not yet clear how dedicated Paul really is to moss removal. But as long as he’s scrubbing, I’ll Stand with Rand.

(CNN) —

Republicans portray themselves as the party of family values. Yet, in Wyoming, one prominent group of right wing kinfolk will spend the holidays embroiled in a family feud.

You don’t get to choose your family. Still, family members might choose a destructive lifestyle that puts them at odds with loved ones. They make others uncomfortable, and hurt those who love them. These people are often thinking only of themselves, and they haven’t considered the consequences of their behavior.

Liz Cheney is one of these people. And the destructive lifestyle she has chosen is that of a politician.

The Republican Senate candidate from Wyoming is running to the right of Republican incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi. And because that might not be so easy to do, whenever the challenger offers an opinion on a topic, it’s difficult to know if she’s speaking from the heart – or pandering to the lowest common denominator.

Courtesy San Diego Union Tribune Ruben Navarrette Jr.

An independent political group calling itself the American Principles Fund, which is defending Enzi, recently launched an ad attacking Cheney for opposing a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and supporting the decision of the State Department to give benefits to same-sex partners of employees.

Cheney sisters spar over same-sex marriage, parents weigh in

This week, while calling on Enzi to denounce the ad and labeling it “gutter politics,” Cheney stood by those earlier positions. During an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” she said:

“I don’t believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. If people are in a same-sex relationship and they want their partner to be able to have health benefits or be designated as a beneficiary on their life insurance, there’s no reason we shouldn’t do that.”

Nonetheless, that ad puts Cheney in a tight spot, and given that Wyoming is a very conservative state and given that she’s trying to position herself on the far right of the spectrum, she can’t be seen as soft on same-sex marriage.

Thus, in the same interview, she made clear that she doesn’t favor allowing same-sex couples to wed and that she supports “the traditional definition of marriage.”

It’s a position that Cheney has long held. That is part of the problem. In a country where, as public opinion polls make clear, the opinion of so many Americans on same-sex marriage is rapidly evolving due in large part to the fact that young Americans consider this a nonissue, it would have been good to see some personal growth from Cheney.

Besides, she should tread lightly on this subject. Why? Because blood is thicker than votes. And because Michael Corleone was right, and – even in the rough and tumble of politics – you “don’t ever take sides with anyone against the family.”

And, for the Cheney family, this issue is personal. Liz’s sister, Mary, is in a same-sex marriage and has two children with her wife and longtime companion, Heather Poe.

“I love Mary very much. I love her family very much. This is just an issue in which we disagree,” Cheney said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Mary Cheney wasn’t having any of it. Not long after the interview, she posted this rebuttal on Facebook:

“Liz – this isn’t just an issue on which we disagree – you’re just wrong – and on the wrong side of history.”

Mary also shared a post by Poe, who was likewise bothered by Liz’s comments. It read:

“I was watching my sister-in-law on Fox News Sunday (yes Liz, in fifteen states and the District of Columbia you are my sister-in-law) and was very disappointed to hear her say ‘I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage….

“Liz has been a guest in our home, has spent time and shared holidays with our children, and when Mary and I got married in 2012 – she didn’t hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us.

“To have her now say she doesn’t support our right to marry is offensive to say the least.”

Here is what Liz Cheney missed: To many proponents of marriage equality, the very idea of “traditional marriage” is offensive. You see, tradition is the antithesis of progress. It was once tradition that women didn’t have the right to vote, and African-Americans used separate restrooms, and U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were swept up in immigration sweeps. Those things had to change, and they did. In those instances, Americans decided that tradition should take a back seat to things like fairness, justice and equality.

This year, Christmas dinner at the Cheney house is bound to be awkward. The kids are fighting, and that sort of thing always hurts the parents most of all.

“This is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years, and we are pained to see it become public,” Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife, Lynne, said Monday in a statement.

They insisted that Liz Cheney has “always treated her sister and her sister’s family with love and respect, exactly as she should have done.” And, they said, “Compassion is called for, even when there is disagreement about such a fundamental matter.”

The Cheneys know something about compassion. Over the years, they have been remarkably graceful and supportive toward Mary Cheney and her family. Dick Cheney has challenged conservatives in his own party by saying that gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry and that – despite calls for a federal ban on same-sex marriage – the issue should be handled at the state level.

I know something about what Liz Cheney is going through. As recently as 14 years ago, I was opposed to same-sex marriage and supported the watered-down alternative: civil unions. I thought this was a battle that wasn’t worth fighting and that gay activists should focus their attention elsewhere.

However, my younger brother, who is gay, wouldn’t let me get away with it. He challenged me. He told me I was wrong. He forced me to be a better person. I changed my view, and came to understand that Americans can’t have a two-tiered system, where some of us enjoy the right to marry the people we love while our brothers and sisters and cousins are denied that right, based on nothing more than sexual orientation. It’s discrimination with all its ugliness.

In the end, this is where we should arrive. Not just because you love your brother, or your sister, but because, just as importantly, you love your country. And you understand what America stands for above all else: freedom.

For all of us. Or none of us.

Mass shootings such as the one in Newtown, Conn., in December spurred Democratic lawmakers to look for ways to tighten California’s gun laws, already some of the toughest in the nation.

“We all can recite the horrific acts that have occurred in our country over the last year,” said Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento). “These bills attempt to respond to those well-publicized tragedies and many more that go unpublicized.”

Californians who want to buy ammunition would have to submit personal information and a $50 fee for a background check by the state, under a bill passed by the Senate. The state Department of Justice would determine whether buyers have a criminal record, severe mental illness or a restraining order that would disqualify them from owning guns.

Ammo shops would check the name on buyers’ driver’s licenses against a state list of qualified purchasers.

The goal of the bill is “to ensure that criminals and other dangerous individuals cannot purchase ammunition in the state of California,” said Sen. Kevin De Leon (D-Los Angeles), author of SB 53.

The vote was 22-14, with a few Democrats joining the Republican minority in opposition.

Sen. Jim Nielsen (R-Gerber) said, “We are criminalizing legal, historic behavior in the state of California and putting onerous burdens and regulations and requirements on law-abiding citizens.”

The Senate also OK’d a bill that would outlaw the sale, purchase and manufacture in California of semiautomatic rifles that can accommodate detachable magazines. The measure, SB 374 by Steinberg, also would require those who own such weapons to register them with the state.

The Assembly joined the action on guns by passing a measure to require the state Department of Justice to notify local law enforcement agencies when someone buys more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition. The bill would also ban kits that convert magazines to carry more than 10 rounds and would extend a ban on gun ownership for anyone who conveys a serious threat of violence to a licensed psychotherapist.

Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley), who authored the bill, AB 48, said mass shooters often “have a mental health history.”

The legislation approved in the Assembly on Wednesday now goes to the Senate and vice versa.

Senators on Wednesday voted to strip tax-exempt status from nonprofit groups, including the Boy Scouts of America, that deny participation based on sexual orientation or religion.

Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) said he was glad the Boy Scouts’ national council recently decided to allow openly gay minors to serve as scouts. But he said it was unacceptable that the organization did not also lift its ban on gays serving as adult leaders.

“We’ve given the Boy Scouts ample time to solve their discrimination problem, and they have chosen a path that still leads to discrimination,” Lara told his colleagues.

Some Republicans voted against the bill, SB 323, which would eliminate nonprofit youth groups’ exemption from state sales, use and corporate taxes if the organizations discriminate based on sexual orientation.

Boy Scouts spokesman Deron Smith said the organization remains committed to serving the 180,000 scouts in California.

“Today, more than ever, youth need the character and leadership programs of scouting,” he said in an email after the vote. “We are disappointed with anything that impacts our ability to serve more youth.”

Republicans also opposed a bill that would impose the $75 charge on the recording of many real estate documents. Sen. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Concord) said his bill, SB 391, would raise up to $720 million annually to replace money lost for affordable housing when redevelopment projects were disbanded.

Sen. Joel Anderson (R-San Diego) voted against it, saying the bill would hurt the working-class people it is intended to help.

Other bills approved in one house Wednesday would:

• Allow those who may be in the country illegally to obtain a California driver’s license if they can provide documents to establish their identity and residency in the state.

Require the state to develop restrictions on an oil production technique called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), served up a stemwinder this week, laying out God’s positions on the death penalty, guns in schools, gay marriage, communism and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), all in an impassioned 45 minutes.

The Cuban-American creationist quoted Bible verses that he said described God’s hardline position on capital punishment. “You know, the Bible is so clear,"" he said. ""Go to Genesis chapter nine and you will find the death penalty clearly stated in Genesis chapter nine ... God ordains the death penalty!”

He brushed off “all these people that want to come home with their violins to tell you, ‘Oh, we need to show mercy,'"" declaring that the death penalty rightly shows no mercy.

On the subject of mass shootings on school campuses, Cruz blamed Democrats who have lobbied for gun control in response to the atrocities.

“Look at all the massacres that we’ve had in the last year or two that the left is using to try to tell us that we need to control guns. Every one of those was in a gun-free zone,” Cruz said, amid exclamations of “Amen!” and “Exactly!” from the audience.

“You want to eliminate school massacres? Have the teachers carry [guns]! … How stupid can you be?” Cruz said. An audience member answered, “It’s doggone stupid!”

Cruz also spoke at length against same-sex marriage, arguing, “It was Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.”

He said the legalization of gay marriage would lead to a deluge of hate speech claims.

“After this homosexual marriage law gets passed, do you know what the next thing that is coming very soon is? ... Hate speech,” Cruz said. “You preach Romans chapter one in your church, you’re going to be called before a court for hate speech. Now what are you gonna do? Are you going to take that page and cut it out of your Bible? Because it’s not politically correct? So it’s going to come to a head.”

More broadly, the senator's father warned that “social justice very quickly leads to socialism and ultimately communism.” He squeezed in a jab at the National Rifle Association's past support for the Senate majority leader, asking, “How can you call yourself righteous and go endorse Harry Reid?”

Cruz attacked President Barack Obama as a “king” and a “tyrant,” before closing with “God bless you all.”

The event at which Cruz spoke was sponsored by the gun rights advocacy group OK2A and the anti-government Tulsa 9.12 Project."

The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the slain civil rights leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, is lionized each year at ceremonies on the federal holiday in his honor. Here’s what you may not know about him.

Peter Dreier is the E.P. Clapp distinguished professor of politics and chair of the urban and environmental policy department at Occidental College. His latest book is “The 100 Greatest Americans of the 20th Century: A Social Justice Hall of Fame.”

What would the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. march for if he were alive today?

America has made progress on many fronts in the half-century since King electrified a crowd of 200,000 people, and millions of Americans watching on television, with his “I Have a Dream” address at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. But there is still much to do to achieve his vision of equality.

Fortunately, many Americans are involved in grass-roots movements that follow in his footsteps. King began his activism as a crusader against racial segregation, but he soon recognized that his battle was part of a much broader fight for a more humane society. Today, at age 84, King would no doubt still be on the front lines, lending his voice and his energy to major battles for justice.

Voting rights: Along with other civil rights leaders, King fought hard to dismantle Jim Crow laws that kept blacks from voting. He was proud of his role in pushing Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act in 1965. He’d be outraged by the Supreme Court’s recent ruling to weaken the law that, among other things, increased the number of black voters and black elected officials.

Since that ruling, a movement has burgeoned to stop states’ efforts to require photo IDs in order to vote, shrink the early-voting period, and end same-day voter registration and pre-registration for teenagerswho will turn 18 by Election Day. Today, King might lend his name to these campaigns and join the Moral Monday protests in North Carolina, where thousands have opposed that state’s efforts to restrict voting rights.

Gun violence: During the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, King faced constant death threats and feared for his family’s life. He owned several guns and allowed armed guards to protect his home. But Bayard Rustin — a pacifist who was one of King’s closest advisers — persuaded King to give up his guns and guards and embrace a nonviolent strategy.

King’s commitment to nonviolence grew stronger as he grew older. After John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963, King wrote: “By our readiness to allow arms to be purchased at will and fired at whim, by allowing our movie and television screens to teach our children that the hero is one who masters the art of shooting and the technique of killing, by allowing all these developments, we have created an atmosphere in which violence and hatred have become popular pastimes.”

Today he would probably push for tougher limits on gun ownership. He would have joined the college and high school students who recently camped outside Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s office for 31 days, demanding repeal of that state’s shoot-first “stand your ground” law. And he’d probably support the activists in Chicago who recently protested for several days outside a conference of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a corporate-sponsored lobbying group that has been a major advocate of “stand your ground” laws. He might call on cities, colleges and churches to divest from companies that manufacture military-style assault weapons.

Mass incarceration: King recognized that the criminal justice system has long had a double standard when it comes to the treatment of black and white Americans. Today he would be joining prison reform groups, the ACLU, the NAACP and others that have been protesting racial profiling by police and drug policies that have resulted in 2.3 million Americans behind bars, many for nonviolent, minor offenses.

King would have applauded Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.’s recent speech outlining plans to reduce mass incarceration rates by limiting the number of people sentenced under mandatory-minimum laws. You could hear King’s spirit echoed in Holder’s words: “A vicious cycle of poverty, criminality and incarceration traps too many Americans and weakens too many communities. We cannot simply prosecute or incarcerate our way to becoming a safe nation.”

Women’s reproductive freedom: In 1966, King was one of four recipients of Planned Parenthood’s first Margaret Sanger Award, named for the group’s founder, a pioneer in educating women about birth control. In accepting the award, King said that “there is a striking kinship between our movement and Margaret Sanger’s early efforts.” He noted how “at the turn of the century, she went into the slums and set up a birth-control clinic, and for this deed she went to jail because she was violating an unjust law. Yet the years have justified her actions.”

King never spoke publicly about his views on abortion, and he was murdered five years before the Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973, but he was a fervent advocate for universal health care. “Of all the forms of inequality,” he said in 1966, “injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.” Today King probably would speak at rallies and participate in vigils at state capitals in Maine, North Carolina, Texas and elsewhere to protect women’s access to health care and reproductive freedom — and challenge those who are trying to shut down Planned Parenthood clinics.

Immigrant rights: King would be pleased by the ties between the civil rights and immigrant rights movements. Ten years ago, a coalition of union, immigrant, faith and civil rights groups organized an Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride. More than 900 riders on buses from nine cities traveled 20,000 miles, in the tradition of the 1960s Freedom Riders, to support immigration reform. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), one of the original Freedom Riders, spoke at a rally when the buses reached New York, declaring: “Martin Luther King would be very proud. We are white, black, Hispanic, Native American — we are one family, in one house, and we are not going to let anybody turn us around.”

Now a much broader coalition is pushing for comprehensive immigration reform, energized by young activists who call themselves Dreamers, a term that evokes King’s 1963 speech. Many of these young people share the values, culture and aspirations of other American youth, but they feel, as King described the typical African American 50 years ago, like “an exile in his own land.”

National spending priorities: By 1965, King had turned against the Vietnam War, arguing that it was stealing precious resources from domestic programs and that it was “an enemy of the poor.” In his last book, “Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?” King wrote, “The bombs in Vietnam explode at home; they destroy the hopes and possibilities for a decent America.” At the time, he called for a comprehensive plan to create jobs, rebuild cities, improve schools and lift the poor out of destitution.

Today, King would probably be working with unions, religious organizations and activist groups such as Code Pink to cut the defense budget and redirect money to help rebuild our cities and social safety net. He’d be speaking out against Congress’s recent cuts to food stamps, Head Start and other anti-poverty programs. In particular, King, who had close ties to the United Auto Workers — once the backbone of a powerful labor movement that helped build the postwar middle class — would be calling on the president and Congress to help revitalize Detroit with loans and grants to create jobs, restore public services and create a smaller but more humane city.

Income inequality and the working poor: A half-century before Occupy Wall Street, King warned about the “gulf between the haves and the have-nots” and insisted that America needed a “better distribution of wealth.” During the final few years of his life, King focused much of his energy on helping low-wage workers fight for rights and respect. He was in Memphis to support striking garbage workers when he was assassinated in April 1968.

Today he would join the growing campaigns to unionize and improve pay and working conditions for workers who earn poverty-level wages. He might disrupt Wal-Mart stockholder meetings to demand that the company pay employees a living wage, join fast-food workers in their nationwide walkout on Aug. 29, and urge consumers to boycott the Gap, Wal-Mart and other companies until they stop manufacturing their products in overseas sweatshops. He’d also be vocal about raising the federal minimum wage, which was one of the demands of the March on Washington.

Housing and predatory lending: Appalled by the slums and blatant residential segregation in our major cities, especially in the North, King lobbied hard for anti-discrimination laws in the 1960s. Today, King would be equally outraged to learn that banks targeted African American and Latino neighborhoods with subprime loans in recent decades. As a result, in the past few years, about one-quarter of black and Latino borrowers have lost their homes to foreclosure or are seriously delinquent on their mortgages, compared with about 12 percent for white borrowers. From 2009 to 2012 African Americans lost about $200 billion in wealth, and the wealth gap between whites and blacks now stands at an astonishing 20 to 1 ratio.

King would find common cause with community groups such as the Home Defenders League and state attorneys general, such as California’s Kamala Harris and New York’s Eric Schneiderman, who are pressuring Wall Street banks to reset mortgages for underwater homeowners. King might link arms with homeowners such as Rose Gudiel of Los Angeles, who, with friends and neighbors at her side in 2011, refused to leave her house when the bank sought to evict her after she missed a few mortgage payments because her brother, who had been helping her, died. Gudiel and her friends occupied the bank’s office and later got arrested at Fannie Mae’s regional office. The bank reset her loan, and she is back in her modest home with her family. But she’s now working with the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment to help other homeowners in similar circumstances. Gudiel was carrying out King’s view that sometimes you have to break an unjust law — and get arrested — to change it.

LGBT equality: Typical of most Americans in the 1950s and 1960s, King did not approve of homosexuality, even though his close adviser Bayard Rustin was openly gay. But when some civil rights leaders objected to Rustin’s role as the key organizer of the March on Washington, worried that it would tarnish the movement, King insisted that Rustin stay in the job.

Since the 1960s, public opinion toward gay Americans has shifted dramatically. Had King encountered more openly gay men and women, his views probably would have evolved as well. After all, when King spoke out against state laws banning interracial marriage in 1958, he sounded a lot like those who advocate for same-sex marriage today: “When any society says that I cannot marry a certain person, that society has cut off a segment of my freedom.”

Today, with the support of the NAACP and a growing number of black clergy members supporting gay rights, King would stand — and sit in when necessary — with the LGBT community to help push states toward legalizing same-sex marriage and ending other forms of discrimination against gay Americans.

The night before he was shot, King spoke at a rally for the striking garbage workers in Memphis. He told the crowd about a bomb threat on his plane from Atlanta that morning, saying he knew that his life was in danger because of his political activism.

“I would like to live a long life,” he said. “Longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain, and I’ve looked over, and I’ve seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land.”

We haven’t gotten there yet. The best way to honor his memory is to continue his struggle for social justice. dreier@oxy.edu

Five myths about the March on Washington

http://money.cnn.com/2013/11/01/smallbusiness/sex-workers-obamacare/index.html,2013-11-01 00:00:00,['Erica Fink'],Sex workers embrace Obamacare,"A burlesque dancer dressed as a nurse taunts her co-performer with a toy syringe, dangling the medicine seductively in an act that's meant to reflect the cat-and-mouse game of U.S. healthcare. They shimmy and eventually end up topless.

The risqué performance was part of an Obamacare registration drive last week in San Francisco, dubbed the ""Healthy Ho's Party.""

Organized by ""Siouxsie Q,"" a Bay Area sex worker, the event was meant to encourage other sex workers to enroll in the new insurance exchanges. It was a rousing success: Nearly 40 men and women attended and almost all of them filed enrollment paperwork.

In the all-cash, off-the-books sex industry, workers can be particularly high risk and insurance is often out of reach. Many sex workers -- a broad term that can refer to a number of services, including sexual massage, prostitution, and escort and dominatrix work -- consider themselves self-employed entrepreneurs who can't afford to purchase healthcare. But that could all change with the Affordable Care Act.

Siouxsie, 28, has shopped for plans countless times since 2008, coming up empty each time. She and her partner recently reviewed their healthcare options and found that a joint plan would have cost between $400 and $500 a month -- an unaffordably large chunk of their incomes.

""We just couldn't swing [insurance] in the Bay Area -- we're lower middle class, recent college graduates, in Startup Land trying to make our way,"" she said.

But come January 1, when the new law goes into effect, she and her partner will be looking at a monthly bill of between $175 and $200. They're deciding between two plans on the California exchange and will receive a tax credit of about $275 a month (without the credit it would have cost nearly $500).

California's exchange site was down the first few times Siouxsie tried to navigate it, but she was able to successfully browse policies several times. (She nevertheless arrived at the party with stacks of paper applications so the night could continue even if the website was disrupted.)

Volunteers from Siouxsie's weekly podcast, The WhoreCast, staffed the event. ""Jolene,"" another sex worker who had already enrolled through the California exchange, was also on hand to talk users through the process. A key detail for the crowd: Enrollment doesn't require users to report their employment.

""I am here mostly to put my skill at filling out bureaucratic forms to use,"" Jolene joked.

Through the California exchange, Jolene will receive a $211 monthly tax credit, which will bring her payments to just $36 a month.

Individuals making less than $46,000 are eligible for a tax credit to offset their monthly costs. Many of the sex workers at the event file W-2s for their legal work, whether it be a part-time job or sex work that falls within the law. Sex workers interviewed by CNNMoney estimated this income to be less than $45,000 a year.

The Affordable Care Act will cover contraception, screening for sexually transmitted infections, and violence counseling at no additional charge, which the sex workers said would make a big difference in their community.

Abortion has to be made funny, the thinking goes, because funny sells on social media, and that’s where one goes to court young people. “You can engage with sarcasm, it’s hard with the abortion issue, but you have to,” said Students for Life President Kristan Hawkins at a breakout panel at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference in Washington today on how to win millennial voters. “Unfortunately we have to, because this is the generation that we’ve been dealt.”

So the way to convince young Americans to join the Republican Party is to make abortion hilarious. Or at least be sarcastic about it. Your abortion-related humor will then get the young folks these days to realize that you are hip and with it and that they really want on board with that whole Gilead-patterened premise of social conservative religious rule, aka Jesus Sharia.

You know something? Screw it. You go for it, folks. I would have paid solid pay-per-view prices to see Mitt Romney standing at the Republican National Convention plastering the audience with some truly top-notch abortion jokes. How many abortions does it take to change a light bulb? A priest, a rabbi and an abortion walk into a bar, and the priest says hey pal, you're an abomination, I can't believe they let you in here. You know, humor.

The premise apparently extends to being anti-gay-marriage as well; nothing attracts the young folks like treating gay people like dirt while also making jokes about it on Twitter. Unfortunately, those ""young people"" are about 12 years old, so they'll have to figure out a way to keep them occupied until voting age. Maybe some fetus-related puppet shows or something.

In the meantime, I think we all need to start preparing an escape plan. The moon is far too boring, and Mars might take a long, long time to terraform, but we've got to at least start considering our options. We're nearing maximum crackpot. This thing's about to go supernova."

The signers are “highly concerned about the heavy attacks that the Russian Federation is facing due to its recent Federal Law…that protects innocence and moral formation of children…”

The signers cite the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that the family is the fundamental unit of society and “is entitled to protection by society and State.”

They assert the new Russian law “protects the innocence of children and the basic rights of their parents recognized in international legislation and treaties.” They also note that the concepts of “sexual orientation and gender identity” are not outlined in the existing binding international treaties and agreements.

Organizations signing the statement come mostly from Europe, but also from the United States and Latin America. Most consider themselves human rights organizations focused on the rights of children and the family.

The statement and large number of signatories challenges the assertion made by gay activists in the United States that the West stands united against the new Russian law.

At the same time that the new statement was released, the Washington Post reports on how the “Russian law isolates gay teenagers.”

Reporter Kathy Lally tells the story of 16-year-old Maxim of Moscow who came out publically as gay at 13-years-old. He says his classmates called him names and that a teacher tried to cut his “longish hair.” A 15 year-old-girl who says she is a lesbian was picked on in her class and then berated when she came out to her mother.

Advocates claim the new law puts these children in further danger since they cannot seek help from adults who could be fined for helping them. Advocates define help in only one way, helping these children continue with the notion they are gay and always will be. But is that the case?

The boy Maxim tells the reporter that he “didn’t become gay. I was born gay.” Someone must have taught him that. An adult taught him that. A child does not come to such a dubious conclusion by himself.

Dr. Paul McHugh, former long-time chief of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University and an emeritus professor there now, tells a different story in an important friend-of-the-court brief he submitted in the Proposition 8/DOMA cases before the US Supreme Court.

From his own professional experience and from the scientific literature he concludes that “sexual orientation is not immutable” and is “not solely an accident of birth.” Further he says that “sexual orientation can and often does change over time.” He also makes the case that “social science experts raise serious doubts about the definability of sexual orientation.”

McHugh’s brief quotes academics friendly to gay rights. Lisa Diamond, writing in Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, says, “There is currently no scientific or popular consensus…that definitively ‘qualify’ an individual as lesbian, gay or bisexual.”

Gail S. Bernstein, who has clinical faculty appointments at the University of Denver School of Professional Psychology and the University of Colorado School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, writes, “Much of the confusion about sexual orientation occurs because there is no single agreed upon definition of the term…there is not one universally accepted definition of sexual orientation, nor who is bisexual, lesbian or gay.”

What about immutability, the thought that someone put in Maxim’s head that he was born gay?

Letitia Anne Peplau and Linda D. Garnets, writing in the Journal of Social Issues, “Although additional research will fill in gaps in our knowledge, there is no reason to expect that biological factors play anything other than a minor and probably indirect role in women’s sexual orientation.” Rather there is “substantial indirect evidence in support of socialization model at the individual level.”

McHugh and others point out that if genetics were the cause of homosexuality then identical twins would always share the same sexual orientation as they always share the same eye color. In fact, only roughly 30% of identical twins share a gay orientation, according to Kenneth Kendler’s paper in the American Journal of Psychiatry.

McHugh cites a plethora of academic research concluding that, “…sexual orientation is influenced by a variety of factors beyond genetics or biology alone.”

And the most recent statement from the American Psychiatric Association concludes, “Currently there is renewed interest in searching for biological etiologies for homosexuality. However, to date there are no replicated studies supporting any specific biological etiology for homosexuality.”

And what about permanence? Is homosexuality life-long? Once you discover your same-sex desire, does it never change? I am not talking here about therapy to alleviate unwanted same-sex attraction. Rather, academic research shows that quite separate from any such outside influence, that homosexuality is remarkably plastic.

Writing in the Journal of Social Issues, Lisa Diamond and Ritch Savin-Williams write, “Contrary to the notion that most sexual minorities undergo a one time discovery of their true identities, 50% of respondents had changed their identity label more than once since first relinquishing their heterosexual identity.”

Writing in Developmental Psychology Lisa Diamond found “Half of the young women…relinquished the first sexual-minority they adopted.” In fact, a “10-year study of 79 non-heterosexual women reported that 67% changed their identity at least once and 36% changed their identity more than once.”

So, who is supposed to be talking to Maxim about such a complicated and thorny issue? Should it be gay advocates who have an ax to grind? Certainly, they would like to increase their tribe. And often they do this using phony science that says homosexuality is inborn and never changing.

The Russian people, supported by 100 human rights and other groups from around the world, have determined that such unscientific ideologues should be kept out of schools and out of sight of school children, and that the proper teacher for Maxim and others like him are those who love him most, his family.

Finally there is the question of the certitude of 16-year-olds. They are absolutely certain about a great many things. All of us were certain of things at 16 that seem crazy to us now. But, we grow and we change a great many things in our lives.

No doubt buoyed by sketchy adult advice, young Maxim is certain he wants to be with men and that he always will. But science shows that this question is vastly more complicated than that. Like all young people, Maxim deserves space to grow and learn and change and to be free from ideologies that may not have his best interests in mind."

The primates held the first conference in Jerusalem in 2008, five years after openly gay New Hampshire Bishop Gene Robinson was consecrated in the Episcopal Church. The action threw the communion into disarray.

At the Jerusalem meeting, the primates called for the creation of an Anglican province in North America to rival the Episcopal Church. Five years later, the primates say the new Anglican province, known as the Anglican Church in North America, is thriving.

Now, the archbishop of Nigeria and archbishops in East Africa have organized the second Global Anglican Future Conference at which they hope to accelerate the process that began in Jerusalem. The so-called GAFCON II meeting will take place Oct. 21-26 in Nairobi.

“We have succeeded in consolidation,” said Ugandan Anglican Archbishop Stanley Ntagali.

“Anglican churches have been planted in North America. The clergy trust one another to preach according to the Bible,” he said. “But the crisis in the communion continues to deepen as more (homosexual) consecrations occur.”

In addition to the consecration of gay bishops, the African primates are concerned with the growing acceptance of same-sex unions in the West. They say attempts to discipline the Episcopal Church were not successful, and, as a result, a “spiritual cancer” has spread to other provinces, including the Anglican Church of Canada, the Church of England, the Scottish Episcopal Church, the Church in Wales, and the Anglican Church of Southern Africa.

In their words, GAFCON II seeks to restore good order, theological integrity and biblical faithfulness.

“We need to see the overthrow by some churches of the creation order of female and male as just one symptom of the disease,” wrote Kenyan Anglican Archbishop Eliud Wabukala, chairman of the GAFCON primates’ council in a letter to the conference dated Thursday (Aug. 22). “The cause is spiritual.”

The primates remain optimistic that Archbishop Justin Welby, the new global leader of the Anglican Communion, may prevent a split since he is on record as being opposed to gay consecrations.

“The primates are happy with Welby since he has been attending our meetings,” said Ntagali. “He has taken time to follow what we are doing and he understands we are not breaking the communion.”

Amid the disclosure that the federal government has systematically obtained massive amounts of Verizon phone records, a new poll shows that a preponderant majority of adults already fear that their private communications are no longer private. Americans believe their cell-phone, e-mail, and other communications history is more likely to be accessed without their consent than any other form of sensitive personal information, the latest Allstate/National Journal Heartland Monitor Poll has found.

In the poll, 85 percent of adults surveyed said it was likely that their ""communications history, like phone calls, e-mails, and Internet use,"" was ""available for businesses, government, individuals, and other groups to access without your consent."" That was a higher percentage than believed that any other kind of private information, such as medical and financial records, is being obtained without their approval. The survey, which was conducted just before the controversy erupted over the National Security Agency's access to Verizon phone records (although not actual conversations), will be released in full on June 13.

A solid majority of Americans opposes a broad national right to same-sex marriage, saying the power to legalize gay unions should rest with the states — even as most support marriage equality for gay people, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.

On national security, Americans expressed strong skepticism about taking the lead in trying to solve overseas conflicts, but support for action against Iran if it is on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon. The public continues to support the Obama administration’s use of unmanned drone aircraft; 72 percent back their use against people suspected of being terrorists, but 66 percent are concerned the drone program suffers from “not enough oversight.” The poll found mistrust of the federal government, amid national debate about whether it has grown too intrusive; in subsequent interviews, several respondents said the federal government should stay out of private lives, and one cited the recent scandal at the Internal Revenue Service, which has acknowledged targeting Tea Party conservatives, in arguing marriage should be left to the states. “The federal government is too involved in too many personal things that they don’t need to be involved in,” said Frances Narramore, 75, a retired teacher in Arizona, who calls herself an independent. “Just look at what’s happening at the I.R.S., and you see what I mean by that.”

The disclosure has reignited longstanding debates in the US over the proper extent of the government's domestic spying powers. Ron Wyden of Oregon, a member of the Senate intelligence committee who, along with Udell, has expressed concern about the extent of US government surveillance, warned of ""sweeping, dragnet surveillance"". He said: ""I am barred by Senate rules from commenting on some of the details at this time, However, I believe that when law-abiding Americans call their friends, who they call, when they call, and where they call from is private information. ""Collecting this data about every single phone call that every American makes every day would be a massive invasion of Americans' privacy.""

By far the most disingenuous, however, was Jim Sensenbrenner, who (as he has emphasized to the credulous journalists who served as his stenographers today) wrote the PATRIOT Act, who has remained in a senior position on House Judiciary Committee since that day, and who now claims to be shocked — shocked! — there is dragnet collection going on in the casino he built.

Though American officials said they remained concerned about the invective flowing from North Korea — and South Korea’s president ordered military commanders to carry out a swift and strong response to any provocations — the Obama administration took pains to emphasize the “disconnect” between Mr. Kim’s “rhetoric and action.”

The White House’s strategy, officials said, was calculated to ease tensions after a fraught few days in which Mr. Kim threatened to rain missiles on the American mainland and the United States responded by flying nuclear-capable bombers over the Korean Peninsula.

“We are not seeing changes to the North Korean military posture such as large-scale mobilizations or positioning of forces,” said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. “What that disconnect between rhetoric and action means, I’ll leave to the analysts to judge.”"

But Sprigg and other evangelicals say changing attitudes toward homosexuality have created a new victim: closeted Christians who believe the Bible condemns homosexuality but will not say so publicly for fear of being labeled a hateful bigot.

“In the current culture, it takes more courage for someone like Chris Broussard to speak out than for someone like Jason Collins to come out,” says Sprigg, a former pastor. “The media will hail someone who comes out of the closet as gay, but someone who simply expresses their personal religious views about homosexual conduct is attacked.”

Oh boy! So the breakdown as far as I can see is groups like the Family Research Council really want to have bigoted views and talk about them a lot -- in their case, in the context of advocating for actually damaging, actually discriminatory policy initiatives. They just don't want to be called on it. Fun fact: You can believe whatever you want to believe and advocate for whatever social policies you see fit. However, if those beliefs and social policies are hateful and bigoted, you may in fact be called a hateful bigot. The Bible does not provide a mystic force field that protects you from criticism. You'd think that biblical literalists would have a better understanding of cause and effect. Unfortunately not. But Sprigg continued:I've already written about Chris Broussard's views about Jason Collins at length . But suffice it to say, you can't pick which parts of the Bible you decide you want to follow. For example, never saying one word about the morals of an entire sports league notorious for pre-marital and extra-marital sex, but once an athlete comes out as gay, feeling the need to pontificate on what does or doesn't make a ""true Christian."" But I digress. More importantly, the fact that anyone would think it's easier for Mr. Broussard to ""come out"" as a person who thinks homosexuality is wrong versus Mr. Collins' actually coming out is laughable.

There's a reason that it's taken so long for a man to step forward as the first openly gay athlete in one of the major sports. There's also a reason why the person who stepped forward is nearing or at the end of his career. Besides the media circus and having millions of strangers suddenly keenly interested in your intimate life, there are downsides like it's still perfectly legal to fire someone in most of the United States for simply being gay (further fun fact: the FRC is predictably adamant in its defense of those laws). And if that weren't enough, there's a real potential for violence. According to the LA Times, hate crimes against LGBT people are on the rose by 13% from 2009-2010. Among that group minorities were even more likely to be targeted. 2011 saw the highest number of anti-gay murders ever reported. Yes, yes, what courage Mr. Broussard had. He should get a medal because by espousing bigoted claims, some think him an asshole. If only he had it as easy as Jason Collins.

If I were a betting man, I would put $0.00 or less on the table for the possibility that facts, reason, logic or actual cudgels could be used effectively to beat any sense into the FRC or their mouth-breathing fanbase. Haters, as the saying goes, gonna hate. The most obnoxious part of this conversation to me is that a major media news outlet not owned by Rupert Murdoch -- CNN, ever the fucking baby-splitter -- is giving wide-eyed, credulous airtime to these ludicrous and offensive claims as if they are a meaningful part of an ongoing social conversation. There are a ton of interesting ways to cover the changing attitudes in America toward homosexuality and what that means for our past, present and future as a nation. But when the team representing the Obviously Wrong Side of History insists on having a little bitchfit about how they're the ones now being oppressed, this is not a reason for raising the alarm and slamming on the brakes for some soulful reflection on empirically idiotic claims. This is the time to play those people a very sad song on the world's tiniest little violin -- and let the rest of us dance into the future."

However, when asked by Fox News host Greta Van Susteren if Robertson's remarks were offensive and whether or not she had any objection as to how he worded his comments, Palin said she didn't know what Robertson had actually said, Politico reports.

“I haven’t read the article. I don’t know exactly how he said it,” Palin explained on Fox News’s “On the Record With Greta Van Susteren"" on Monday.

On December 18, shortly after the ""Duck Dynasty"" controversy began, Palin took to Facebook where she wrote, ""Free speech is an endangered species. Those 'intolerants' hatin and taking on the Duck Dynasty patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us.""





Palin's comment drew over 428,000 likes on the social network. Robertson's original comments in GQ expressed his opinions on homosexuality, including that he sees it as sinfin, akin to bestiality.

Via GQ.com:

""'Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men,' he says. Then he paraphrases Corinthians: 'Don't be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers—they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. Don't deceive yourself. It's not right.'""

Robertson also made some graphic comments about homosexuals.

Again, via GQ.com:

""It seems like, to me, a vagina—as a man—would be more desirable than a man's anus,"" Robertson was quoted as saying. ""That's just me. I'm just thinking: There's more there! She's got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I'm saying?""

An online petition seeking Robertson's reinstatement on the A&E reality show has over 200,000 signatures. On Saturday, restaurant chain Cracker Barrel pulled all ""Duck Dynasty"" merchandise from its shelves. However, a day later, the restaurant reversed course after customers threatened a boycott.

Story continues

Via Forbes.com:

""'When we made the decision to remove and evaluate certain Duck Dynasty items, we offended many of our loyal customers,' a statement explained. 'You told us we made a mistake… You wrote, you called, and you took to social media to express your thoughts and feelings. You flat-out told us we were wrong. We listened. Today, we are putting all our Duck Dynasty products back in our stores. And we apologize for offending you.'""

Partners became spouses following the decision by a U.S. judge that the state’s ban was illegal.

A fresh battle over same-sex marriage in conservative Utah, the heart of Mormon country, has offered gay-rights advocates hope that their effort has reached a national tipping point.

The judge who struck down the state’s same-sex marriage ban refused to stay his own ruling Monday, beating back the third challenge in two days to his Friday ruling declaring the state’s ban unconstitutional. Utah is expected to take its appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver, but in the meantime hundreds of same-sex couples continued to get married at Salt Lake City’s county courthouse.

Judge Robert J. Shelby’s ruling is particularly significant because it represents the first time a federal court has ruled on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage bans since the Supreme Court struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act in June. The ruling will serve as a precedent for other states facing challenges to their bans, and it sets the stage for a Supreme Court decision that would apply to all 50 states.

“This case could decide the issue of same-sex marriage across the United States of America,” said Clifford Rosky, a University of Utah professor of law and expert on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender legal issues.

Also on Monday, in a far narrower ruling, a federal judge in Ohio declared that state’s ban on gay marriage unconstitutional, though the ruling only applied to death certificates for gay couples. Still, it is expected to be precedent-setting, leading to more lawsuits in Ohio challenging the ban.

Eighteen states and the District of Columbia now allow same-sex marriage.

Several observers believed that Shelby’s decision — clearing the way for same-sex marriages in one of the country’s most politically and religiously conservative states, one dominated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — represents a pivotal point for the country.

One of the strongest indicators of the broader cultural shift on the issue is the growing acceptance of legal recognition of gay unions among Mormons.

According to a recent poll by the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young University, 54 percent of Mormons now favor civil unions for same-sex couples, and opposition to any legal recognition has dropped from 69 percent in 2004 — when state voters approved the ban — to 38 percent now.

The church is clear about its stance. “Marriage should be between a man and a woman,” it said plainly in a three-sentence statement following Friday’s ruling. But that statement reflected a change in tone that church leaders have been trying to strike since the church faced a storm of criticism for urging members to actively push and fund California’s Proposition 8, which briefly banned same-sex marriage there.

“Certainly they’ve stepped back from the public perspective on this,” says Ryan T. Cragun, a University of Tampa professor of sociology focusing on Mormonism. “[But] they’ve still been very opposed.”

The church, he said, still contributes to protecting traditional marriage in less-public ways, such as working with partner organizations.

But while its opposition to same-sex marriage may be unchanged, the Mormon Church’s statements on homosexuality are shifting, albeit in nuanced ways. On Mormonsandgays.com, a church Web site started a year ago outlining doctrine on homosexuality, the church states that being attracted to someone of the same sex is not a sin, though acting on it is still considered sinful.

“Even though individuals do not choose to have such attractions, they do choose how to respond to them,” the Web site reads. “With love and understanding, the Church reaches out to all God’s children, including our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters.”

Thirty years ago, being homosexual was in itself grounds for excommunication, said Greg Prince, a national director of Affirmation, a support group for LGBT Mormons and their families and friends. Now, he said, there are gay Mormon missionaries who are open about their sexual orientation; so long as they remain celibate, the church does not care, he said.

Besides recognizing what a public relations disaster the church’s support of Proposition 8 was, Prince said, the attitudes of many Mormons have been shaped by scientific research showing people are born gay instead of choosing it. Many Mormons also were moved to question their attitudes by a well-publicized study of homeless Mormon teens in Salt Lake City, which showed a large number of them had been kicked out of their parents’ homes for being gay, he said.

“Though the percentage of Mormons in Utah who favor gay marriage lags behind the national percentage, it’s a moving target,” he said. “We certainly have changed the way we view homosexuality, and the way we view homosexuals in our church.”

Salt Lake County Clerk Sherrie Swensen said more than 400 same-sex marriage licenses were issued Friday and Monday.

On Monday, hundreds of gay couples had flocked to county clerk offices around Utah seeking to get marriage licenses. In Salt Lake City, gay and lesbian couples began lining up Sunday night. More than a dozen clergy from different denominations set up tables in the lobby and performed on-the-spot weddings. Every two minutes or so, another couple left the building to the sound of jubilant cheers from well-wishers.

Among them were Kody Lee Partridge and Laurie Wood, Utah natives who were both raised as Mormons and graduated from Brigham Young University. The women were among three couples who were plaintiffs in the lawsuit Shelby decided on Friday, overturning Utah’s ban.

Wood recalled how she and Partridge applied for a marriage license in March and were rejected. The clerk was apologetic, Wood said, and suggested they hold on to their application a little while longer. After the judge’s ruling Friday, Wood said, the clerk recognized them in the courthouse and told them with a smile, “I guess you didn’t have to wait as long as you thought.” Wood and Partridge were married in the courthouse by an American Baptist minister who had heard about the ruling and rushed down hoping to officiate at someone’s wedding.

Partridge, who teaches high school English, said parents of her students gave the couple flowers and champagne, and many of her former students sent e-mails congratulating them.

“What a difference 10 years makes,” said Wood, 58. “Utah’s being exposed as a pretty great state. It’s so conservative. But it’s changing. It may have to be dragged into the 21st century, but it’s going to go there.”

“It’s a different state,” said Partridge, 47, who is descended from a prominent Mormon bishop.

The Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young University has been tracking views on gay marriage in Utah for a decade in opinion polls that show a dramatic shift in attitudes since then.

In 2004, the year Utah voters approved a measure defining marriage as between a man and a woman, 54 percent of all Utah residents said they disapproved of any legal recognition of a gay couple’s relationship, including civil unions. Now, that opposition has dropped to 29 percent.

“Both nationally and even in Utah, there’s a generational difference,” said Kelly Patterson, a BYU political scientist who put the results on his blog, utahdatapoints.com. “It’s the younger members of both Republicans and the LDS faith who are driving a lot of this change.”

An estimated 47,000 to 63,000 residents of Utah are gay, lesbian or bisexual, according to a 2010 analysis of census data done by the Williams Institute, a think tank at UCLA’s law school that studies gay issues and law. About 3,800 identified themselves in census surveys as unmarried partners. More than half live in or around Salt Lake City."

Ya got your work cut out for you, Reince

A Michigan member of the Republican National Committee said Thursday he will not resign after posting an article critical of gay people on his Facebook page, despite calls from members of his own party that he step down. Dave Agema, who served as a state representative from 2007 until December posted an excerpt from an article titled ""Everyone Should Know These Statistics On Homosexuals"" on his Facebook page Wednesday. A group of 21 Michigan Republicans, including local precinct delegates and members of the University of Michigan College Republicans, has called it ""deplorable.""

The big problem Republicans face in trying to rebrand their party as more tolerant and inclusive is, of course, all the damn Republicans The so-called article was in fact just a particularly vile and hateful screed , claiming things like ""part of the homosexual agenda is to get the public to affirm their filthy lifestyle,"" that gay Americans are obsessed with ""recruiting children"" and so forth. This also is a good representation of how the party base operates, which is to base all of their deep policy decisions on ""obviously insane stuff they read on Facebook."" Anyway, the Michigan party chair and Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus both had to come out with new statements about treating people with dignity and respect and so on, though I'm almost positive they just have a form letter for that by now.

How many of these stories have we had, just in the last few days? Priebus brags about a new effort to spend $10 million for outreach in minority communities, a number which probably is going to need to be doubled after Don Young's foul ""wetbacks"" comments on Thursday. He might get more bang for the buck if he spends that kind of money on Shutting Your Damn Trap lessons for all current members of the Republican hierarchy. Or not; it's not clear it's a lesson any of them could learn, no matter how much effort you put into it.

Gilmore said Parrish can provide the ethics panel documentary evidence that Sorenson was paid $7,500 a month to work on Bachmann's campaign, money that was funneled to him indirectly through C&M Strategies, a Colorado-based company controlled by Bachmann fundraiser Guy Short.

Parrish's willingness to go public against his former employer and political mentor is likely to send shock waves through Minnesota GOP circles, where both he and his attorney are well-known figures. Parrish served as deputy campaign manager of last year's unsuccessful effort to pass a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage. Gilmore is a well-known conservative blogger.

Parrish is the former CoS. Gilmore is his lawyer. The money came from Bachmann's independent PAC, which makes it almost impossible for her to claim innocence - not that reality and logic have much to do with her speech.The Minnesota GOP has some problems, oh yes they do. And that's what happens when one of the leading figures in the state party is a lunatic grifter ... come to think of it, that really doesn't narrow it down to Minnesota.

Michele has other problems than making illegal payments to Mr. Sorenson. Sorenson allegedly stole a proprietary mailing list from a volunteer's computer, and the police are investigating that. Congressional investigators are looking into her conflating her book tour and her Presidential campaign - good thing Newt Gingrich is no longer in Congress.

It will be a sad day for Kossacks when Michele Bachmann retires from Congress. Who will take her place as the March to Madness champion of the GOP? Only time will tell! There are certainly no shortage of candidates in the party for which facts are optional.

And somehow, this reminds me of Ms. Bachmann's modus operandi.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, seen here lecturing others about their 'values'

""Sadly, in a culture infected with political correctness, people of faith are targeted for defending their beliefs with no consideration of their First Amendment rights. I will continue to stand with my fellow Texans in defending our God-given, constitutionally protected freedoms.""

Given the caliber of political mind Texas Republicans seem intent on foisting off onto the rest of us, non-Texans might be curious as to what sorts of people they've tapped for state government of late. The simple answer is ""more of the same,"" as the responses to an AP questionnaire on gay rights sent to GOP candidates for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general revealed. Lt. Gov. Dewhurst sets the tone Yes, yes. Why are we even talking about civil rights for gay Americans when people of faith are the real victims here. It's getting so you can't even show your love for Jesus by calling someone names and beating them up anymore.

GOP gubbernatorial candidate Tom Pauken:



""Current statutes adequately address the issue of equality before the law and I would oppose laws that provide preferential treatments based on lifestyle choices.""

Unless that lifestyle choice is my own, in which case all the rules will be written to support that and only that.

Attorney general candidate Ken Paxton:



""I do not believe in elevating sexual 'rights' to be superior to religious freedom and freedom of conscience. Such rights are enumerated nowhere in the Texas or U.S. Constitution, unlike religious freedom ...

Again, the victimhood is palpable. You having your rights will automatically infringe on my right to believe you shouldn't have that, so you shouldn't have that. Each candidate seems to have set out to make the laziest, dullest argument possible as point of personal conservative pride.

We shall see if Texas demographics begin to reverse the tide of celebrated Republican dullardism that has turned state politicians into national laughingstocks. Republicans are highly devoted to making sure that doesn't happen, but I remain confident that at some point the party will elect someone to office who is so stone-cold stupid, such an obvious empty sack, such an impressive specimen of termite-riddled fencepost that the entire state shudders in embarrassment and begins to rethink their party lifestyle choice en masse. It would have to be someone meaner than Steve Stockman and dumber than Louie Gohmert and—well, I forget the third thing—but do not worry about that. Somewhere in Texas there is a very drunk and bitter man sleeping it off under a church pew who fits all those requirements and then some. Get to it, Republicans. Find that final mean, stupid, godbothering anti-science crank who can out-crook and under-whelm all the rest of them. It is your destiny.

Christie%2C a Catholic%2C vetoed a bill to recognize gay marriages

He endorses having a referendum on the same-sex marriage

Advocates say marriage is a civil right that should not be ruled by majority vote

As activists push states to recognize gay marriages, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — conservative Republican governor in a blue state and a 2016 presidential possibility — is walking a fine line between two electorates and two elections.

Christie vetoed same-sex marriage legislation last year and severely criticized the Supreme Court's decision striking down a ban on federal rights for same-sex married couples. At the same time, he is ""adamant'' that same-sex couples deserve equal legal protection, wants a referendum on gay marriage, and vows to abide by a same-sex marriage law if the voters approve it.

He's tiptoeing between constituencies. First are the voters of New Jersey: polls show they favor same-sex marriage, and Christie wants them to reelect him in November by a big margin. Then there are Republican caucus-goers in Iowa. Christie needs their backing if he runs for president in 2016; in 2012, evangelical conservatives, who generally oppose gay marriage, made up 57% of Republican caucusgoers in the state, according to exit polls.

And there is a third group of voters to think about: swing voters across the nation, who might go for a Republican presidential nominee who is sufficiently centrist.

To appeal to those voters, Christie ""will want to not be perceived to be as far right as many Republicans are,'' says David Boaz of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. ""That's a lot of tightropes to walk.''

Christie, who is Roman Catholic, has said he does not believe being gay is a choice, nor is it a sin, and that he has gay friends who argue the issue with him. Marriage, he said last year on CNN, is ""special and unique in society.'' He followed his veto in of the gay-marriage bill in February 2012 with a call for a statewide referendum on whether to allow same-sex marriage by constitutional amendment.

""When you want to change the core of a 2,000 year-old institution, the way to do that is to put it in front of the voters,'' he told reporters July 2.

A referendum would allow same-sex marriage to pass in New Jersey without his fingerprints — or as he said at a town-hall-style meeting last month: ""I don't have to compromise my principles that I believe in and someone else doesn't have to compromise theirs.''

Christie is in the same position as his party. The Republican platform says marriage is only for couples of different sexes, but Chairman Reince Priebus has said that the Republican Party should be open to those who favor same-sex marriage. ""I don't believe we need to act like Old Testament heretics,"" he told USA TODAY in March. Instead, Republicans ""have to strike a balance between principle and grace and respect.''

Garden State Equality, a leading advocate for same-sex marriage in New Jersey, opposes a referendum saying civil rights should not be on the ballot. ""It should never be up to the majority to vote on the rights of the minority,'' spokesman T.J. Helmstetter said.

Same-sex marriage advocates are now lobbying New Jersey legislators to override Christie's veto before the end of the year, when the window to do so expires. Christie is too powerful a party leader to let that happen, says Ben Dworkin, director of Rider University's Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics.

""I can't envision a situation where the Republican votes that are needed to get the two-thirds override would come, given this administration's history,'' Dworkin says. ""The Christie administration sees no reason why any Republican should really ever override a Republican governor. That's their logic, so I'd be shocked if it ever got to happen.""

Last year, Christie nominated a gay judge (a Republican) to the state Supreme Court, a first for the state. Last month, when the Supreme Court ruled on Defense of Marriage Act, he called it ""insulting"" to the Congress and president which passed the law.

Troy Stevenson, executive director of Garden State Equality, said, ""I don't like to pretend I can get inside the mind of the governor, but I think the closer we get to him having future political ambitions the more staunch his opposition gets to marriage equality.""

But Jimmy LaSalvia, a founder of GOProud, a Republican gay-rights group that favors same-sex marriage, gives Christie credit for not trying to change the subject. ""He's one Republican who doesn't say 'I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. We need jobs and the economy is hurting,''' says LaSalvia, who now works with the ACLU trying to pass same-sex marriage state by state. ""He's willing to talk through the issue in a way that no other Republican has the balls to do.''

Christie has to make his political calculus now, even though ""he doesn't know how much public opinion will change between now and 2016,'' Boaz says. ""Will people be more liberal then? Is the country? Yes. But the Republican primary electorate, maybe not so much.''

Public opinion on gay marriage has changed rapidly. Four years ago, 37% of Americans favored same-sex marrage. Now, 51% do, according to the Pew Research Center.

Iowa and New Hampshire, traditionally the first states to hold presidential nominating contests, both allow same-sex marriage – which could mean voters there no longer focus on it as an issue. ""Those people in those states have been living with (same-sex marriage) for a while,'' LaSalvia says. ""I don't think any of us knows how the issue is going to play in 2016 because it's moving so fast.'' An October poll sponsored by the Iowa Republican, a news site, showed Iowans favor gay marriage 49% to 42%.

Iowa has allowed gays to marry since a 2009 state Supreme Court decision – and voters remain conflicted about it, says pollster Ann Selzer, who conducts the Iowa Poll for the Des Moines Register, ""You ask them on the street and nobody can say that their lives have been affected. But you ask them if they like it and they don't.'' In a poll taken a month after the 2012 caucuses, 64% of Republicans favored a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage."

After the arrest the senator denied any sexual intent, and in a statement issued Monday afternoon he attributed the matter to a misunderstanding.

“At the time of this incident, I complained to the police that they were misconstruing my actions,” Mr. Craig said in the statement. “I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct.

“I should have had the advice of counsel in resolving this matter. In hindsight, I should not have pled guilty. I was trying to handle this matter myself quickly and expeditiously.”

Mr. Craig also severed ties Monday with the Republican presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, in which he had been serving as a co-liaison to the Senate with Senator Robert F. Bennett of Utah. The Romney campaign issued a statement that said: “Senator Craig has stepped down from his role with the campaign. He did not want to be a distraction, and we accept his decision.”

Mr. Craig, whose seat is up for election next year, is the second senator in recent weeks to find his personal behavior under scrutiny. Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, was implicated in a separate case in the Washington area when his phone number turned up in the records of an escort service that the authorities have described as a prostitution ring. Mr. Vitter made a public apology for what he called “a very serious sin in my past,” but he has not been charged with any crime."
http://news.yahoo.com/civil-rights-case-vs-zimmerman-wont-simple-072336718.html,,[],Civil rights case vs. Zimmerman won't be simple,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Calls for the Justice Department to look into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin reverberated as soon as George Zimmerman was acquitted of state charges in a Florida courtroom, but it may be even tougher to mount a federal case against Zimmerman.

The department says it's reviewing evidence to determine whether criminal civil rights charges are warranted, but legal experts see major barriers to a federal prosecution — including the burden of proving that Zimmerman, the former neighborhood watch leader, was motivated by racial animosity — and say Justice officials would likely be saddled with some of the same challenges that complicated the unsuccessful state case.

""The Justice Department would face significant challenges in bringing a federal civil rights case against Mr. Zimmerman,"" said Alan Vinegrad, the former U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York. ""There are several factual and legal hurdles that federal prosecutors would have to overcome: They'd have to show not only that the attack was unjustified, but that Mr. Zimmerman attacked Mr. Martin because of his race and because he was using a public facility, the street.""

The department opened an investigation into Martin's death last year but stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed. It said in a statement Sunday that the criminal section of its civil rights division, the FBI and federal prosecutors in Florida are continuing to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation, plus evidence and testimony from the state trial. The statement came as the NAACP and others called on the Justice Department to open a civil rights case against Zimmerman for the shooting death of the unarmed black 17-year-old.

Zimmerman was acquitted Saturday night in a February 2012 shooting that tapped into a national debate about racial profiling, equal justice and self-defense. Civil rights leaders, Martin's parents and many others said Zimmerman had racially profiled Martin when he followed the teenager through a gated townhouse community and shot him, but Zimmerman said he was physically assaulted by Martin and shot the teenager in self-defense.

Story continues

Though the Justice Department does have an established history of using federal civil rights laws to try to convict defendants who have been previously acquitted in related state cases, experience shows it's almost never easy getting guilty verdicts in such high-profile prosecutions. In this case, federal prosecutors pursuing a civil rights case would need to establish, among other things, that Zimmerman was motivated by racial animosity, even though race was barely mentioned at the state trial.

Lauren Resnick, a former federal prosecutor in New York who secured a conviction in the killing of an Orthodox Jew during the 1991 Crown Heights riots in Brooklyn, said the Justice Department could conceivably proceed under a theory that Zimmerman interfered with Martin's right to walk down a public street based on his race. But even that is difficult since the conflict occurred in a gated community, which may not fit the legal definition of a public facility. Prosecutors would also probably need to prove that trailing Martin on the street constituted interference, she said.

""One could argue it did, if it freaked him out and he couldn't comfortably walk down the street — there's an argument here,"" said Resnick, who now specializes in white-collar defense and commercial litigation.

But she said federal prosecutors were likely to encounter the same hurdles as state prosecutors in establishing that Zimmerman was driven by racial animus and was the initial aggressor, as opposed to someone who acted in self-defense.

""When you have a fact pattern where one person's alive, and one person's not, and the person alive is the efendant, it's hard to prove things beyond a reasonable doubt,"" she said.

Samuel Bagenstos, a former No. 2 official in the Justice Department's civil rights division, said: ""This is an administration that hasn't shied away from bringing hate crimes cases that are solid prosecutions based on the facts and the law, but from what I've seen this would be a very difficult case to prosecute federally because the government would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that George Zimmerman acted because of Trayvon Martin's race. If you're trying to prove racial motivation, you are usually looking for multiple statements related to why he is engaging in this act of violence. I think it's a difficult case to prove.""

Another federal case, the Rodney King prosecution, illustrates just how difficult it can be for the federal government to come in behind a state prosecution that ended in acquittal, even when there's videotaped evidence of the crime.

King was beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers after a high-speed car chase in 1991, but the four police officers charged in the incident were acquitted on state charges of assault with a deadly weapon and three of the four were acquitted on a charge of use of excessive force. The jury deadlocked on the excessive force charge against the fourth officer.

Federal prosecutors obtained an indictment on charges of violating King's civil rights. Two of the officers were found guilty and were imprisoned. The other two officers were acquitted.

In a 1970 prosecution, the Justice Department charged three white Detroit police officers and one black private security guard with allegedly conspiring to deprive eight black youths and two white girls of their civil rights during the 1967 riots in Detroit.

The officers had gone to the Algiers Motel in a reported search for snipers. Three black teenagers were slain at the motel. One of the police officers had been acquitted earlier of a state charge of first-degree murder in the case; another officer had been found innocent in a separate state trial on a charge of felonious assault.

The federal case took place in Flint, Mich., an hour's drive north of Detroit, after the defense complained that the defendants could not get a fair trial in the city where the slayings occurred. A jury acquitted all four defendants.

In prosecuting the law enforcement officers, the Justice Department invoked an 1871 civil rights law. Prosecutors alleged that the officers had lined up the people staying at the motel and slugged them with clubs and rifle butts. There was testimony that several of the guests were taken into separate rooms where shotguns were fired into the ceiling in an effort to get those in a nearby hallway to disclose the identity of the alleged snipers and the location of firearms.

In a defense that turned out to be successful, defense attorneys emphasized that the charge against their clients was conspiracy, not assault, coercion, intimidation or murder. Lawyers for the two officers previously charged in the state cases also argued that their clients were being charged with serious criminality even though they had already been acquitted."

Rev. Al Sharpton calls verdict %22an atrocity%22

NAACP urges Justice Department to pursue civil rights charges against Zimmerman

Leaders appeal for calm

Angry civil rights groups on Sunday were pressing for new criminal charges following George Zimmerman's acquittal on second-degree murder and manslaughter in a Florida courtroom.

The NAACP website featured an online petition -- also posted on the liberal site MoveOn.org -- asking the Justice Department to bring federal charges against Zimmerman in the February 2012 fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin.

""The most fundamental of civil rights — the right to life — was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,"" the petition says. ""We ask that the Department of Justice file civil rights (criminal) charges against Mr. Zimmerman for this egregious violation.""

Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson issued a statement Sunday saying federal prosecutors were continuing to review evidence in the case, including testimony from the state trial.

""Prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate,"" Iverson said.

Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, pressed for those charges, blasting the state verdict as a ""tragic miscarriage of justice."" She also urged Trayvon's family to pursue a civil lawsuit.

""No matter how you look at this situation, if it were not for the actions of Mr. Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin would still be alive with his family today,"" Arnwine said.

She said she hoped the verdict would spark a national conversation about racial profiling and the ""broken criminal justice system.""

After the verdict was announced Saturday night, a clearly shaken NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said, ""This is a heartbreaking moment. This will confirm for many that the only problem with the New South is it occupies the same time and space as the old South.""

He referenced another killing of a black youth that many have compared to the Trayvon Martin slaying, the 1955 killing of 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was killed in Mississippi for allegedly flirting with a white woman. ""Trayvon Martin's case has focused a generation the same way that the Emmett Till case focused a generation 60 years ago. I had hoped that this time we would get a verdict that fit the gravity of the case.""

The Rev. Al Sharpton, who led thousands of protesters in Sanford seeking a prosecution of Trayvon's killer, called the verdict ""a sad day in the country"" and ""a slap in the face to those that believe in justice in this country.""

""I think this is an atrocity,"" Sharpton said. ""It is probably one of the worst situations that I have seen.""

Jesse Jackson called the verdict ""Old South justice.""

""I'm disappointed and I'm saddened for the family,"" Jackson said.

While the jury's verdict was a crushing blow for many, there were no reports of serious unrest by early Sunday morning. Authorities in Martin's hometown of Miami and in Miami Gardens, where his father lives, said the streets were quiet.

Demonstrators took to the streets of four California cities, and there were reports of protesters breaking windows and damaging cars in Oakland, officials said early Sunday.

In Chicago, about 40 people chanted ""Justice for Trayvon!"" as they marched through the streets Saturday evening, according to The Chicago Tribune.

In Sanford, Tristan Bailey, 15, who was outside the Seminole County courthouse, was stunned after hearing the verdict. ""I don't know what to say,"" said the teen, who identifies with Trayvon Martin. ""He was just a teen, trying to live his dreams.""

Shannon Mickey, 41, was also disappointed. ""We were all nervous when we knew the verdict was coming down,"" Mickey said. ""It was a sense of shock. And unbelievable sadness.""

In Detroit, the Rev. Charles Williams II, president of the National Action Network of Michigan and pastor of Detroit's Historic King Solomon Baptist Church, said he planned a special prayer service at the church to pray for the Martin family.

""In the South, it's still hard for an African American to get justice,"" Williams said. ""Mr. Zimmerman deserved at least manslaughter and the jury wouldn't even do that. There is not faith in the jurors or in the diversity of the process.""

Williams said that National Action Network will examine legal options. ""We're going to continue our calls for justice for Trayvon Martin,"" he said.

In Fort Myers, Fla., people voiced feelings of anger, dismay and concern about keeping the peace immediately following the verdict.

""Oh my goodness, this is unreal to me. I'm very upset,"" said Antoinette Anderson, 48, a school district employee who is African American. ""It shows we're not equal in the justice system.""

Joe D'Alessandro, a 74-year-old former state attorney who now has a private legal practice, had a different take: ""I never thought the state had a second-degree murder case,"" he said. ""Self-defense trumps all. I just hope there's no violence.""

Despite his disappointment with the verdict, Jealous urged calm. ""It's important that the public focus on the fact that there are still additional avenues for holding this man accountable and bringing him to justice,"" he said. ""It is critical that people keep the peace and focus their energy on encouraging the federal authorities to make sure that Zimmerman is held accountable for taking young Trayvon Martin's life.""

Jackson also called for calm. ""I hope there will be dignity and discipline, and not street justice,"" he said. ""We cannot dishonor the innocent blood of Trayvon Martin with acts of violence.""

Tampa resident Craig Woodord brought his 13-year-old son, Dante, to the courthouse Saturday afternoon to watch history in the making. Dante wore a blue hooded sweatshirt and carried a bag of Skittles candy and a can of watermelon Arizona Iced Tea.

""My son's 13,"" Craig Woodord said. ""And it could have been him. So my heart really, really goes out to the Martin family, who lost their son that was doing absolutely nothing wrong.

""But nobody wins tonight. George Zimmerman is free, but he has to come out into society – living with a lot of people that don't like him.""

The jury began its second day of deliberations on Saturday.

Jurors are deliberating whether Zimmerman committed second-degree murder when he shot and killed Trayvon Martin last year. Zimmerman has claimed he had to shoot Martin in self-defense.

The Washington Times noted the group has tweeted, “New Black Panther Party will not give you specific details on anything other than to say we have rallies and street maneuvers planned.” The group has even tweeted about a planned Sept. 7 rally for Trayvon Martin: “We can’t and WON’T try to control the general dissatisfied population. For sure we are ORGANIZING.”

“If Zimmerman is acquitted there is likely to be unrest all over America. It will be way beyond the capacity of the NBPP,” the group tweeted. “From what we are hearing there is a HIGH chance of rebellion across the nation if Zimmerman is acquitted on all charges.”

The Times flagged some tweets that showed the group’s disdain for Zimmerman. The NBPP tweeted that Zimmerman was “exposed on closing arguments as a lying, conniving, manipulating scheming underhanded profiling devil” and that the prosecution’s “withering” closing argument “wiped that smile off his [expletive] face.”

On Friday, Malik Shabazz, Chairman of the the New Black Panther Party, appeared on the David Webb Show on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, which Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon guest-hosted. Shabazz claimed the New Black Panthers are in Sanford because President Barack Obama has encouraged more “traditional” civil rights groups and leaders, like Al Sharpton, to not play active roles in organizing protests during the trial. He said groups like the New Black Panthers have had to replace the more “traditional” civil rights groups who he claimed have been “silenced.”"

But his death in Oklahoma -- allegedly at the hands of three “bored” teenagers -- has become entangled in uncomfortable conversations and innuendo about race in the U.S.

And nothing about the debate, of course, has been simple.

Take one announcement issued Thursday: A Los Angeles commentator and radio host urged civil rights leaders to condemn the shooting of Lane, a white man, after it was revealed that one of the suspects, who is black, had previously tweeted that he hated white people.

“This was a heinous murder irrespective of color. And this makes it even more compelling for civil rights leaders to publicly condemn the killing, no matter who the victim is or the alleged perpetrators are,” Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, said in a Thursday statement. “This is even more urgent given a recent report that one of the alleged shooters posted anti-white tweets.”

So why is the need for condemnation urgent? Perhaps because condemnation has been urged. Look to the Wall Street Journal’s editorial Wednesday, which oozed with accusation.

“Three teenagers were charged Tuesday in the killing of a white college student in Duncan, Okla., and part of the story is what didn’t happen,” the Journal’s editorial stated. “There was no saturation cable TV coverage, no press conference featuring Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson, and no statement from the Oval Office. The death of Christopher Lane, while as troubling as that of Trayvon Martin, will not become a national touchstone of racial and cultural debate or reflection.”

“But maybe it should,” the Journal added.

And while it took weeks for Martin’s 2012 shooting to brew into a national controversy -- including a comment from President Obama and eventually George Zimmerman’s arrest -- it appears to have only taken a day for the paper to get its wish for racial and cultural debate over the Oklahoma shooting.

By Thursday, CNN was debating whether the killing should be prosecuted as a hate crime; Jackson had condemned Lane’s slaying via Twitter; and conservative personality Rush Limbaugh was using his radio pulpit to ask, “Why does the left protect racism? They’re doing so here in the killing of this Australian college student.”

In Duncan itself, the question of race proved a difficult one for locals to discuss, as the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday.

Officials also have not formally tied race to a motive for Lane’s slaying last week. Police identified two of the suspects as black and one suspect as white, and each of the suspects have family or friends who identify as white.

And at the time of the shooting, James Francis Edwards Jr., 15 -- who had once tweeted “90% of white ppl are nasty. #HATE THEM” -- had a white girlfriend, Edwards’ sister told the Los Angeles Times on Thursday.

But when the media are handed an actual hate crime that involves a black man accused of gunning down four white people because they are white, the media collectively shrug.

The media also claim to be interested in mass-shootings. For days and sometimes weeks, we have seen our media turn their outlets over to obsessive coverage of one mass shooting after another. So you would think a racially-motivated mass-shooting would explode in the media.

But according to our media, not all racially-motivated crimes and mass shootings are alike. In fact, if the media see no political upside, some racially-motivated mass-shootings are ignored as though they never even happened.

In Greenville, North Carolina, it is now official. According to the Grand Jury indictments, a black man named Lakim Faust entered a Walmart in June with more than a hundred rounds of ammunition, and targeted white people based on their race:

Police said Faust’s first victim on June 21 was an insurance adjustor in the parking lot of a law firm. He then crossed a five-lane highway and shot three more people in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart, investigators said.

Three of the four people wounded in the shooting suffered permanent and debilitating injuries, according to the indictments. Details of those injuries were not specified.

In a just world, a local crime such as this would not deserve national coverage. One man does not in any way say anything larger about our society as a whole. But I do not write the rules, the media does; and the media poses as an objective institution concerned with hate crimes — so concerned, in fact, that they went so far as to manufacture evidence as a way to falsely accuse the Hispanic George Zimmerman of being both white and a racist.

But an actual, official hate crime in North Carolina is completely ignored by this very same media.

The reason is obvious: the objective, unbiased, not-at-all-liberal media see no political upside in a hate crime that can’t be used to gin up the left’s version of white guilt, push gun control, or falsely portray America as a country where white people still oppress minorities and therefore need a larger government to right these wrongs.

The media ignoring this racially-motivated murder spree also has nothing to do with protecting black people.

Sadly, the media don’t care about black people. This is why Chicago is ignored. Hundreds of black people are gunned down every year in Chicago. But the national media refuse to pressure the politicians in charge of that city and state to do anything, because on paper Chicago is a Liberal Utopia. The city also enforces some of the strongest gun control laws in the country.

If the media questions what is happening in Chicago, that would be mean questioning the very foundation of liberalism. And the media simply doesn’t believe a few hundred dead black people is worth doing anything that might undermine their political agenda.

“Obama sees himself in Trayvon and identifies with him,” they said in a statement. “This is a beautiful tribute to our boy.”

The president surprised the White House press corps Friday afternoon, relating his own experiences to those of Martin and other African American youths.

TRANSCRIPT: Obama on Trayvon Martin case

“There are very few African American men in this country who haven’t had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me,” Obama said. “There are very few African American men who haven’t had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars.”

Obama also called for closer inspection of “stand your ground” laws in the wake of the acquittal of Martin’s shooter, George Zimmerman. Robert Zimmerman, George’s brother, thanked Obama for his “sincere” remarks, but advised him to go a step further in an interview with Fox News.

“The president talked about encouraging African American youth but I would say also youth of all colors,” Zimmerman said. “It might be in situations in their life that they don’t feel like they’re getting the encouragement from society that they need. That’s one of the things my brother was doing before this incident.”

Rep. Karen Bass (D-Los Angeles) praised Obama for providing “a great starting point to reignite a dialog on what should be done on a number of fronts to address the challenges confronting black youth in America.”

“As the president said, ‘We’ve made progress,’ but progress doesn’t mean we’ve closed the book,” Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nev.) said on his Facebook page. “All children deserve to walk home from a convenience store, having done nothing wrong, free from fear of being profiled, harassed or killed.”

Obama supporters saw the address as a landmark moment for the president, while members of the press were surprised by the frank and lengthy delivery from a president who talks little about race.

(AP) — Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson isn't backing down from comments he made comparing Florida's struggle with the Trayvon Martin case to the civil rights clashes with police during the 1960s in Selma, Ala.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Wednesday demanded that Jackson apologize for his comments calling the state the ""Selma of our time."" He also said Florida has been an ""apartheid"" state.

But Jackson, in an interview with The Associated Press, defended his remarks. He cited the state's voter laws and incarceration rates of blacks versus the general population as examples of ""apartheid like conditions.""

Jackson made his original remarks while taking part in a protest at the Florida Capitol. He joined a group upset that George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting death of Martin.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Wednesday demanded an apology from longtime civil rights activist Jesse Jackson for comparing the state's struggle with the Trayvon Martin case to the civil rights clashes with police during the 1960s in Selma, Ala.

Jackson spent the night with protesters upset that George Zimmerman was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Martin. They've refused to leave the Capitol until Scott calls a special session to have legislators overhaul the state's self-defense laws.

Jackson called Florida the ""Selma of our time"" and even compared Scott to former Alabama Gov. George Wallace. While he was governor, Wallace famously stood in the door at the University of Alabama to try to block the entry of two black students.

Scott so far has refused the request and the protest has dragged on for more than two weeks. The protesters have gotten national media attention and won support from celebrities such as entertainer Harry Belafonte and others who have urged people to boycott Florida.

Scott in a release blasted Jackson's comments as ""reckless"" and ""divisive"" and said that he should apologize to residents.

Story continues

""It is unfortunate that he would come to Florida to insult Floridians and divide our state at a time when we are striving for unity and healing,"" Scott said.

But Bishop Tavis Grant, national field director for the Rainbow PUSH coalition started by Jackson, said there was no need for an apology.

""The governor has a deafening ear to the cries of those asking him to take a moral stand, not a political stand,"" Grant said.

Jackson left Tallahassee earlier Wednesday and wasn't immediately made available to comment.

Grant, though, said Jackson made his comments not only in response to the Zimmerman verdict but because of the case of Marissa Alexander.

Alexander, who is from Jacksonville, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a bullet at a wall to scare off her husband when she felt he was threatening her. A judge refused to let her use a ""stand your ground"" defense.

Grant said that thousands of Floridians support Jackson and agree that the state's ""stand your ground"" law is egregious.

But that view isn't shared by Scott or other Republican leaders in the Florida Legislature. Senate President Don Gaetz earlier this week that while he understands that some people are ""frustrated"" with the verdict that doesn't mean the law should be changed.

""In our system, a verdict is not then referred to a referendum of the people who are interested in the issue or who are passionate about the issue,"" Gaetz said. ""A verdict is a verdict.""

The protesters, many of whom belong to a group called the Dream Defenders, want the special session to consider changing state laws to repeal Florida's ""stand your ground"" law and to end racial profiling and zero-tolerance policies in public schools.

Protesters this week started their own mock session in the Old Capitol. They also are trying to urge 32 legislators to ask for a special session. Under Florida law, if 32 legislators make that demand, then the Department of State must poll the Legislature. If three-fifths of lawmakers agree, then a special session must be called.

The topic of Obama%27s race has been front-and-center throughout his presidency

His most compelling remarks on race over the years include reflections as a young man grappling with his identity

Obama%27s remarks on racial issues have been lauded by supporters%2C criticized by detractors as divisive

WASHINGTON — President Obama is no stranger to talking about race.

As the nation's first African-American president, Obama's racial identity has remained front-and-center through the first 4½ years of his presidency. He's spoken of his own improbable story as evidence of how far the nation has come, even as he's battled with detractors who have spoken of his ""otherness"" as a handicap to leading the nation.

When the president steps to the dais at the Lincoln Memorial on Wednesday to deliver remarks marking the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, he will undoubtedly note that his own rise connects directly to the blood, tears and work of Martin Luther King Jr.and his civil rights contemporaries.

Over the years, his most compelling remarks on race stretch from reflections as a young man grappling with his identity to his thoughts last month after a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin.

Some of these comments have been lauded by his supporters as thoughtful and heartfelt, while others have derided them as divisive rhetoric that stoke the nation's continued racial divide.

July 1995, Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance

Before launching his political career, Obama penned a book delving into his own journey as the son of a black African father and white American mother:

""The emotions between the races could never be pure; even love was tarnished by the desire to find in the other some element that was missing in ourselves. Whether we sought out our demons or salvation, the other race would always remain just that: menacing, alien, and apart.""

March 5, 2007, Selma, Ala.

The then long-shot presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama spoke from the pulpit of the historic Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church of his own claim to a place in the civil rights movement:

""I'm here because somebody marched. I'm here because you all sacrificed for me. I stand on the shoulders of giants. I thank the Moses generation; but we've got to remember, now, that Joshua still had a job to do. ""

March 18, 2008, Philadelphia

After video of Obama's former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, making a series of racially controversial statements surfaced in the heat of the presidential race, Obama spoke about race in the USA:

""I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother — a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe.

""These people are a part of me. And they are a part of America, this country that I love.""

July 22, 2009, news conference

About six months into his first term, Obama was asked during a prime-time news conference about the arrest of Henry Louis Gates, a noted African-American scholar who was arrested outside his own home:

""I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played in that (Gates case). But I think it's fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry; number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, number three, what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there's a long history in this country of African Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately. That's just a fact.""





March 23, 2012, Washington

President Obama weighed in on the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin for the first time more than a month after the killing had spurred a national uproar:

""My main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin. You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. All of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves.""

May 19, 2013, at Morehouse College, Atlanta

Obama delivered the commencement address at Morehouse, the country's pre-eminent historically black college and the alma mater of King:

""Just as Morehouse has taught you to expect more of yourselves, inspire those who look up to you to expect more of themselves. We know that too many young men in our community continue to make bad choices. And I have to say, growing up, I made quite a few myself. Sometimes I wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down. I had a tendency sometimes to make excuses for me not doing the right thing. But one of the things that all of you have learned over the last four years is there's no longer any room for excuses.""

July 19, 2013, Washington

After George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, Obama tried to explain African Americans' response:

""When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. ... When you think about why, in the African-American community at least, there's a lot of pain. It's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and history that doesn't go away.""

Mr. Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot Mr. Martin, was acquitted of all charges by a jury late Saturday.

The federal inquiry, which was started shortly after the shooting last year but had been delayed while the state criminal trial in Florida was under way, was being restarted after civil rights leaders called on the Justice Department to re-examine the case. The leaders said Sunday that they remained convinced that the shooting had a racial element. Mr. Martin, 17, was black.

“There is a pattern of George Zimmerman making dozens of calls to 911 over several years, frequently about young men of color,” Benjamin T. Jealous, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., said in an interview on Sunday. Mr. Zimmerman and his family have defended the shooting as an act of self-defense."

Columnist Rich Benjamin at Salon.com called the effort “safe, over-rated and airy” and compared it unfavorably to Attorney General Eric Holder’s recent address to the NAACP by asking the provocative question: “Some of us have an Inner Child. Others have an Inner Ni**er. Is Holder the president’s conscience? Or his Inner Ni**er?”

Finally the president has spoken about George Zimmerman’s acquittal. Even as the country waited for his singular response – the nation’s leader and a law professor who once looked like Trayvon Martin – the president danced around the issues. And what a dramatic anti-climax, listening to the president refuse to say anything insightful or profound about the acquittal. In signature professorial style, the president gave us the “context” to the episode and to black people’s “pain.” But he didn’t offer a meaningful opinion on the episode’s hot molten core: racial profiling, vigilantism, and “Stand Your Ground” laws. Meanwhile, Attorney General Eric Holder delivered trenchant thoughts on the acquittal, demanding action. Before an audience of supporters, Holder recently called for a full investigation of Martin’s death after Zimmerman’s acquittal. Holder vowed that the Justice Department will act “in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law. We will not be afraid.” “We must stand our ground,” he told supporters. Some of us have an Inner Child. Others have an Inner Ni**er. Is Holder the president’s conscience? Or his Inner Ni**er?

It’s an attention-getting way to suggest that Obama and Holder play “good cop/bad cop” on racial issues, and Benjamin goes on to show examples over their careers that support the idea. Benjamin is a Senior Fellow at the liberal think tank Demos, has written extensively about the Zimmerman case, and has been critical of Obama’s reaction.

The “Inner Ni**er” charge got a volatile reaction from most liberals who absolutely loved the meaningless, identity-politics-pander that President Obama passed off as a meaningful speech, and they took to Twitter to let Benjamin know. (H/T Tommy Christopher)

Of all the framing around this you would use “Inner Nigger” to make this argument? @elonjames Whether you thought that Obama’s speech is lacking or not, deliberate link bait like this is cheap and problematic at best. @AngryBlackLady When I said publish more voices of color, this wasn’t what I had in mind, @Salon. @AngryBlackLady I can’t. i can’t. RT @tommyxtopher: @AngryBlackLady @Salon @elonjames cue Rush Limbaugh “satire.” Maybe a parody Stevie Wonder album cover? @elonjames Wow. And @Salon-do you guys not have editors? What editor in their right mind sees “Inner Nigger” and thinks “Publish this ASAP.” @elonjames Fuck your career. This isnt about how many hits you can get. This is so much bigger than that and muthafuckas out here trying to be popular. @elonjames Dear White People & Organizations: having negroes make dumbass arguments does not shield you from critique. CC: @Salon @elonjames At this point @Salon should rename itself “White Liberal Bullshit Weekly.” @AngryBlackLady And @Salon published that nonsense by @RichBenjaminUSA with Trayvon’s name spelled incorrectly in the photo caption — so that’s delightful. @goldietaylor I don’t even know what to say. Why would a progressive site publish a piece re: POTUS’ “inner n-word”?

That last tweet from MSNBC’s Goldie Taylor is instructive in that she acknowledges that “progressive sites” tend not to publish anything that would be seen as critical of President Obama, especially an article critical of the President within the realm of race."

USA TODAY

Former president says Zimmerman jury answered %22legal question%2C%22 not %22moral one%22

George Zimmerman was acquitted in shooting death of Trayvon Martin

Carter said he believes jury %22listened to the evidence%22

Former president Jimmy Carter said the jury in the George Zimmerman trial ""made the right decision"" and agrees with President Obama that Americans should respect its judgment.

Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, was acquitted last Saturday in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. Carter, the nation's 39th president, made his comments about the high-profile case in an interview Tuesday with WXIA in Atlanta.

""I think the jury made the right decision based on the evidence presented because the prosecution inadvertently set the standard so high that the jury had to be convinced that it was a deliberate act by Zimmerman and that he was not at all defending himself,"" Carter said.

""It's not a moral question,"" he continued, ""it was a legal question and the American law requires that the jury listens to the evidence presented.""

Trayvon's death sparked outcry over Florida's ""stand your ground"" laws and a national debate over racial profiling. State prosecutors argued during the trial that Zimmerman profiled and murdered the teenager, then lied about the Trayvon initiating the fight.

Since Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder, protests have occurred in some communities across the country.

Asked if race was a factor in the jury's decision, Carter said he believes the six women based their decision on the evidence that was presented. ""I can't allege the six jurors ... are not just as sensitive about the race issue as I am or you are,"" he said. ""I would presume they listened to the evidence.""

It's only relevance is that according to her, George was capable of hiding every aspect of his secret advances on her using charm and a pleasant demeanor to make her dad feel that George was the ""son he never had"".

Many have pondered that her father may have been the uncle who testified that as soon as he heard the Lauer 9-11 call ""I knew it was Georgie.""

As result of George's close relationship with he dad, she knew they'd never believe it if she ever told them. But eventually she did tell them and there was a confrontation with George where he didn't exactly admit to everything - he did however say them ""I'm Sorry"" and then left. (This is included in the audio provided at Huffington Post)

Add to this the fact that we know George is an expert at deception as we saw him and his wife lie to the court about his ability to pay bail without showing a trace of deception.

Getting back to the racism charges it appear that Witness #9 was not alone in bringing this point up. George's ex-fiance confirmed these allegations about George's Mother.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...



At family gatherings, she said, much of the conversation centered around ""financial status and material things."" Zimmerman's mother would often talk about ""marrying into white families in order to improve one's status."" But the woman said Zimmerman never got along with his mother and that the women in his family ""exercised a lot of control over"" him. At one point, the woman told investigators, after she'd gotten into a particularly heated argument with his mother, Zimmerman retaliated by turning off the electricity to his mother's house. ""[Zimmerman] locked the electrical box and departed leaving his mother without electricity,"" according to the report. ...

Zimmerman was estranged from his mother and other members of his family, according to the report. His mother was ""very strict and dominant"" the friend told investigators. ""His father did not discipline and did not stick up for the kids as they were abused by their mother.""

""Zimmerman began to exhibit overly protective and territorial behavior,"" she said. At one point he agreed to go to counseling, and did so each week for a year. Then one day as the two were driving back from a session, she said he hit her in the mouth because she was chewing gum. In a later incident that occurred after the pair had separated, the woman said that Zimmerman became physically aggressive after she refused to let him stay the night at her apartment. The two began pushing each other and at one point he pushed her to the bed, according to earlier reports. The next day she filed an injunction against him. In retrospect, the woman told FBI agents, Zimmerman's relationship with his family, and his mother in particular, was the source of a lot of his torment.

Previously, Zimmerman Sr. “believed generally racism was a thing of the past.” He says that, personally, he hadn’t encountered much racism , even though his wife is Hispanic. But after his son shot and killed Trayvon Martin, however, Zimmerman learned that racism is “flourishing at the insistence of some in the African American Community.” He then goes on to list various black leaders and organizations that he believes are racist: Congressional Black Caucus. “[A] pathetic, self-serving group of racists… advancing their purely racist agenda.” He later adds that “all members of Congress should be ashamed of the Congressional Black Caucus, as should be their constituents.” And finally: “ They are truly a disgrace to all Americans. ” The NAACP “[S]imply promotes racism and hatred for their own, primarily finical, interests” and “without prejudice and racial divide, the NAACP would simply cease to exist.” NAACP President Benjamin Jealous. “[W]hat I would expect of a racist.” Trayvon Martin’s funeral director. A “racial activist and former head of the local NAACP.” Benjamin Crump, Natialie Jackson and Darrly Parks, attorneys for Travyon Martin’s family. “The scheme team.” The National Basketball Players Association. Black Chamber of Commerce. National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers. National Black United Fund. United Negro College Fund.

So it's not just one person saying this, it's two. Now this doesn't necessarily mean that George himself is a bigot, because it appears he and his mother - have been estranged for some time according to his ex-fiance and family friends.So we have a fairly dysfunctional arrangement here. One which may have been part of what led to the physical violence between George and his ex.Going beyond George's mom we have his dad who claims ""he never thought of race"" until the trial and now all of sudden he can see nothing but Racism Coming from Black People. So, we're supposed to believe, despite the several witnesses who talked to prosecutors (meaning if they were lying, they're potentially subject tojust as so many claim Rachel Jeantel was for lying about why she didn't go to Trayvon's funeral) that two different witnesses independently confirm that his, but that somehow he ""hasn't been exposed to much racism""?

He's married to Racism. That Racism raised his kids.

And then, and then, we're supposed to believe he came to this view that ""All the Racists are Black"" just suddenly? Just now? If this is such a brand new idea to him, how did he muster up enough thoughts about it to Publish His Own E-Book on the subject?

Florida v. Zimmerman: Uncovering the Malicious Prosecution of my Son, George

And then you have Robert Zimmerman Jr. whose comments seem to eerily echo those of his father when it comes to accusing black people of being ""Race Hustlers"" in the direct aftermath of the verdict.

http://youtu.be/...





Robert Zimmerman Jr at 5:51: These people who I think exploited very pure grief, and other Race Profiteers like the NAACP, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton - I wouldn't give them a hug, but I would give [Sybrina Fulton & Tracy Martin] a hug.

Zimmerman, according to the witness, targeted him because he was Middle Eastern. He repeatedly called the man a “fucking moron” and mocked him using the voice of “Achmed the terrorist.” Zimmerman’s stories about the man would involve “bombing,” “I’ll kill your family” and other “jokes” about “Middle Eastern stuff.” According to the man, this went on “for days and days.”

The one indicator that we have that George himself may not have assimilated these types of attitudes as expoused by his mother, father and now brother is the fact that one witness who talked to prosecutors about George included a co-worker of his who said George relentlessly and mercilessly taunted him Racially for days and days

There's also another interesting tidbit about George's habits.



After a few months, Zimmerman was terminated. According to the witness, “he was fired for calling HR hotline so many times…he would complain about each and every manager and employee.”

Just like he would call the police non-emergency line -- to complain about the ""those assholes"" and ""punks"" who always managed to be Black Kids , in his neighborhood.

Conclusive evidence of Racism on his part in the killing of Trayvon Martin? Possibly not enough for a Civil Rights Conviction, but if Trayvon can be Convicted In Death for being a ""Thug"" on the basis of some smack-talking text messages and a fight video (where he seems to be breaking up the fight at the end) it does seem to be a good place to start an Civil Rights investigation and begin to dig deeper into George's Life.

The DOJ Has established a Tip Line for those with information on possible Civil Rights Violations by George Zimmerman, so in the end, they don't seem to be limiting themselves just to this case.



http://www.orlandosentinel.com/...



The U.S. Department of Justice on Monday afternoon appealed to civil rights groups and community leaders, nationally and in Sanford, for help investigating whether a federal criminal case might be brought against George Zimmerman for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, one advocate said.

The DOJ has also set up a public email address to take in tips on its civil rights investigation. “They were calling on us to actively refer anyone who had any information,” that might build a case against Zimmerman for either a civil rights violation or a hate crime, Arnwine said. “They said they would very aggressively investigate this case.” Arnwine said the call was convened at about 3:30 p.m. by Tom Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice, and included representatives from the FBI, and several federal prosecutors, she said. DOJ officials also said they would open a public email address so people could send in tips on the case. That email address, which is now in operation, is Sanford.florida@usdoj.gov

I don't believe this is guilt by association, it's an examination of the environment George was raised in. It's possible that part of George's estrangement with his mother is because he differs with her on this issue. That does seem to be the source of his tension with is ex-fiance, who as I understand it was a Latina, someone who Glady's wouldn't have approved of. Still, it may be telling the George ultimately married a White GIrl, so mother ideas may have had some influence or they may not. What strikes me most is, as with many families with racists streaks, they've learned to hide it well. That may be true of George too, as he apparently his advances on his cousin quite well. This isn't conclusive, but it probably worth investigating as the DOJ is now with their tip line.

Many families have both secrets, and lies.

If you can I really suggest you listen to the interviews by Witness #9 (the Cousin) and Witness #22 (the ex-coworker), but of them describe a George Zimmerman of many sides and many faces. One who was cold and predatory with them, but congenial and gregarious with others, ingratiating himself with them and disguising his other ""face"" so well that Witness #22 said..



When confronted by the Managers he was so smooth and self-assured, I almost doubted myself. ""Did I get this guy wrong?""

That's one twistedright there. Very likely this is the George we saw in the police interviews and walk-thru, a practiced, accomplished, sociopathic Liar. When you add in George's history of domestic violence and attacking an undercover cop , and then lying about to get off, ""I didn't hear him say he was a Cop""- although the Officer said that George told him """" when he identified himself, and his History of ""Snapping"" and throwing a woman against a wall , when he was a bouncer - if the DOJ brings all cards in the deck, this could be a humdinger.

Let's compare all that to some text messages and a video those show a school yard fight that Trayvon seems to STOP, by intervening and standing between the combatants at the end."
http://www.reuters.com/article/comments/idUSBRE96C07420130714,2013-07-14 02:06:21+00:00,"['Ellen Wulfhorst', 'Barbara Liston']",Obama calls for calm after Zimmerman acquittal; protests held,"SANFORD, Florida (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama called for calm on Sunday after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of black teenager Trayvon Martin, as hundreds of civil rights demonstrators turned out at rallies to condemn racial profiling.

Zimmerman, cleared late Saturday by a Florida jury of six women in the shooting death of the unarmed Martin, still faces public outrage, a possible civil suit and demands for a federal investigation.

In Washington, the U.S. Justice Department said it was evaluating whether it has enough evidence to support prosecution of Zimmerman in federal court after his acquittal in Florida.

Civil rights activists have been pressuring the Obama administration to bring civil rights charges in federal court.

Critics contend Zimmerman wrongly suspected 17-year-old Martin of being a criminal because he was black, making it a civil rights issue. At a rally in New York’s Union Square, more than 200 protesters turned out Sunday, chanting “No justice, no peace.” Some held signs calling for “Justice for Trayvon, Jail for Zimmerman.”

Similar rallies were held or expected to start later in other cities including Boston, San Francisco, San Diego and Sacramento.

Obama, who once said, “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon,” called for a peaceful response to a case that polarized the U.S. public from the beginning, raising issues of racial profiling and gun control.

“We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken,” the first black U.S. president said in a statement. “I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.”

The jurors who deliberated for 16 hours over two days found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. If found guilty of the most serious charge, Zimmerman could have faced life in prison.

Zimmerman’s lawyers argued he acted in self-defense the night of February 26, 2012, when he and Martin met inside a gated community in the central Florida town of Sanford. They accuse civil rights advocates of wrongly injecting the issue of race.

“It was such a shame. The whole case nearly destroyed George from Day One ... . That they put a racism spin on this prosecution just hurt him very deeply,” said John Donnelly, a close friend of Zimmerman who testified in the trial.

In Sanford at the largely black Allen Chapel A.M.E. Church, pastor Valarie Houston dedicated a Sunday morning prayer service to Martin.

“I am hurt. I am sad. I am disappointed and my heart is overwhelmed with pains,” Houston said. “I thought in my heart that justice would be served.”

Civil rights leaders including Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and Benjamin Jealous, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), urged the Justice Department to pursue federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.

Jealous said Martin’s family may bring a civil suit against Zimmerman but said federal criminal charges should be filed because evidence suggests race was a factor in the case.

A Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement on Sunday it would determine whether “the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction.”

‘WE DON’T GET JUSTICE’

The jurors, who were sequestered during the three weeks of testimony and remained anonymous by court order, have declined to speak with reporters since handing down the verdict in one of the highest-profile trials of the year.

Zimmerman, who showed little reaction when the decision was read, was unshackled from a monitoring device he had been wearing while on bail. He previously only left home in a disguise and body armor, his lawyer said.

His brother said he would remain out of public view for some time, but friends said the former neighborhood watch volunteer had recently spoken about the possibility of entering law school.

The tense drama that climaxed with the verdict had been building for more than a year, since police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman for shooting Martin, whose gray hooded sweatshirt has become a symbol of injustice for many.

Zimmerman, 29, who is white and Hispanic, spotted Martin from his car and called police, believing Martin to be suspicious. The teenager, who was staying in the neighborhood at the home of his father’s fiancee, was walking back from a convenience store where he had bought candy and a soft drink.

Minutes later, after Zimmerman got out of his car, the two engaged in a fight that left Zimmerman with a bloody nose and head injuries. The encounter ended when Zimmerman shot Martin once through the heart with a 9mm pistol.

Prosecutors had to prove that Zimmerman committed a crime in pursuing and killing Martin and that he did not act in self-defense, a bar they failed to clear with jurors.

The acquittal will weaken any wrongful death civil lawsuit that Martin’s family might bring. Zimmerman’s lead defense lawyer, Mark O’Mara, predicted Zimmerman would seek and win immunity from a civil suit.

Around Sanford, some residents expressed relief at the verdict, while others said they failed to see how Zimmerman could have been acquitted.

“You said he’s not guilty, but why would you say he’s not guilty?” said 28-year-old Robyn Miller. “It’s crazy.”

At rallies in Boston and New York, several hundred demonstrators expressed a similar sense of frustration. “I feel we don’t get justice when it’s needed,” said Kabrina Oliver, 18, a Boston high school student."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/07/16/Daily-Beast-columnist-no-black-on-black-crime,2013-07-16 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],Daily Beast: 'There's No Such Thing as Black-on-Black Crime',"On Monday, in response to my piece on 17-year-old Darryl Green of Chicago, who was found shot to death after refusing to join a gang at school, Jamelle Bouie of The Daily Beast claimed that “black-on-black crime” is a myth. “There’s no such thing as ‘black-on-black’ crime. Yes, from 1976 to 2005, 94 percent of black victims were killed by black offenders, but that racial exclusivity was also true for white victims of violent crime–86 percent were killed by white offenders. Indeed, for the large majority of crimes, you’ll find that victims and offenders share a racial identity, or have some prior relationship to each other,” wrote Bouie. Bouie added, “Nor are African-Americans especially criminal. If they were, you would still see high rates of crime among blacks, even as the nation sees a historic decline in criminal offenses. Instead, crime rates among African-Americans, and black youth in particular, have taken a sharp drop.”

That, of course, is not the point. Of course the vast majority of murdered whites are murdered by other whites. That’s why there’s no national outrage when a white person is killed by a black person: it’s not evidence of some underlying black violence problem directed against white people. But when a white Hispanic kills a black man (a far less common occurrence than a black person killing a white person), that’s taken as evidence of a deeply racist America requiring a media tsunami. And when a black person kills a black person, the media ignores it completely.

African-Americans aren’t especially criminal, of course; for Bouie to impute such notions to those who are concerned about black-on-black crime is insidious and vile. But the notion that we don’t see “high rates of crime among blacks” is sadly untrue. The numbers are coming down, but black Americans still commit a disproportionate amount of crime. Blacks represent 13.1 percent of the American population, but 49 percent of the murder victims. More than half of those victims were in their teens or twenties. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, “The percentage of black offenders [in sexual violence cases] increased from 18% in 1994-1998 to 27% in 2005-2010.” Thankfully, crime across the board is dropping, including in the black community. But that does not mean that the black community is not still plagued by black-on-black crime that far surpasses the problem of white-on-white crime by percentage, and absolutely dwarfs the problem of white-on-black crime.

Bouie’s real point is that statistics should not matter – disproportionate black-on-black murder is the result of white racism anyway. “And while it’s true that young black men are a disproportionate share of the nation’s murder victims, it’s hard to disentangle this from the stew of hyper-segregation (often a result of deliberate policies), entrenched poverty, and nonexistent economic opportunities that characterizes a substantial number of black communities,” Bouie wrote. Let’s assume all of that’s the case, for the sake of argument. That still does not justify the media’s disproportionate attention to a problem that does not heavily plague the black community — white (or white Hispanic) on black crime – even while ignoring the sort of crime that destroys black communities day in and day out, in the name of liberal policies and political correctness. The longer those on the left continue to ignore real problems in the black community, the more Darryl Greens will be murdered.

Four years ago, Congress adopted a stronger federal hate crimes act to empower federal prosecutors to go after violent crimes of bias. Since then, the Obama administration has won convictions against more than 140 defendants who chose their victims because they were gay, disabled or members of racial or religious minorities.

But a successful federal prosecution of Zimmerman would require clear evidence that he set out to attack the unarmed Martin because he was black.

Although that is exactly what many Americans see in the fatal shooting of the 17-year-old, it can be very hard to prove in court, legal experts said. So far, prosecutors have not shown evidence that Zimmerman acted out of racial bias.

“I’d be very, very surprised if we took it,” said one federal civil rights prosecutor, speaking anonymously because no decision had been made. “It’s a very tough, tough case to sell” because of the lack of witnesses.

“The difficult element would be proving racial motivation beyond a reasonable doubt,” said University of Michigan law professor Samuel Bagenstos, a former civil rights attorney in the Obama administration. “In most of these [hate crime] cases, you have someone who had made racial statements or you have a group who goes looking to attack a person based on their race.”

But in the confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin, “no one else was there who could testify about the motivation,” he said.

Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said at the NAACP convention in Orlando, Fla., on Tuesday: “We are mindful of the tragic and unnecessary shooting death of Trayvon Martin last year — in Sanford, just a short distance from here.”

He reiterated that federal prosecutors had an “open investigation” into the shooting. “While that inquiry is ongoing, I can promise that the Department of Justice will consider all available information before determining what action to take,” he said.

Holder said laws like Florida’s “stand your ground” statute, which allow someone who feels in danger to respond with violence without retreating, must be “examined” because they eliminate “the common-sense and age-old requirement that people who feel threatened have a duty to retreat, outside their home, if they can do so safely.”

Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, has called on Holder and the Justice Department to prosecute Zimmerman on a hate crime charge.

“It is clear George Zimmerman’s bias played a major role in the events that led” to the shooting, Jealous said. He noted that Zimmerman had made dozens of calls to police, “disproportionately about young men of color who he thought were suspect.” He also noted that Zimmerman said on the night of attack, “These punks always get away with this.”

Jealous agreed the law required evidence of racial bias. “We believe there was enough evidence to satisfy that standard,” he said.

Some advocates also have called for charging Zimmerman with violating Martin’s civil rights. But a civil rights count is limited to defendants who act “under color of law” — that is, wielding government authority.

One such example involved four Los Angeles police officers who were acquitted in 1992 in the beating of motorist Rodney King. Federal officials later charged them with violating King’s constitutional rights; two officers were convicted. Zimmerman was not a police officer when he got out of his car to pursue Martin.

The 2009 hate crimes act was named for Matthew Shepard, a young Wyoming man who was brutally beaten and left to die because he was gay. The law made it a federal crime to “willfully cause bodily injury to any person” with a weapon or explosive device “because of” the person’s race, religion, national origin, disability, gender, gender identity or sexual orientation.

In early July, the U.S. court of appeals in Denver upheld the law as constitutional. That ruling came in the case of three white supremacists who had abducted a developmentally disabled Native American and brutally abused him, including branding a swastika on his skin with a hot coat hanger. Two of the men were sentenced to 8 1/2 years in prison, while the third received a lesser sentence.

Professor Bagenstos was the deputy to the Justice Department’s civil rights chief, Thomas E. Perez, during Obama’s first term. He said a successful prosecution would require more evidence than has come to light.

“Unless there is significant new evidence, I’d say it would be unlikely the department would bring a hate crimes charge,” Bagenstos said. “It would be very difficult to win, and they don’t bring charges they don’t think they can prove.”

The refrain in the song's lyrics:



But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears

Take the rag away from your face

Now ain’t the time for your tears

I've been following the shooting death of Trayvon Martin for ""walking while black"" since it occurred, and the media campaign of George Zimmerman's defense attorneys and his family members—father and brother—both named Robert Zimmerman (Sr. and Jr.). It wasn't until recently that it struck me why the name ""Robert Zimmerman"" rang a bell, not related to this case. I often forget that Bob Dylan was born Robert Zimmerman.

How ironic.

One Robert Zimmerman (Dylan) will be remembered for writing and performing songs pointing out racism and injustice in U.S. society, while the other (Zimmerman Sr.) has just penned what can only be described as a racist screed blaming black people and black organizations for his son's ""persecution"" and calling them ""racists."" In tandem, Robert Zimmerman Jr has been making the media rounds and sent out racist tweets.

I shed no tears for George Zimmerman, and can only state that the apple hasn't fallen far from a racist Zimmerman tree when watching his father.

Let's examine Robert Zimmerman Sr's list, as reported by ThinkProgress. I am not going to buy a copy of his rant so I'll just have to trust their quotes.

The most striking chapter is called “Who Are The True Racists,” an apparent effort to rebut claims that his son’s actions were racially motivated. Previously, Zimmerman Sr. “believed generally racism was a thing of the past.” He says that, personally, he hadn’t encountered much racism, even though his wife is Hispanic. But after his son shot and killed Trayvon Martin, however, Zimmerman learned that racism is “flourishing at the insistence of some in the African American Community.” He then goes on to list various black leaders and organizations that he believes are racist: Congressional Black Caucus. “[A] pathetic, self-serving group of racists… advancing their purely racist agenda.” He later adds that “all members of Congress should be ashamed of the Congressional Black Caucus, as should be their constituents.” And finally: “They are truly a disgrace to all Americans.” The NAACP. “[S]imply promotes racism and hatred for their own, primarily finical, interests” and “without prejudice and racial divide, the NAACP would simply cease to exist.” NAACP President Benjamin Jealous. “[W]hat I would expect of a racist.” Trayvon Martin’s funeral director. A “racial activist and former head of the local NAACP.” Benjamin Crump, Natialie Jackson and Darrly Parks, attorneys for Travyon Martin’s family. “The scheme team.” The National Basketball Players Association. Black Chamber of Commerce. National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers. National Black United Fund. United Negro College Fund.



From Robert Zimmerman's perspective, his son shoots and kills an unarmed young black man, and when there is an outcry, those who have something to say about it are racists. Too often the response to racism is to label those who address it as racists.

If his list wasn't so blatantly bigoted, I might even laugh. Except this isn't funny, and looking at racist reviewer comments at Amazon.com where he is selling the e-book makes it even more disgusting.

The tin-foil list at first glance doesn't contain any references to anyone other than blacks. Except when you think about it ""the NBA"" has players other than blacks, and as a player's union was founded by Bob Cousy. The NAACP has always had white members and was founded by blacks and whites.



The NAACP was founded on February 12, 1909 by a diverse group composed of W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, Archibald Grimké, Henry Moskowitz, Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, William English Walling (the last son of a former slave-holding family), Florence Kelley, a social reformer and friend of Du Bois, and Charles Edward Russell, a renowned muckraker and close friend of Walling who helped plan the NAACP and served as acting chairman of the National Negro Committee (1909), a forerunner to the NAACP.

Obviously, from Zimmerman Sr.'s perspective only black people push back against the racism that is embedded in the foundations of this society.

But wait. That ""other"" Zimmerman (Bobby) isn't black.

As the news just announced a jury selected for the Zimmerman trial without a single black person on the panel, my thoughts move again to another song by Dylan/Zimmerman, on the murder of Emmett Till and subsequent trial

And then to stop the United States of yelling for a trial

Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till

But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this

awful crime

And so this trial was a mockery, but nobody seemed to mind I saw the morning papers but I could not bear to see

The smiling brothers walkin’ down the courthouse stairs

For the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free

While Emmett’s body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea

Bob Dylan's lyrical power has influenced a host of other songwriters and his body of work will be remembered long after he leaves this mortal plane.

Awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, last year by President Obama, Bob Dylan, born Robert Zimmerman will hold a place in our hearts and history.

One young singer has taken the melody and lyrics of Dylan's Hattie Carroll tune and revised it to ""The Lonesome Death of Trayvon Martin.""

Robert Zimmerman Sr. will be remembered for fathering a son who took the life of someone else's son. And for blaming the victim for being black."

USA TODAY

Sen. Graham says Hillary Clinton should testify about Benghazi%2C under subpoena if necessary

He played a role in arranging the dramatic testimony of Gregory Hicks%2C the No. 2 U.S. official in Libya

He denies partisan politics in growing criticism of Clinton%2C a possible 2016 presidential nominee

WASHINGTON – South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Thursday that former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton should return to Capitol Hill -- under subpoena if necessary -- to answer new questions about the attacks on a U.S. consulate in Libya that left four Americans dead.

In an interview on Capital Download, USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series, Graham said the account of the Benghazi assaults last Sept. 11 offered by Clinton and other Obama administration officials had been undercut in congressional testimony Wednesday by three State Department officials, including Gregory Hicks, the No. 2 U.S. official in Libya at the time.

Hicks described a closer involvement by Clinton than previously known, including a phone call he received from her at 2 a.m. that deadly night. While the crisis unfolded, his pleas for a military response to the assaults were rejected. Afterward, he said he was castigated by Clinton's chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, for talking about the attack with a member of Congress who was visiting Libya.

Graham, a leading critic of the administration on Benghazi, said he had played a role in arranging Hicks' testimony.

""I got a call from a friend of his who said this Greg Hicks is really torn about what to do"" about an official account of events he saw as inaccurate, Graham said. ""So I got a phone number; I gave him a call. In March, we met here in the office. And I said, 'I don't know whether I can get the Senate to take this up, but the House is interested in finding out what happened in Benghazi.'""

He described Hicks as a reluctant witness. ""He's probably the typical State Department person -- very diplomatic, very reserved -- but this was gnawing at him,"" Graham said. ""It was really eating him up.""

Hicks testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., a fierce Obama critic.

In January, before she left the administration, Clinton answered questions about Benghazi at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, angrily rebuffing suggestions that the administration had misled Americans about the attacks for political reasons, seven weeks before Election Day. At the time, United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice said in a string of Sunday morning TV appearances that the attacks might have been a spontaneous uprising sparked by an anti-Muslim video that had been posted on YouTube.

In fact, Hicks testified, he and other U.S. officials in Libya immediately realized it was a planned attack by terrorists.

Graham, interviewed in his Senate office, said Clinton should return to Congress to address the issues raised. Should she be subpoenaed?

""I hope she would come back without that, but yes,"" he replied. ""I think she needs to come back and answer questions. Did she know that Cheryl Mills called the DCM (deputy chief of mission) to tell him, watch the member of Congress and don't talk to him? And there's now evidence that she was made aware of the security concerns and basically ignored security requests.""

He said Mills and Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and others also should be called to testify about the attacks. Those killed included Christopher Stephens, the first U.S. ambassador to die in the line of duty in a generation.

Republicans began this week to more openly hold Clinton responsible both for inadequate security at the consulate before the attack and for misleading characterizations about it afterward. Graham denied the criticism was partisan or an effort to dent the reputation of the leading prospect for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.

He noted Democrats had praised him during the Bush administration when he faulted then-Defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld and then-vice president Dick Cheney on national security issues.

""When ... we were pushing back against Rumsfeld and Cheney about Iraq in the early years, as not going well -- it's not a few 'dead-enders' -- we were great patriots,"" he said. ""When you question Secretary Clinton and President Obama, it's a little bit different from our Democratic friends.""

Pollak'],3 Problems with Obama's Navy Yard Speech the Media Still Ignore,"The mainstream media have awoken to the fact that President Barack Obama’s partisan attack on Republicans during the Navy Yard attack on Monday may not have been the best idea, even if only for tactical reasons.

The New York Times‘ Maureen Dowd worried that Obama’s speech meant that he “cannot seem to connect anymore” and concluded that the president had been “overtaken by events.” The Hill called it a political “blunder” and agreed, via a quote from a “former aide,” that he had been “overtaken by events.” (Poor President Obama, always the victim of circumstances not of his own making, always “overtaken by events”!)

While it is encouraging that the media have noticed Obama’s attack–even though most networks cut away after he briefly mentioned the Navy Yard shooting–they continue to ignore three glaring problems:

1. The fact that Obama never considered canceling or postponing the speech. A president who does not realize that a mass shooting on a military base in the nation’s capital city is a reason to suspend politics as usual is dangerously removed from his duties as commander-in-chief–never mind the political damage. In addition, he is receiving bad advice, ignoring good advice, or simply not being advised by staff who have learned that he tunes out all but a select group of trusted Chicago insiders and loyalists. By putting politics first, the Obama administration is putting the nation at risk–at a time when risks are only growing.

2. The fact that the media pilloried Mitt Romney for lesser sins in 2012. When Mitt Romney issued a statement criticizing the Obama administration’s apologetic response to the Cairo embassy attack on Sep. 11 last year, the media attacked him viciously. Romney, too, was “overtaken by events”: he did not know that four Americans would be killed in Benghazi. But the media never let Romney forget his alleged gaffe, while giving Obama a pass for his inaction that night. Because the media never hold Obama accountable for anything, he rarely takes his governing responsibilities seriously, exacerbating a dangerous vacuum in national leadership.

3. The fact that the Navy Yard attack happened at all, four years after Ft. Hood. It is easier for the Obama-supporting media to dwell on an inappropriate speech than to ask the much more important question: how did the attack happen at all? Four years after a similar mass shooting at Fort Hood, was nothing done to improve security at military bases? Why were rules restricting guns on base not changed? Did the Obama administration let the nation’s guard down by downplaying Ft. Hood as “workplace violence” instead of terrorism? Why, after the NSA scandal, was there no review of security clearance procedures and lists?"

Serrano Was A Federal Law Enforcement', 'Terrorism Reporter In The Los Angeles Times', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Bureau. He Left The Times In']",Prosecutor retaliated against Fast and Furious whistle-blower,"WASHINGTON — The former top federal prosecutor in Arizona retaliated against the lead whistle-blower in the Fast and Furious gun-smuggling scandal by leaking an internal report that suggested the whistle-blower once favored allowing illegal gun sales as a way to track weapons to drug cartels in Mexico, the Justice Department’s inspector general’s office said Monday.

Dennis K. Burke, who resigned from the U.S. attorney’s office following the Fast and Furious matter, told investigators that he leaked an internal memorandum to a television producer in which ATF Special Agent John Dodson discussed an earlier case involving gun trafficking on the border. Burke told investigators that he did not believe he had done anything illegal.

However, he was sharply admonished by his supervisor, the deputy attorney general in Washington. He was prodded to resign over Fast and Furious and left the U.S. attorney’s office in Phoenix in August 2011. Until then he had been seen as a rising Democratic political star.

Under the Fast and Furious program, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives purposely allowed hundreds of guns to be illegally purchased in the hope of tracking them to Mexican cartel leaders. Instead, almost all of the firearms were lost. Two turned up at the site of the slaying of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in southern Arizona in December 2010.

Burke could not be reached for comment Monday.

In November, the inspector general’s office issued a report sharply criticizing the ATF for Fast and Furious. The findings Monday were a follow-up to that report and determined that “Burke’s disclosure was likely motivated by a desire to undermine Special Agent’s Dodson’s public criticisms of Operation Fast and Furious.”

The Dodson memo discussed a case he worked on in which he served as an undercover agent posing as an illegal straw purchaser providing firearms to a trafficker, and he discussed the tactic of “walking” firearms as a way to build an investigation. Burke saw the document as evidence that Dodson also condoned “gun walking” investigations, and personally emailed it to a friend in Washington with the intent of sharing it with a Fox News producer.

The inspector general’s report said Burke told both Deputy Atty. Gen. James M. Cole and the inspector general that he had leaked the internal memo. He said he did so thinking it was already in the hands of congressional investigators and would come out eventually. Nevertheless, Burke acknowledged it had been a “mistake” to leak the document.

Burke’s departure came after he also leaked a separate internal memo to the New York Times about the guns recovered at the site of the Terry slaying. Burke admitted he had leaked the memo, which was published on the paper’s website with his fax number on the copy. Cole called the leak “another horrible incident of bad judgment.”

The inspector general referred the Burke matter to the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility to determine whether Burke’s behavior violated any state bar association rules of conduct. It was unclear whether the office would go further and open a broader investigation.

Before he stepped down, Burke had a promising political future and had built a strong record for being tough on border crime. He was seen as a likely Democratic candidate for governor or senator from Arizona, and he had been a protege of Janet Napolitano, now secretary of the Homeland Security Department, who earlier served as attorney general and governor in Arizona.

http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/07/08/zimmerman-defense-to-continue-presentation-monday/,2013-07-08 00:00:00,[],Judge rules defense can show Trayvon Martin died with marijuana in his system,"Defense lawyers will be permitted to show that Trayvon Martin had marijuana in his system when he and George Zimmerman had their fateful encounter in a gated community in Florida last year, the judge in Zimmerman's murder trial ruled Monday.

Judge Debra Nelson denied a motion by prosecutors to keep toxicology results showing THC in Martin's system from the jury, paving the way for Zimmerman's lawyers to argue the drug may have influenced the teen's behavior. Defense attorney Don West noted that in Zimmerman’s statement to the non-emergency 911 dispatcher that it appeared the person he was observing in the Sanford, Fla., community was “on drugs.”

Late Monday, Zimmerman defense spokesman Shawn Vincent said the defense could rest by the end of the day Tuesday or early Wednesday morning. The prosecution would then have rebuttal witnesses, with closing statements by Thursday or Friday. Vincent stressed this scenario depended on everything going as expected.

Nelson's ruling on the toxicology results came after the jury was dismissed following a day of conflicting testimony about whose voice could be heard screaming on a subsequent 911 tape. A parade of Zimmerman's friends said they recognized the neighborhood watch volunteer's voice, but Martin's father, who police said initially told them he did not recognize the voice, said he came to realize it was his son after hearing the tape some 20 times.

The testimony, in week three of Zimmerman's murder trial, came after the mothers of both Zimmerman and Martin testified Friday it was their son doing the screaming in the Feb. 26, 2012, 911 call made to Sanford, Fla., police. The issue is critical because Zimmerman, a 29-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer, says he shot the 17-year-old in self-defense as he was being beaten.

Sanford Police Det. Christopher Serino and Police Officer Doris Singleton both recalled playing the 911 tape for Tracy Martin days after his son was killed, and both said the elder Martin did not recognize his son's voice on the tape. But later, Tracy Martin, curiously called to the stand by lead defense attorney Mark O'Mara, took the stand to say that he did recognize his son's voice on the tape later, after hearing it several more times when played at the Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett's office.

""After listening to the tape for, maybe 20 times, I said I knew that it was Trayvon's voice,"" the elder Martin said under questioning by O'Mara. Martin called his son his ""best friend in life,"" and said the boy's death turned his world ""upside down.""

Earlier, close friends and former co-workers of Zimmerman testified that they recognized Zimmerman's voice on the the 911 tape that captured his confrontation with Martin. Sondra Osterman, wife of Zimmerman’s best friend Mark Osterman, told jurors that the shrieking voice on the tape was “definitely” that of Zimmerman.

“Yes, definitely, it’s Georgie,” Osterman said. “I hear it, I hear him screaming.”

[pullquote]

Osterman told jurors she has known Zimmerman since 2006, when they worked at a mortgage company. Osterman’s husband has written a book about the fatal shooting — ""Defending our Friend: The Most Hated Man in America"" — and Sondra Osterman told jurors that would not affect her testimony in the case.

“I wouldn’t lie for him or for anybody,” Sondra Osterman said of Zimmerman; she said she was unsure how many copies her husband's book has sold.

Osterman testified she did not think Zimmerman's use of an expletive on the 911 call indicated any ill-will or hatred on his behalf.

""I don't think he was angry,"" she told jurors.

Mark Osterman, a federal air marshal, told jurors he discussed gun safety with Zimmerman and took him to a gun range. Osterman testified that Zimmerman was “very safe all the time” with his Kel Tec 9-mm. handgun, which does not have an external safety and is difficult to fire accidentally.

“It’s a reliable firearm,” said Mark Osterman, who recommended to Zimmerman that he keep a round chambered in the weapon.

Mark Osterman also testified that he heard Zimmerman screaming on the 911 call.

“It sounded like George,” he told jurors.

During cross-examination by prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda, Osterman said he was unsure how many copies his book has sold, but confirmed that all proceeds were destined for Zimmerman.

Geri Russo, a friend who previously worked with Zimmerman, testified that the yelling heard on the 911 tape is Zimmerman.

“I recognize his voice, I’ve heard him speak many times,” Russo told jurors. “I have no doubt in my mind that’s his voice.”

Leanne Benjamin, who owns a real estate company and formerly worked with Zimmerman, also identified Zimmerman as the screaming voice on the 911 call.

“I know his voice,” Benjamin told jurors. “I know what his voice sounds like when he gets excited or loud.”

Benjamin and her husband, John Donnelly, contributed $2,500 to Zimmerman's defense fund and Donnelly purchased suits for Zimmerman to wear during his trial, she testified.

Donnelly, who said he thought of Zimmerman as a son, later testified he found it “distressing” to listen to the 911 tape, which he recently heard twice online and again on Monday in court. Donnelly said he also recognized Zimmerman’s voice as the shrieking individual on the 911 tape, becoming the seventh witness since the defense began its case Friday to testify that the former neighborhood watch volunteer is screaming for help on the 911 call.

“There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that is George Zimmerman and I wish to God I didn’t have the ability to understand that,” Donnelly said.

Donnelly testified he also donated an additional $500 to Zimmerman for his website and purchased $1,700 in suits for the former neighborhood watch volunteer.

Further bolstering the defense contention that Martin was getting the better of the fight when Zimmerman shot him was Adam Pollock, owner of a kickboxing gym where Zimmerman trained prior to the incident. Pollock said Zimmerman was ""grossly obese,"" and not atheltic at all.

""He came to the gym to lose weight and get in shape,"" Pollock said.

When O'Mara asked him to rate Zimmerman's athletic ability on a scale of one to 10 when he began training, Pollock replied, ""Point-five.""

Also on Monday, prosecutors asked Judge Debra Nelson to prevent Zimmerman's defense attorneys from showing jurors a computer-animated depiction of his confrontation with Martin. A motion made public Monday requests that the animation not be mentioned or played at Zimmerman's trial.

Prosecutors — who believe the animation would only confuse jurors — say the animation doesn't depict a murder weapon and only approximates positions based on witness accounts.

Zimmerman's attorneys called their first two witnesses Friday after prosecutors rested their case and Nelson denied a request for acquittal. Some of the witnesses called by the defense could be the same neighbors and investigators called by prosecutors. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara told reporters Friday he expects his case to last a few days and may recall some of the prosecution's witnesses.

The mothers of both Zimmerman and Martin testified on Friday that it was their own son's voice calling for help on a taped 911 call minutes before Zimmerman fatally shot the teen on Feb. 26, 2012. The screams are considered to be crucial pieces of evidence because they could determine who was the aggressor in the confrontation. An FBI expert testified earlier in the week that a person familiar with a voice is in the best position to identify it.

Zimmerman, 29, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, claiming self-defense. It remains unclear whether Zimmerman will testify, although jurors already have heard his account through videotaped police interviews played in court.

Zimmerman faces life in prison if convicted. The state argued during its opening statement that the neighborhood watchman profiled and followed Martin in his truck and called a police dispatch number before he and the teen got into a fight.

“Keep Santa Cruz Weird” was the longstanding, if unofficial, motto for this small beachfront city proud of its tolerance and its offbeat vibe. People came for Santa Cruz’s 1960s-imbued live-and-let-live attitude, its progressive politics, the great weather, the University of California campus, the hard-partying surfing scene and the freewheeling drug culture.

But “Keep Santa Cruz Safe and Clean” began appearing on bumpers in recent years as the city was rattled by acts of violence, its streets and parks seemingly overwhelmed by homelessness and drugs. To hear the supporters of the new slogan, Santa Cruz’s famous tolerance was guilty of enabling.

The dueling slogans captured the fight over the city’s politics and policies, as well as its spirit. The debate has only intensified since the recent killings of Sgt. Butch Baker and Officer Elizabeth Butler, the first two police officers to die on duty in the Santa Cruz Police Department’s 157-year history."

Should America cut off the money for Super Twiggy, the cartoon squirrel?

At that time, across-the-board budget cuts called sequestration were kicking children out of Head Start and leaving FBI agents without gas money. Congress was still supposed to be looking for smaller, smarter ways to trim the budget — so it could replace that big, dumb cut.

So it came to Super Twiggy. The squirrel starred in Web videos in Spain, touting the health benefits of California-grown walnuts. U.S. taxpayers had paid more than $3 million for Spanish walnut promotions, as part of a $200 million-per-year Agriculture Department program that promotes U.S. farm goods overseas.

“The Republican majority was supposed to end this kind of nonsense, not perpetuate it,” said Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.), trying to kill the broader program with an appeal to his party’s small-government soul. “It is a test of the determination and sincerity of the House majority.”

It didn’t work. After other members touted the program’s value to farmers, the cut was rejected, 322 to 98.

Jackie Kucinich takes a look at some of the wasteful government spending listed in Sen. Tom Coburn's (R-Okla.) annual ""WasteBook."" (Thomas LeGro/The Washington Post)

There — in a vote and, in fact, in a nutshell — was the story of the American austerity wars in 2013.

Republicans in Congress had forced a historic shift: Washington, for the first time in years, was focused on cutting, not growing, the budget. But then, politicians in both parties choked on the decisions that came next: Where to cut. Who to hurt. What to kill.

Instead, they allowed sequestration, a policy that — at least in theory — cut the good and the bad equally. That created odd contrasts: Meals on Wheels was cut, and Army units reduced training; Washington kept paying for dubious expenses such as a plane that didn’t fly, an airport with no passengers and farm subsidies in Manhattan. And a private industry’s “spokes-squirrel.”

This month, Congress canceled sequestration’s across-the-board cuts and gave itself another chance to demonstrate that legislators can make smarter, more judicious cuts. But so far, it has mainly demonstrated the power of old Washington habits, the political reflexes that make cutting government so hard.

“The only way Congress can make cuts is across the board, because they have trouble making decisions,” said Robert L. Bixby of the Concord Coalition, a group seeking to reduce the federal deficit. “If you’re trying to limit the scope of government, or the function, it doesn’t accomplish that goal at all. It just gives you less money to accomplish the same goals, which is why it doesn’t really work over the long term. [Either] the money grows back, or you provide a declining level of service.”

Three years after deficit-driven Republicans took the House, Washington’s experiment with budget-cutting has produced mixed results. Politicians have, indeed, had historic success cutting numbers — the abstract, friend-less figures at the bottom of the federal balance sheet.

In the next fiscal year, for instance, the government’s “discretionary” spending will be limited to $1.012 trillion. That figure was set by the budget deal agreed to last week. That’s down about 13 percent from 2010, adjusting for inflation.

There has been very little change in “mandatory” spending programs, which account for the vast majority of federal spending.

But the budget deal signed in August 2011 was projected to save about $2.1 trillion by 2021, as compared with the levels of spending projected before. And to some conservatives, that’s victory enough. The big number went down.

“I’d much rather have [that] than to break my pick on some of this completely small-ball stuff,” said anti-tax advocate Grover G. Norquist. He said that it was unrealistic to expect Republicans to win many of those little battles, anyway: “You can’t line out anything. Because the Democrats run the Senate. The president has the veto.”

But to many other people — conservatives and liberals both — this is a dispiriting outcome. They expected more from austerity.

It was supposed to force Washington to face decisions about how the country really ought to spend its money. Finally, legislators would eliminate the duplicative, wasteful or profligate programs that they’d ignored in fatter times.

Or not.

In 2011 and 2012, for instance, at least 84 federal programs were either eliminated or defunded by Congress. In large part, however, these were not major reforms. The programs cut were often small, redundant, outdated or all three. In 72 of those cases, the cuts had been suggested by the Obama administration.

The suggestions included a scholarship named in honor of Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), another named for Byrd’s wife, as well as an anti-drug center championed by Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.), and a scholarship named for the son of Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.). At the time, Stupak had already retired. Byrd and Murtha were dead.

For many conservatives, that adds up to an unsatisfying result. They had wanted a government that was cheaper, smaller and smarter.

Suddenly, they were being asked to settle for just cheaper.

“Have we eliminated anything? No. We haven’t,” said Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), a conservative in his second term. “I can’t think of a single major agency that we’ve gotten rid of. Or a role of government that we’ve gotten rid of.”

So how did Congress manage to cut the budget overall, while leaving so much of government’s parts intact?

One answer was an old Washington trick: budget gimmicks, which cut money on paper but made little difference in the real world.

In 2011, for instance, Congress and President Obama trumpeted a budget deal that included $37.8 billion in budget cuts. But upon close inspection, many of those cuts were only-in-Washington illusions, paper money that was unlikely to ever be spent. The “cuts” in that case included $6 billion for a census that wasn’t necessary, $280 million for a tunnel that was already canceled and $375,000 for a road that didn’t exist (the money had been allotted to a fictional road because of a typo).

Another answer was distraction and theatrics in Congress — another bad habit, which left legislators little time to dig into the details of the budget and agree on what was too wasteful or extraneous to keep.

In early 2011, Democrats blocked many of the biggest cuts that Republicans had proposed, including defunding Planned Parenthood and NPR. After that, the two sides began a cycle of hair-pulling crises, each of which was resolved in a series of last-minute deals. Often, the outcome of the showdown was a “continuing resolution,” a stopgap measure that mainly continued funding levels at levels set previously.

And finally, even when legislators focused on a real-world cut, even small-government Republicans often found reasons to keep government doing the same things it did before.

So it was with Super Twiggy, one of several controversial giveaway programs that legislators couldn’t cut loose.

The program that funds Super Twiggy — the USDA’s Market Access Program — has been criticized for spending taxpayer money to advertise for private business interests. But it lives, partly because its benefits are spread among so many farmers in so many states.

Since 2008, the program has paid more than $3.1 million to help the California Walnut Commission advertise in Spain. First, the money paid for ads with a live squirrel, Twiggy, who snacked on walnuts and then water-skiied behind a miniature boat.

“Then, Twiggy retired. The real squirrel. So we reinvented, I guess, a digitized Twiggy,” said Dennis Balint, the walnut commission’s chief executive.

Now the commission produces Web videos where the new, digital squirrel has adventures inside the human body, hurling walnuts at villains who symbolize cholesterol. It is a bit of an odd metaphor — because having either a live squirrel or a walnut inside one’s blood vessels would probably be a more immediate concern than hardening of the arteries.

But the walnut commission thinks it’s a worthwhile use of their aid money. Their research shows that Spaniards, in particular, respond well to squirrels.

“Twiggy being inside the blood vessel is a way of demonstrating the fact that cholesterol — bad cholesterol — can be beaten with walnuts,” Balint said.

On the House floor this summer, proponents of the Market Access Program brushed aside the mention of Super Twiggy and argued that the program should stay because it helps farmers.

“Since the creation of this extremely successful agricultural export program, it has increased America’s export by over 500 percent. That is a success story by any measure,” said Rep. Jim Costa (D), who represents a heavily agricultural district in California. Two Republicans and another Democrat also spoke in opposition to the cut.

When the vote came, 142 Republicans and 180 Democrats voted to keep it.

Now — in theory — Congress has a chance to hit the reset button and find new ways to cut the budget. Last week, legislators approved a deal that canceled the sequester and gave the House and Senate appropriations committees the chance to write a new bill with specific, targeted reductions.

But some conservatives — inside and outside the House — say they’ve already seen enough to doubt.

“At some point, nothing’s going to change. So why keep saying it?” said Tad DeHaven, a Cato Institute analyst who helps run the Web site DownsizingGovernment.org. For 14 years, he has pushed for Washington to rein in spending and the size of government.

Next year, as Congress begins its new effort, he will quit and go into business with a friend in Pennsylvania.

“I got tired of being asked on radio shows and such, ‘What can we do about it?’ Because I couldn’t continue to pretend that there’s a lot that can be done,” DeHaven said in a telephone interview. “You’re going up against an aircraft carrier with a slingshot.”"

(CNN) - President Barack Obama explained why, amid a series of executive branch controversies, his renewed focus on the economy matters: it's not only about financial stability, but about equal opportunity.

The message he sees as ""jobs and justice"" from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington 50 years ago still rings true, Obama told The New York Times in an interview published Saturday evening.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

To the many Americans who today are uncertain about their future, the 1963 march taught valuable lessons on racial equality and opportunities for ""working folks,"" he argued.

The remarks, days after the president spoke on race and the Trayvon Martin case, came while he was on a campaign-style economic tour.

""Racial tensions won't get better; they may get worse, because people will feel as if they've got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot"" if individuals do not see a stable fiscal future, Obama said.

""If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested. Everybody feels as if we're rolling in the same direction,"" he continued.

Obama's midweek schedule looked familiar to watchers of his 2012 campaign and first White House term, when he favored speaking to crowds at colleges and businesses around the nation over Washington venues when advocating his economic priorities.

After visiting universities in Illinois and Missouri and speaking on the importance of education to the economy, he flew to the port in Jacksonville, Florida, where he called for investment in infrastructure. On Monday, he will speak at a Tennessee shipping center about manufacturing, jobs, and economic growth; then on Wednesday, he will travel to Capitol Hill to meet with Democrats in the House and Senate.

He cast aside the questions about such issues as the National Security Agency leaks, Internal Revenue Service political scrutiny and U.S. handling of the Benghazi, Libya, attack last September. ""With an endless parade of distractions, political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball,"" he said, although he was not specific about which controversies he was referring to.

The White House plans to continue the economic push into the fall.

In the same time frame, he is also expected to make perhaps the most important economic decision of his second term: naming a new individual to chair the Federal Reserve. Ben Bernanke's term as chairman is set to expire in January.

Obama told the Times he wanted someone who would go beyond tracking inflation and focus on market stability.

""The idea is to promote those things in service of the lives of ordinary Americans getting better,"" he said. ""I want a Fed chairman that can step back and look at that objectively and say, Let's make sure that we're growing the economy.""

He disputed Republicans' claims about job creation should the controversial Keystone pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast be constructed. The 2,000 temporary construction jobs he predicted - far less than the 20,000 some Republicans have said to expect - would be a ""a blip relative to the need"" for job creation.

He suggested that concerns over the pipeline's environmental impact could be addressed to his satisfaction because ""there is no doubt that Canada at the source in those tar sands could potentially be doing more to mitigate carbon release.""

In the interview, the president acknowledged that people are ""anxious"" and ""frustrated"" about their own financial future even while the economy overall improves.

Some do not see the potential for upward mobility, which he called ""part and parcel of who we were as Americans.""

It predates the fiscal crises of the last decade, he said, and despite the bloated national debt, the federal government's austerity measures have hurt the government's ability to effect change in diverse areas such as climate change and immigration.

""I want to make sure that all of us in Washington are investing as much time, as much energy, as much debate on how we grow the economy and grow the middle class as we've spent over the last two to three years arguing about how we reduce the deficits,"" he said, blasting what he called ""a damaging framework in Washington.""

And he issued a stern warning to Capitol Hill Republicans: ""I'm not just going to sit back if the only message from some of these folks is no on everything, and sit around and twiddle my thumbs for the next 1,200 days.""

A series of polls this month have shown Obama's approval rating is below the 50% mark. But his scores - in the mid- and upper-40s - rank well above those of Congress, which came in at 21% and 12% approval in two surveys conducted about a week ago."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/03/news/economy/april-jobs-report/,2013-05-03 00:00:00,['Annalyn Kurtz'],April jobs report: Hiring picks up,"The U.S. economy seemed to be headed for a spring slowdown this year. Then the April jobs report was released Friday morning, and now some economists are doing a double-take.

The economy added 165,000 jobs in April, according to the Labor Department. That was more than the 140,000 jobs economists expected, and it marked an improvement over March.

The even bigger story, though, came from large revisions to earlier numbers. It's a common practice for the Labor Department to revise its data for the two prior months, and this time, those revisions showed an additional 114,000 jobs were added in the U.S. economy over February and March alone.

Previously, March hiring had looked particularly weak, with only 88,000 jobs added that month. Now, the Labor Department says 138,000 jobs were added in March.

February job growth, which had already looked solid, now looks even stronger. About 332,000 jobs were added in February, making it the strongest month for hiring since the Census hired temporary workers in 2010.

The report goes a long way ""toward soothing fears of another spring slowdown,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics.

Economists had been warning of a spring swoon for the third year in a row, this time driven largely by government spending cuts and global economic weakness. Retail sales slumped unexpectedly in March, the manufacturing sector stalled in April, and signs abroad point to a global deceleration. China's rapid economic growth has lost some steam and Europe is still mired in a recession.

But those fears eased following the report. Stocks jumped. For the first time ever, the Dow topped 15,000 and the S&P 500 climbed above 1,600.

Service jobs boom: The strongest job growth in April came from restaurants and bars, which added 38,000 jobs; temporary services, which added 31,000 jobs; and retailers, which added 29,000 jobs. On the flip side, the government is now the biggest drag on the job market. Overall, federal, state and local governments cut 11,000 jobs in April.

The bigger picture, however, remains static. About 11.7 million people remain unemployed, and the unemployment rate fell to 7.5% in April, but that's still high compared to historical levels. Before the recession hit, the unemployment rate was 4.5%.

""This is a classic 'hold-steady' report -- enough job growth to keep the unemployment rate stable but not much more,"" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. ""In good times, this would be fine, but at a time like this, it represents an ongoing disaster.""

A big question still hangs in the air about how many jobless Americans are simply not being counted in the unemployment figures. The unemployment rate only includes people who have looked for work in the prior four weeks. Workers who have given up on the job market are not counted.

Only 63.3% of the civilian population, over age 16, is either working or looking for a job. That's the lowest labor force participation rate since May 1979.

Blue-collar jobs take a hit: Over the last six years, the labor force has declined most dramatically in auto manufacturing states like Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. While some veteran workers may simply be retiring, the trend could also reflect former blue-collar jobs transforming into fewer high-skill, technical positions.

""These jobs pay more, but there aren't as many of them either,"" said Mark Vitner, senior economist for Wells Fargo. ""In order to fill those jobs, workers may need to be retrained.""

Nationwide, manufacturing hiring came to a halt in April.

Construction firms also cut 6,000 jobs. The sector had been adding jobs for the prior 10 months, fueled mainly by the housing recovery. But, as of April, job cuts by commercial firms were large enough to offset jobs added by homebuilders. Those job cuts are most likely tied to recent declines in government-funded construction projects, for example on infrastructure and schools.

Health care remained a strong sector, adding 19,000 jobs in April. Hospitals and doctors' offices hired more workers, and demand for more health care for the elderly is driving a surge in home health care services. That industry added 6,000 jobs in April. The Labor Department expects home health aide to be the fastest growing occupation in the country this decade.

How far we've come: Overall, the U.S. economy lost 8.7 million jobs in the financial crisis, and since then has added back about 6.2 million jobs.

Once you factor population growth into the mix, Shierholz estimates there is still a gap of 8.6 million jobs ""missing"" from the U.S. economy. If hiring keeps up at its current pace, it will take about five more years to get back to a pre-recession job market."

Combining all instances of reported sexual assault on an off campus from 2009 to 2011, George Washington University had 56; Georgetown University, 26; and Howard, 20.

With thousands of students arriving this month for a new academic year at Howard University, the school is still roiling from reports of two summertime crimes that have raised fresh questions about safety on the Northwest Washington campus.

Police reported two violent attacks at Howard last month: the robbery and fatal shooting of a rising senior on July 4, and the rape of a campus visitor inside a classroom building on July 22.

The publicity surrounding both reports, along with a separate crime spike last fall, have prompted a soul-searching on how to shake long-standing perceptions and realities about crime and safety on a campus in the heart of a big city.

The discussion began when the campus was already shaken by a financial crisis at Howard, first revealed in June, that led to layoffs and sparked a debate about the school’s future.

“Having a safe environment is essential,” Howard’s president, Sidney A. Ribeau, said in a recent interview. “If people are worried about crime, they cannot learn.”

Ribeau and other officials have sought to boost campus security in time for the fall semester. He said that freshmen, who will begin moving into dorms Saturday, will be counseled about their environment soon after their arrival. Students will also be greeted by guards posted at dormitories, and they will be offered 24-hour shuttle service to off-campus apartments and other buildings in the historic Shaw neighborhood.

In addition, undercover D.C. police officers will patrol the campus in increasing numbers.

“The officers are being told to be more observant, that their job is even harder now,” said Cedric Scott, an 11-year veteran of the Howard University police force and vice president of the Metropolitan Campus Police Officers Union. “We don’t want to be in a position where something happens and we aren’t where we’re supposed to be.”

Howard leads most other schools in the District in both on- and off-campus street robberies, which often target students carrying book bags, computers and smartphones.

But in other ways, Howard compares favorably with the other urban campuses of Washington. The university reported 20 sexual assaults on and off campus between 2009 and 2011, the latest years available.

Georgetown University reported 26 sexual assaults on and off campus over those three years. George Washington University reported 56.

Howard officials also point to statistics that show a dramatic drop in campus crime over a five-year period. There were 47 robberies in 2008 and 15 last year. There were 29 in 2010 and five in 2011.

They also say the recent financial turmoil has not affected public safety. Howard University Police Chief Leroy K. James said the budget issues that forced the elimination of 73 university staff members spared his 211-member force.

James said 15 officers were recently hired and an additional five are about to join. Officials said the public-safety budget has risen from $10 million to $11 million, not including several million to improve technology, such as key-card access to buildings and surveillance cameras.

Officials are also contemplating more long-term efforts to improve campus safety, including revitalizing the more well-worn portions of the Georgia Avenue corridor, which skirts Howard’s open, 108-acre campus.

The thoroughfare hardly offers a grand entrance to campus. Walking up from the Shaw Metro station to the university means passing a collection of gritty

carry-outs, an array of “cold beer” signs and storefronts selling throwaway cellphones.

Ribeau described the contrast between Georgia Avenue and the campus itself as emblematic of “the divide between the haves and the have-nots in America.”

He said he hopes that Howard can anchor a burst of gentrification, much like those occurring elsewhere in the District, attracting thousands of new residents and clearing away crime. “Ten years from now, there will be a new Georgia Avenue corridor,” he said.

Already, store owners and vendors said they’ve seen marked improvements and called the area safer than in years past. And campus visitors interviewed last week expressed little concern.

Kenya Hall, a 37-year-old from Brooklyn, came with her son, Aaron Trotman, who plans to attend Howard this fall. “I’m not scared,” said Trotman, 17. Hall added, “I’ve seen two police pass by in the last five minutes.”

But Wilhelmina Rochester, who drives a FedEx truck and makes stops throughout campus each day, said students here and elsewhere nearby are typically easy prey. “I’ve seen people get robbed,” said Rochester, 57, adding that she occasionally notices security lights that don’t work.

The latest discussion of safety at Howard was prompted primarily by a random robbery July 4 on Georgia Avenue, which police said led to the shooting death of Omar Adam Sykes, 22. He would have been a senior majoring in business marketing this year. No arrest has been made.

Then came the report of a rape July 22, which the victim said occurred after her attacker followed her off a Metro bus. Police and university officials said privately that surveillance video does not support the woman’s story, but they have not discounted it and have released a photo of a man they want to question.

There was also a crime spike last October, including a carjacking in a campus parking lot, a robbery of a student at gunpoint in front of the stadium, an assault of four students as they walked home from a party and another robbery at gunpoint of a man outside the campus theater.

Then, in November, a 19-year-old student was raped in the Bethune Annex dorm by an intruder police said had been hiding in her bathroom. University officials said they have replaced keycard access with 24-hour security guards at every dorm.

D.C. police charged a man in that rape and another attack in which a woman allegedly was stabbed repeatedly by a man who broke into her apartment in Northeast Washington. Police said the same knife was used in both attacks. The suspect’s trial is pending.

The victim of the on-campus rape, who spoke publicly for the first time since the attack in an e-mail exchange this month, said she has decided to return to Howard this fall despite her misgivings about safety.

“Although the choice was not easy especially considering recent events, I have decided to come back,” she wrote. “It’s a struggle mentally, emotionally and physically to feign normality and return to the school after something such as this.”

But, she said: “The last thing you want taken from you is something you’ve worked for and deserve. I want my education and I refuse to let him or anyone else take that as well.”"

(Appeal document)

The father of a 7-year-old suspended from his Anne Arundel County school for nibbling his breakfast pastry into the shape of a gun filed a formal appeal Thursday, asking that the second-grader’s school records be wiped clean of the offense.

“The chewed pastry was not capable of harming anybody, even if thrown,” said the appeal, addressed to Anne Arundel Superintendent Kevin M. Maxwell and Park Elementary School Principal Sandy Blondell. “It could not fire any missile whatsoever.”

The case, which attracted national attention, came 11 weeks after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., which left 20 children and six staff members dead. In the massacre’s aftermath, sensitivities have been heightened about security and guns, even imaginary ones.

In recent weeks, children have been suspended from school for pointing their fingers like guns and, in one case, for talking about shooting a Hello Kitty gun that blows bubbles. In several cases, the offenses were described in harsh terms — one as a “terroristic threat” — and officials agreed, after appeals, to clear students’ permanent records.

In the Anne Arundel case, the son of William “B.J.” Welch was suspended March 1 for two days after chewing his breakfast bar, akin to a Pop-Tart, and yelling, “Look I made a gun,” according to the appeal. He aimed the pastry at students in a hallway and those at nearby desks, the appeal said.

“It was harmless,” Welch said. “It was a danish.”

After the suspension, Welch asked that his son’s record be wiped clean of words such as “gun,” which he worried could be damaging as the boy grows up. But school officials turned him down. In recent days, he hired lawyer Robin Ficker, who has handled three other recent suspensions of young children accused of similar actions.

In the appeal, Ficker wrote that the boy was accused of classroom disruption, although it was during a breakfast period with no teaching. The child’s classmates were eating the same breakfast bars and recognized “the pastry as a pastry and not a gun,” the appeal said.

The shape that touched off so much trouble, the appeal argues, is similar in appearance to puzzle pieces of states such as Idaho, Florida and Oklahoma, which it said are “available in every second grade classroom in the state of Maryland.”

The filing included photos of chewed Pop-Tarts and the three states.

Anne Arundel schools spokesman Bob Mosier said that the district had not received the appeal as of late Thursday afternoon and that he could not comment on the case because of confidentiality laws. Anne Arundel, he said, uses a discipline system with six tiers, and suspension is not an option until an offense reaches Level 3.

The appeal says that the second-grader’s offense March 1 was a “Level 3 violation” and that the school said the boy was seeking “peer attention” and “power control.” But Ficker argues in the appeal it was the “worst possible interpretation. . . . He was simply playing, as all kids his age do.”

Welch said in an interview that he remains hopeful about getting his son’s record cleared. “I don’t think he’ll be making any more food weapons,” Welch said.

Last week, a Maryland lawmaker introduced a bill that would forbid suspensions of young children for imaginary guns, pictures of guns or objects that resemble a gun but serve another purpose.

State Sen. J.B. Jennings (R-Baltimore County) said that he hopes school boards would act reasonably on their own but that too many cases suggested otherwise. The pastry suspension was “one of the last straws,” he said.

Jennings acknowledged that he was not hearing the school’s side of every story but said he was “looking for common sense in the classroom.”

“I think these are kids playing around — these are boys being boys,” Jennings said. “They watch cartoons. They are kids.”"

The candidate for the Los Angeles school board stood outside her chief fundraiser’s home and balked at the task of asking people for money.

Then, she said, she thought of three struggling students in her fifth-grade class at San Pedro Street Elementary, located in a gritty downtown Los Angeles neighborhood. She thought of the vocational programs, better training for teachers and other ideas she could push for as a board member to keep her students from falling off track.

Her hesitancy vanished.

“I am asking for them,” she said after her electoral triumph last week. “After that, I was inspired.”

From start to finish in what supporters are calling her “miracle” win, Ratliff has been driven by thoughts of her students. The 43-year-old teacher defeated Antonio Sanchez, a political aide backed by a $2.2-million campaign (compared with Ratliff’s $52,000) and supported by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, his allies, heavyweight labor unions and others.

But, her supporters say, Ratliff had what Sanchez lacked: The authenticity of a 12-year teaching career and a deep emotional commitment to her students that visibly surfaces when she talks about those who need her help.

Ratliff entered the race motivated by thoughts of those students — some of whom had stumbled after leaving her school but might have stayed on track with more sustained support. She learned of the District 6 open seat just three days before the filing deadline but jumped in anyway.

“This is my chance to help these kids,” she recalled thinking. “I could change their educational lives.”

During the campaign, she refused to take off any time from teaching, despite urging to do so from some of her campaign advisors. She went to bed at 11 p.m. on election night not knowing whether she won or lost, because she had to wake up at 6 a.m. to make the commute from Sunland to school.

And as she prepares to join the Board of Education, Ratliff brims with ideas about how she hopes to make the nation’s second-largest school district more effective for students. How far she will get in promoting her ideas, however, is uncertain. The seven-member board is divided on many issues, although not always along the same lines.

One big theme Ratliff voices is more local control for schools to choose their own curriculum and spending priorities rather than follow top-down mandates.

Her classroom experience gives her strong views on what works and doesn’t. District assessment tests are a “waste of money and time” because the results come in too late to help teachers, who constantly assess their students anyway, she said. Why not free up money and let schools make their own purchasing decisions — as San Pedro has done with federal dollars to fund a nurse, library aide, teaching assistants?

“You’re not getting enough bang for the buck,” she said of those tests, noting that charter schools are not required to give them.

Ratliff prefers to teach reading and writing with children’s literary classics rather than the district-issued textbook anthology. So far this year, her class has dug into such favorites as “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” “Old Yeller,” “The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe” and, currently, “Holes” — books she says engages them far more than the shortened stories in district anthologies. How about encouraging all schools to make their own curriculum choices?

Advertisement

Even questions of class size and campus security should be left to the local school, she said. Smaller classes could help struggling students, but others might do fine in larger ones.

Does the district really need to spend $4.2 million for extra security aides at campuses in the aftermath of the school shooting in Newtown, Conn.? If schools were allowed to decide how best to spend those safety dollars, she said, her own campus might have decided to fund a gated buzzer system after a school staff member was threatened by someone who walked in off the street.

“I’ve felt some of the district mandates are disconnected from the classroom,” she said.

Another major interest, she said, will be working with the district and United Teachers Los Angeles to find incentives for highly effective teachers to work in low-performing schools.

Advertisement

At her own school, for instance, the staff has boosted students who are overwhelmingly low-income and not fluent in English to outperform their district peers in reading and math. Nearly two-thirds are at grade level in math and more than half are proficient in reading.

And she is keen to push for more vocational programs. One of her students, she said, could be more talented on a more technical path but may not make it if pushed along a rigorous academic track.

The main goal of her opponent’s biggest funders was to safeguard the job of L.A. schools Supt. John Deasy and strengthen his influence. During the campaign, Ratliff’s position on Deasy “evolved,” as she put it. Most recently, she said she wants to keep him on the job, but reserves her right to evaluate him.

As her school’s union representative, she had to defend the rights of teachers, yet she still enjoyed a strong rapport with her principal. She served in the union’s main decision-making body — its House of Representatives — yet the union did nothing of substance to elect her. As a result, she may have that rare opportunity to demonstrate true independence.

Advertisement

Her nuanced position on teacher evaluations aligns with neither Deasy nor the union. Although she’s spent her career in a traditional school, she has no innate hostility toward independently managed charter schools, most of which are non-union.

“She’s not the kind of person ever to hold a grudge or base her decisions on who scratched her back and who is her friend,” said Ruby Chavez, a San Pedro colleague. “If you know Monica, you’ll understand she has a mind of her own.”

For now, Ratliff is savoring her victory. At a celebration party in Granada Hills over the weekend, more than 100 supporters ate barbecue and marveled at what many called her “David and Goliath” win.

Fred Huebscher, her campaign consultant, said two decisions proved critically important: Her ballot designation as “fifth-grade teacher,” which conjured up warm memories of elementary school and images of her “teaching cute kids.” And her decision to place an accent mark over the “o” in her first name to signal her Latina heritage (she refused suggestions to use her mother’s maiden name of Asenio Padilla because she did not want to dishonor her father).

Other teachers who walked precincts with her said some voters told them they were repelled by Villaraigosa’s and Sanchez’s reliance on millions of dollars of outside funding. Chuck Kanganis, her boyfriend and campaign manager, said voters could connect with Ratliff’s intelligence, compassion and “absolute integrity.”

As she put it Saturday: “My grass-roots campaign was so grass-roots, it’s seeds. But thanks to you it grew and grew.”

"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-sandy-hook-return-20130104,0,4935940.story",2013-01-03 08:00:00,[],Sandy Hook students go back to class,"As the children stepped off the school bus, the signs pointed to the typical kind of excitement for the first day back at class. But for the 500 or so students and teachers from Sandy Hook Elementary School, there was nothing typical about Thursday.

After three weeks of unspeakable tragedy, funerals and muted holiday celebrations, Thursday was an effort to deliver a sense of normalcy for those who survived the shooting massacre that left 20 first-graders and six adults dead, residents of Newtown, Conn., in shock and a nation in grief.

Now the school is in a new town — Monroe, just seven miles away — but with its old name and a lot of support.

“A lot of them were happy to see their friends they hadn’t seen in a while,” Monroe Police Lt. Keith White told reporters. He described class attendance as “very good.”

Sandy Hook Elementary officials declined to talk with reporters, who were kept several miles away to not be a distraction.

The new building — until recently Monroe’s shuttered Chalk Hill School — was refurbished to help in the transition. Students arrived to find their old desks, classroom decorations and Sandy Hook’s furniture.

Julian Ford, a clinical psychologist at the University of Connecticut who helped counsel families in the days after the massacre, emphasized that familiarity was important for the children, who live more in the present than adults.

“When they see the classroom, it is not going to take them right back to the terrible incidents that happened,” he said, “but to all the experiences in the prior part of the school year — most of which will be very reassuring and positive for them.”

Despite the efforts to make the new school comfortable, signs of the tragedy were unavoidable. Students spent time with so-called comfort dogs and counselors were on hand. Inside a lecture hall, concerned parents asked questions about security and “how school was going to go,” White said.

At the state Capitol in Hartford, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy announced the formation of a Sandy Hook Advisory Commission to make policy recommendations on public safety, prevention of gun violence and mental health.

It was no surprise that a large police presence greeted students and teachers outside the school. But White said it would be reevaluated “week to week.”

“We don’t want them to think this is a police state,” he said. “We want them to know that this is a school and a school first. And that it is a place they are to come to learn, enjoy their friends and grow up.”

Ford said parents had a crucial role to play as their children recovered from what they would probably remember as a “very strange period,” filled with too many people, too much going on. “When parents are able to express what they are feeling in a way that communicates that it’s going to be all right, kids really pick up” those cues.

One mother, Denise Correia, told CNN: “There is no real playbook for this. We are kind of just sensing our child and trying to meet the needs that we can, and just support them.”

One 82-year-old preacher even called for “Tea Party” style meetings in some of Chicago’s south side communities such as Altgeld Gardens and Trumbull Park.

“This was a historic event,” Paul McKinley of V.O.T.E. (Voices of the Ex-Offender) and former 2nd Congressional District GOP nominee to replace Jesse Jackson, Jr. told Breitbart News. “Not because of Al Sharpton coming to town,” he continued. “This was first time since electing Mayor Harold Washington in the eighties that all of these grassroots groups and community organizers have come together under one roof to talk about the problems plaguing our community.”

While the stated goal for Sharpton was to bring the many different groups together to discuss solutions to the city’s violence epidemic, he may not have gotten the types of responses he was looking for. Calls for more gun control laws and getting guns off the streets were nonexistent and not mentioned by residents throughout the session.

Instead, attendees offered solutions addressing the problems facing their community as a whole rather than just taking on “gun violence” itself. Audience members addressed the need for jobs and solving the foreclosure crisis plaguing Chicago’s south and west sides. Perhaps the loudest message–and one that Reverend Al or the Chicago media have yet to report on–echoed by several different people in attendance as well as panel members was that it is time for the black community to start voting differently.

“The manner in which we have been voting needs to change,” Wendy Pearson, an activist against Chicago school closings, told the room. “I’m here to say to you that we have been trained to vote in a specific manner… we need to start looking at the manner in which our elected officials have been voting… if they have not voted in a manner that is beneficial to you, yours, and your community, then you need to start voting them out.”

McKinley told the room, “Stop blaming just anybody for the violence in the city of Chicago. Blame the right people, not just white people, but the right people. Because it’s not just white folks a part of this, but it is on the fifth floor. The fifth floor took your schools, the fifth floor just took your jobs that he said that he gave to the ex-offender… and every single alderman was a part of this criminal process.”

McKinley called on President Obama to help the grassroots by discontinuing aid and government grants that go through Chicago’s political machine to “name-brand-blue-ribbon-negro-organizations” such as the NAACP and Urban League. McKinley told Breitbart News those groups “are poverty pimps, and are part of the problem and not the solution.”"

Speaking at the annual Values Voter Summit, a gathering of conservative Christians in Washington, Rios painted a picture of a nation under siege by homosexuals.

Rios, the former president of the conservative Christian group Concerned Women of America, referenced a recent story in The Advocate, a national magazine geared toward LGBT readers, that challenges the narrative of the Matthew Shepard story. The article examines a new book by Stephen Jimenez, The Book of Matt, which suggests Shepard's murder was drug-related.

In Rios' retelling, however, Shepard's murder was part of a long-term plan by liberals and the LGBT community to create a society that is accepting of gay people.

It is up to Christian conservatives, Rios argued, to stop that acceptance. ""We can't let [gay people] keep breaking hearts and taking lives,"" she said, one of a number of references Rios made to her theory that gay men are responsible for the AIDS epidemic.

""You think youth is worshipped in heterosexual sex? It is top of the line [for gay men]. And they like young men, young virile men,"" Rios told a crowd of hundreds in the ballroom of the Omni Shoreham Hotel. ""You get old and you're a gay man? There's so much rejection.""

Rios also railed against the nonprofit civil rights group the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks and catalogues extremist and hate groups in the United States. Rios said the SPLC ""cares more about attacking American Christians than it does about protecting"" the civil rights of African-Americans, which the group has done for more than three decades.

SPLC and a coalition of other human rights groups encouraged members of Congress not to speak at the Values Voter Summit because a number of the sponsoring groups, including the American Family Association and the Family Research Council, hold extremist anti-gay views.

President Barack Obama in 2009 passed anti-hate crimes legislation named after Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., who was also killed in a hate crime."

(CNN) - The death penalty should be applied in the case of Dzhokar Tsarnaev, the 19-year-old suspected of participating in the Boston Marathon bombings, Sen. Chuck Schumer said Sunday.

""Given the facts that I've seen, it would be appropriate to use the death penalty in this case and I hope they would apply it in federal court,"" Schumer, D-New York, said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

And Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on Fox News the case should likely be considered a death penalty case under federal law.

While the death penalty is not legal in the state of Massachusetts, it can be used at the federal level.

Tsarnaev, a naturalized citizen, remains in the hospital in serious condition under federal custody. Federal prosecutors hope to charge him as early as Sunday, a Department of Justice official told CNN. Due to his condition, he may be arraigned at the hospital, a law enforcement source said.

Federal prosecutors had been working on preparing terrorism and possibly other charges against him, a Justice Department official told CNN. He's suspected of plotting and carrying out the Boston Marathon bombings along with his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who died after a shootout with police Thursday night.

Schumer authored the 1994 law that expanded the federal death penalty to include additional crimes. Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted of carrying out the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, received the death penalty. He was executed by lethal injection in 2001.

""This is just the kind of case that it should be applied to,"" Schumer said, referring to the Boston Marathon blasts, which killed three people and injured more than 170 others. The Tsarnaev brothers are also suspected in the shooting death of an MIT officer last week."

ABC News is is reporting that his attorneys have dropped their strategy to seek dismissal of the case at an immunity hearing set for April. Zimmerman was expected to cite Florida's Stand Your Ground law at the hearing which, if successful, would have immediately set Zimmerman free.



George Zimmerman's attorneys stunned court observers today by deciding to skip a ""Stand Your Ground"" hearing slated for April that might have led to a dismissal of the charges in the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin. Under Florida's Stand Your Ground law, Zimmerman is entitled to immunity and if he can prove he shot and killed Martin Feb. 26, 2012 self defense. If self defense was determined, all criminal proceedings would have immediately stopped, and Zimmerman would have walked free. But Zimmerman's legal team also risked the possibility that the judge would reject the motion and the hearing would give prosecutors an opportunity to pick apart Zimmerman's testimony.

O’Mara said outside Seminole County Courthouse on Tuesday that Zimmerman believes it would be a better outcome to be found not guilty of murdering Martin, rather than being granted immunity, WESH reported. ""George wants a jury of his peers to decide the case. It’s going to be, I think, a more accepted result for everyone who has to result that he gets an acquittal at trial even more so than immunity hearing by a judge.""

Vincent said that releasing the court dates doesn’t waive any rights Zimmerman has to have an immunity hearing, and indeed the defense may raise “Stand Your Ground” claims at trial. In addition, Zimmerman could seek immunity from civil claims at a later date. “By entertaining the option of not having an immunity hearing before trial, George preserves the option of having a civil immunity hearing should he need it in the future,” Vincent said.

His attorneys indicated they will still pursue a self-defense strategy, possibly citing Stand Your Ground at trial. They also left open the possibility that they may request a Stand Your Ground hearing at a later date. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said he believes that his client has a better shot of being acquitted in a jury trial than he does being granted immunity by a judge.A spokesman for Zimmerman’s defense team, Sean Vincent spoke with NBC News and indicated Zimmerman may still seek immunity at a civil hearing if the need arises.So the saga continues in the pursuit of justice for Trayvon Martin."

Officials had previously disclosed finding materials pertaining to Norwegian mass-killer Anders Breivik -- a right-wing ultranationalist who killed 77 people in July 2011 -- in Lanza’s home, where he lived with his mother, Nancy Lanza.

Breivik’s shooting rampage on Utøya Island, which followed a bombing near government offices in Oslo, targeted teenagers belonging to a left-leaning political party.

TIMELINE: Deadliest U.S. shootings

Lanza shot his mother in the head four times before proceeding to the school, where police said he used an AR-15-style rifle to do his killing. He shot himself in the head with a pistol.

The Hartford Courant reported that Lanza fired 152 bullets in five minutes at the school and had hundreds of more rounds with him and in his car. At one point, six children escaped Lanza when his AR-15 jammed or failed to fire, sources said.

The Stamford Advocate, citing an unnamed source, said officials found documents on “virtually every mass murder” in the United States and elsewhere after searching the Lanza home.

The source said they found “a lot of material” in particular on Charles Carl Roberts IV, who attacked an Amish schoolhouse in 2006, killing five girls.

The Associated Press also reported that literature on other mass shootings was found at his house.

Connecticut State Police have kept a tight lid on the investigation, whose search warrant affidavits and applications have remained sealed over concerns that the investigation could be impeded.

Investigators last issued a news release on Feb. 19 to denounce media leaks and to say they would not release more information before the conclusion of the investigation, which did not have a given end date.

Legislature may act on proposal next week

Efforts draw resistance from gun-rights advocates

Governors in Colorado%2C Connecticut also pursuing tougher limits

ALBANY, N.Y. – In 1911, New York passed the Sullivan law, one of the first gun-control laws in the nation that required a permit to own a handgun.

More than a century later, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg have become national players in the push for tougher gun laws, putting New York at the forefront of the gun-control debate.

While the White House works to curb gun violence after the school shootings in Newtown, Conn., New York is forging ahead quickly with its own proposal. Cuomo, a Democrat and potential 2016 presidential candidate, has vowed to pass the toughest gun-control measures in the country. State lawmakers are hoping to pass a set of laws as early as news week, which would make it the first state to do so since the Connecticut shootings.

""Gun violence has been on a rampage, as we know firsthand, and we know painfully,"" Cuomo said in the annual State of the State Address last Wednesday. ""We must stop the madness, my friends, and in one word, it's just enough. It has been enough.""

Cuomo is pressing lawmakers, including Republicans who control the state Senate, to support his agenda.

""To be blind to this issue and the number of tragedies and the amount of bloodshed, I think would be dereliction of your public service responsibility,"" he said Thursday.

Those efforts, though, are drawing increasing resistance from gun-rights advocates. The National Rifle Association issued a statement Wednesday saying, ""America's most anti-gun governor hails from the same state as the nation's most anti-gun mayor.""

The group argued that New York already has among the toughest gun laws in the nation, including an assault-rifle ban and a 10-round magazine capacity limit. The NRA on its website said New York is trying to move quickly in order to diminish public debate.

New York lawmakers are proposing to expand the assault-rifle ban to include all high-capacity magazines. Currently, high-capacity magazines are banned in New York unless they were manufactured before 1994, a loophole that Cuomo wants to close. Lawmakers also want to reduce the number of bullets in a magazine from 10 to seven, which would be the most stringent limit in the nation.

Bloomberg and Cuomo haven't always agreed on state policy, but they appear to be in sync on the gun-control issue.

""New York state has led the nation with strong, common-sense gun laws, and the governor's new proposals will build on that tradition,"" Bloomberg, an independent who heads the group Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said Wednesday. ""They will help law enforcement keep guns out of the hands of criminals and other dangerous people and save lives.""

Other Democratic governors are pursuing also tougher gun laws. On Thursday, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper proposed universal background checks for gun sales. Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy has set up a panel to make proposals by March.

New York, with nearly 19.5 million people the third largest state in the U.S., ranked 24th in the nation for its murder rate in 2010, federal statistics show, and slightly below the national average. Last month, Bloomberg announced that the number of murders in the city was the lowest since records started being kept 50 years ago.

The debate over gun laws in New York has expanded to media coverage. The Journal News in Westchester County, like USA TODAY, a Gannett Co. publication, has been under heavy criticism for publishing an interactive map of the names and addresses of pistol-permit holders in the northern New York City suburbs. Putnam County has refused a request to release its list of pistol-permit holders and has vowed to fight the newspaper in court, saying the information's release would jeopardize safety. Good-government groups defended the newspaper, saying the information is public.

Some lawmakers want a state law that would make the pistol-permit information private, but Cuomo has not included the measure in his gun-control package.

""I'll leave it to the local government to make their interpretation of the law,"" Cuomo said Thursday. ""And my guess is in these cases, the court will wind up deciding.""

Republicans and conservatives in New York are focusing on tougher laws on illegal guns, saying the shootings in Newtown and another in Webster, N.Y., on Christmas Eve when four volunteer firefighters were shot, killing two, in an ambush shouldn't be linked to law-abiding gun owners.

""Any further restrictions on legal gun ownership in New York state will jeopardize the safety of all New York's citizens,"" the state's Conservative Party said in a memo to legislators Friday. ""The best solution to end indefensible terroristic acts is to prosecute to the fullest extent possible all those who use illegal guns.""

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/22/nra-robocalls-newtown-_n_2934948.html,2013-03-22 00:00:00,['White House Reporter'],NRA Robocalls In Newtown Spark Outrage From Local Gun Control Group,"WASHINGTON -- The National Rifle Association came under fire late Thursday from members of a gun-control advocacy group in Newtown, Conn., after reports surfaced of Newtown residents receiving robocalls and pro-gun postcards from the NRA.

The advocacy group, the Newtown Action Alliance, posted a Facebook message Thursday about the calls, prompting responses from people who said they'd received communications from the NRA and were upset by them.

""I received one of these,"" Newtown resident Christopher Wenis wrote on Facebook Thursday afternoon. ""I was insulted and offended."" Wenis told The Huffington Post in an interview Friday night that in the 36 hours since he first posted his response, he received two more robocalls from the NRA, one later on Thursday night and one on Friday evening.

""I've got a 5-year-old son who went to preschool on the Sandy Hook Elementary School campus,"" Wenis explained. ""And this was a really hard week for me on a lot of levels. These calls were the very last thing I needed.""

Wenis said that he called the NRA twice to request that his name be placed on a ""Do Not Call List"" -- first on Tuesday and again Thursday. He said an NRA phone operator assured him he would be removed from NRA call lists. But the calls kept coming. By Friday night, Wenis said, he was desperate to be left in peace.

Another woman, Lisa Abrams, wrote on Facebook that she had ""received a call and a postcard asking me to call my congressmen and tell them 'NO ASSUALT WEAPONS BAN' [sic] ... I was not happy and needless to say did just the opposite!""

LISTEN: NRA robocall in Connecticut, sent by a HuffPost reader:

Tom Maurath, a 40-year resident of Newtown, said he was having dinner with his family on Tuesday when the phone rang at 6:37 p.m. ""Our caller ID announces who is calling, and when I heard 'National Rifle Association,' I jumped to answer the phone so my 6-year-old son wouldn't get there first,"" he told The Huffington Post in an interview. ""Our son loves to answer the phone because it might be Grandma.""

Maurath said he listened to a prerecorded message about Connecticut state gun legislation for about 30 seconds -- a call that he was stunned to realize took no account of who might pick up the phone.

""The idea that this message could have been delivered to a sibling of one of the families who lost children at [Sandy Hook Elementary School] is just appalling,"" he said.

In the months since the tragic school shooting in December, Newtown has become a focal point for the nation's renewed debate over gun control, as well as an international symbol of America's epidemic of gun violence. The Connecticut Legislature is considering a bevy of gun-control measures in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre. On Tuesday, a bill requiring universal background checks for gun purchases in Connecticut cleared a key committee. The state already has a ban in place on military-style assault weapons.

This week Maurath also received a postcard from the NRA, which he shared with HuffPost. The blaze-orange card proclaims, ""Despite public outcry, anti-gun legislators in the Connecticut General Assembly are aggressively forging ahead with numerous proposals that are designed to disarm and punish law-abiding gun owners and sportsmen.""

(Rep. Dan Carter, mentioned on the card, is the state legislator who represents Newtown.)

Maurath said the script of the phone message sounded a lot like the postcard. He also said that at least a half-dozen of his fellow residents in Newtown had told him they received similar robocalls.

A spokesman for the NRA, which opposes the measures being proposed in Connecticut, said robocalls in the state were made to NRA members and supporters, and were designed to be informative about the legislation being considered.

As is the case in other states, ""We have members, contributors, and supporters in Connecticut who expect us to do our jobs and keep them abreast of developments on the legislative front in their state,"" NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told HuffPost.

Maurath, however, could think of no reason why he would have been singled out to receive such a call. A registered independent, he said he has ""thought over and over about any reason I would have been on their lists, but there isn't one. I have zero connection to this group or any affiliated group.""

Robocalls are nothing new for the NRA or for many large advocacy groups. Tax-exempt groups like charities and advocacy groups, as well as political campaigns, are exempt from many of the restrictions placed on commercial telemarketing calls by the Federal Trade Commission. It's common for advocacy groups on both sides of the political spectrum to purchase mailing lists and phone lists from other like-minded organizations, such as political parties that generally support the same issue platform. The NRA is known for being very protective of its member lists.

Maurath is still in shock over why Newtown residents weren't exempted from this round of NRA robocalls.

""There are only three phone number prefixes here in town, and it's less than three months after the most horrific tragedy imaginable,"" he said. ""You'd think they could have scrubbed the list, just to be decent. Instead, you're making an unsolicited call with no opt-out that my children could answer.

Thousands of gun fans have been listening to speakers addressing the NRA's annual convention in Houston, Texas, at which the former vice presidential candidate praised members for 'not giving up'.

Mrs Palin said: ""The Washington establishment sneers at you, and you don't give up.

""The lamestream media just plain doesn't get you, and you don't give up, you don't retreat.""

The convention was the first since the start of a national debate over gun control following December's mass shooting of teachers and school children in Newtown, Connecticut.

Mrs Palin said recent mass shootings had prompted leaders in Washington DC to exploit tragedy in order to limit the freedoms of law-abiding people.

While she and others were saddened and angered by the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary, she added, the emotions that resulted from it would not make anybody safer and would not ""protect the good guys' rights"".

The former Governor of Alaska asked those at the convention to ""keep the faith"" and ""stand up and fight for our freedoms"".

Last month a US Senate bill aimed at forcing restrictions on who could own guns was thrown out.

More than 70,000 NRA members were expected to attend the three-day convention.

Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre said his organisation would not stop defending the rights of gun owners.

He told the convention: ""We will never back away from our resolve to defend our rights and the rights of all law-abiding American gun owners.""

US President Barack Obama, who has pushed for gun control measures, was a prime target for criticism.

Gary DuBois, a member of the NRA, claimed gun control pushes crime up.

He told a film crew: ""I hate to sound like I'm paranoid or something, but the deal is, any thinking person, you can look at Britain, Australia, any place where they put gun control in effect, crime goes up.

""They can say that they are doing it for public safety, but it's just not right, they are doing it for another reason. I think it's for control.""

Story continues

Across the street from the conference hall, America's campaign against gun violence - called No More Names - was protesting by reading out the names of all those shot dead since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre.

The campaign was trying to remind NRA members that 30,000 Americans die every year from gun violence.

Erica Lafferty, whose mother, Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung, was killed in the elementary school shooting, said: ""The most recent polling that I've seen was that 74 per cent of NRA members do support the universal background check.

""It seems like it's their leadership that's kind of way more right than that and is really giving a lot of push back against it.""

Recent national polls have indicated that a majority of US citizens are in favour of expanding background checks.

But many convention attendees said on Friday that they were not in favour of such efforts.

Politicians have said they intend to continue pressing for restrictions to be brought in at the federal level.

Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, has said he will re-introduce the bill to require criminal and mental health background checks for gun buyers.

Some states have taken matters into their own hands and introduced gun controls without the need for national legislation."

The debate took place at Virginia Tech, and McAuliffe referenced the 2007 shooting on that campus as justification for more gun control.

Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli correctly stated more gun control would not have prohibited that shooting and that shooters like the killer in that instance, Seung-Hui Cho, are “almost impossible” to find before they decide to start shooting. McAuliffe replied, “Some people should not own guns.” He then defended his gun control proposals, saying: “I don’t care what grade I got from the NRA. I never want to see another Newtown or Aurora or Virginia Tech again.”

Cuccinelli’s argument is in line with experts on the subjects of firearms and the mentally ill. Mayo Clinic psychiatrist J. Michael Bostwick, M.D., recently wrote that more gun control aimed at the mentally will not end mass shootings. According to Bostwick, not even confiscating guns from the mentally ill will do that.

He says this is because the great percentage of the mentally ill are not dangerous, while individuals who commit mass shootings and are mentally ill are usually only discovered to suffer from mental illness after the fact.

On top of this, an internal investigation by a Virginia Tech Review Panel reported that more gun control would not have stopped the Virginia Tech shooting. Looking particularly at bans on “high capacity” magazines–bans which McAuliffe supports–the review panel said having 10 round magazines instead of 15 round magazines “would have not made that much difference in the incident.”

The bill also focuses on high-capacity ammunition magazines.

The National Rifle Associations calls it a misguided attack on constitutional gun rights.

WASHINGTON — Congressional Democrats, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, have reintroduced a bill that would ban assault weapons despite opposition in the Republican-led House and the reluctance of some Senate Democrats.

Feinstein wrote the original assault weapons ban, which became law in 1994 and expired in 2004. Democratic Reps. Carolyn McCarthy of New York and Ed Perlmutter of Colorado will lead the effort to push the bill through the House.

The new bill would do the following:

• Ban the sale, transfer, importation or manufacturing of about 150 named firearms, plus certain rifles,handguns and shotguns fitted for detachable magazines and having at least one military characteristic.

• Strengthen the 1994 ban by moving from a two- to a one-characteristic test to determine what constitutes an assault weapon.

• Ban firearms with ""thumbhole stocks"" and ""bullet buttons.""

• Ban the importation of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines.

• Ban high-capacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.

The legislation would grandfather in weapons legally owned on the day of enactment and exempts more than 2,000 specific weapons ""used for hunting or sporting purposes.""

Feinstein said changes had been made in the new version to reflect lessons learned from the 1994 law and to keep pace with the technology of the weapons being manufactured today.

""One criticism of the '94 law was that it was a two-characteristic test that defined that, and that was too easy to work around,"" Feinstein said, noting that manufacturers would tweak models to remove one of the two characteristics making the gun legal. ""The bill we are introducing today, it will be -- will make it much more difficult to work around by removing a one-characteristic test.""

The National Rifle Association, which opposed the original ban and the attempts to revive in 2004, dismissed the bill as a misdirected effort to limit Second Amendment rights.

""Senator Feinstein has been trying to ban guns from law-abiding citizens for decades,"" said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. ""It's disappointing but not surprising that she is once again focused on curtailing the Constitution instead of prosecuting criminals or fixing our broken mental health system. The American people know gun bans do not work and we are confident Congress will reject Senator Feinstein's wrong-headed approach.""

Bill supporters said they were under no illusions it will be easy to pass the bill, which faces significant opposition in the Republican-controlled House.

""This is going to be hard; this is going to be difficult, but to honor those 20 lives and six more in Newtown, we are going to get it done,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. Twenty children and six adults were killed in a mass shooting with an assault weapon on Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.





Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., became emotional as he recalled standing with parents outside the Newtown school who realized their children were not coming out of the school.

""I came there as a public official but what I saw was through the eyes of a parent and I will never forget the sights and sounds of that day,"" he said.

Police who responded to the shooting said they could not have stopped the massacre because of the assault weapon carried by shooter Adam Lanza, Blumenthal said.

Victims and relatives of other shootings also joined the lawmakers Thursday.

Colin Goddard was shot four times when a mentally ill student killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in April 2007.

""I carry three of those four bullets with me now for the rest of my life,"" he said. ""I'm here on behalf of the 32 Hokies who didn't make it that day, and the 32 Americans, the 32 of us that are murdered by guns every single day.""

Shear', 'Peter Baker']",Obama Sees Tough Path on Assault Gun Ban,"WASHINGTON — While President Obama pledged to crack down on access to what he called “weapons of war” in the aftermath of last month’s schoolhouse massacre, the White House has calculated that a ban on military-style assault weapons will be exceedingly difficult to pass through Congress and is focusing on other measures it deems more politically achievable.

As a task force led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. readies recommendations on reducing gun violence for delivery to the president next week, White House officials say a new ban will be an element of whatever final package is proposed. But given the entrenched opposition from gun rights groups and their advocates on Capitol Hill, the White House is trying to avoid making its passage the sole definition of success and is emphasizing other new gun rules that could conceivably win bipartisan support and reduce gun deaths.

During a day of White House meetings on the issue on Thursday, including one with the National Rifle Association, Mr. Biden focused publicly on universal background checks for gun purchases and the need for more federal research on gun violence. In 15 minutes of public remarks, Mr. Biden made no mention of curbing the production and sale of assault weapons, even though he was a prime author of such a law that passed in 1994 and expired 10 years later. Both he and the president say they strongly support an assault weapons ban.

But Mr. Biden noted that his former colleagues in the Senate have long been “pretty universally opposed to any restrictions on gun ownership or what type of weapons can be purchased.” He said they now seem more open to limits on the purchase of high-capacity magazines."

Bills to limit ammunition clips reintroduced in new Congress.

NRA says it expected the bills and will fight back.

Newtown shootings provided new momentum for gun regulation bills.

WASHINGTON — Supporters of tighter federal gun restrictions moved quickly Thursday, the first day of the new Congress, introducing bills in the wake of last month's deadly mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., that will set up a long and contentious fight over the shape of the nation's gun laws.

Democratic Reps. Carolyn McCarthy of New York and Diana DeGette of Colorado refiled the bill they had promoted in earlier Congresses and said they hoped the environment for gun laws would improve in the wake of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 20 students and six adults Dec. 14. The bill would ban high-capacity ammunition magazines.

""These devices are used to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time possible, and we owe it to innocent Americans everywhere to keep them out of the hands of dangerous people,"" McCarthy said. ""We don't even allow hunters to use them – something's deeply wrong if we're protecting game more than we're protecting innocent human beings.""

Despite a series of highly visible mass shootings in malls, on college campuses, at a movie theater and at workplaces, Congress has not passed any significant gun-related regulations since 2007. Since Newtown, several pro-gun legislators, such as Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., have called for greater restrictions.

The National Rifle Association, which has fought off many attempts to increase gun regulation, said Thursday it expected the gun control advocates to come ""full force"" at the NRA.

""This is something we are prepared to address with facts,"" said Andrew Arulanandam, an NRA spokesman.

""I think it's really put a lot of people over the edge,"" DeGette said of the violence in Newtown and a mass shooting in July at a theater in Aurora, Colo., her home state. ""Now is the time to take a tough, principled look at what we need to do.""

In addition to the magazine ban, McCarthy and DeGette reintroduced a bill that would stop the sale of ammunition online. The measure was introduced last year after the Aurora shooting.

More bills are expected soon in the Senate that will have House counterparts, said Shams Tarek, a McCarthy spokesman. They include the Fix Gun Checks Act by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., which would close loopholes that allow gun sales at shows without background checks and strengthen those checks. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has said she will reintroduce a ban on the ownership on assault weapons.

Feinstein sponsored the first ban, which was passed in 1994 and expired in 2004.

The White House, which has been quiet on gun-related legislation until Newtown, is likely to issue its plan Jan. 15. Last month, President Obama asked Vice President Biden, who helped pass the 1994 assault weapons ban while a senator, to lead the administration's effort to send proposals to Congress.

Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said the group is focused on keeping the momentum for this debate going while lawmakers sort out the details of what can be done.

""The administration has shown tremendous leadership on this issue, there are a number of Congress people that have come out in the same way,"" he said. ""While we're applauding every well-intentioned effort, we're looking at the issue holistically. We are not investing entirely yet in every one single solution until we really analyze all the (proposals).""

Getting these measures to the floor in both chambers could be extremely difficult. No Republican has expressed support for specific gun control measures, and the NRA has made it clear it will vehemently oppose any effort to curb gun rights.

In response to the Newtown shooting, the NRA has proposed that the government pay for armed guards in schools to prevent school shootings.

Support for stricter gun laws has risen since the Sandy Hook shooting, according to a recent USA TODAY/Gallup Poll. Fifty-eight percent of those surveyed said they backed tougher restrictions, an increase from 43% in October 2011. The poll also showed a split, as 47% said new laws were necessary while 46% said they preferred enforcing current laws."

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-says-hes-determined-ever-gun-bill-221018585--politics.html,,[],Obama says he's 'determined as ever' for gun bill,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — With time running out on the chance to pass gun control legislation, President Barack Obama on Monday warned Congress not to use delaying tactics against tighter regulations and told families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims that he's ""determined as ever"" to honor their children with tougher laws.

Obama's gun control proposals have run into resistance on Capitol Hill, leaving their fate in doubt. Efforts by Senate Democrats to reach compromise with Republicans over expanding required federal background checks have yet to yield an agreement, and conservatives were promising to try blocking the Senate from even beginning debate on gun control legislation.

""The day Newtown happened was the toughest day of my presidency,"" Obama said in an emotional speech from Connecticut's capital, an hour's drive from Newtown. ""But I've got to tell you, if we don't respond to this, that'll be a tough day for me too.""

Some of the Sandy Hook families are making an attempt to push through the bill. Obama met with them privately before his speech at the University of Hartford Monday evening, then brought 12 family members back to Air Force One for the trip back to Washington. The relatives want to meet with senators who've yet to back the legislation to encourage their support in memory of their loved ones.

""Nothing's going to be more important in making sure that the Congress moves forward this week than hearing from them,"" Obama said. His eyes teared as he described Nicole Hockley, who lost her 6-year-old son, Dylan, saying how she asks him every night to come to her in her dreams so she can see him again.

""If there's even one thing we can do to prevent a father from having to bury his child, isn't that worth fighting for?"" Obama asked.

Obama's speech was interrupted repeatedly by standing ovations from the packed gymnasium. At one point, the room erupted with chants of ""We want a vote!"" Audience members, many wearing green ribbons in support of the victims, were stomping their feet on the bleachers and clapping their hands in unison with the chant.

Story continues

""This is not about me. This is not about politics. This is about doing the right thing for all the families who are here who have been torn apart by gun violence,"" Obama said, his voice rising with emotion as he shook his finger in the air.

Obama argued that lawmakers have an obligation to the children killed and other victims of gun violence to allow an up-or-down vote in the Senate. That would require 50 votes to pass, rather than a procedural maneuver some Republican senators are threatening to require 60 votes, potentially sinking the legislation.

""Some back in Washington are already floating the idea that they may use political stunts to prevent votes on any of these reforms. Think about that. They're not just saying they'll vote no on ideas that almost all Americans support. They're saying they'll do everything they can to even prevent any votes on these provisions. They're saying your opinion doesn't matter. And that's not right.

Obama rode to the speech with Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who signed sweeping gun control legislation into law Thursday with the Sandy Hook families standing behind him. But legislation in Washington faces a tougher challenge, as the nation's memories of the shooting fade with time and the National Rifle Association wages a formidable campaign against Obama's proposals.

Majority Leader Harry Reid brought gun control legislation to the Senate floor on Monday, though actual debate did not begin. He took the step after receiving a letter from 13 conservative Republican senators including Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, saying they would use delaying tactics to try preventing lawmakers from beginning to consider the measure. Such a move takes 60 votes to overcome, a difficult hurdle in the 100-member chamber.

The conservatives said the Democratic measure would violate the Second Amendment right to bear arms, citing ""history's lesson that government cannot be in all places at all times, and history's warning about the oppression of a government that tries.""

Further underscoring the tough road ahead for the Obama-backed legislation, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that the Kentucky Republican would join the filibuster if Reid tries to bring the measure to the floor.

Obama said the vote shouldn't be about his legacy, but about the families in Newtown who haven't moved on to other matters.

""Newtown, we want you to know that we're here with you,"" Obama said. ""We will not walk away from the promises we've made. We are as determined as ever to do what must be done. In fact, I'm here to ask you to help me show that we can get it done. We're not forgetting.""

A group of Sandy Hook families originally planned to travel to Washington earlier on Monday, but the White House offered to give the families a ride so they could also attend Obama's speech before their lobbying push. The White House lit up the steps of Air Force One with flood lights so photographers and television cameras could capture the image of Obama climbing the plane's steps with the families at dusk.

Nelba Marquez-Greene, whose 6-year-old daughter Ana was among the victims at Sandy Hook, held up a sign that said ""Love Wins"" as she walked toward the steps of Air Force One.

The families' lobbying trip was organized by Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit started by community members in the wake of the shooting. ""The group is encouraging senators to come together around legislative proposals that will both save lives and respect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans,"" the group said in a statement.

With time running out on negotiations, the White House is making an all-hands-on-deck push this week. Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Eric Holder planned to promote their plan at the White House on Tuesday with law enforcement officials. First lady Michelle Obama planned to wade into the debate Wednesday with a speech on youth violence in her hometown of Chicago. And on Thursday, Biden was taking part in a discussion on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" with people who have different views on gun control.

Organizing for Action, the grassroots group being formed out of Obama's re-election campaign to support his agenda, said it was launching online ads Monday asking the public to urge their senators to support background checks. The ads will target 11 senators — all Republicans — through Facebook and search engines. An OFA spokesman said the group was not disclosing the cost of the ad campaign.

Gun control is divisive in Newtown, Conn., as in the rest of the country. Not all Sandy Hook families support gun control, and even those involved with the lobbying push organized by Sandy Hook Promise are not backing the assault weapons ban. But those families are asking lawmakers to expand background checks, increase penalties for gun trafficking and limit the size of magazines.

http://news.yahoo.com/cowardly-congress-ruthless-nra-impotent-obama-conspire-against-092719796--politics.html,,[],"Cowardly Congress, Ruthless NRA, and an Impotent Obama Conspire Against Assault-Weapons Ban","I don’t have the words to describe the cowardice of Congress or the depravity of the gun lobby, which conspired to kill the assault-weapons ban. I can’t explain the apparent impotence of President Obama who vowed to “use whatever power this office holds” to convert the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School into commonsense common good.

Fortunately, Mike Lupica of the New York Daily News found the words:

Any fool knows that [Adam] Lanza couldn’t possibly have killed as many children as quickly as he did on the morning of Dec. 14 without an assault weapon in his hands. So how does the president and any other big politician who allows the gun nuts from the National Rifle Association to win again answer the larger question about weapons that make killings like the elementary-school massacre ridiculously easy: If not now for a ban on these weapons, when?”

His must-read column was illustrated by the pictures of 20 slain Sandy Hook students and this headline: “Shame On U.S.”

The ban on assault weapons sponsored by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California apparently died Tuesday with barely a whisper from media outlets or the White House. Black bunting should have hung from every window in Washington.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democratic ally of Obama, told reporters that Feinstein’s proposal could not overcome Senate rules requiring the support of at least 60 senators before allowing a final vote. The proposal “using the most optimistic numbers, has less than 40 votes. That’s not 60,” he said.

In fairness, the gun lobby deserves most of the blame for creating a political climate in which any regulation of firearms is viewed as an attack on the constitutional right to bear arms. This as much a financial issue to the NRA and its industry allies as it is a constitutional one.

But Obama and fellow Democrats shoulder a responsibility to reframe the debate around unassailable facts: The Second Amendment is not at risk; modest regulations would improve gun safety and strengthen the nation's noble gun culture; and nobody outside the U.S. military needs an assault weapon. Instead, the White House and Democratic lawmakers signaled retreat on the assault-weapons ban almost immediately after Obama proposed it. He didn't fight.

Story continues

“We cannot tolerate this anymore,” a teary-eyed president told the nation after the Sandy Hook shootings. “We are not doing enough and we will have to change.”

I don’t doubt Obama’s sincerity, but it is fair to question the president’s stomach for hard and hands-on legislative campaigns in a divided Congress. Not only are the facts on his side, but so is the public. An ABC News/Washington Post poll shows that 52 percent of the public favor stricter gun laws; 91 percent support background checks at gun shows; 82 percent want to make illegal gun sales a federal crime; and 57 percent favor a ban on assault weapons.

Every member of Congress, every White House aide, and every National Rifle Association dues-payer should take another look at those numbers. Be ashamed.

Sure, there is a chance that Obama will eventually sign legislation that requires background checks at gun shows, that makes gun trafficking a federal crime and that provides funding for school security. These provisions would allow Democrats, moderate Republicans, and a legacy-seeking president to claim they did something about gun violence. And they might, in fact, help. But don't be impressed: If anything comes out of the GOP-controlled House, it's likely to be weakened.

Remember Lupica’s words: Any fool knows what an assault weapons is created to do. “If Sandy Hook Elementary doesn’t make every member of Congress take a stand against assault weapons in this country, then what does?” Lupica wrote. “How many small coffins do we need the next time?”"

He Is A Professor At Georgetown University', 'A Senior Fellow At The Brookings Institution', 'A Frequent Commentator For Npr', 'Msnbc. His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",EJ Dionne: The way forward on guns,"Victories often contain the seeds of future defeats. So it is — or at least should be — with the Senate’s morally reprehensible rejection of expanded background checks for gun buyers.

The outcome is a test of both an invigorated gun safety movement and a gun lobby that decided to go for broke.

The National Rifle Association assumed that blocking new gun legislation in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre would firmly establish its dominance. Advocates of sane gun regulations would scatter in despair and be torn apart by recriminations.

But there is a flaw in the gun lobbyists’ calculation: Their strategy leaves the initiative entirely in the hands of their opponents. The early evidence is that rage over the cowardly capitulation of so many senators to raw political power is pushing activists against gun violence to redouble their efforts.

What was striking about Wednesday’s vote is that many of the senators who had expressed support for universal background checks after the slaughter at Newtown meekly abandoned their position when the roll was called.

Proponents of the measure, including Mark Kelly, the husband of former representative Gabrielle Giffords, spoke of private meetings in which senators offered no substantive objections to the compromise negotiated by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa). The wobbling legislators simply hinted that politics would not permit them to vote “yes.”

Giffords, the victim of the 2011 mass shooting in Arizona, founded Americans for Responsible Solutions to battle on behalf of gun reforms. She responded to the Senate vote with an op-ed in the New York Times that declared plainly: “I’m furious.” Senators, she said, “looked over their shoulder at the powerful, shadowy gun lobby — and brought shame on themselves and our government itself by choosing to do nothing.”

Giffords’s frustration echoed sentiment all across her side of the debate. In the past, Democrats who support gun safety had reacted benignly to members of their party from rural states who opposed sensible gun measures for expediency’s sake. Not this time. The response to Democrats who opposed background checks — Sens. Max Baucus, Mark Begich, Heidi Heitkamp and Mark Pryor — was indignation.

Begich invited scorn by insulting those who insisted that the Newtown massacre ought to be the last straw.

“It’s dangerous to do any type of policy in an emotional moment,” he said. “Because human emotions then drive the decision. Everyone’s all worked up. That’s not enough.” Describing the reaction to the death of so many children as “emotional” rather than rational should be electorally disqualifying.

But the vote also demonstrated for all to see a Republican Party walking in lock step behind its commanders in the gun lobby. Only four Republicans bravely defied the NRA’s fanatical opposition to a very mild measure: Toomey and Sens. Mark Kirk, John McCain and Susan Collins.

This should send a message to all who keep looking for new signs of Republican moderation.

Republicans who cultivate a reputation for reasonableness — their ranks include, among others, Sens. Johnny Isakson, Lamar Alexander, Bob Corker, Kelly Ayotte, Saxby Chambliss, Lisa Murkowski and Rob Portman — could not even vote for a watered-down proposal. This tells us that the GOP has become a coalition of the fearful. In a pinch, the party’s extreme lobbies rule.

This vote also made clear that the right wing is manipulating our system, notably by abusing the filibuster, to impose a political minority’s will on the American majority. Since when is 90 percent of the nation not “the Real America”?

Not only do Americans overwhelmingly endorse background checks; senators representing the vast majority of our people do, too. The “yes” votes Wednesday came from lawmakers representing 63 percent of the population. How can our democracy thrive when a willful minority can keep dictating to the rest of the country?

But the next steps are up to the supporters of gun sanity. They can keep organizing to build on the unprecedented effort that went into this fight — or they can give up. They can challenge the senators who voted “no,” or they can leave them believing that the “safe” vote is always with the NRA. They can bolster senators who cast particularly courageous “yes” votes — among them, Mary Landrieu and Kay Hagan — or they can leave them hanging.

The story of reform in America is that it often takes defeats to inspire a movement to build up the strength required for victory. Which way this story goes is up to us.

Merkle, a high school sophomore from Maryland, spoke out against gun control laws in front of the Maryland State Legislature in March, Today.com notes. In a concise, 3-minute argument, Merkle said the proposed legislation would not prevent violence.

“Ever since I first learned how to shoot, the issue with gun violence around the nation became clear — guns are not the problem, people are,"" Merkle told the lawmakers. “Purging our society of violence and murder cannot be done by gun control legislation.""

The teen, who is secretary of the Maryland Rifle Club and a life-long sport shooter, also said ""guns are not needed for mass murder, and robbing American citizens over rights to own them won’t solve anything.""

Merkle added that the proposed laws would stop her from attending college on a shooting scholarship.

While Merkle's testimony will probably not influence Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who is expected to soon sign the gun measure into law, it has made her a budding star among conservative bloggers and gun rights advocates.

A YouTube video of the teen's testimony has racked up more than 2.5 million views in the ensuing weeks. The clip also has garnered 16,000-plus comments.

On Sunday, Merkle told the Washington Times that she was glad her video was getting attention, if only to bring more awareness to the issue.

“The biggest part of this is that the pro-gun, Second Amendment argument is getting publicity,” Merkle said. “I like that it actually got out there, and not just because it’s me, but because it’s the argument.”

On Tuesday, Merkle also made an appearance on Fox News program ""Hannity."" Host Sean Hannity praised Merkle for understanding that gun control wouldn't have prevented the Sandy Hook tragedy.

""Here you are, 15-years-old, you get that,"" he said, asking why did she think the massacre was being ""used as an issue to control people's guns.""

""I don't understand what they're doing, they are criminalizing law abiding citizens,"" Merkle replied.

She also told him that she thought the AR-15 rifle -- the weapon used by Newtown shooter Adam Lanza -- is actually one of the most effective weapons for self-defense. The AR-15 is much more accurate, and much easier to fire, Merkle said, especially for children or people with smaller frames.

Merkle told the Washington Times that her high profile comments have also attracted some less-than-positive feedback, including pretty nasty threats, but she said she remains committed to the cause.

""I’m not going to stop fighting on this just because some people disagree with me,"" she said."

The website, Change For Trayvon, and committee of the same name, are intended “to give his family a voice in the political process,” according to the group's mission statement.



“Your support will help engage the discussion across the country regarding stand-your-ground laws and the need to revise them so that there is required judicial or prosecutorial review before decisions are made,” the statement continues. “30,000 mothers and fathers lost their children to gun violence. The Change for Trayvon movement will shine the light on stand-your-ground laws across the nation. These laws allow individuals to shoot first and ask questions later.”

The site provides PayPal links for those wishing to make contributions, which ""will be used to educate voters, candidates, and elected officials on the impact these laws have on victims and families,"" according to the site.

Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Martin’s family, said the committee was formed in response to a growing number of states that have placed Stand Your Ground laws -- which they believe prevented their son’s killer, George Zimmerman, from being immediately arrested -- on ballots for the upcoming November election.

“The family is saying straightforward that it is not just about Trayvon; all of our children have the possibility of being a Trayvon and having to face this battle against the Stand Your Ground law and the way it’s written,” Crump told The Huffington Post. “They’re saying its too late for them, we can’t do anything about Trayvon. But it’s not too late for others.”

In the wake of Martin’s Feb. 26 killing by Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch member in Sanford, Fla., who claims he shot the teen in self-defense, so-called Stand Your Ground laws were scrutinized not only by supporters of Martin’s family, but also by legal experts and advocacy groups who say the laws are written in a way that allows broad interpretation and application and give people wide discretion in the use of deadly force.

Sanford police initially said that it would have been against the law and possibley a violation of Zimmerman’s rights to arrest him. But police arrested Zimmerman more than 40 days after the killing, not long after Florida Gov. Rick Scott assigned a special prosecutor to the case.

Scott also formed the Task Force on Citizen Safety and Protection to hold town hall meetings, consult with legal experts, and make recommendations for possible changes to the law.

The task force has itself been controversial, with critics assailing it and Gov. Scott for appointing supporters of the law to the board, including two of the law's authors.

The family’s announcement today comes on the eve of a meeting of the 19-member task force on Tuesday in Jacksonville.

“These laws allow people to shoot first and ask questions later,” Tracy Martin, Trayvon’s father, said in a video featured on the Change For Trayvon website.

“Worse, under existing Stand Your Ground laws, decisions on shootings are made even before a judge or prosecutor can review the case,” added Sybina Fulton, Martin’s mother. “Stand Your Ground is a solution in search of a problem, and it’s a terrible solution with tragic result, like the death of our son.”

The Change For Trayvon website also ups the ante in a media battle between the Martin and Zimmerman camps, as both sides work to drum up moral and financial support.

Zimmerman has given exclusive interviews to sympathetic cable news pundits. And his parents, friends and brother have defended him on various television news programs.

Meanwhile, Martin's family has made the rounds on the major morning shows and have done countless primetime interviews.

The fight for support has also been waged on the Internet.

Zimmerman, who remains free on bail pending trial, set up a website early on, which he used to thank supporters and raise funds. That site was later taken down, at which time his defense attorney, Mark O’Mara, launched a new website, gzlegalcase.com, which has been used to publish evidence, court filings and various statements.

Zimmerman’s parents also launched a website in support of their son.

According to the Change For Trayvon website, laws similar to Florida’s Stand Your Ground law exist in 32 states “and have allowed people to escape responsibility.”

In Florida, the bill sailed through the state legislature in 2005 with bipartisan majorities. It was intended to strengthen existing self-defense laws after a series of major hurricanes raised fears of looting. But critics say the law is ambiguously written, which consequently has allowed some misapplication. Recent investigative reports suggest a troubling pattern in the application of the law, which seems to skew along racial lines.

Among the more controversial aspects of the debate are the law's possibly biased application, its widespread support among gun rights advocates like the NRA and conservative groups like ALEC, and a number of recent high-profile shootings, including the Trayvon Martin case, in which people have attempted to invoke the law as a legal defense."

“I would say that the likelihood is that they are not going to be able to get assault weapons ban through this Congress,” NRA President David Keene said on CNN’s “State Of The Union.”

Keene’s comments come two days before Vice President Joe Biden is expected to issue a series of recommendations to President Obama on reducing gun violence, and as gun stores in many areas report a dramatic spike in sales.

Biden’s focus has been on requiring universal background checks for gun sales and on limiting sales of high-capacity ammunition clips, two areas that appear to have widespread public support.

But administration officials have indicated that a ban on assault weapons could be included in an overall package of proposals. Obama has endorsed renewing such a ban, which was passed by Congress in 1994 but expired a decade later.

Congress is exhibiting new energy to restrict production and sales of certain firearms, with some pro-gun members speaking out for the first time against the spread of assault weapons.

But it’s far from clear if there’s enough support, particularly among Republicans, to approve a broad ban on such type of military-style guns.

“I think we have the possibility, but it’s going to be difficult,” said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) on CNN. He said prospects were better for Congress to push through restrictions on high-capacity magazines and expanded background checks.

Biden met with NRA officials last week as part of his efforts to reach out to all sides on the issue, but Keene described the meeting as disingenuous, saying that the administration had already made up its mind.

Keene insisted that new measures on assault weapons, as well as on high-volume magazines, would be ineffective in preventing gun violence, arguing instead that the focus should be on mentally ill people and curbing their ability to acquire guns.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Sunday sharply disagreed with Keene’s assessment that the current Congress would not take action on assault weapons.

“No, I think he’s wrong,” Murphy said on CNN. Saying that he believed such a ban would have prevented the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Murphy said: “Newtown fundamentally changed things. The NRA doesn’t get this.”

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/us/politics/biden-to-meet-with-gun-advocates-including-nra.html,2013-01-11 00:00:00,"['Michael D. Shear', 'Peter Baker']",Obama Sees Tough Path on Assault Gun Ban,"WASHINGTON — While President Obama pledged to crack down on access to what he called “weapons of war” in the aftermath of last month’s schoolhouse massacre, the White House has calculated that a ban on military-style assault weapons will be exceedingly difficult to pass through Congress and is focusing on other measures it deems more politically achievable.

As a task force led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. readies recommendations on reducing gun violence for delivery to the president next week, White House officials say a new ban will be an element of whatever final package is proposed. But given the entrenched opposition from gun rights groups and their advocates on Capitol Hill, the White House is trying to avoid making its passage the sole definition of success and is emphasizing other new gun rules that could conceivably win bipartisan support and reduce gun deaths.

During a day of White House meetings on the issue on Thursday, including one with the National Rifle Association, Mr. Biden focused publicly on universal background checks for gun purchases and the need for more federal research on gun violence. In 15 minutes of public remarks, Mr. Biden made no mention of curbing the production and sale of assault weapons, even though he was a prime author of such a law that passed in 1994 and expired 10 years later. Both he and the president say they strongly support an assault weapons ban.

But Mr. Biden noted that his former colleagues in the Senate have long been “pretty universally opposed to any restrictions on gun ownership or what type of weapons can be purchased.” He said they now seem more open to limits on the purchase of high-capacity magazines."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/the-senate-fails-americans-on-gun-bills.html,2013-04-18 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],The Senate Fails Americans on Gun Bills - The New York Times,"The National Rifle Association once supported the expansion of background checks, but it decided this time that President Obama and gun-control advocates could not be allowed even a scintilla of a victory, no matter how sensible. That group, and others even more militant, wanted to make sure not one bill emerged from the Newtown shooting, and they got their way. A vast majority of Republicans meekly followed along, joined by a few nervous red-state Democrats, giving far more weight to a small, shrill and largely rural faction than to the country’s overwhelming need for safety and sanity.

Guns had not been on the president’s campaign agenda, but, to his credit, he and Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. came up with a solid package of proposals after Newtown that would have reduced the number of dangerous weapons on the street and in the hands of criminals. Mr. Obama traveled the country to promote it in 13 speeches, and he has spent the last weeks unsuccessfully trying to pry senators out of the pocket of the gun lobby.

The most important aspect of his proposal, in the eyes of many gun-control advocates, was the expansion of background checks, both because it closed an important loophole and because it seemed the easiest to pass. From 20 percent to 40 percent of all gun sales now take place without a background check, and the bill rejected on Wednesday would have required the check for buyers at gun shows, on the Internet and at other commercially advertised sales. It was sponsored by two pro-gun senators with the courage to buck the lobby, Joe Manchin III, a Democrat of West Virginia, and Patrick Toomey, a Republican of Pennsylvania.

The critical need for this measure was illustrated by a report in The Times on Wednesday that showed how easy it is for criminals to buy weapons on the Internet without a look at their backgrounds. One widely popular Web site contains tens of thousands of private postings of gun sales, and The Times’s investigation found that many buyers and sellers were criminals. Some of the guns have been used to kill.

A vote to continue this practice would be hard to explain to constituents, so lawmakers simply invented reasons to oppose background checks. Some insisted it would lead to a national gun registry, though the plain language of the bill prohibited that. Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said it would raise taxes. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona said it would require checks even when a gun sale is posted on an office bulletin board. (There’s nothing wrong with that, but it wouldn’t.) Mr. Obama, after the vote, said those who made these arguments had “willfully lied.”"

Dianne Feinstein, said Tuesday.

The California Democrat said her party’s leaders told her that her legislation, approved last week in the Senate Judiciary Committee in a party-line vote, could be offered as an amendment to the larger bill.

Feinstein expressed disappointment that her attempt to revive the 1994 ban was dropped to clear the way for other measures. “I very much regret it. I tried my best. But my best, I guess, wasn’t good enough,” Feinstein said before heading into the Senate Democrats’ strategy luncheon.

Feinstein’s bill would prohibit the sale, import and manufacture of more than 150 weapons and ban ammunition magazines that can accept more than 10 rounds. People who already legally own assault weapons – 3.5 million to 4 million, by one estimate – would be allowed to keep them. Sale of existing weapons would require buyers to undergo background checks.

Spurred by the December massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the Senate Judiciary Committee passed four gun bills. In addition to Feinstein’s assault weapons ban, the committee moved bills to expand background checks for gun buyers, crack down on gun trafficking and allocate money to improve school safety. The assault weapons ban was always seen as the most politically challenging of the recommendations produced by the Obama administration.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said he was taking a pragmatic view of which measures could attract the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate and move to the House. “Her amendment, using the most optimistic numbers, has 40 votes,” he said.

Advertisement

The other three bills will be rolled into one bill, which could put pressure on Republicans and conservative Democrats to get on board. That bill has not been crafted yet, because senators are waiting on a possible bipartisan compromise on the background check measure.

On the floor, senators would probably have a chance to vote on an amendment that would add both a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, and then on another amendment that would add just the limits on magazine size.

Advertisement

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who opposes stricter gun control, said he was not surprised Reid would drop the assault weapons ban, saying it was “primarily focused on cosmetics, not on function.”

“I also think as a political matter that Sen. Reid’s loath to have a bunch of red-state Democrats running in [2014] have to vote on that. That explains the strategy,” Cornyn, a former chairman of the Senate Republican campaign committee, said.

Advertisement

Feinstein vowed not to give up, even floating – but immediately dismissing – the idea of placing a hold on a broader gun bill that doesn’t include the assault weapons ban. She blamed her bill’s troubles in part on the political and financial power of the main gun lobby, the National Rifle Assn.

“America has to stand up,” she said. “I can’t fight the NRA. The NRA spends unlimited sums, backed by the gun manufacturers, who are craven in my view. And I don’t know what else to do other than the best we can in drafting a bill in asking for support and in enabling something to pass in the Senate.”

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/20/missouri-house-bill-would-make-proposing-gun-control-illegal/,2013-02-20 00:00:00,[],Missouri House bill would make proposing gun control illegal,"A Missouri lawmaker is proposing to send colleagues to prison for introducing gun control legislation -- a plan that even its sponsor acknowledges has no chance of passage but nonetheless highlights the increasingly strident tone of gun measures in Missouri's generally pro-gun Legislature.

Rep. Mike Leara said Tuesday that he considers his bill a statement of principle. It would make lawmakers guilty of a felony punishable by up to four years in prison if they introduce legislation restricting gun rights.

""I have no illusions about the bill making it through the legislative process, but I want it to be clear that the Missouri House will stand in defense of the people's constitutional right to keep and bear arms,"" Leara, a Republican from suburban St. Louis, said in a written statement. He declined further comment.

Since last year's deadly mass shootings in Colorado and Connecticut, state and federal lawmakers have grappled with gun legislation. President Barack Obama has proposed an assault weapons ban, background checks and restrictions on high-capacity ammunition magazines. But Missouri's Republican-led Legislature has taken a different approach -- more guns, not less.

State Rep. Stacey Newman, D-St. Louis, called Leara's measure ""unconstitutional"" and said she would go directly to prison if the bill passes. Newman is the sponsor of a measure that would require guns to be sold by a licensed dealer and force that dealer to conduct a background check.

Even one of Leara's fellow Republicans said he probably wouldn't support the bill.

""Everybody should have a right to introduce bills, even bad ones,"" said state Rep. Kevin Engler, of Farmington, a former state senator who has sponsored National Rifle Association-supported legislation in previous years.

Leara's measure comes less than a week after St. Louis-area House Democrats introduced legislation containing an assault weapons ban. That bill would require owners of semi-automatic weapons to surrender, destroy or send their guns to another state within 90 days of the measure's passage. Sponsoring state Rep. Rory Ellinger said he knows Missouri is a very conservative state, but he still wants a dialogue on gun safety.

Given the two-thirds Republican majority in the Legislature, the assault weapons ban probably won't even get a committee hearing. But that hasn't stopped Republicans from attacking the bill with fervor. Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Springfield, posted a YouTube video of a physical copy of the bill being shot with a handgun.

One lawmaker has questioned the wisdom of proposing legislation to the ideological extreme of both political parties.

""(Leara's bill) has as much chance of passing as (the assault weapons ban). Highlights the problem with proposing bills to get attention,"" tweeted Sen. Ryan Silvey, R-Kansas City.

While Leara's and Ellinger's bill are likely dead on arrival, a state House committee moved forward Tuesday on two proposals that would curb federal gun regulation. One proposal is sponsored by Rep. Casey Guernsey, R-Bethany, who said he has decided ""to take swift and strong actions to counteract the federal government."" Guernsey wants to criminalize the enforcement of any federal gun control laws enacted after Jan. 1, 2013.

The second measure would prevent federal regulation of guns that are manufactured in Missouri and remain inside the state's borders. The committee did not vote on either bill.

Even measures to address gun violence in schools have drawn out the ideological divides in the Legislature.

On Tuesday, Missouri's Senate gave first-round approval to a proposal that would give school districts the option to teach the National Rifle Association's gun-safety program to elementary school students and to allow teachers and other school personnel go through training on how to respond to armed intruders. The bill sponsored by Sen. Don Brown, R-Rolla, originally mandated schools implement both programs, but opposition from Democratic senators caused him to make the programs optional.

Brown's original bill was opposed by Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-St. Louis, who said it would do little to address the problem of gun violence by urban gang members whose parents don't supervise them. She said trying to train teachers to respond to ""gang bangers"" is a ""pretty dangerous thing,"" adding that ""a lot of our teachers are kind of petite.""

A Senate committee on Wednesday also considered a state constitutional amendment to broaden the right-to bear-arms by specifying that it is ""inalienable."" The measure sponsored by Sen. Kurt Schaefer, R-Columbia, would also require the state to oppose any ""infringement"" on that right."

But momentum to take action has faded, and we still lose that many lives to gun violence every eight hours on average.

The price of our gun policy can be seen in this breathtaking statistic: More Americans have died from guns here in the United States since 1970 (nearly 1.4 million) than American soldiers have died in all the wars in our country’s history over more than 200 years (about 1.2 million).

Those gun killings have been committed by people like John Lennon (his real name, but no relation to the Beatles star), who, in 2001, used an assault rifle to shoot an acquaintance dead in a quarrel over drugs. Lennon is now locked up at Attica Correctional Facility in Attica, N.Y., and he underscores that while people kill people, so do guns.

“I do take responsibility for the murder; I’m sorry for taking his life, and all the life he could have had,” Lennon writes in an essay that he sent me out of the blue and that I’ve published on my blog. “But without a gun, I would not have killed.”"

Pew Project for Excellence in Journalism, April 25, 2013

In the four months since the Newtown, Connecticut shootings, the tone of the conversation about gun control on Twitter has shifted sharply several times in apparent response to ongoing events, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of nearly 21 million tweets from December 18 through April 21.

“I think the opposition is counting on mistrust of government, hatred of Obama and the idea that Congress can’t get anything right to combine as the pathway to no,” said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, an immigrant advocacy group.

Politicians counting on Americans to forget about Newtown when they go to the ballot box next year may be in for a surprise. A pair of recent PPP polls shows that “no” votes from Senators Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), Jeff Flake(R-AZ, NRA rating=A), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK, NRA rating=A), Mark Begich (D-AK, NRA rating=D),Rob Portman (R-OH, NRA rating=A), and Dean Heller (R-NV, NRA rating=A) have dropped them into varying degrees of hot water with voters. Another poll from Pew showed that, while overall dissatisfaction with the vote did not match the 90% approval of background checks, many more Americans were disappointed or angry about the Senate’s failure to pass background checks than those who were relieved or happy. A pair of new polls shows that even in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings, the public’s interest in the gun control debate has actually increased, and the number of Americans who identify guns as the most important problem facing this country is equal to the number who answer “terrorism” to the same question.

NY Times talks immigration reform prospects, but could be talking about gun laws or anything else:Interest waning? No. Mediaite Gun safety advocates are not going away. Intensity is not on the side of gun rights. It does not hurt politiclans to vote for background checks. 5 y.o.s should not have guns , even in Kentucky. And what other myths do you want addressed?

How about the deep paranoia of Republicans that the media who tut-tut Obama's record are afraid to tell you about?

Poll: 29% Think Armed Rebellion Might Soon Be Necessary The eye-opening findings serve as a reminder that Americans’ deeply held beliefs about gun rights have a tendency to cross over into outright conspiracy theories about a nefarious government seeking to trample the Second Amendment — paranoia that pro-gun groups like the National Rifle Association have at times helped stoke. The data help explain why even the most modest gun safety laws face tremendous, intense opposition.

“I’m for stricter gun laws, but the reason I favor the Republicans over the Democrats and the liberals on gun laws is because they have always been against the Second Amendment and the right to own guns,” said Jim Hensley, 69, a Republican from Grandville, Mich., in an interview after the poll was conducted. “Yes, I believe the Republicans should have voted for background checks, and they should not legalize automatic weapons,” Mr. Hensley added. “I was against the repeal of the ban on automatic weapons, and I don’t support the N.R.A. But it’s like marriage. You stick with your wife no matter what, and you don’t just ditch your political party on one issue.”

Two weeks after a bipartisan measure that would have expanded background checks for gun buyers was defeated in the Senate, nearly 9 in 10 of those surveyed said they favored background checks on all gun buyers, and 6 in 10 said they were disappointed or angry with the vote.

Voting is tribal, not logical. Sometimes you simply need to win rather than worry about convincing everyone of the whys and wherefores.Want intensity? You're looking at it."
http://news.yahoo.com/newtown-families-well-keep-fighting-131052016.html,,[],Newtown families: We'll keep fighting for gun law,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disappointment. Disgust. Grossly unfair.

That's how some families who lost loved ones in December's massacre at a Connecticut elementary school view the Senate's defeat this past week of the most far-reaching gun control legislation in two decades, as they pledged to keep fighting for measures to prevent gun violence.

Neil Heslin, Erica Lafferty and Carlee Soto were among the Newtown, Conn., family members who spent a week on Capitol Hill describing how their loved ones died at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14. But their stories of horror and heroism were no match for a threat from the National Rifle Association to rate the vote, and concern from Republicans and a small band of rural-state Democrats.

Lafferty, whose mother, school principal Dawn Hochsprung, lunged unarmed at the gunman to stop him from firing the assault weapon, said she was ""honestly disgusted that there were so many senators that are doing nothing about the fact that my mom was gunned down in her elementary school, along with five other educators and 20 6- and 7-year-old children.""

The Senate rejected on Wednesday a series of gun control bills that would have tightened background checks for buyers, banned assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, and loosened restrictions on carrying concealed weapons across state lines, the last measure backed by the NRA.

Within hours of the votes, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords accused senators who opposed the new regulations of ""cowardice"" in a piece published in the New York Times' op-ed page. Giffords was among 13 people wounded two years ago when a lone gunman opened fire as she met with constituents in a Tucson, Ariz., shopping mall, killing six others. She and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, had lobbied for the bills' passage.

On CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" moderator Bob Schieffer asked Heslin, Lafferty and Soto Sunday whether the words ""cowardice"" and ""cowards"" were appropriate to describe Wednesday's vote.

""I do,"" said Heslin, who's 6-year-old son Neil Lewis died at Sandy Hook. ""I feel they're not standing up for what they should be.""

Carlee Soto, recounted her sister Victoria's courage to try to save her students, Neil Lewis among them.

""My sister wasn't a coward that day. My sister pushed the kids up against the wall, out of sight,"" she said, adding, ""She protected her kids. Why aren't they protecting us?"" referring to the senators who voted against the gun bills.

The families say the gun legislation would have strengthened laws already in effect rather than undercut the Second Amendment, which provides a constitutional right to bear arms.

""It's beyond me how these congressmen cannot stand up and support something that would prevent — or help prevent — something like this from ever occurring again,"" Heslin said.

""We aren't going to go away. I know I'm not,"" he added. ""We're not going to stop until there are changes that are made."""

Story highlights NEW: Sen. Manchin says a vote on background checks unlikely until later in the week A compromise amendment on background checks comes up this week Republicans who voted to open debate may not support the bill Debate on the overall gun package is expected to last two weeks

(CNN) —

A compromise proposal to expand background checks on gun sales lacks enough support to win Senate approval now, which will likely delay a vote on the measure that has strong public support, one of the sponsors told CNN on Monday.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, acknowledged the vote on the amendment he worked out with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania was being pushed back to try to build more support.

Asked if the vote would take place Tuesday or Wednesday, as supporters had hoped, Manchin said he didn’t think so.

“I would say by the end of the week, probably,” he added.

The Manchin-Toomey compromise had been scheduled as the first amendment to be considered as part of gun legislation pushed by President Barack Obama and Democrats in the aftermath of the Newtown school massacre in December.

Last week, the broader gun package received 68 votes, including 16 from Republicans, to bring it to the Senate floor.

Before discussion on the legislation began Monday, Manchin told CNN there was more work to do.

“We’ve got to work hard and the more people know about the bill, the more people read the bill, the more people see the facts of the bill, it breaks down all the misnomers,” he said of what he called misinformation about the background check proposal being spread by opponents.

Both Manchin and Toomey are self-professed gun lovers who have gotten high marks from the powerful National Rifle Association for their voting records on firearms issues.

However, the NRA opposes their compromise, casting doubt on whether it can get the 60 Senate votes necessary to pass under the filibuster threshold imposed by Republicans.

Far fewer Republicans than the 16 who voted last week to open debate are committed to backing the Manchin-Toomey amendment or supporting the final gun package.

So far, four GOP senators have declared they will support the Manchin-Toomey compromise or were leaning toward backing it.

With at least two moderate Democrats from pro-gun states known to oppose the measure, it needs at least seven GOP votes to have any chance of passing.

Gun rights group endorses background check deal

The amendment will be one of perhaps dozens to be debated on the broader package of gun laws drafted in response to the killing of 20 first-graders and six educators at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.

The package also contains measures to crack down on gun trafficking and straw purchases, and to find ways to improve school safety.

On Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney sought to keep up the pressure on senators to approve the expanded background checks, noting polls show about 90% of Americans support such a move.

“If they vote no, they will be siding with the 10% and not the 90% in the United States that support background check legislation,” Carney told reporters.

In debate expected to last two weeks, senators will consider efforts by both sides to either expand or weaken the gun package.

Republican Sen. Collins will support Manchin-Toomey gun compromise

A push by Democrats for an updated ban on semiautomatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons, as well as limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, is expected to fail.

Republicans will push an NRA proposal to make state concealed weapons permits acceptable nationwide, a concept opposed by many Democrats.

Since the Newtown attack by a lone gunman, Connecticut and a few other states have passed tougher gun laws.

While polls show Americans favoring expanded background checks and other proposals intended to crack down on gun trafficking, more pro-gun states have passed laws easing firearms restrictions.

In addition, the NRA has promised political retribution for legislators who back measures it opposes.

“This debate in some ways is underscoring just the extent to which there is a polarization in our society,” Toomey told CNN on Sunday, lamenting “the acrimony that has gotten into politics.”

Asked if he was concerned about political repercussions, the conservative Republican said: “I’ll just let the political chips fall the way they fall.”

In a separate interview on CBS, Manchin acknowledged the power of the NRA, saying: “They won’t be with us on this and I just would hope that they would allow their members to see the facts and let them vote their conscience.”

Both senators said Monday that part of the problem involves misconceptions about their compromise, and they urged colleagues to read the 49-page measure instead of relying on what they called erroneous political rhetoric by opponents.

Their amendment expands background checks to gun shows and all Internet sales, but exempts private transactions such as hunting rifles traded among family and friends.

Co-author of gun compromise says Senate support an ‘open question’

It also makes it easier for hunters and sport shooters to transport their firearms across state lines. It would also require states and the federal government to provide records on criminals and the “violently mentally ill” to the national background check system, addressing a criticism by the NRA and other opponents of gun laws that the existing system lacks substantive information.

In addition, the plan calls for a new National Commission on Mass Violence to report in six months on “all aspects of the problem, including guns, school safety, mental health, and violent media or video games.”

The NRA opposes the compromise as a possible first step toward a national gun registry and therefore a violation of the constitutional right to bear arms.

However, smaller pro-gun groups have come out in favor of the Manchin-Toomey amendment, indicating a rift in the gun lobby over the emotional issue of taking legislative action in response to the Newtown killings.

Manchin said Monday he was reaching out to senators who voted last week against beginning debate on guns.

“We’re working on all of them. Some of them who might not have voted for cloture might be more receptive once they see the facts,” he said. “Now that we have gun groups coming out in support, it really helps us.”

Manchin and Toomey noted Monday that their proposal includes a specific prohibition against a national gun registry as well as criminal penalties for misusing background check information for that purpose.

In a statement on Sunday, moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she would support the compromise because it exempted private family gun transactions from needing a background check, calling it a “commonsense approach” that required the screening only for commercial transactions.

No sense of urgency: Rocky road ahead for gun legislation in the House

Even if the compromise passes and the Senate proceeds to approve a broader gun package, it was unclear if the Republican-led House would go along.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has stopped short of promising a vote, saying only that the chamber would look at whatever the Senate sends over.

Obama has made the gun legislation a major focus of his second term, holding events across the country to push for congressional action and public pressure.

Last weekend, the mother of one of the Newtown schoolchildren killed in December delivered the weekly presidential address instead of Obama.

Francine Wheeler, whose 6-year-old son Ben died in the attack by a lone gunman, noted that since the December 14 killings, “thousands of other Americans have died at the end of a gun.”

“Thousands of other families across the United States are also drowning in our grief,” Wheeler said. “Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy.”

The issue has raised attention on overall gun deaths in the country, with supporters of tougher gun laws noting that more than half all homicides involve firearms and U.S. levels are higher than other countries.

On Saturday night, a man shot himself to death during a NASCAR event sponsored by the NRA in Texas.

http://news.yahoo.com/gun-victims-relatives-emerge-advocates-085524029--politics.html,,[],Gun victims' relatives emerge as advocates,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Several people whose lives have been shattered by gun violence will be watching from the packed House gallery as President Barack Obama gives his State of the Union speech.

But not Bill Sherlach, whose wife, Mary, was killed in the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14.

Washington officials fighting over gun control invited him to attend Obama's speech Tuesday night in the House chamber. Sherlach declined.

He said that rather than be the nationally televised face of tragedy, he prefers working within a group that wants the gun issue addressed as part of a comprehensive effort to reduce violence. He wants to work with Sandy Hook Promise, a group that deals with more than just gun control. Mary Sherlach was the Sandy Hook Elementary School psychologist.

Sherlach, who said he had other obligations the day of the speech, explained he also didn't want to be part of the heated rift over gun control that politics and dueling news conferences seem to inflame.

""I think the political aspect pulls people to one extreme or the other extreme,"" he said.

Rep. Jim Himes, Sherlach's congressman in Connecticut, had invited him to the president's address.

Victims of tragedy long have played major roles in the nation's most dramatic public policy debates, and there are few more bitter, or expensive than this year's legislative battle over gun control. Victims make riveting witnesses to wrenching problems and the consequences of doing nothing to prevent the nightmares they know.

The age of global multimedia sharing, however, opens them as never before to becoming pawns and targets in fights that can be more about the legacies and ambitions of others than their own lost loved ones.

Unfortunately, there's no shortage of gun victims in a nation that saw nearly 8,600 gun violence deaths in 2011, according to the FBI, or of politicians looking for real people to bolster their positions on gun control, mental health and other issues. There still will be representatives from Newtown in the House gallery for Obama's prime-time speech.

Story continues

After a gunman shot his own mother at home and then 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook, Obama pledged to tighten gun laws. And then came a parade of the sorrowful and the defiant filing through the virtual public square.

At the White House, Obama met with Newtown families. At a public hearing in Connecticut, Neil Heslin, whose 6-year-old son, Jesse, was killed at the school, questioned the need for any civilian to own semi-automatic, military-style weapons. ""The Second Amendment shall not be infringed!"" someone shouted back.

In Washington, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a shot to the head during a 2011 assassination attempt, told a Senate committee that Congress must revamp gun laws. Her husband, Mark Kelly, got into a terse discussion at the witness table with National Rifle Association's executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre.

At the Super Bowl, the Sandy Hook Elementary School chorus gave a stirring rendition of ""America the Beautiful"" that had some players on the sidelines and fans in the stands in tears.

The State of the Union address will showcase the results of intense campaigns by the White House and members of Congress to bring victims of gun violence, including some Newtown families, to the Capitol.

Cleopatra and Nathaniel Pendleton, the parents of a Chicago teenager slain just days after performing during Obama's inauguration, will sit with first lady Michelle Obama during the speech. Hadiya Pendleton, 15, was shot to death Jan. 29 in a park close to the Obama's Chicago home. Police say a gunman hopped a fence and opened fire on a group of young people. She was a majorette with the King College Prep band.

Twenty-four House members are bringing people affected by gun violence, according to Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., who spearheaded the effort. The guests include Natalie Hammond, Sandy Hook's lead teacher, who was shot in the foot, leg and hand but managed to crawl to safety behind a door. She'll be the guest of Rep. Elizabeth Esty, D-Conn.

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., will have as her guest a fourth-grader who attends a different elementary school in Newtown, but recently wrote to her about gun control.

""To have them in the gallery during the speech is a strong reminder to Congress that the American people want action on these issues,"" said Langevin, who has used a wheelchair since being paralyzed in a shooting accident as a teen.

Langevin was a 16-year-old Boy Scout cadet working with police in Warwick, R.I. He was in a locker room watching officers examine a gun they thought was unloaded, when the weapon accidentally fired. A bullet ricocheted off a metal locker and severed Langevin's spinal cord.

Taking sides on the gun issue while coping with grief can be a stunning and disillusioning experience, say veterans of victim advocacy.

""Families are not prepared to go through the onslaught,"" said John Walsh, host and executive producer of TV's ""America's Most Wanted"" show, who began his crime-busting crusade after the abduction and murder of his 6-year-old son, Adam, in 1981. Victims' relatives, he said, can get frustrated when their activism doesn't translate into swift action.

""They're not prepared for all the shenanigans in Congress,"" said Walsh. But, he added, some good could come from Sandy Hook. ""There is a tiny window here before everybody forgets about it. This could be a great time for these parents to make a loud statement.""

In his speech, Obama is expected to urge support for his plan to ban assault weapons and require background checks for all gun buyers. Last month he released his package of proposals for curbing gun violence in response to the Newtown shootings and vowed to use the powers of his office to fight for the proposals.

Most of them face tough opposition from the NRA and its friends in Congress. Conservative accused Obama of using children as political props. When he announced his gun proposals at the White House, he was surrounded by some kids who had written him in support of further gun restrictions.

While no family wants to be exploited, many in Newtown want to have a role in seeing something come of the tragedy, said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.

Their testimony, she said, ""puts a tangible human face on the issue.""

Jim Tyrell, a Warwick, R.I., bartender whose older sister, Debbie, was shot and killed nine years ago during a robbery at the convenience store she owned, said he's attending Obama's speech as Langevin's guest.

""Somebody took her life with a gun, and here I am trying to save another person's life by getting guns off the streets,"" he said.

Tyrell said he's not daunted by the prospect of public criticism. ""If somebody criticizes me, that is their opinion. I am not looking to offend anybody else, I just want to tell them my story and what happened to our family.""

Destination of 400-mile ride is rally at the Capitol

Trip honors those killed at Sandy Hook

Organizer says nation is suffering %27epidemic of gun violence%27

NEWTOWN, Conn. — More than two dozen bicyclists plan to leave Saturday on a 400-mile ride to Washington to ""raise awareness for common-sense gun legislation"" and honor 26 children and adults killed by a gunman Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

The riders will stop for several rallies along the route, according to the event's organizer, Monte Frank. They will join members of the Virginia Tech Victims Cycling team Tuesday in College Park, Md.

The team, formed to honor 32 people killed in shootings at that university in April 2007, will accompany the Newtown-originated riders to the Capitol, where a final rally will take place.

During the first leg of the Sandy Hook Ride On Washington, the cyclists will be joined, Frank says, by Chris McDonnell, whose 7-year-old daughter, Grace, was one of the victims at the elementary school.

Frank, a Newtown lawyer and a former member of Cornell University's cycling team, says his 11-year-old daughter, Sarah, a sixth-grade student, was instrumental in founding the event.

Sarah's teacher three years ago at Sandy Hook Elementary was Victoria Soto, who was killed trying to defend her students Dec. 14.

Sarah had a close relationship with Soto, Frank says, and recently wrote an essay — posted on the Sandy Hook Ride on Washington Facebook page — about why her father was organizing the event.

""My dad rides to honor (Victoria Soto) and the other 25 victims,"" Sarah wrote. ""We have to prevent this from happening again and protect innocent lives. My dad rides to show that a small town in the middle of a tragedy can bring about change.""

Frank, who has lived in Sandy Hook, a village within Newtown, for 10 years and serves as a town attorney, says he senses a growing grass-roots movement pushing for stronger gun-control laws throughout the country.

""We have gotten to the point where we recognize we have an epidemic of gun violence,"" Frank says. ""The current situation is not tolerable for a sophisticated and developed nation.""

The ride will begin with a rally — to be attended by several local government officials and federal legislators, including Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy — at Newtown's Reed Intermediate School.

The riders will cycle to the Sandy Hook firehouse for a moment of silence for the victims and a show of support for first responders. The firehouse is at the end of a street leading to Sandy Hook Elementary School and the place where students and faculty took refuge after the shootings.

The riders will next pass the facilities of other fire, police and ambulance responders before heading for another rally in Ridgefield, Conn., Frank says.

Rallies are planned in three New Jersey towns and in Baltimore with the city's mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake.

The events are in sync with the sentiments of many Newtown residents who, Frank says, don't want the shootings to define the town as a place of tragedy.

""We want to be remembered as a town that went to work to change the gun culture in our society and put stronger laws in place to reduce gun violence,"" Frank says.

On Dec. 15 — one day after gunman Adam Lanza killed his mother, Nancy, at their Sandy Hook home before killing Soto and 25 others at Sandy Hook school — Frank and his wife, Leah, had to sit down and explain to Sarah what had happened to her former teacher.

""Those were not conversations any parent should have with their 11-year-old child, and those conversations will haunt me the rest of my life,"" Frank says. ""I'm committed to do what I can to prevent another tragedy from happening elsewhere."""

With the Senate set to begin what is expected to be a long and difficult debate on gun-control legislation, it's no surprise that President Obama would dedicate his weekly address to making another pitch on the issue.

But for this week's address, President Obama made a highly unusual move and passed on the duty to someone he believes can make the argument better than him: the mother of a 6-year-old child that was gunned down in the Newtown, Conn., mass shooting that has spurred a national debate on nation's gun laws.

Francine Wheeler used the address to speak of her anguish since her son Ben's death, and called on Americans to ""convince the Senate to come together and pass common-sense gun responsibility reforms that will make our communities safer and prevent more tragedies like the one we never thought would happen to us.""

""Sometimes, I close my eyes and all I can remember is that awful day waiting at the Sandy Hook Volunteer Firehouse for the boy who would never come home – the same firehouse that was home to Ben's Tiger Scout Den 6,"" Wheeler said. ""But other times, I feel Ben's presence filling me with courage for what I have to do — for him and all the others taken from us so violently and too soon.""

The president has only passed on his address once during his presidency. He tapped Vice President Biden to deliver the weekly address in December 2010, while the president was in Afghanistan.

Here's what Wheeler said:

Hi. As you've probably noticed, I'm not the President. I'm just a citizen. And as a citizen, I'm here at the White House today because I want to make a difference and I hope you will join me.

My name is Francine Wheeler. My husband David is with me. We live in Sandy Hook, Conn.

David and I have two sons. Our older son, Nate, soon to be 10 years old, is a fourth grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our younger son, Ben, age 6, was murdered in his first-grade classroom on Dec. 14, exactly four months ago this weekend.

David and I lost our beloved son, but Nate lost his best friend. On what turned out to be the last morning of his life, Ben told me, quite out of the blue, ""I still want to be an architect, Mama, but I also want to be a paleontologist, because that's what Nate is going to be, and I want to do everything Nate does.""

Ben's love of fun and his excitement at the wonders of life were unmatched. His boundless energy kept him running across the soccer field long after the game was over. He couldn't wait to get to school every morning. He sang with perfect pitch and had just played at his third piano recital. Irrepressibly bright and spirited, Ben experienced life at full tilt.

Until that morning. Twenty of our children and six of our educators – gone. Out of the blue.

I've heard people say that the tidal wave of anguish our country felt on 12/14 has receded. But not for us. To us, it feels as if it happened just yesterday. And in the four months since we lost our loved ones, thousands of other Americans have died at the end of a gun. Thousands of other families across the United States are also drowning in our grief.

Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy.

Sometimes, I close my eyes and all I can remember is that awful day waiting at the Sandy Hook Volunteer Firehouse for the boy who would never come home — the same firehouse that was home to Ben's Tiger Scout Den 6. But other times, I feel Ben's presence filling me with courage for what I have to do — for him and all the others taken from us so violently and too soon.

We have to convince the Senate to come together and pass common-sense gun responsibility reforms that will make our communities safer and prevent more tragedies like the one we never thought would happen to us.

When I packed for Washington on Monday, it looked like the Senate might not act at all. Then, after the president spoke in Hartford, and a dozen of us met with senators to share our stories, more than two-thirds of the Senate voted to move forward.

But that's only the start. They haven't yet passed any bills that will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. And a lot of people are fighting to make sure they never do.

Now is the time to act. Please join us. You can talk to your senator, too. Or visit WhiteHouse.gov to find out how you can join the president and get involved.

Help this be the moment when real change begins. From the bottom of my heart, thank you."

The advocacy group, the Newtown Action Alliance, posted a Facebook message Thursday about the calls, prompting responses from people who said they'd received communications from the NRA and were upset by them.

""I received one of these,"" Newtown resident Christopher Wenis wrote on Facebook Thursday afternoon. ""I was insulted and offended."" Wenis told The Huffington Post in an interview Friday night that in the 36 hours since he first posted his response, he received two more robocalls from the NRA, one later on Thursday night and one on Friday evening.

""I've got a 5-year-old son who went to preschool on the Sandy Hook Elementary School campus,"" Wenis explained. ""And this was a really hard week for me on a lot of levels. These calls were the very last thing I needed.""

Wenis said that he called the NRA twice to request that his name be placed on a ""Do Not Call List"" -- first on Tuesday and again Thursday. He said an NRA phone operator assured him he would be removed from NRA call lists. But the calls kept coming. By Friday night, Wenis said, he was desperate to be left in peace.

Another woman, Lisa Abrams, wrote on Facebook that she had ""received a call and a postcard asking me to call my congressmen and tell them 'NO ASSUALT WEAPONS BAN' [sic] ... I was not happy and needless to say did just the opposite!""

LISTEN: NRA robocall in Connecticut, sent by a HuffPost reader:

Tom Maurath, a 40-year resident of Newtown, said he was having dinner with his family on Tuesday when the phone rang at 6:37 p.m. ""Our caller ID announces who is calling, and when I heard 'National Rifle Association,' I jumped to answer the phone so my 6-year-old son wouldn't get there first,"" he told The Huffington Post in an interview. ""Our son loves to answer the phone because it might be Grandma.""

Maurath said he listened to a prerecorded message about Connecticut state gun legislation for about 30 seconds -- a call that he was stunned to realize took no account of who might pick up the phone.

""The idea that this message could have been delivered to a sibling of one of the families who lost children at [Sandy Hook Elementary School] is just appalling,"" he said.

In the months since the tragic school shooting in December, Newtown has become a focal point for the nation's renewed debate over gun control, as well as an international symbol of America's epidemic of gun violence. The Connecticut Legislature is considering a bevy of gun-control measures in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre. On Tuesday, a bill requiring universal background checks for gun purchases in Connecticut cleared a key committee. The state already has a ban in place on military-style assault weapons.

This week Maurath also received a postcard from the NRA, which he shared with HuffPost. The blaze-orange card proclaims, ""Despite public outcry, anti-gun legislators in the Connecticut General Assembly are aggressively forging ahead with numerous proposals that are designed to disarm and punish law-abiding gun owners and sportsmen.""

(Rep. Dan Carter, mentioned on the card, is the state legislator who represents Newtown.)

Maurath said the script of the phone message sounded a lot like the postcard. He also said that at least a half-dozen of his fellow residents in Newtown had told him they received similar robocalls.

A spokesman for the NRA, which opposes the measures being proposed in Connecticut, said robocalls in the state were made to NRA members and supporters, and were designed to be informative about the legislation being considered.

As is the case in other states, ""We have members, contributors, and supporters in Connecticut who expect us to do our jobs and keep them abreast of developments on the legislative front in their state,"" NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told HuffPost.

Maurath, however, could think of no reason why he would have been singled out to receive such a call. A registered independent, he said he has ""thought over and over about any reason I would have been on their lists, but there isn't one. I have zero connection to this group or any affiliated group.""

Robocalls are nothing new for the NRA or for many large advocacy groups. Tax-exempt groups like charities and advocacy groups, as well as political campaigns, are exempt from many of the restrictions placed on commercial telemarketing calls by the Federal Trade Commission. It's common for advocacy groups on both sides of the political spectrum to purchase mailing lists and phone lists from other like-minded organizations, such as political parties that generally support the same issue platform. The NRA is known for being very protective of its member lists.

Maurath is still in shock over why Newtown residents weren't exempted from this round of NRA robocalls.

""There are only three phone number prefixes here in town, and it's less than three months after the most horrific tragedy imaginable,"" he said. ""You'd think they could have scrubbed the list, just to be decent. Instead, you're making an unsolicited call with no opt-out that my children could answer.

President Obama meets Thursday with survivors of gun violence and law enforcement officials

Families of four victims killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School are featured in a gripping new TV ad aimed at spurring action by Congress to reduce gun violence.

""Don't let the memory of Newtown fade without doing something real,"" pleads Terri Rousseau, whose daughter, Lauren, was a teacher at the Connecticut school where 20 children and six adults were killed on Dec. 14.

The ad is the first to feature Newtown families and coincides with President Obama's meeting Thursday at the White House with survivors of gun violence and law enforcement officials. There are also more than 120 events planned across the country in a National Day to Demand Action on reducing gun violence, led by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which sponsors the new commercials.

The Senate is expected to take up gun legislation in April, but the measure will not include a proposed ban on assault weapons and a limit on the ammunition contained in magazine clips. The legislation will incorporate bills to enhance background checks for gun owners, reduce gun trafficking and improve school safety.

In the spot, Neil Heslin speaks in the ad of dropping off his son, Jesse Lewis, at Sandy Hook and then receiving a 911 call about the shooting. An emotional Heslin told his story at a Senate hearing in February on the gun ban.

""I want to prevent any other family from having to go through what we're going through,"" said Chris McDonnell, father of 7-year-old Grace, who died in the rampage.

The ad also features Jillian Soto, sister of Vicki, who was a teacher at Sandy Hook. The commercial is running in the Hartford TV market because the Connecticut Legislature is considering gun-control bills.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns is co-chaired by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. Bloomberg in particular has been a vocal gun-control advocate, using both the mayors' group and his own super PAC to push for new legislation."

The strong majority in favor of considering legislation that would expand background checks and increase the penalties for illegal gun sales reflected the power of a lobbying campaign by parents of students killed in Newtown, Conn., and by others who persuaded reluctant lawmakers to back them in an initial fight that looked lost just last week. The vote was 68 to 31.

“It’s remarkable,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut whose nascent Senate career has been devoted to gun safety. “You can’t turn a corner in the Capitol this week without meeting a family of a gun violence victim. It’s hard to say no to these families.”

But the victory could be short-lived. The vote in no way guaranteed passage of the gun measure; some Republicans and Democrats who voted for this initial step made clear they are not committed to supporting any final measure, even if they agreed to allow the debate."

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court weighs whether to hear case on guns in public,"WASHINGTON — While Congress debates proposals for tighter gun regulation, the Supreme Court is weighing whether to consider striking down state laws that strictly limit who can carry a gun in public.

When the justices ruled in 2008 and 2010 that the 2nd Amendment gave people a right to keep firearms in their homes, it did not address whether they had a right to carry weapons outside the home.

Gun rights advocates have asked the court to strike down New York’s law allowing officials to deny “concealed carry” permits to gun owners unless they can show a “special need for self-protection.” They want the justices to rule that the 2nd Amendment gives law-abiding gun owners a right to be armed on the streets. An announcement from the court on whether it will hear the case could come Monday.

Justice Antonin Scalia, in his 5-4 majority opinion in the 2008 Heller case striking down a ban on handguns in the District of Columbia, described the 2nd Amendment as creating a “right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.”

Citing Scalia’s words, gun rights advocates have mounted challenges to laws in seven states that routinely deny permits to gun owners who wish to carry loaded or unloaded guns with them. Typically, these laws say the gun owner must show a “proper cause” or “good cause” to obtain a permit. California, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York have such laws.

“This case could be more important than Heller,” said UCLA law professor Adam Winkler. “The biggest unanswered question about the 2nd Amendment is whether people have a right to carry guns in public.”

In December, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago struck down the Illinois law, the nation’s strictest. That law was understood to bar all but police and security guards from carrying guns in public.

Judge Richard Posner said the Supreme Court had described the 2nd Amendment as conferring “a right to bear arms for self-defense,” and if so, being armed is “as important outside the home as inside.” The decision gave state lawmakers six months to craft a new law that would allow the carrying of guns in public in a way that is “consistent with public safety.”

In November, however, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld that state’s law, which is often described as the nation’s second strictest. It authorizes gun owners to obtain permits to carry weapons in public, but only if they can convince a county official that they have “a special need” to be armed. Evidence of “good moral character” is not enough, nor is living or working in a “high-crime area,” the judges said.

The appeals court rejected a constitutional claim brought by Alan Kachalsky and several other residents of Westchester County who were turned down for permits. The 2nd Amendment does not “call into question the state’s traditional authority to extensively regulate handgun possession in public,” the appeals court said.

Attorney Alan Gura, who won the 2nd Amendment rulings in the case from District of Columbia and the 2010 case from Chicago, appealed the New York case to the high court. He says the New York decision made the right to bear arms “practically worthless.”

“If it is a constitutional right, you don’t have to prove to the government that you are entitled to exercise your rights,” he said.

If the justices vote to take up the appeal, the Kachalsky case will be heard in the fall.

But Winkler, the UCLA law professor, and others think the court may choose to put off a decision on the reach of gun rights. “Some of the justices may be hesitant to take a 2nd Amendment case while nerves are still raw from Newtown,” Winkler said.

The December school shooting in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 children and six adults has forced Congress to take another look at the nation’s gun laws, and last week the Senate voted to begin debate on expanding the background checks required for purchasing a handgun.

If the justices deny the appeal in the New York case, it will not set a legal precedent, but it will be seen by some as allowing state and local officials leeway in deciding who can carry a gun in public.

But the continuing litigation will almost surely force the court to decide the issue in the next few years. In December, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard challenges to the concealed-carry laws from two California counties and from Hawaii. Illinois Atty. Gen. Lisa Madigan has until May to decide whether to ask the Supreme Court to review the 7th Circuit decision striking down the state’s ban on carrying guns in public.

Steve and Amber Mostyn, wealthy Texas trial attorneys, said today that they are giving $1 million to help start the gun-control advocacy group formed by former Arizona Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly. Steve Mostyn, one of the top contributors to a super political action committee that assisted in President Barack Obama’s re-election effort, is listed as treasurer of Giffords’s new super-PAC, Americans for Responsible Solutions. Mostyn said the group will have a nonprofit wing, which will be used to conduct a public education campaign.

Mostyn said the super-PAC will counter the political contributions of the National Rifle Association, which is how he’s pitching it to other big Democratic donors.

If there is any real hope of effectively standing up to the NRA and the corporate gun lobby, it is certainly going to take a similarly well funded and organized effort. It is also probably going to take the charismatic image of a person like Giffords. Jim Brady and his supporters attempted to use his tragic experience to establish an effective gun control lobby. They had some successes, but I don't think that they ever became a political force that could counter balance the NRA.

The culture of guns and violence is deeply rooted in our society and history. There are many cultural divides in America. It is possible for some of them to coexist on the basis of live and let live. The issue of guns has become one where this isn't really a workable approach. The ready accessibility of high powered military style weapons poses a threat to the ability of other people to simply live. The political difficulty arises when attempts to find a workable approach to balancing concerns about public safety with the legal rights of gun owners are unable to move forward. The NRA and its allies are determined to block any and all attempts at better control and regulation. That is a force that must be vigorously opposed.

I think that I will take the news of this vote of confidence as reason to send my little mite to Ms. Giffords in support of her efforts. I hope that others here will consider doing likewise."

It also voted down other key measures and counterproposals, defeating a string of amendments in a series of procedural votes that likely doomed any major legislation to curb gun violence.

The background check measure -- painstakingly crafted by the bipartisan duo of Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) -- was seen as the key to passing the first legislation in decades to address the sorts of mass slaughters that so recently horrified the country in Newtown, Conn., where 20 children and six educators were gunned down at an elementary school, and in Aurora, Colo., where 12 people were killed in a theater.

The amendment failed 54 to 46, falling short of the 60-vote threshold needed to break a filibuster. That failure upset anew victims of the Sandy Hook shootings and other slaughters who watched from the Senate gallery.

""Shame on you!"" shouted two women in the gallery after the vote. One was Patricia Maisch, who grabbed the third clip from the gunman who opened fired at then-Rep. Gabby Giffords in the Tuscon., Ariz., shooting in 2011. The other was Lori Hass, whose daughter was injured in the Virginia Tech shootings six years and one day ago.

""I think we're going to continue to work for the right thing to be done. I think the senators who voted against this will have to live with that vote, and I think they're going to have to account for themselves,"" said Peter Read, whose daughter, Mary, was among the 33 killed at Virginia Tech.

An angry and disappointed-looking President Barack Obama also hammered the vote in a Rose Garden speech on Wednesday.

""All in all, this is a pretty shameful day for Washington,"" Obama said.

""The American people are trying to figure out -- how can something that has 90 percent support not happen?"" Obama said.

He was echoed by other victims of mass shootings who watched the Senate vote.

""I was extremely disappointed,"" said retired Col. Bill Badger, one of the people who tackled Jared Lee Loughner in Tucson. ""When 90 percent of the people want something, and the senator votes against them, the next election, we're going to take care of those senators, because they're not representing the people.""

Passage of the background check amendment had been seen as key because it represented a bipartisan agreement in a highly polarized debate. It also would have preserved a major part of the overall bill that many advocates against gun violence saw as a minimum step toward stemming gun massacres.

Stronger measures up for a vote also failed, including a ban of assault weapons sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that went down 40 to 60, in spite of an impassioned plea from the senator.

""I know how this is going to end, and the despair and the dismay of the families standing out there whose safety we need to protect, and we don't do it. I am really chagrined,"" said Feinstein, who argued that lawmakers with six-year terms should have the fortitude to take tough votes.

""Show some guts,"" Feinstein said.

The only significant steps that all sides agreed on were stemming illegal trafficking of weapons and improving mental health efforts, but even an amendment written with NRA input to crack down on trafficking failed 58 to 42.

A vote on improving mental health services was delayed until Thursday.

The background check measure would have expanded the current check system to cover sales of weapons on the Internet and at gun shows.

Democratic aides privately conceded that with the failure of background checks, the rest of the bill would likely go down. One described it as a ""pyrrhic victory,"" noting that a majority of the Senate backed the bill that is so popular outside the halls of Congress. ""It's the farthest we've come,"" said the aide, speaking on background to talk freely.

The aides saw little hope of it being resurrected, although leaders kept that option open.

Opponents, citing a National Institute of Justice study, argued that the expanded check system would have laid the groundwork for a national registry of gun owners, although the measure expressly forbid such a step, with a 15-year jail sentence for anyone who tried to do that.

They also called it a useless step that would achieve little.

""Expanded background checks would not have prevented Newtown,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who offered an alternative measure with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) lacking new background checks. That measure also failed, 52 to 48.

But Toomey said his amendment would have at least been a modest step in the right direction.

""The goal was to see if we can find a way to make it a little bit more difficult for people who have no legal right to have a gun for them to obtain it,"" Toomey said. ""That was the goal.""

The Senate failed to meet it.

CORRECTION: This post originally incorrectly stated Chuck Grassley's state. He is a senator from Iowa. Patricia Maisch's first name was also misstated.

Gun maker Sturm Ruger%27s 1Q earnings surged 39%25%2C besting estimates

1Q background checks%2C proxy for gun sales%2C jumped 46%25 year over year

Many people say they are buying guns%2C ammo ahead of stronger laws

The White House unintentionally is proving to be the best thing to happen to gun sales in decades.

In late April, Sturm Ruger (RGR) reported first-quarter results that exceeded targets. Net sales for the largest publicly traded gun manufacturer surged 39% to $155.9 million, compared to $112.3 million a year earlier.

The gun maker's earnings came in at $1.20 per share, up from 79 cents per share in the same period last year. Analysts on Wall Street were expecting earnings of $1.01 per share with revenue of $112.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters.

New products, such as LC380 and SR45 pistols, boosted sales, but the company said the recent gun control debate is the main driver of rising sales.

During the first quarter of 2013, background checks through the National Instant Criminal System, considered a proxy for retail gun demand, jumped 46%, according to Sturm Ruger.

Gun maker Smith & Wesson (SWHC) says background checks in February, while down from a month earlier, were 29.1% higher than the same month in 2011.

Gun sales typically receive a boost when a Democrat inhabits the White House, but firearms and ammo sales have surged to record highs after the December tragedy in Newtown reinvigorated debate about gun control.

Sturm Ruger can not make guns fast enough to satisfy growing demand. Itsbacklog climbed to 2.1 million orders in the first quarter vs. 337,000 order in the same period a year earlier.

Ruger had to limit incoming orders from independent distributors to reduce the growth in its backlog, which hit 1.5 million orders at the end of 2012, or roughly nine months of production.

In a regulatory filing, Ruger said: ""Demand for the company's products in the first quarter of 2013 was very strong. We believe this strong demand for our products was primarily due to the current political environment that favorably impacted the entire firearms industry.""

In January, President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden rolled out a wide-ranging list of executive actions aimed at strengthening gun control. As a result, many people say they are making purchases ahead of any major legal reforms. In fact, many people say Obama may end up being the best gun salesman in history.

Obama continues to press Congress to ban military-style assault weapons and ammo capacities of more than 10 rounds, to require background checks on all gun sales, and to create tougher penalties for anyone selling guns to people who are not legally allowed to own them.

After months of heated and emotional rhetoric, a bipartisan bill aimed at expanding the system of background checks failed in the Senate. It received 54 votes, six votes short of the 60 needed to advance.

Breaks from party lines impacted the bill's prospects. Five Democrats voted against it, and broke from party lines and voted against the bill. And only four GOP senators voted in favor of the bill. The Senate also blocked a proposal to ban semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines.

A visibly angry Obama gave a speech shortly after the Senate's decision. He said: ""This was a pretty shameful day for Washington. But ... I want to make it clear to the American people we can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence, so long as the American people don't give up on it. Even without Congress, my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities … but we can do more if Congress gets its act together.""

Some companies responded to public opinion polls showing support for stronger gun control laws. In January, Wal-Mart (WMT), one of the largest gun sellers in the U.S. placed a limit on ammunition sales of three boxes per customer, per day.

Gun sales had been on the rise before the Newtown shooting, in which a lone shooter killed his other, then mowed down 20 children and six adults at an elementary school before turning the gun on himself.

According to a gun industry analysis by The Associated Press, in Obama's first four years in office, the federal government conducted roughly the same number of background checks for gun owners and prospective buyers as it did under George W. Bush's first six years in office.

And for the first time since 1993, the number of federally licensed retail gun dealers in the U.S. increased in 2010 and 2011, adding 1,167 more licensed dealers.

Little wonder shares of gun makers continue to outperform the broader market. The past three years, Ruger shares have tripled in price, while Smith & Wesson shares have more than doubled. Shares of Cabela's (CAB), one of the most well-known outdoor recreation brands in the world, have more than tripled since 2010.

Pollak'],"In Debate with Breitbart's Shapiro, CNN's Piers Morgan Calls the Constitution 'Your Little Book'","“You come in here, brandish your little book as if I don’t know what’s in there–”

“My little book? That’s the Constitution of the United States. It’s our founding document, Piers.”

“I know what’s in your Constitution.”

“Do you really?”

That was the climax of a heated debate between Breitbart News Editor-at-Large Ben Shapiro and CNN’s Piers Morgan on live television this evening–one in which Morgan came off much the worse for wear.

Shapiro began by pointing out that for weeks, Morgan had bullied guests who defend the right to bear arms by “standing on the graves of the children of Sandy Hook.”

“How dare you,” said a rattled Morgan.

“I have seen you do it repeatedly,” Shapiro replied.

He challenged Morgan to explain whether he wanted to ban all guns, not just “assault rifles,” since the vast majority of gun deaths involve ordinary handguns. “Why don’t you care about banning the handguns in Chicago?” Shapiro asked him.

Morgan, who later stated that he supported Americans’ right “to defend themselves with a handgun or a pistol,” pointed out that the weapons used in recent sensational mass shootings had been “assault rifles,” and insisted that the debate was not one of “left and right,” because his position ought to be the consensus, as in Britain. Shapiro countered that the basis of the Second Amendment was not self-defense or hunting, but the ability to resist government tyranny–a point that Morgan attempted to mock, unsuccessfully.

Shapiro’s statement is worth quoting in full:

Shapiro: I think the reason that it’s about left and right here is because fundamentally, the right believes that the basis for the Second amendment–and they believe in the Second Amendment–the basis for the Second Amendment is not really about self defense, and it’s not about hunting. It’s about resistance to government tyranny. That’s what the Founders said, and that’s what the right believes in this country. Morgan: Which tyranny are you fearing, yourself? Shapiro: I fear the possibility of a tyranny rising in the country in the next fifty to a hundred years. Let me tell you something, Piers. The fact that my grandparents and great grandparents in Europe didn’t fear that is why they’re now ashes in Europe. So this kind of leftist revisionist history where there’s never any fear of democracy going usurpatious or tyrannical, is just that. It’s fictitious.

Subsequently, Morgan accused Shapiro of wanting to “do nothing” about mass shootings, to which Shapiro replied that his position was to improve background checks and screening for mental illness and criminal histories among potential gun owners and their households. Shapiro later pointed out the hypocrisy in attacking the National Rifle Association and the Second Amendment without subjecting violent video games, the American Civil Liberties Union and the First Amendment to the same scrutiny.

Morgan then presented Shapiro with a letter co-signed by Ronald Reagan in 1994, urging support for the assault weapons ban (an ineffective policy, which lapsed after ten years). He challenged Shapiro to justify “why an American needs an assault weapon.”

Shapiro repeated his point on tyranny, to which Morgan said: “Do you know how absurd you sound?”

In so doing, he proved Shapiro’s point:

Here’s where you go into the bullying….For weeks now, you have been saying that anybody who disagrees with your position is absurd, idiotic, and doesn’t care about the dead kids in Sandy Hook. And then when I say that’s a bullying tactic, you turn around and say that I’m bullying you.

Later on the program, once Shapiro was safely off camera, Morgan admitted: “In an ideal world, I’d have all guns gone, as we have in Britain, but this is not my country and I respect the fact most Americans wouldn’t wear that kind of argument.”

An epic win for Shapiro, and for our “little book.”

Greetings. My name is Wayne LaPierre, and I’m the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association. After the national tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School, it was my hope that Red America and Blue America would finally come together and try to solve a serious problem, because protecting our children from violent madmen isn’t a conservative position or a liberal position; it’s a common-sense position.

Sadly, instead of offering new solutions, the same anti-gun zealots who’ve always hated the Second Amendment have politicized the deaths of kindergartners, adopting the Rahm Emanuel tactic of “Never letting a good crisis go to waste.” Anti-gun newspapers have even published the names and private addresses of law-abiding gun-owners – something they would NEVER do to sex offenders, drug addicts, wife-beaters, AIDS victims, welfare recipients or women who’ve had an abortion – and rightly so.

[pullquote]

The NRA tried to help: Since we protect our president, vice president, governors, senators, judges, banks, hospitals, office buildings and jewelry stores with armed guards, why does it make sense to protect our schoolchildren with a small sign that says, “This Is a Gun Free Zone” – and then hope that someone with a gun can get there quickly if there’s an emergency? Why do we have armed guards at middle school and high school football games – but not at the actual middle schools or high schools?

But this still doesn’t do enough to protect our children. The time for partisanship is over; now is the time for action. And that’s why the NRA is requesting the assistance of the ACLU.

The Sandy Hook tragedy, the Virginia Tech shooting, the Aurora “Batman” shooting, the Tucson shooting – all of the killers had something in common: They were all mentally unstable young men who were prescribed mind-altering psychiatric drugs.

These killers didn’t purchase their guns illegally, or watch Fox News, or circumvent background checks by attending gun shows. They didn’t have prior convictions or troubling police records. That’s not the common denominator. The common denominator is that these young men were sick – and everyone knew it.

The ACLU has done more than any other organization to protect the legal rights of mentally sick people.

This is a fact.

Because of the ACLU, mentally sick people can refuse medical treatment or psychiatric care, even when their mental condition has left them homeless and penniless. Even in situations like Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old Sandy Hook killer, whose own mother, according to reports, was unable to mandate medical treatment for her son.

The NRA doesn’t hate the mentally ill. They deserve our compassion and our help. But sick young men have spilled far too much innocent blood. This simply cannot continue.

The NRA is hereby inviting the ACLU to join us on a study to find common-sense solutions that will prevent violent madmen from harming our children. And then together, it’s our hope that the NRA and the ACLU will offer these solutions directly to President Obama.

This won’t be easy. It’s anathema to the NRA to deny any law-abiding American the right to bear arms, just as it’s anathema to the ACLU to deny any American the same civil liberties of his neighbors. But despite our personal biases, there must be a solution that’s better than the status quo!

An inspirational politician once declared that there isn’t a Red America and a Blue America, or a black America and a white America – there’s the United States of America. As Americans, let’s come together, rise above the rhetoric, and actually do something that protects our children.

Thank you."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/26/Screenwriter-David-Mamet-Assault-Weapons-Ban-Is-A-Political-Appeal-To-The-Ignorant,2013-01-26 00:00:00,['Awr Hawkins'],David Mamet: Assault Weapons Ban an Appeal to the Ignorant,"Writer and film director David Mamet has weighed in on the current gun control push, and what he sees as government overreach couched in an “assault weapons” ban that is actually “a political appeal to the ignorant.”

Mamet describes it as a “hoax”- a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist, because “assault weapons” are used in few crimes, and the very designation “assault weapon” is based on a gun’s cosmetics–i.e., does it look menacing?

Going after such guns makes some people feel safer because they have slowly, and perhaps unknowingly, traded their independence for a “government knows best” mentality.

Think about Ronald Reagan’s 10 most dangerous words in the English language–“Hi, I’m from the government and I’m here to help.” Reagan saw these words as dangerous because they were indicative of an encroaching government that had taken unto itself the role of determining what was best for you and for me: a role for which our government simply was not designed.

Mamet sees the government doing this very thing with an “assault weapons” ban, in that he sees it determining what guns we can and can’t own based on what has been determined that we do or don’t need. And as Mamet so ably points out, government officials exercise Marxist principles when they limit our exercise of freedom based on what they think we need.

This is all part of the “hoax.” It takes our eyes off of the real solution to crime in this country-namely, the strength of the individual and an armed citizenry-and it makes us think the answer is a blind trust in the supposed-altruistic aims of our government.

According to Mamet, the height of hypocrisy is that the people who are trying to disarm us are themselves surrounded (protected) by heavily armed guards.

He specifically mentions Obama in this instance, and the way Obama has ordered armed guards for himself and his family for life. To this Mamet simply says: “Evidently, [Obama] feels he is best qualified to determine his needs, and of course, he is.” And subsequently, remarks Mamet, “I [too] am best qualified to determine mine.”"

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/obama-stinging-gun-bill-defeat-personal-political-234849868--politics.html,,[],"For Obama, stinging gun bill defeat is personal and political","What happens to a president who romps to re-election, channels a national tragedy that sparked coast-to-coast outrage into a deeply personal crusade, then fails to get a measure backed by 9 out of 10 Americans through the Senate, where his party holds a majority? Thanks to the NRA-fueled defeat of a bill that might have mildly tightened limits on gun sales, President Barack Obama is learning the hard way.

For the families of those killed or wounded by gun violence and who watched with judging eyes as the Senate killed the measure by a vote of 54-46 (it needed a supermajority of 60 votes to pass), what to make of the vote was an easy call.

“Shame on you!” Patricia Maisch shouted from the visitors gallery above the Senate floor.

Maisch, a grandmotherly figure who disarmed the shooter in the Tucson carnage that nearly claimed the life of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, was happy to elaborate as reporters swarmed her after the vote. “I decided I could not sit still,” she said. “They have no souls, they have no compassion.”

But on Wednesday, they had the votes.

That’s Message One for Obama from this stinging legislative defeat: Having emotion and the majority on your side isn’t enough. NRA leader Wayne LaPierre, after all, didn't even need to show up.

The knock on Obama has often been that he’s Mr. Spock, viewing his approach as the most logical and assuming that logic will trump the other side’s arguments and emotions. But only the most cynical observers will argue that the president didn’t take this fight personally—with frequent flashes of very public anger and anguish ever since the slaughter of 20 schoolchildren at Sandy Hook Elementary. And supporters of the legislation deployed the families of the slain as lobbyists in the weeks leading up to the vote.

Moreover, as the White House never tired of pointing out, polls show roughly 90 percent of Americans support expanded background checks.

""I will put everything I've got into this, and so will Joe,"" Obama promised in January, with Vice President Biden at his side. ""But I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it.""

Story continues

In the end, though, four red-state Democrats joined 41 of the Senate's 45 Republicans to defeat the bill. Why stick their necks out for legislation whose death in the Republican-led House of Representatives was essentially foreordained?

""It came down to politics—the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment,"" Obama said in a passionate assessment in the White House Rose Garden after the vote. ""And obviously, a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too. And so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse—any excuse—to vote 'no.'""

That would seem to bode ill for Obama in the early months of a second term. A re-elected president at perhaps the height of his persuasive powers couldn't even get his own party in line behind this widely popular measure.

Obama's 2012 campaign juggernaut, overhauled and renamed Organizing for Action—an unprecedented grassroots effort devoted entirely to advancing his agenda—didn't tip the balance. There will be hard votes in the future on immigration, on taxes and spending, maybe on energy and climate change. He's doomed!

Message Two: No, he's not.

Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a staunch conservative and fierce Obama critic, told Yahoo News that Wednesday's vote was a fight over the Second Amendment. ""I wouldn't think it has any broader implication"" for Obama's agenda, he said.

So no spillover effect on immigration? ""I don't think so,"" Cornyn said.

Sure, former President George W. Bush's second term never really recovered from his failed push to partly privatize Social Security. But that effort was powerfully unpopular, including among Republicans, while the goal of tamping down gun violence is broadly popular.

Which brings up Message Three: Obama's push on gun safety has suffered a terrible setback, but it's far from over.

Surrounded in the Rose Garden by parents of slain Sandy Hook schoolchildren, Obama never said the words ""2014 mid-term elections."" He didn't need to.

""We can do more if Congress gets its act together. And if this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters,"" he declared. ""You need to let your representatives in Congress know that you are disappointed, and that if they don’t act this time, you will remember come election time.""

Maybe, but Message Four is that this White House needs to get better organized.

Democrats from states with large gun-owning populations complained privately that the Obama operation never seemed to know how to talk to gun owners. Several told Yahoo News that Obama hasn't really moved past his 2008 depiction of small-town Americans who ""cling to guns or religion."" Gun rights-favoring media, too, complained about the message.

There was a weird, telling little moment in the debate that highlighted the White House's struggle.

In early April, top Obama pollster Joel Benenson wrote a New York Times op-ed describing a poll his firm conducted that found, as he described it, that Americans don't really know what the country's gun laws actually say. Benenson was trying to beat back the core NRA argument against new gun laws: that authorities must enforce existing gun laws. But his column sent another message: that Team Obama had not really scrutinized the NRA argument until April.

""I'm a person who believes that that gun, that gun, all around this United States -- when a person has a gun sometimes their mind clicks that this thing is, it will win arguments and straighten people out, and then in the wrong hands and the wrong mind, it's death,"" he said on CNN in an interview that aired Sunday.

He said he wasn't talking about having a gun for self-defense in the home, but made the point ""that when you tell me that you're going to protect the neighborhood that I live in, I don't want you to have a gun.

""I want you to be able to see something, report it, and get out of the way. ... I don't want you to get hurt, and I don't want to hurt anyone.""

Deciding racism is involved in a situation -- Cosby never mentioned George Zimmerman by name -- doesn't solve anything, he said. If a person is scared to death, whether he's a racist matters little if he's carrying a firearm at the time, Cosby said.

The stand-up comic beloved for his well-known routines as well as his turn on ""The Cosby Show"" lost his son Ennis Cosby to gun violence in January 1997. Mikael Markhasev was sentenced to life in prison without parole for killing the 27-year-old during a holdup while Ennis was fixing a flat tire near a freeway offramp.

Martin, 17, was fatally shot by Zimmerman while walking to his father's house from a nearby convenience store. The 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer had called police to report Martin as a suspicious person and followed him. After Martin's death in a fight that ensued, Zimmerman claimed self-defense.

After national outrage over the local police department's allegedly insufficient investigation of the crime and failure to make an arrest, Zimmerman was booked into jail last Wednesday on second-degree murder charges brought by a special prosecutor assigned to the case.

He and Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. have spent weeks crisscrossing the country, making a forceful case for a package of laws that would reduce gun violence. At every stop, including one on Wednesday in Denver, he has demanded that Congress require universal background checks, ban assault weapons and large ammunition magazines, and prohibit gun trafficking. He has invoked the bloodshed in Newtown, Conn., and the daily toll that adds up to 30,000 gun deaths a year.

“If there is just one step we can take to prevent more Americans from knowing the pain that some of the families who are here have known, don’t we have an obligation to try?” he asked in Denver. “Don’t we have an obligation to try?”

But the president has been unable to break through the blockade set up by one of the most powerful and relentless lobbies in Washington. The assault weapons battle has already been lost, and it is increasingly doubtful that there will be enough votes in the Senate to support the expansion of background checks, the centerpiece of Mr. Obama’s agenda. (Sixty votes will be required to break the filibuster promised by the most extreme Republican senators, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah.) Even the gun trafficking provision, which seemed the easiest to pass, is being torn apart by the National Rifle Association, which put forward a substitute version that would eviscerate the prohibition on straw purchases of guns.

The gun lobby is a combination of forces that includes manufacturers, hunters and hobbyists, political opportunists, and a fanatically active faction that believes guns are needed to fight off the conquest of freedom by the government. That faction is represented by the group Gun Owners of America, which has spent the months since Newtown doing tremendous damage, insisting that expanded background checks will lead to a gun registry that will assist a secret plan by the president to seize every firearm."
"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-sandburg-poem-found-20130121,0,7226266.story",2013-01-21 09:55:00,['Bridget Doyle'],U. of I. volunteer finds unknown Carl Sandburg poem,"With the debate over gun control heating up, a retired volunteer at a University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign made a timely find.

Ernie Gullerud, a former professor of social work at the university, came upon a previously unpublished poem by Carl Sandburg titled ""A Revolver,"" which addresses the issue of guns and violence.

""I'm no judge of what makes a great poem, but this one said so much and so succinctly and to the point. I thought 'Golly, someone could have written this today,'"" said Gullerud, 83.

It's not clear when Sandburg typed the poem:

Here is a revolver.

It has an amazing language all its own.

It delivers unmistakable ultimatums.

It is the last word.

A simple, little human forefinger can tell a terrible story with it.

Hunger, fear, revenge, robbery hide behind it.

It is the claw of the jungle made quick and powerful.

It is the club of the savage turned to magnificent precision.

It is more rapid than any judge or court of law.

It is less subtle and treacherous than any one lawyer or ten.

When it has spoken, the case can not be appealed to the supreme court, nor any mandamus nor any injunction nor any stay of execution in and interfere with the original purpose.

And nothing in human philosophy persists more strangely than the old belief that God is always on the side of those who have the most revolvers.

Gullerud has volunteered at the Rare Book and Manuscript Library every Thursday for more than seven years. For the past two years, he's been working to classify and enter a file folder of poems into the school's electronic system.

He was working through poems by Sandburg this month when he came across ""A Revolver"" typed on scratch paper and recognized its relevance to current cultural debates across the country.

""When I wrote down that last line, I knew this was really big,"" Gullerud said.

Sandburg, a Galesburg native and at one time a Chicago newspaperman, received Pulitzer Prizes for poetry in 1919 and 1951 and another in 1940 for his biography of Abraham Lincoln.

Gullerud took the poem to Valerie Hotchkiss, head of the Rare Book and Manuscript Library, who also noted its relevance.

U. of I. English professor emeritus George Hendrick, who has published multiple volumes of Sandburg's poems, said ""A Revolver"" appears to be from the writer's later work. Hendrick speculated that the poem could be related to Lincoln's assassination.

""Sandburg wrote the multi-volume biography of Lincoln. … Lincoln was his great hero, and his great hero was cut down by a man who used a gun to end his existence,"" Hendrick said. ""It's clear that Sandburg had very strong feelings about weapons being used to end the life of others.""

Hendrick said many of Sandburg's undocumented poems and draft work remain in the U. of I. library. Sandburg's wife and daughter gave the papers to the library years ago, he said, and it's now a ""great collection.""

Sandburg died in 1967.

(CNN) —

In the days before the Senate voted to end a filibuster and take up gun control this week, President Barack Obama crisscrossed the nation, flying from Colorado to Connecticut in an effort to energize public opinion and pressure reluctant lawmakers.

Vice President Joe Biden also made an emotional plea at the White House. And even the first lady brought an audience to tears at a high school in Chicago where gun violence has been felt most painfully.

But, as a bipartisan group of senators reached agreement on what some have called a watered-down proposal for expanded background checks for gun purchases, the question remains whether all that lobbying really made a difference.

“It has helped, but it’s sort of a two-part story,” said Robert Spitzer, author of “Politics of Gun Control” and chairman of the State University of New York-Cortland’s political science department.

“Part one is the president using the bully pulpit to make news events and congratulate those states where they’ve enacted tougher laws. There’s a certain downside that anything that Obama is for is anything his opponents are against,” Spitzer said.

As the president spent considerable political capital over the past few days to champion gun reform, opponents have raised the stakes by vocally speaking out against such policies and making it clear there will be a reckoning come Election Day for any lawmaker who supports them.

Take the president’s fiery comments on Monday in Hartford. It was a message crafted as much for lawmakers as it was for the families of students and educators killed in December’s school massacre in Newtown, which is not far from where Obama spoke.

The families sat behind him on stage and traveled to Washington with him on Air Force One to lobby Congress on gun control.

“This is not about politics,” the president said to applause. “This is not about politics.”

“This is about these families and families all across the country who are saying let’s make it a little harder for our kids to get gunned down.”

But it is, at least in part, about politics.

Why we’re still debating guns

Sen. Joe Manchin, the conservative West Virginia Democrat and avid gun supporter who helped lead a bipartisan compromise agreement with fellow senator Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, over background checks, was visibly moved after meeting with Sandy Hook families.

“I can do something,” an emotional Manchin told parents who lost children in the attack.

But when the pair announced their compromise to expand federal background checks to gun shows and Internet sales, the executive director of the Gun Owners of America, Larry Pratt, tweeted the sentiment of many in his organization.

“May Sen. Toomey experience in 2016 the same as he did to Sen. Specter in 2010.”

In 2010, Toomey was the more conservative challenger to the late Sen. Arlen Specter in Pennsylvania’s Republican senatorial primary. Specter, who beat Toomey in a similar, contentious GOP primary in 2004, later switched parties and lost in the Democratic primary to Rep. Joe Sestack, who then lost to Toomey in the general election.

“It means that he ought to be held politically accountable and the way to do it is in the primaries,” Pratt told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in a heated exchange, indicating his organization would support a primary challenge to Toomey when he is up for reelection in 2016.

The timing of Obama’s speech in Hartford preceded the Senate’s vote clearing the way for consideration of a Democrat-backed gun control package. The House of Representatives has not yet decided when or if it will take up a similar bill.

And the timing of first lady Michelle Obama’s emotional homecoming to Chicago, speaking Wednesday at a luncheon fundraiser for a new initiative seeking to curb youth violence, was not by accident, either.

She recalled the shooting death of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old who was killed a week after performing in Washington during the Inauguration in January. Saying Pendleton “was me, and I was her,” Mrs. Obama reflected on the opportunities that led her to the White House instead of a similar fate.

Obama was in Colorado last week, just miles from the scene of last July’s movie theater shooting that left 12 people dead, to push for expanded background checks.

“I’ve come here to Denver today because Colorado, in particular, is proving a model for what’s possible,” Obama told the audience.

Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper recently signed measures into law that will require universal background checks for gun sales, restrict the size of ammunition magazines and make buyers pay for their own background checks.

Before the Colorado gun-control vote, Biden, who heads the Obama administration’s efforts on the issue, called several state lawmakers to underscore the broader national importance of the heated gun control policy debate.

But those efforts may have backfired, galvanizing pro-gun advocates instead. Colorado gun groups have vowed to help defeat lawmakers in tough districts who supported passing the gun control package.

“I don’t want to go their cocktail parties. I don’t want to make friends. I just don’t want them to stop Americans of their rights including me and my kids,” said Dudley Brown, executive director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners.

His group, as well as pro-gun rights groups and publications, such as Concealed Carry magazine, have stepped up gun giveaways in states like Colorado, New York and Arizona, where tough gun control laws have passed or are pending.

The National Rifle Association, the nation’s largest and most powerful gun lobby group, said Wednesday that expanding background checks at gun shows “will not prevent the next shooting, will not solve violent crime and will not keep our kids safe in schools.”

The group’s leaders have also been deeply critical of Obama’s efforts.

“President Obama should be as committed to dealing with the gang problem that is tormenting honest people in his hometown as he is to blaming law-abiding gun owners for the acts of psychopathic murderers,” the NRA said in a statement.

Obama has often said that the fight for new gun control is personal.

He wiped away tears when reflecting on the Newtown shooting spree. And the president was animated in talking about what he sees as national support for stricter gun control policies.

However, gun control advocates have worried and polls have shown that in the months following the Newtown shooting, support for stricter gun laws has waned.

In that, Obama’s fierce push to keep the issue up front has been extremely valuable to those seeking stricter gun laws, Spitzer said.

“It’s an imperative that the president be out front on this issue,” Spitzer said. “Obama’s ability to keep this in the minds of the public paves the way a little more for legislative reforms.”

Vice President Biden meets Thursday with the National Rifle Association and other gun owners groups, but early signs do not suggest a meeting of the minds.

In a radio interview this week, NRA President David Keene criticized Biden and President Obama over their anti-gun violence efforts, calling it a political project.

""I think they're being disingenuous,"" Keene said, CBS News reported. ""I think that they see this as an opportunity to go after the Second Amendment, which they've wanted to do for years, if not decades, and I think they're going to do everything they can to strip Americans of their right to keep and bear arms.""

Biden and Obama have said they respect the Second Amendment right of gun ownership, but are looking for ways to keep weapons out of the wrong hands in the wake of last month's elementary school shooting in Connecticut.

The president assigned Biden to develop a legislative package by the end of the month. Obama is also considering a series of executive actions in the wake of the shooting that killed 20 children and six adult staff members.

The vice president has been meeting with a series of ""stakeholders"" on the issues, from gun control advocates to gun rights groups, faith leaders to elected officials, hunters to members of the entertainment industry.

""We've reached out beyond the issue of just gun safety,"" Biden said Wednesday. ""We've reached out to the mental health community. We've reached out to doctors and nurses. We've reached out to the religious community.""

The White House issued a statement on Biden's talk Wednesday meeting with elected officials:

""Following a meeting with representatives of victims' groups and gun safety organizations, the vice president held conference calls with governors of both parties and state and local elected leaders from across the United States.

""During the calls, the vice president listened to the unique perspectives of all the participants and solicited their ideas and input on how to curb gun violence in this country. The vice president reiterated the administration's commitment to this urgent issue, and stressed that the problem requires immediate action."""

Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school?

I swear to you, if I didn't know any better, and I'm not a big conspiracy guy, after seeing that ad, I would think the NRA is either an elaborate avant-garde Joaquin Phoenix-style joke, or a false flag operation run by Michael Moore in an attempt to discredit responsible gun owners.

But anyway, your response, Mr. President.



BARACK OBAMA (1/16/2013): I believe the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms. ... I also believe most gun owners agree that we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible law-breaking few from inflicting harm on a massive scale.

But anyhow, at that conference today at the White House, the President unveiled legislative proposals and 23 executive actions to begin to address gun violence, including recommendations to limit magazine size, restrict assault weapons — that's going to happen through Congress if it happens at all — expand background checks, and oddly enough, also provide money for increased school security, which had originally been suggested by that really charming ad. Um, so how did his recommendations go down with the pro-gun crowd?



JERRY HENRY, GEORGIA CARRY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR (1/16/2013): All the things that he pointed out will only affect law-abiding citizens who already abide by the law. ... We've got over 20,000 gun laws on the books. We need to enforce those gun laws.

EX-REP. TODD TIAHRT, R-KS (7/11/2007): And when crimes are committed, or when there's a dealer selling guns illegally, we have an organization that goes after them, 24/7, every day. It's called the ATF, and they have officers completely assigned to do this.

(audience laughter and applause)

Depends on where you're registered. Although when you get those, they don't have to be registered. That's the beauty.

I'd like the ATF's director to explain to us law-abiding citizens, if you're out there 24/7, why is this country ass-deep in illegal guns?



NEW YORK CITY MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (12/18/2012): We have not had a director of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Fire for six years.

PETER JOHNSON, JR. (8/1/2012): We don't have a permanent director. BOB CUSACK, THE HILL MANAGING EDITOR (1/16/2013): They haven't had a permanent director of that gun agency in six years.

So there's no director of the ATF. So is the ATF like a Montessori agency, where there's no director, but agents are just encouraged to be curious, and regulate weapons at their own pace?



JOHN AVLON, CNN (12/19/2012): The current acting director commutes from Minnesota. He's the U.S. Attorney from Minnesota as well as Acting Director of the ATF.

You're telling me this dude, the guy who is the Acting Director of the ATF, has another full-time job. That regulating alcohol, and tobacco, and firearms, is his side gig? He's just moonlighting, pickin' up a little extra dough.

Why?? There's 7.8% unemployment in this country, we could find someone to take that job who doesn't already have another job!



RACHEL MADDOW (6/20/2011): The Senate won't confirm anybody to the full-time job.

I'm being told the Senate has to confirm the ATF director, because apparently Wisconsin Congressman James Sensenbrenner, for some reason, inserted that provision into the PATRIOT Act in 2006. Sorry, I don't have footage of that, it was apparently done on the Q.T. I do have footage of Sensenbrenner from that very same year accepting the NRA's coveted Defender of Freedom award.

(audience groans in disgust)

Coincidence!! Unrelated action.

But you know, I mean, OK, they don't have a director, they still have ATF agents.



FORMER ATF AGENT JAMES CAVANAUGH (6/14/2011): In 1972, and I went on ATF in the '70s, there was 2,500 agents. And there's still 2,500 agents, 39 years later.

So policing over 100,000 gun dealers in this country, with just a couple of thousand agents, who are also responsible for tobacco and alcohol may seem impossible, but here's the good news. 18 years ago, a professor analyzed ATF tracing data, and found that 57% of guns used in crimes — the illegal guns — could be traced back to just 1% of licensed gun dealers. All the ATF has to do is create some sort of federal registry of these transactions, trace them back to the bad dealers, and those dealers — the dealers ruining it for the law-abiding gun dealer and citizen, flooding cities with illegal guns — they can be stopped!



LAWRENCE O'DONNELL (12/27/2012): According to today's New York Times, the Bureau is prohibited from creating a federal registry of gun transactions.

Are there any other somewhat comical limits on federal law enforcement's ability to enforce federal law? (sound of letter arriving via pneumatic tube)

I'm sorry, I normally get that through my ear, but I guess the old pneumatic tube system didn't realize the question was rhetorical. But I'll bite, let's see what we got here. All right, hold on.

(reads message) Oh! Apparently, the ATF isn't allowed to inspect dealers for inventory discrepancies more than once a year. And in reality, get to inspect them once every 17 years. 17 years! I'm assuming that's because the ATF doesn't have enough agents, and not that the ATF agents are cicadas. (audience laughter) Let that insect joke just wash over ya.

Well, I guess self-reported inventories from dealers are better than nothing.

Oh my God! Why, it's Gunther, my messenger pigeon!

(reads message) Oh, I see, we can't rely on self-reported inventories either, because the ATF cannot require dealers to keep track of their own inventory!

You see, about 10 years ago, a Congressman stuck an amendment into a federal spending bill that severely restricted the ATF's ability to do what the NRA says they want them to do, which is enforce existing gun laws! It allowed dealers to ignore police requests for assistance. It denied Congress formerly public crime gun data. It ended the oversight of used firearm sales. It required the destruction of background check records within 24 hours, you know, to make sure no mistakes could be corrected!

Who did this? What Congressman jammed this amendment into an unrelated spending bill, completely castrating the ATF's ability to enforce existing gun laws?



PETER JOHNSON, JR. (7/19/2011): It was the amendment named with your name, Tiahrt. EX-REP. TODD TIAHRT (7/11/2007): The Tiahrt Amendment is to protect those who protect us.

That amendment couldn't be worse if the NRA wrote it themselves. (sound of letter arriving via pneumatic tube) Oh boy.

Noooo!!! Gunther, why??? Why would you be in the tube?? You're never supposed to cross antiquated message delivery systems like this!

(reads message) The NRA did write that law.

Well, it's not like the ATF has been completely de-balled. Thanks to the First Amendment, they still do have a YouTube channel that they use to warmly encourage gun dealers to act responsibly.



ATF AGENT PATRICK HOOVER: Although conducting a firearms inventory is not required by federal law, ATF suggests that you conduct a complete firearms inventory at least once a year. ATF ATTORNEY ERIKA RITT: If you observe a buyer who appears to be under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, and it appears their judgment may be impaired, you may want to deny the sale. Not because it would be a violation of the Gun Control Act to complete the sale... but because that person's judgment is likely impaired.

""But obviously it's up to you. It's not our job at the ATF to tell you, you can't sell guns to drunk people. I will say this, though, to the gun dealers. You can sell the gun to the drunk people, but if those motherfuckers try and get in a car and drive home, you take them down!""

We'll be right back."

Per-capita firearm homicides are about average compared to other U.S. states, and Connecticut actually gets high marks from the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, whose score card rates it fifth best in the nation for its legislative efforts to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of criminals.

As Congress and the states examine ways to toughen gun laws in the wake of the elementary school rampage that left 20 children and seven adults dead, figures like that aren’t very encouraging. If horrors like the Sandy Hook massacre can happen even in states that do a decent job of controlling guns, what’s the point of forcing states with looser laws to crack down? Researchers have for years been trying to answer the question of whether gun violence drops in states that approve strict gun laws, only to produce studies that contradict each other or provide mixed results.

The problem probably stems from the fact that the United States is a patchwork of 50 governments with widely differing ideas about how to regulate firearms; and there is such a thing as interstate commerce -- if you can’t buy a gun in your home state, you can drive across the border to a more permissive one. This is an argument for strong federal rather than state restrictions, but of course the power of Congress in this area is limited by the 2nd Amendment.

Even if statistics don’t point to a cure for America’s gun epidemic, they do show some interesting things about where gun violence is concentrated. It’s not where you might think. Urban states with heavy gang populations such as California and New York aren’t particularly high up on the list of per-capita gun killings, though of course in terms of absolute numbers, they look like murder capitals because of their big populations. Mid-size Southern states seem to be the places people are trigger-happiest -- and where, of course, political opposition to gun control often runs strongest. Perhaps that’s because most of the bloodletting happens in Southern cities, and it’s in rural areas -- where gun violence is slight -- that gun rights are held most sacred.

The 10 states that follow are ranked based on the number of gun homicides per 100,000 population. For the crime statistics, I used this chart from the FBI, which has pluses and minuses; on the plus side, it’s more up to date than most of the gun-crime data available, using murder rates from 2011. On the minus side, two states are missing from the chart, apparently because the FBI couldn’t get the numbers from them: Alabama and Florida.

Slideshow ( 31 images )

The U.S. debate over gun control flared in mid-December when a man armed with an assault rifle killed 20 first-graders and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut - the deadliest of a string of U.S. shooting sprees last year.

“We are law-abiding citizens, business owners, military, and we are not going to be responsible for other people’s criminal actions,” former Marine Damon Locke said to applause at a Florida rally he had helped organize.

Some in the crowd of about 1,000 in Brooksville, about an hour north of Tampa, hoisted signs that said “Stop the Gun Grabbers” and “Gun control isn’t about guns, it’s about control.”

Obama and gun control advocates have begun a push to reinstitute a ban on assault weapons in the wake of the Connecticut school massacre. A number of other states have taken up gun legislation, and New York, which has among the strictest gun control laws in the country, broadened its assault weapons ban on Tuesday.

Obama also called for a ban on high-capacity magazines and more stringent background checks for gun purchasers.

“Until we enforce gun laws on the books against the bad guys, I think it’s hypocritical to discuss more laws against law-abiding citizens,” Gary Schraut, a Brooksville real estate agent, told Reuters.

Across the country at a rally in Denver, the mood was defiant as about 500 people, including families with children, gathered in unseasonably warm weather outside the state capitol.

“I have earned the right to have my guns,” said Don Dobyns, an Air Force veteran and former police officer from Colorado Springs, who was among the rally organizers.

Sporting a shirt that read, “Girls with guns,” 31-year-old Jennifer Burk said: “My parents didn’t raise a victim and the government shouldn’t try and make me one.”

Gun control advocates say U.S. civilians have no justifiable need for assault weapons or high-capacity magazines, and they say more background checks will help keep guns out of the hands of criminals.

The reaction has been fierce from gun supporters such as the National Rifle Association, who point to a right to bear arms that is enshrined in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and which they do not want to see watered down.

Saturday’s rallies were organized by Guns Across America, a group launched by Texas airline pilot Eric Reed, who has said that after he heard Obama talk about gun control on the day of the Connecticut massacre he thought gun owners should send a strong message to lawmakers in Washington.

As of Saturday afternoon, the Facebook page for Guns Across America listed more than 20,000 people saying they intended to attend events planned mostly in state capitals. Local media reported hundreds of people gathered at rallies nationwide, from Kentucky to Oregon to Michigan and Pennsylvania.

Gun-control advocates on Sunday plan to hold a National Gun Prevention Sabbath, where they say 150 houses of worship will call on the faithful to advocate for an “actionable plan to prevent gun violence.”

People who have lost loved ones to gun violence will display their photographs, organizers said."

The president, in a set of brief remarks from the White House Thursday surrounded by the mothers of shooting victims, raised concern that the shock from the Newtown elementary school shooting could soon fade.

""Less than 100 days ago that happened. ... Shame on us if we've forgotten,"" Obama said. ""I haven't forgotten those kids. Shame on us if we've forgotten.""

Amid signals from Washington that the Senate bill could be losing momentum and high-dollar ad campaigns on both sides, the president was there to deliver a message to wavering lawmakers. ""Don't get squishy,"" he said.

Obama, accusing opponents of drumming up ""fear,"" urged supporters to call members of Congress and pressure them into backing the package.

More On This...

Republican Sen. Mike Lee, of Utah, ripped the president for the remarks, suggesting he was exploiting the Newtown tragedy.

""The proposals the president is calling for Congress to pass would primarily serve to reduce the constitutionally protected rights of law-abiding citizens while having little or no effect on violent crime,"" Lee said in a statement. ""It is deeply unfortunate that he continues to use the tragedy at Newtown as a backdrop for pushing legislation that would have done nothing to prevent that horrible crime.""

Lee said he and his conservative colleagues plan to ensure that any of the firearms proposals require a 60-vote threshold in order to proceed. This could be a high hurdle for the Senate to clear.

Already, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid dropped from the main package a proposal to renew and expand the expired assault weapons ban.

The base bill will instead cover universal background checks, strengthened punishments for illegal trafficking and more money for school security.

Items like school security enjoy broad support. But the move to include private sales -- including gun show purchases -- in the background check system remains controversial in some circles. Plus the assault weapons ban, which Republicans most adamantly oppose, is still expected to get a vote as an amendment to the main bill.

The National Rifle Association, during and after Obama's remarks, tweeted a flurry of comments criticizing the latest Obama push. The group accused him of campaigning ""against guns to please the fringe.""

Both sides of the gun debate are stepping up their effort to sway Congress. While the NRA has been vocal since the start of the process, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg just launched a $12 million ad buy in support of the legislation.

""It's not done until it's done,"" Obama said Thursday. ""There are some powerful voices on the other side that are interested in running out the clock, or changing the subject. ... They're doing everything they can to make all our progress collapse under the weight of fear and frustration."""
"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-senate-gun-measure-20130304,0,5616625.story",2013-03-04 08:00:00,"['Melanie Mason Is A National Political Correspondent For The Los Angeles Times', 'Based In Los Angeles. She Started With The Times In Washington', 'D.C.', 'In', 'Covering Money', 'Politics', 'She Also Covered State Politics', 'Government In Sacramento.']","New Senate gun measure unveiled, and this one’s bipartisan","WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of senators unveiled a new measure Monday to combat illegal gun trafficking, a sign of momentum for one element of President Obama’s initiative to reduce gun violence.

The primary focus of the bill is to combat so-called straw purchasing, in which a person who is legally eligible to buy a gun does so for someone who is prohibited from purchasing or owning a firearm. The proposal would impose stiff penalties for both straw purchasers and those who sell to them. It would also explicitly define gun trafficking as a federal crime.

Law enforcement officials have said the absence of such laws has hampered their ability to stop illegal firearms trafficking. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the bill’s co-sponsor and chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the “common sense” proposal would address those gaps in the law.

“Our bill was drafted at the request of law enforcement,” Leahy said. “It will provide needed tools to fight against the drug cartels and other criminals who threaten our communities. It will not undermine the 2nd Amendment rights of lawful gun owners.”

The bill blends two existing anti-trafficking proposals: one introduced by Leahy and Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), and another from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Mark Steven Kirk (R-Ill.). All four senators co-sponsor this new proposal, as well as Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).

With two Republicans on board, the bill has the most bipartisan support of the major gun bills now winding through Congress. Its backers are continuing to reach out to other Republican senators, particularly Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee who has an A rating from the National Rifle Assn.

While groups like the NRA have ardently opposed other elements of Obama’s gun control package, such as an assault weapons ban and an expansion of background checks, gun rights supporters have been relatively quiet on anti-trafficking proposals. But there have been pockets of push-back: Last week, Gun Owners of America urged members to call their senators to block the earlier version of Leahy and Durbin’s bill. The group did not respond to calls for comment Monday on the new agreement.

The Senate Judiciary Committee will deliberate the trafficking bill and other gun measures Thursday. A separate group of senators, led by Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) have been working on a bipartisan universal background check bill, but negotiations have stalled over disagreements over record-keeping for private sales.

The group also spent $500,000 on Wednesday alone, on an advertising campaign criticizing “Obama’s gun ban” and using Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a deep-pocketed gun control advocate, as a foil. “Tell your senator to listen to America’s police instead of listening to Obama and Bloomberg,” the ad said.

The action on Wednesday was initially supposed to be only the first series of votes in a debate to take days if not weeks. But as the measures’ chances faded this week, Senate leaders decided to rush the process, reaching a bipartisan agreement to hold nine votes in succession, each with a 60-vote threshold for passage.

Using the 60-vote hurdle so early in the process allowed Democrats to prevent the passage of an amendment mandating that any state with a concealed-weapons law, no matter how rigorous, would have to recognize the concealed-weapons permit of residents from any other state. The amendment received 57 votes in favor, including those of 12 Democrats, and 43 votes against.

Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, a lifelong backer of the N.R.A. who also pushed for new restrictions in recent weeks, made one last plea for his amendment, which would extend background checks to Internet and gun show sales. While acknowledging that “the politics are risky,” he said it was “a defining time in politics, where you know the facts are on your side.”

The bipartisan measure, which had appeared to have a strong chance of passage, received 55 votes before Mr. Reid changed his vote to “no” to preserve the parliamentary right to bring the measure up again. Four Republicans voted “yes”: Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, a co-author of the legislation; John McCain of Arizona; Mark Steven Kirk of Illinois; and Susan Collins of Maine. An equal number of Democrats voted “no”: Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Max Baucus of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. All are from states that Mr. Obama lost by wide margins last fall, and all but Ms. Heitkamp face difficult re-election campaigns in 2014.

Debate over the measures consumed the Senate on Wednesday, with speeches from both sides meant to stir emotions. “I choose to vote my conscience,” Mr. Reid said, announcing his decision to vote for the bans on assault weapons and magazines that carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition, “because, if tragedy strikes again — if innocents are gunned down in a classroom or a theater or a restaurant — I could not live with myself as a father, as a husband, as a grandfather or as a friend knowing that I didn’t do everything in my power to prevent it.”

The assault weapons vote was 40 in favor and 60 against. The magazine ban fell with 46 in favor and 54 against."

That's all wet,"From Sunday's print column, which features another collection of dispatches from Somebody Nobody Asked™, America's pre-eminent unsolicited advice columnist

Dear gun rights advocates:

I'm with you on the futility of municipal gun bans and other localized restrictions on the private ownership of firearms. They present obstacles mainly for responsible, law-abiding people and do little to prevent evildoers from obtaining and carrying lethal weapons

But please. In the wake of the recent uptick in firearms fatalities in Chicago I've heard a corresponding uptick in your triumphant claim that the carnage here — a city with some of the toughest gun-control laws in the nation — illustrates not just that gun control doesn't work, but also that it has the perverse effect of making our streets more dangerous.

Truth is, attempts to declare ""no gun"" zones in urban areas that are surrounded by suburban and exurban dealers are doomed to be as ineffective as declaring ""no peeing"" zones in public swimming pools. In both cases, the flow is so easy and inevitable that it renders boundaries basically imaginary.

As long as we permit the straw purchase of virtually unlimited numbers of firearms, as long as we don't carefully track the custody of these weapons from hand to hand and as long as we don't require background checks prior to every gun sale, local ordinances will be chain-link levees. Their ""failure"" proves nothing, suggests nothing.

Police don't yet have a suspect in custody in the shooting death of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton in a South Side park Tuesday afternoon. But what do you want to bet that the murder weapon, if it's ever recovered, will have been bought by someone else, then sold, passed around or stolen until it ended up in the hands of the thug who fired the bullet that struck Hadiya in the back?

Strict, Chicago-style gun restrictions might reduce violence if implemented nationwide — it works in other countries — but we all know that's a political nonstarter, and no one is seriously suggesting it. In fact, the legal trend is going the other way, with Illinois poised to become the final state to allow licensed residents to carry concealed weapons. This development will at least start to level the battlefield in the war between those who follow the law and those who don't.

So meet us halfway here. Universal background checks. Heavy penalties and other safeguards against straw purchases. And no gloating about Chicago's homicide rate."

There were three Samurai swords, with blades 13 inches, 21 inches, and 28 inches long, inside the home that Lanza shared with his mother, Nancy, according to search warrants unveiled by Connecticut State Police.

There were boxes of bullets, a bayonet, a newspaper story about a 2008 mass shooting in Illinois, and photographs that appeared to show a dead person covered in plastic and blood.

DOCUMENTS: Newtown shooting search warrants

There were hundreds of rounds of ammunition, drawers full of gun paraphernalia, cardboard and paper targets, and a holiday card from Nancy Lanza to her son with a check to buy himself another gun.

In addition, investigators who continue to comb the murder scene at the school in Newtown say they recovered from Adam Lanza’s body three fully loaded 30-round magazines for the Bushmaster .223 caliber rifle that he used to kill 20 first-graders and six adults at Sandy Hook. Fourteen rounds remained in the magazine that was in the Bushmaster, with one round in the chamber, indicating that Lanza would have kept on shooting if his rampage had not been interrupted by police called to the scene.

The search warrants also noted that NRA certificates for Adam Lanza and for his mother were found in their home, but the NRA in a statement Thursday denied any association with the pair. “There is no record of a member relationship between Newtown killer Adam Lanza, nor between Nancy Lanza, A. Lanza or N. Lanza with the National Rifle Association,” it said in a statement.

The shootings have prompted President Obama to launch new gun control efforts, which have led to a showdown with the NRA and others who allege that proposed restrictions on gun purchases and ownership could infringe on the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution.

PHOTOS: Massacre in Newtown

“Now’s the time to turn that heartbreak into something real,” Obama said Thursday as he called on those who support reforms to speak out and challenged Congress not to get “squishy” and shy away from passing laws requiring background checks on all gun sales and banning high-capacity magazines like the ones Adam Lanza used.

“We need everybody to remember how we felt 100 days ago and make sure what we said at that time wasn’t just a bunch of platitudes,” Obama said. “Tears aren’t enough. Expressions of sympathy aren’t enough. Speeches aren’t enough. We’ve cried enough, known enough heartbreak. What we’re proposing is not radical. It’s not taking away anybody’s gun rights.”

A group formed in the aftermath of the massacre, Sandy Hook Promise, said the revelations of Lanza’s weapons collection and his actions proved that change is needed.

“The information revealed today underscores the need to turn this tragedy into transformation,” Tim Makris, co-founder of Sandy Hook Promise, said in a statement. “While legislation is not the only answer, it’s time for Congress to pass sensible measures supported by the vast majority of Americans to reduce gun violence. It’s time for our Legislature to move forward with the strongest measures possible. The country is united that something must be done; our representatives should act without delay.”

Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said Lanza’s collection of high-capacity magazines showed the need for a ban on them.

“We knew he used 30-round magazines to do it, and that they allowed him to do maximum damage in a very short period of time,” Malloy said in a statement. “This is exactly why we need to ban high-capacity magazines and why we need to tighten our assault weapons ban. I don’t know what more we need to know before we take decisive action to prevent gun violence.”

The Sandy Hook Promise group has steered clear of demanding specific changes in the past and made clear when it was launched in January that it was not yet ready to dive into the political debate on gun control. But the chilling details of the information unveiled Thursday appeared to have pushed it further toward calling for specific changes that some Newtown parents support.

According to the investigators’ reports, Lanza had easy access to the trove of weapons, ammunition, magazines, holsters, gun guides and other material found in the home, in his vehicle and on his body, despite reports from those who knew the family that Nancy Lanza had long worried about her son’s emotional state.

WHO THEY WERE: Sandy Hook shooting victims

The gun locker in their home was unlocked when police arrived there Dec. 14, and there was no indication it had been broken into. The guns used in the shootings were all purchased by Nancy Lanza, 52, who was shot dead in her bed. “There was no indication of a struggle,” Stephen J. Sedensky III, the state’s attorney for the district of Danbury, said. A rifle was found next to her bed.

Lanza then drove his mother’s vehicle to the Sandy Hook school and “shot his way into” it, leaving a loaded 12-gauge shotgun in the passenger compartment of the car. He carried with him a Glock 10-millimeter handgun, a 9-millimeter Sig Sauer handgun, the Bushmaster and multiple rounds of ammunition.

According to the police reports, it was just five minutes from the time Lanza got into the school until he killed himself with the Glock in the second of the two classrooms he targeted.

Lanza was found dressed in military-style clothing and lying on the floor. “Numerous schoolchildren and school personnel were located deceased in the first ... classrooms located off the main hallway, adjacent to the school’s front entrance,” the report said, making clear that Lanza began firing at his victims as soon as he gained entrance to the building.

Advertisement

The paperwork discovered in the Lanza home indicated that Nancy Lanza, for all of her apparent concern over her son’s anti-social behavior, was not concerned about him turning violent.

The papers included a handwritten notepad with what appeared to be “to do lists” for Nancy Lanza, for Dec. 14 through Dec. 20.

This is his vision of a speech he would like to see delivered by leaders at the National Rifle Association. It has not been delivered by the NRA.

Greetings. My name is Wayne LaPierre, and I’m the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association. After the national tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School, it was my hope that Red America and Blue America would finally come together and try to solve a serious problem, because protecting our children from violent madmen isn’t a conservative position or a liberal position; it’s a common-sense position.

Sadly, instead of offering new solutions, the same anti-gun zealots who’ve always hated the Second Amendment have politicized the deaths of kindergartners, adopting the Rahm Emanuel tactic of “Never letting a good crisis go to waste.” Anti-gun newspapers have even published the names and private addresses of law-abiding gun-owners – something they would NEVER do to sex offenders, drug addicts, wife-beaters, AIDS victims, welfare recipients or women who’ve had an abortion – and rightly so.

The NRA tried to help: Since we protect our president, vice president, governors, senators, judges, banks, hospitals, office buildings and jewelry stores with armed guards, why does it make sense to protect our schoolchildren with a small sign that says, “This Is a Gun Free Zone” – and then hope that someone with a gun can get there quickly if there’s an emergency? Why do we have armed guards at middle school and high school football games – but not at the actual middle schools or high schools?

But this still doesn’t do enough to protect our children. The time for partisanship is over; now is the time for action. And that’s why the NRA is requesting the assistance of the ACLU.

The Sandy Hook tragedy, the Virginia Tech shooting, the Aurora “Batman” shooting, the Tucson shooting – all of the killers had something in common: They were all mentally unstable young men who were prescribed mind-altering psychiatric drugs.

These killers didn’t purchase their guns illegally, or watch Fox News, or circumvent background checks by attending gun shows. They didn’t have prior convictions or troubling police records. That’s not the common denominator. The common denominator is that these young men were sick – and everyone knew it.

The ACLU has done more than any other organization to protect the legal rights of mentally sick people.

This is a fact.

Because of the ACLU, mentally sick people can refuse medical treatment or psychiatric care, even when their mental condition has left them homeless and penniless. Even in situations like Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old Sandy Hook killer, whose own mother, according to reports, was unable to mandate medical treatment for her son.

The NRA doesn’t hate the mentally ill. They deserve our compassion and our help. But sick young men have spilled far too much innocent blood. This simply cannot continue.

The NRA is hereby inviting the ACLU to join us on a study to find common-sense solutions that will prevent violent madmen from harming our children. And then together, it’s our hope that the NRA and the ACLU will offer these solutions directly to President Obama.

This won’t be easy. It’s anathema to the NRA to deny any law-abiding American the right to bear arms, just as it’s anathema to the ACLU to deny any American the same civil liberties of his neighbors. But despite our personal biases, there must be a solution that’s better than the status quo!

An inspirational politician once declared that there isn’t a Red America and a Blue America, or a black America and a white America – there’s the United States of America. As Americans, let’s come together, rise above the rhetoric, and actually do something that protects our children.

Thank you."

(CNN) —

In a major defeat for supporters of tougher gun laws, the U.S. Senate on Wednesday defeated a compromise plan to expand background checks on firearms sales as well as a proposal to ban some semi-automatic weapons modeled after military assault weapons.

The votes were on a series of amendments to a broad package of gun laws pushed by President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders in the aftermath of the Newtown school massacre in December.

However, fierce opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association led a backlash by conservative Republicans and a few Democrats from pro-gun states that doomed key proposals in the gun package, even after they had been watered down to try to satisfy opponents.

After the votes, Obama angrily criticized the NRA and senators who voted against the expanded background checks for rejecting a compromise he said was supported by a strong majority of Americans.

Public opinion gets trumped in gun control defeat

“Instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill,” Obama told White House reporters.

Noting polls that showed 90% support for such a measure, Obama called it a “pretty shameful day for Washington” and wondered of Congress: “Who are we here to represent?”

He was flanked by relatives of gun violence victims as well as former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a gun owner who was disabled in a shooting attack and supported Obama’s proposals.

A statement by Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, said the Senate had “ignored the will of the American people,” adding that those senators who voted against the expanded background checks chose to “obey the leaders of the powerful corporate gun lobby, instead of their constituents.”

To Erica Lafferty, the daughter of the principal of the Newtown, Connecticut, school who was killed along with 20 first-graders and five other educators in the December attack, the vote amounted to inaction in the face of a national tragedy.

“The next time there’s a mass shooting and they’re asked what they did to prevent it, they’re going to have to say nothing,” she said.

On the other side, the NRA’s Chris Cox called the expanded background check proposal “misguided,” saying it would not reduce violent crime “or keep our kids safe in their schools.”

The broader gun package still under consideration by the Senate includes tougher laws on gun trafficking and straw purchases, and steps to devise ways to improve safety in schools.

Obama: ‘This was a pretty shameful day in Washington’

As originally proposed, with a provision to expand background checks, it would have been the most significant gun legislation before Congress in almost two decades.

Due to early opposition to the background check provision, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania worked out a compromise that was less comprehensive than what Obama wanted but still gained the president’s support.

The Manchin-Toomey plan would have expanded background checks to include private sales at gun shows and all Internet sales, while continuing to exempt most sales between family members and friends.

Due to procedural steps agreed to by both sides, all the amendments considered Wednesday required 60 votes to pass in the 100-member chamber, meaning Democrats and their independent allies who hold 55 seats needed support from some GOP senators to push through the Manchin-Toomey proposal.

The final vote was 54 in favor to 46 opposed with four Republicans joining most Democrats in supporting the compromise. With the outcome obvious, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, cast a “no” vote to secure the ability to bring the measure up again.

Meanwhile, four Democrats from pro-gun states voted with most Republicans in opposition.

Giffords on senators: ‘Shame on them’

When the result was announced by Vice President Joe Biden, who presided over the chamber for the vote, two women in the gallery of spectators shouted “shame on you” at the senators.

“They are an embarrassment to this country that they don’t have any compassion or care for people who have been taken brutally from their families,” said one of them, Patricia Maisch, who grabbed the gun magazine from the attacker who shot Giffords and several other people in Tucson in January 2011.

On the proposal by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California to update a 1994 ban on semi-automatic weapons that expired in 2004, the vote was 40-60, showing opposition by several Democrats as well as the chamber’s Republican minority.

Obama had pushed for Congress to include both the expanded background checks provision and the weapons ban in any gun package. In recent weeks, he and the White House focused their efforts on winning support for the Manchin-Toomey compromise.

However, the NRA promised political retribution against supporters of tougher gun laws, and it called the expanded background checks a first step toward a national gun registry and government confiscation of firearms.

Obama called that claim misinformation, noting the Manchin-Toomey proposal prohibited such a registry. He said the tactics of the NRA galvanized a vocal minority of gun owners against the legislation, which caused some senators to flinch.

Rand Paul: OBama used Newtown families as ‘props’

“They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment,” Obama said. “And obviously a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too. And so they caved to the pressure. And they started looking for an excuse, any excuse to vote ‘no.’”

Reid earlier warned Republicans that the strong majority of Americans who support expanded background checks won’t forget votes against the Manchin-Toomey compromise.

“The American people … have a long, long memory,” he said.

Meanwhile, an alternative package of gun proposal that reflected the NRA position also was defeated.

Offerd by conservative Republicans, the alternative plan introduced Wednesday after weeks of hearings and debate on Democratic proposals lacked any expansion of background checks but called for more funding to better enforce the existing system.

Emotions high as political world reacts

A sponsor of the Republican alternative, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, said it would target the gun violence problem in a way that the Democratic proposal before the Senate would not.

In response, Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vermont, called the GOP’s last-minute proposal a “weak and counterproductive alternative.”

Other proposed amendments defeated Wednesday included a plan by Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas to make state concealed weapons permits acceptable throughout the country., as well as a proposal by Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey to limit the number of rounds in ammunition magazines.

Any legislation passed by the Senate would then go to the Republican-led House. So far, House Speaker John Boehner has stopped short of promising a vote on whatever the Senate sends over.

Polls show that a strong majority of Americans support some type of initiative to stem gun violence. In a CNN/ORC International poll released last week, 86% of Americans say they support expanded background checks.

Former FBI agent on ban%3A %27What a joke%27

Ban would allow guns that can use large magazines

Different models of same gun face different rulings

WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress' latest crack at a new assault weapons ban would protect more than 2,200 specific firearms, including a semi-automatic rifle that is nearly identical to one of the guns used in the bloodiest shootout in FBI history.

One model of that firearm, the Ruger .223 caliber Mini-14, is on the proposed list to be banned, while a different model of the same gun is on a list of exempted firearms in legislation the Senate is considering. The gun that would be protected from the ban has fixed physical features and can't be folded to be more compact. Yet the two firearms are equally deadly.

""What a joke,"" said former FBI agent John Hanlon, who survived the 1986 shootout in Miami. He was shot in the head, hand, groin and hip with a Ruger Mini-14 that had a folding stock. Two FBI agents died and five others were wounded.

Hanlon recalled lying on the street as brass bullet casings showered on him. He thought the shooter had an automatic weapon.

Both models of the Ruger Mini-14 specified in the proposed bill can take detachable magazines that hold dozens of rounds of ammunition. ""I can't imagine what the difference is,"" Hanlon said.

President Barack Obama has called for restoring a ban on military-style assault weapons and limiting the size of ammunition magazines.

A bill introduced last month by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. would ban 157 specific firearms designed for military and law enforcement use and exempt others made for hunting purposes. It also would ban ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.

Yet there are firearms that would be protected under Feinstein's proposal that can take large capacity magazines like the ones used in mass shootings that enable a gunman to fire dozens of rounds of ammunition without reloading.

Feinstein said in a written response to questions from The Associated Press that the list of more than 2,200 exempted firearms was designed to ""make crystal clear"" that the bill would not affect hunting and sporting weapons.

The December shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., that left 26 students and educators dead forced Washington to focus on curbing gun violence, a risky political move not tried in decades.

The gun industry, which is fighting any sort of ban, says gun ownership in the U.S. is the highest it's ever been, with more than 100 million firearms owners.

Obama and Vice President Joseph Biden have traveled around the country in an effort to gain support for new laws. Feinstein's proposal is the only sweeping piece of legislation designed to ban assault weapons currently being considered.

But some gun experts say the lists of banned and exempted firearms show a lack of understanding and expertise of guns.

""There's no logic to it,"" said Greg Danas, president of a Massachusetts-based expert witness business and firearms ballistic laboratory. ""What kind of effect is it going to have?""

Feinstein's bill defines an assault weapon as a semi-automatic firearm with a detachable magazine that has one of several military characteristics that are specified in her legislation. Examples of those characteristics include a pistol grip, which makes a firearm easier to hold, and a forward grip, which makes the firearm easier to stabilize to improve accuracy. The definition is similar to the one in Congress' original ban on assault weapons, which went into effect in 1994 and was widely criticized for outlawing firearms based on cosmetic features.

Feinstein was behind the 1994 law which, at the time, protected more than 600 firearms. The current bill would exempt by name and model more than 2,200 firearms by name and model. Feinstein said her staff had worked for more than a year to draft updates for the ban that expired in 2004, and it was apparent in the wake of recent mass shootings that now was the time to introduce a new bill. She said her staff consulted with law enforcement agencies and policy experts for months to create the expanded list.

Naming firearms that would remain legal under an assault weapons ban is a politically motivated gesture that was used to help pass the original ban in the early 1990s, people familiar with the process said.

Any firearm that does not fall within the law's definition of an assault weapon would not be banned. As a result, the list gives vulnerable politicians cover from constituents who do not want to give up their firearms.

For example, a politician can look at the list and assure a constituent that the government would not ban the firearm he or she loves to use for deer hunting. Under both the 1994 law and the currently proposed one, the government would not have the authority to take away guns people already legally own. The ban would only apply to specific firearms manufactured and sold after the law is enacted.

A list of exempted firearms was not part of Feinstein's original assault weapons ban two decades ago, said Michael Lenett, one of the lead congressional staffers on gun control issues in 1994. A separate bill in circulation exempted far fewer hunting and sporting firearms, Lenett said.

The purpose of creating such a list was to assure people that the government was not going after any legitimate hunting or sporting weapons. ""The other purpose of the list was to have a high profile way of assuring certain folks — including legislators — that we would not be going after their weapons that they use for those legitimate purposes,"" Lenett said.

""It was a win-win situation,"" Lenett recalled, because, he said, if the list could help pick up votes needed to pass the bill and temper some of the opposition, it could assuage some opponents of the ban without making the law less effective.

But gun experts say the lists in 1994 and the expanded lists of today don't make much sense.

""The bill demonstrates a shocking ignorance of the product they are purporting to regulate,"" said Lawrence Keane, senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade association based in Newtown, Conn., that represents gun manufacturers. ""I have no idea how they arrived at this list. It would seem to be random, bordering on throwing darts at a dart board.""

For instance, Feinstein's current proposal includes exemptions for three specific types of the M-1 Carbine, an assault rifle designed for the military that the U.S. currently bans from being imported. A draft of the legislation, created and modified in November and early December last year, banned the M-1 Carbine and didn't exempt any models, according to a copy obtained by the AP.

Feinstein said there was disagreement among firearms experts, law enforcement and gun safety organizations about whether to include the M-1 Carbine on the list of banned weapons.

""It has been used in multiple police shootings, and was originally used by U.S. soldiers on the battlefield,"" Feinstein said. ""On the other hand, it comes in models that would not meet the military characteristics test."" She said she decided to limit banned weapons to those that met the definition outlined in the bill.

At a Jan. 30 hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee on gun violence, National Rifle Association President Wayne LaPierre said Feinstein's bill is ""based on falsehoods to people that do not understand firearms, to convince them that the performance characteristics of guns that they are trying to ban through that bill are different than the performance characteristics that they're not trying to ban.""

The Ruger Mini-14 is a perfect example.

The model that has a fixed stock would be exempted by Feinstein's ban; the gun was protected in the 1994 law as well. A Ruger Mini-14 with a collapsible and folding stock would be illegal.

The guns fire the same caliber bullet and can take detachable magazines that could hold dozens of rounds of ammunition. The folding stock only reduces the gun's length by 2.75 inches, according to the manufacturer's website.

""It's irrelevant,"" Edmund Mireles, an FBI agent who survived the Miami shootout, said of the differences in features. ""They're equally dangerous.""

Mark D. Jones, a senior law enforcement adviser for the University of Chicago Crime Lab, said the folding stock does not affect the firearm's lethal potential.

""Given that both firearms will accept a 30 round or larger magazine, it renders the differences between them entirely cosmetic,"" Jones said.

Kristen Rand, the legislative director at the Washington-based Violence Policy Center, said the Ruger Mini-14 model that would be banned under Feinstein's legislation is easier to hold while firing because it has a pistol grip, and it's easier to hide because it has a collapsible stock. That's what makes it more dangerous that the Ruger Mini-14 with the fixed stock which would be exempted under the Feinstein bill, she said.

""And that's supposed to save somebody's life?"" asked Hanlon, the FBI agent shot alongside Mireles.

Hanlon considered the differences between the two models and whether the events of April 11, 1986, would have been different if the shooter used a Ruger Mini-14 with a fixed stock. ""I don't think it would have changed a damn thing,"" he said. ""I don't see what makes that gun less dangerous."""

Dishonorably discharged soldiers, after all, aren’t allowed to own firearms. Why should dishonored cops?

Advertisement

Like booted officer Christopher Jordan Dorner, who allegedly went on a vengeful killing rampage four years after being fired from the Los Angeles Police Department.

Maybe, at least, Dorner should have been required to undergo psychological testing upon being sacked to determine whether he was mentally fit to own weapons.

True, there may be a constitutional problem with that idea. He’s still a citizen, presumably with a 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms. That doubtless would be the argument of gun-rights groups.

He wasn’t convicted of a crime. If we’re going to confiscate the weapons of an axed cop or subject him to psychological testing, shouldn’t we also take that precaution with, say, a fired fast-food burger-flipper?

Advertisement

Well, no, there’s a difference: We expect and demand more from police, who have been trained at public expense to be expert killers.

But never mind.

Advertisement

Dorner seemingly was law-abiding — until he wasn’t.

And that brings up a larger point: At minimum, he is another example of a so-called law-abiding, innocent gun owner who apparently went berserk and used his arsenal to kill people.

Advertisement

It makes such comments as this one recently uttered by National Rifle Assn. executive Wayne LaPierre look particularly inane and off target: “Law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals.”

News flash: Some law-abiders do become violent criminals. And their kill rate too often increases with their firepower.

Advertisement

Of course, this gets into the whole definition of “law-abiding.” Unfortunately, you don’t need to be exactly law-abiding to legally purchase a gun.

“It’s one of the really pervasive myths,” says Garen Wintemute, director of the UC Davis Violence Prevention Research Program. “If you ask people the question, ‘Can criminals legally buy guns?’ they laugh and say, ‘Of course not.’ But a large segment of the population has a criminal record and can still buy guns.”

Advertisement

Especially under federal law. Less so under California law.

Wintemute, an emergency room doctor who has been researching gun violence for three decades, refers to one category of firearms owner as “not so law-abiding.” These are people who have committed misdemeanors, but still are allowed to own guns.

Advertisement

“Under federal law, if I assault my intimate partner, I’m prohibited [from possessing a gun] for life,” he says. “But I can beat you up and nothing happens. I can have any number of convictions for violent misdemeanors — assault and battery, brandishing a firearm in a threatening way — and can buy as many guns as I want.

“California is different. California almost uniquely bans possession for anyone who has been convicted of a violent misdemeanor.”

Advertisement

A national study of prisoners convicted of a firearms-related felony found that 60% were not legally barred under federal law from owning a gun when they committed their crime, Wintemute says.

If California’s tighter gun-eligibility rules were applied, however, only around a third of the criminals would have been legal gun owners.

Advertisement

Just because the law allows these creeps to keep and bear arms, does that make them “law-abiding?” You might think so by listening to the gun lobby.

But crime records don’t seem to matter to the NRA. It’s fighting expanded background checks that might turn up red flags on gun buyers. Criminals would avoid background checking, LaPierre asserts, and law-abiders would be inconvenienced.

Advertisement

“The evidence is that these people [with criminal records] are a much greater risk for committing a future crime than the truly law-abiding gun owners,” Wintemute says.

“The question for us and the rest of the nation is, are we OK with that?”

Advertisement

Clearly we’re allowing too many people to buy and possess guns — characters who, by almost any logical criteria, should not be armed.

“I grew up around guns,” Wintemute says. “I was a member of the Rifle and Pistol Club at UC Davis. I’m not anti-gun. I’m anti-what guns can do....

Advertisement

“Nobody thinks that any one policy is going to take care of the entire problem. But, for most people, denying a gun purchase works.”

The two most important steps Wintemute would take, he says, would be to prohibit alcohol abusers from owning guns and to confiscate the roughly 39,000 weapons currently possessed by about 20,000 Californians legally barred from holding them.

Advertisement

“It’s a huge gap in our current regulation,” Wintemute says of the liquor laxity. “There is solid evidence — it’s not a matter of dispute — that alcohol abuse is a risk factor for committing violence.”

One bill proposed in the Legislature last week would prohibit gun ownership for anyone convicted twice of driving under the influence.

Advertisement

Another measure, coauthored by Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) and budget Chairman Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) would appropriate the $20-million-plus needed to seize the illegally held weapons.

There was a heavy volley of gun control proposals — some good, some goofy.

Advertisement

The good: Ban possession — not just the sale — of ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds. That probably would necessitate an expensive government buy-back.

Also introduced: A requirement that all new semiautomatic rifles come with fixed magazines. No detachables.

Advertisement

The goofy: Requiring all gun owners to buy liability insurance. A boon for insurers and a ludicrous burden for someone who hasn’t shot grandpa’s old shotgun in 40 years.

But really goofy: The idea that an angry, deeply disturbed fired cop was deemed fit to own guns.

Report,"Don’t look for a new Justice Department report about American gun violence to receive any serious media coverage over the coming days, or ever. According to the report from the department’s Bureau of Statistics, every argument the media and the left are currently making to push for new restrictions on our Second Amendment civil rights, are made up of anti-science nonsense. This report not only proves the media wrong, it proves the NRA right.

Between the years of 1993 and 2011, as the assault weapons ban expired, more Americans purchased guns, the Supreme Court overturned outright gun bans, and individual states not only loosed gun control restrictions but also issued concealed carry permits to private citizens, incidents of gun violence in America collapsed.

Between 1993 and 2011, nonfatal gun crimes plummeted 69%; from 1.5 million to 467,300. Gun-related murders dropped 40%; from 18,253 to 11,101. Gun-related murders for black Americans plummeted by 51%.

The report also shows that the media-created hysteria over school shootings is wildly misleading. Between ’93 and ’11, the murder rate in schools dropped by almost a third; from 29 to 20.

Background checks have also been exposed as another bogus narrative the media’s crafted out of thin air. This report proves beyond any doubt that closing the so-called gun show loophole will accomplish next to nothing. Less than one-percent of state prisoners caught with a gun purchased it at a gun show. Moreover, who knows how many of those criminals might have passed or did pass a background check.

So-called assault weapons are also not a problem, Only “2% of state inmates and 3% of federal inmates were armed with a military-style semiautomatic or fully automatic firearm.”

What this study clearly shows is that Obama, Democrats, and the media don’t give a damn about stopping gun violence. If they did, they would be focused on everything but the one and two-percent problems.

What we have here is a yet-another culture war; nothing more nothing less — and one aimed at the type of law-abiding citizens who attend gun shows and enjoy these so-called assault weapons. In other words, Red State conservatives.

What is especially crucial to keep in mind is that 2011 is not some kind of outlier. If you study the original report, you will see that these decreases are all part of an 18-year trend, not an outlier year or two.

This report is extremely good news is you are the kind of person who gives a damn about human life.

But if you are cynical, power-hungry Democrats more uncomfortable with the idea of human freedom than you are pleased with a decrease in human life, this report is bad news. Furthermore, if you are a dishonest member of the media who believes that delivering political wins to Democrats is more important than human life, this report is also bad news.

There is just no question that an armed American populace is a safer American populace. This study also proves that smart policing and a willingness to award serious jail time to violent offenders (two areas our criminal justice system have focused on over the last two decades) does a helluva lot more to decrease the rate of gun violence than purely symbolic gun-grabbing laws.

Thanks to this study we also know for a fact now that the Newtown massacre is being exploited by the media only to demonize Obama’s political enemies.

The push to reduce gun violence comes after a mass shooting at a Newtown%2C Conn. school

President Obama has proposed new gun control measures%2C including an assault weapons ban

The NRA says there should be armed guards in schools

The Senate on Wednesday held its first hearing on ways to reduce gun violence since 20 Connecticut students were killed in a December mass shooting.

President Obama proposed a new ban on assault weapons, background checks on gun buyers and limits on ammunition magazines. He has called on the divided Congress to enact legislation soon.

Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman shot in the head in 2011, opened the Judiciary Committee hearing by urging Congress to ""be bold"" and to do something to reduce the number of children killed by violence. Her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, also made a statement and took questions from senators.

Wayne LaPierrre, executive vice president and CEO of the National Rifle Association, testified that new gun laws ""is not a serious solution to reducing crime.""

USA TODAY's Jackie Kucinich is at the hearing and is filing stories throughout the day. Follow some of the hearing highlights here:

12:09 p.m. Kelly says he would give up his right to own a high-capacity magazine in order to bring back Christina-Taylor Green, the 9-year-old girl killed in the Tucson shooting.

12:04 p.m. LaPierre says Americans are afraid that ""they will be abandoned by their government. The only way they can protect themselves ... is with a firearm."" Johnson, the police chief, is asked to respond. He says law enforcement is ""well prepared"" to deal with any disaster. ""I can't relate to that kind of thinking,"" Johnson says about LaPierre's statement.

12 p.m. Durbin says there should have been a hearing like this after Giffords was shot, but he said it took the Newtown incident to get to this point.

11:56 a.m. After hearing statistics on gun violence, LaPierre of the NRA says it is tragic. ""We've got to interdict these people and get them off the streets,"" he says. ""Problem with gun laws is criminals don't cooperate with them. The mentally ill don't cooperate with them."" He repeats his stance against proposed universal background checks.

Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., refutes LaPierre's testimony and Leahy bangs his chairman's gavel to restore order in the hearing.

11:52 a.m. Cornyn asks Kelly about people with mental illness in Arizona whose applications for guns were denied. Kelly refutes a point made earlier by LaPierre, the NRA chief. About Loughner: ""His plan was to assassinate my wife. He was a criminal because of his drug use,"" Kelly says. ""He would have failed that (gun) background check.""

Kelly says Giffords would not have been at the Senate hearing on Wednesday ""if we had stronger background checks.""

11:49 a.m. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the GOP's minority whip, says he has a hard time telling his constituents that Congress is considering new gun laws when existing laws are not enforced. He says it's a good idea to look at things such as mental health treatment. Like other Republicans at this hearing, Cornyn criticized the Obama administration on prosecuting gun crimes.

11:47 a.m. Johnson, the Baltimore County police chief, says comprehensive background checks are ""not inconvenient.""

11:44 a.m. Sen. Charles Schumer, D.-N.Y., says he is in discussions with legislators who have ""high NRA ratings"" on bipartisan legislation to reduce gun violence. He says he can't share details. ""It won't create any gun registry. That is already illegal. It will not limit your ability to borrow your Uncle Willie's hunting rifle,"" Schumer says.

11:38 a.m. LaPierre says crime would be reduced if laws already on the books are enforced. ""The numbers are shocking,"" he says.

11:33 a.m. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a former prosecutor, criticizes the Obama administration's record on prosecuting gun crimes.

11:29 a.m. Feinstein asks what can be done to prevent gun violence at shopping malls, theaters and other businesses.. ""We can't have a totally armed society,"" the senator says. She asks Chief Johnson if the legislation proposed would be effective. He says: ""Yes, ma'am, I do.""

11:24 a.m. Feinstein, the California Democrat and author of a proposed assault weapons ban, makes a joke that it's good to see LaPierre, the NRA's CEO. She notes they tangled during the 1994 battle over the weapons ban. ""You look good,"" she said.

11:15 a.m. Grassley questions Kopel, the Denver law professor, about the effectiveness of the 1994 assault weapons ban. ""It was tried with great sincerity ... but it didn't seem to save any lives that the researchers could find,"" Kopel said.

11:11 a.m. LaPierre says ""straw man"" gun sales should be prosecuted -- such as anyone who helps a criminal get a gun. But he says it does no good to extend background checks to private sellers or in all instances. ""The fact is the law right now is a failure the way it is working,"" LaPierre says. ""This administration is not prosecuting the people they catch.""

11:09 a.m. Question goes to Kelly. He says there is more that can be done on background checks. He notes that Jared Loughner, the shooter in the Tucson massacre that wounded Giffords, purchased a gun with a background check. ""This is one of the most important things we must do,"" he said. ""Requiring private (gun) sellers to have a background check before they transfer a gun ... I can't imagine something more important"" than requiring that.

11:06 a.m. The formal statements are over and questioning of the witnesses has begun. Leahy asks Chief Johnson about the effectiveness of background checks.

11:04: More from LaPierre's testimony: ""Proposals that would only serve to burden the law-abiding have failed in the past and will fail in the future."" He said studies show the 1994 assault weapons ban did not reduce crime. ""And when it comes to the issue of background checks, let's be honest -- background checks will never be universal because criminals will never submit to them,"" he says.

11:02 a.m. LaPierre says ""proposing new gun laws, while failing to enforce the thousands we already have, is not a serious solution to reducing crime.""

""Law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals. Nor do we believe the government should dictate what we can lawfully own and use to protect our families,"" the NRA chief says.

11 a.m. LaPierre says NRA does more ""than anyone else on teaching safe and responsible gun ownership."" He explains former congressman Asa Hutchinson's role in developing a school safety program. ""It's time to throw an immediate blanket of security around children,"" he says.

10:58 a.m. Now up, Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the National Rifle Association.

10:57 a.m. Trotter calls for ""sensible"" enforcement of the gun laws already on the books. ""Instead of self-defeating gestures, we should address gun violence based on what works,"" she says. ""For women, the ability to arm ourselves is even more consequential than for men. Guns are the great equalizer.""

10:54 a.m. Now testifying: Gayle Trotter, a lawyer and senior fellow at the Independent Women's Forum. She talks about violence against women and research on concealed carry laws. ""Armed security works,"" Trotter says.

10:53 a.m. Giffords just sent a tweet, quoting from her husband's testimony: ""The breadth and complexity is great, but it is not an excuse for inaction.""

10:46 a.m. Now testifying: James Johnson, chief of Baltimore County (Md.) Police Department. He says law enforcement leaders back Obama's approach to reducing gun violence. ""I'm here today to tell you we are long overdue in strengthening our nation's gun laws,"" he says. Johnson calls for background checks and says law enforcement groups support the assault weapons ban proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Johnson also says states need help dealing with gun trafficking across state lines. He says high capacity ammunition magazines are not necessary for hunting.

10:42 a.m. Now testifying: David Kopel, a professor at Denver University's law school. He's going through the history of congressional statutes on guns. ""Universal background checks should be available,"" Kopel says. ""Mandating universal checks can only be enforceable if there is universal gun registration.""

10:39 a.m. Kelly says Congress should close the gun show loophole and enact a tough federal gun trafficking statute. Kelly says Congress should not look to ideology but try to compromise.

10:35 a.m. ""We believe in the Second Amendment. We take that right seriously and we would never give it up. But rights demand responsibility and this right does not extend to terrorists...to criminals ...to the mentally ill. When dangerous people get dangerous guns, we are all the more vulnerable,"" Kelly says.

10:33 a.m. Kelly says he and Giffords ""aren't here as victims. We're speaking to you today as Americans. We're both gun owners and we take that right and the responsibilities that come with it very seriously.""

10:32 a.m. First witness is Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut and Giffords' husband. The couple have founded Americans for Responsible Solutions, a PAC aimed at reducing gun violence.

10:27 a.m. Grassley criticizes executive actions taken by Obama to reduce gun violence, saying there is not enough detail provided about the specifics of each move. He also says they could have been issued before Newtown.

10:24 a.m. Grassley says any discussion about what to do needs to include focus on mental health. He also condemns violent video games. ""Banning guns based on their appearance does not make sense,"" Grassley says about proposed assault weapons ban. He also questions limit on ammunition magazines.

10:21 a.m. Grassley, the top Republican on the committee, is now speaking. He says no one will ever forget where they were when they learned about the ""evil act"" that happened at Newtown. ""Clearly violent crimes and those who commit them are a plague on our society,"" he says.

10:20 a.m. Leahy says he hopes hearing will build consensus around ""common sense solutions."" He urges the new 113th Congress to act in a bipartisan fashion -- something that has been missing in recent years on Capitol Hill.

10:17 a.m. Leahy says ""Americans are looking to us for solutions and for action.""

He says it is a ""simple matter of common sense"" to plug loopholes in the law dealing with background checks for gun owners.

""The Second Amendment is secure and will remain secure and protected,"" Leahy says.

10:15 a.m. Leahy begins his opening statement, saying ""America's heart was broken"" on Dec. 14 when 20 children and six educators were killed at Sandy Hook school in Newtown, Conn.

""I hope we can forgo partisan recrimination. It's too important for that. We should all be here as Americans.""

10:12 a.m. Giffords is speaking haltingly, slowly enunciating her words. ""This is an important conversation for our children,"" she says. ""Speaking is difficult but I need to say something important Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying. ... It will be hard but the time is now. You must act. Be bold. Be courageous. Americans are counting on you. Thank you.""

10:11 a.m. Leahy lays down the rules for the hearing, asking for respect on this ""serious subject."" Capitol police will remove anyone who is disorderly. ""We're going to hear a lot of different perspectives on gun violence,"" he says.

10:09 a.m. Giffords and Kelly are being escorted to the witness table by Leahy and Grassley. The photographers are snapping away.

10:01 a.m. ET Before the hearing, Giffords sent out a tweet thanking Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, ""for starting this conversation."""

Gaining enough support simply to open the debate has required extensive negotiation and legislative maneuvering, testimony to the difficult politics of gun control. If the Senate proceeds as scheduled Thursday, it will mark only the third time in a generation that a significant gun measure has come to the floor.

The last time — late in the Clinton administration — the bill eventually fell victim to attacks from both sides. After passing the Senate with a tie-breaking vote by then-Vice President Al Gore, it failed in the House, where amendments left it too weak in the eyes of gun control advocates, but still too tough for gun rights supporters to accept.

Gun rights advocates plan a similar strategy this time. Their goal, according to Senate officials, is to try to draw out the debate on amendments and offer a number of measures that would expand gun owners’ rights. Democrats running for reelection next year in conservative states will feel the need to back many of those amendments, opponents of the measure hope, and if enough of them pass, liberal gun control advocates will turn against the bill.

Ever since Congress began work on a legislative response to last year’s slaying of 20 children and six educators in Newtown, Conn., backers of new gun laws have tried to come up with a package that would avoid that fate. Their goal is to win support from enough gun control skeptics to get to 60 votes in the Senate — the level required to avert a filibuster — without losing the backing of more ardent gun control advocates.

That effort seemed stalled until last week, when Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a Democrat with an A rating from the National Rifle Assn., began negotiating with Republican Sen. Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania over expanded background checks for gun sales.

On Wednesday, the two unveiled a compromise that appeared to include much of what Democratic backers of gun control had been seeking, albeit with some concessions. The proposal won praise from key gun control advocates and opposition from the NRA.

The compromise would require background checks for a large majority of gun purchases, closing the current exemption for gun shows and Internet sales. Certain private transactions, including transfers between family members and neighbors, would be exempt.

All sales subject to the expanded checks would also be subject to current record-keeping requirements, a key demand of gun control advocates and more liberal Democrats, including Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, lead author of the Senate’s gun control package. To assuage the fears of gun rights advocates, the bill would restate existing law that prohibits the creation of a national registry of gun owners.

The compromise also gives gun rights advocates some victories. Notably, gun owners would be given the right to transport their weapons through states where their firearms are illegal. For example, gun owners who legally own an assault weapon would have the right to transport it through California or New York, which ban such weapons, so long as they could show they were traveling through, not remaining in, the state.

Schumer spent the morning calling leading gun control advocates to seek their support for the compromise, and won significant backing. New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has spent heavily from his personal fortune to back gun control, said in a statement on behalf of his group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, that the bill “will not only help keep guns out of the wrong hands — it will help save lives and keep our communities safe.”

President Obama said that there were “aspects of the agreement that [he] might prefer to be stronger,” but that the agreement “does represent welcome and significant bipartisan progress.”

Manchin, who won his Senate seat after a campaign in which he aired a television ad that showed him firing a gun at an Obama-sponsored bill, said he believed the proposal would win support from gun owners.

“They understand this is common sense — this is gun sense. We’re not infringing on their rights as an individual citizen,” he said. “If you’re going to go to a gun show, you should be subjected the same as if you went to the gun store. If you’re going to go online, you should be the same as if you bought the gun across the state lines.... This makes sense.”

Added Toomey: “I don’t consider criminal background checks to be gun control. I think it’s just common sense.”

“If you pass a criminal background check, you get to buy a gun,” he added. “It’s no problem.”

Sen. Mark Steven Kirk (R-Ill.), a cosponsor of the proposal, emerged optimistic from a closed-door meeting of Republicans.

“Right now we’re on a roll with a 90-10 issue,” he said, referring to polls that show approximately 90% of Americans support expanding background checks.

In a sign of the challenges ahead, however, few senators in either party pledged their immediate support, although Democratic aides said they were confident most if not all of the 55 members of their caucus would endorse it.

Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), who had been Manchin’s lead negotiating partner before talks reached an impasse, called it a “good-faith but unworkable plan,” and said it would “impose new taxes and unreasonable burdens on law-abiding citizens.”

When the Senate begins debate, the Manchin-Toomey proposal will be the first amendment considered. Democratic leaders have also promised Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) a vote on her amendment to ban assault weapons, which is not expected to pass.

After that, however, the bill’s path may become considerably more difficult.

Republican senators who had initially hoped to block the issue from even reaching the Senate floor were still recalibrating their tactics. Their efforts to block the bill at the start failed this week after other Republicans said they would vote with Democrats to open debate, and as outside conservative voices criticized their approach.

“This is not the key vote,” said Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), referring to Thursday’s vote to open the Senate debate. “The key vote is the cloture vote before final passage,” he said, referring to the procedural motion needed to shut down a filibuster. Coats was among the group of 14 Republicans who had tried this week to block the debate.

Opponents of the bill made it clear that they plan an extensive debate. “We’re going to expose all the problems that are wrong with the bill,” said Brian Phillips, spokesman for Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).

On Wednesday, however, it was the bill’s supporters who took to the Senate floor. Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.) spoke several times to tell the personal stories of victims of gun violence from Newtown as well as shootings at Virginia Tech, in Aurora, Colo., and elsewhere.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, another Connecticut Democrat, also spoke to praise the Manchin-Toomey compromise.

“We are on the cusp of success,” he said. “The epidemic of gun violence is stoppable, and we will have a vote in this body that makes sure all of us are held to answer to the American people.”

A goal of Senate leaders is to win a strong bipartisan vote that would pressure the Republican-controlled House to bring the gun measure up for a vote there.

House Speaker John A. Boehner reiterated Wednesday that he would withhold comment until the Senate finished its work.

“It’s one thing for two members to come to some agreement. That doesn’t substitute the will for the other 98 members. And so we’ll wait and see what the Senate does,” he said.

(CNN) - Former Rep. Ron Paul, normally known for his online popularity, drew criticism Monday for asserting a political opinion in a tweet about the Navy SEAL who was killed at a gun range this weekend.

[tweet https://twitter.com/RonPaul/status/298477312876355585%5D



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

The three-time presidential candidate and longtime congressman from Texas is known for his staunch opposition to U.S. military involvement. While he doesn't describe himself as an ""isolationist,"" he has won favor among libertarians for opposing military intervention in other countries.

Kyle, 38, had claimed a record number of sniper killings in Iraq and said in an interview that he had no regrets about the 160 people he shot during his five combat tours in Iraq.

The former SEAL with two silver stars was an outspoken defender of Second Amendment rights and also helped form a foundation that assisted military veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder. Kyle was killed along with another veteran, Chad Littlefield. The two had arrived at the shooting range together Saturday with the suspect, Eddie Ray Routh.

In a post to Facebook Monday night, Paul elaborated more on his comment.

""As a veteran, I certainly recognize that this weekend's violence and killing of Chris Kyle were a tragic and sad event. My condolences and prayers go out to Mr. Kyle’s family,"" the post stated. ""Unconstitutional and unnecessary wars have endless unintended consequences. A policy of non-violence, as Christ preached, would have prevented this and similar tragedies. -REP""

While Paul has also been known as an advocate for gun rights, his comment earlier on Twitter quickly drew fire for going over the line.

Paul, also a doctor, has a record of defending gun ownership. Weeks after the Newtown, Connecticut elementary school shooting, the former congressman posted on his congressional website that he agrees ""more guns equals less crime"" and that ""private gun ownership prevents many shootings.""

He also came out against calls for more gun control, saying people should not view ""government legislation, especially at the federal level, as the solution to violence."""

The Southern Poverty Law Center, which has been tracking hate groups for 30 years, released its latest report on the growth of these organizations this week. Its findings were, to say the least, alarming. The center divides its subjects into militias, which are mostly groups of weekend warriors who train for combat against imaginary foes; hate groups, which target minorities; and “patriot” groups, whose beef is with the U.S. government. Patriot groups first began surfacing after the massacre of a bizarre sect by federal agents in Waco, Texas, in the early 1990s. They showed their teeth in 1995, when a patriot adherent blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City.

SLIDESHOW: The 10 trigger-happiest states in America

Since then, the patriot movement has been growing at a blistering pace, especially following the election of President Obama in 2008, according to the report. From just 149 groups in 2008, the number jumped to 512 in 2009 and has been rising sharply since. In 2012, it hit 1,360. Now that Obama is seriously pushing for tougher gun laws, further growth is a near certainty. The result? There’s no knowing, but some kind of serious attack is increasingly possible.

Patriot groups are motivated by a host of anti-government attitudes, but their primary focus is guns. They are convinced that the government is out to seize their weapons, even though most legislation is focused on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals or restricting the types of weapons that can be sold. Many are also united by belief in an outlandish one-world government conspiracy theory positing that the United Nations is poised to strip away American property rights and impose socialism on us all.

What can be done to reverse this tide of belligerent ignorance? Not much. The typical patriot acts within his free-speech and 2nd Amendment rights, and in fact most patriot activity consists of venting steam by meeting with like-minded Neanderthals and firing off blog posts threatening civil war. Yet such blather tends to get under the skin of the Timothy McVeighs of the world. These groups should be closely monitored, with resources adequate to the task, even if it means shifting some homeland security money from the hunt for foreign terrorists."

The sparse turnout outside City Hall had to be discouraging Thursday for a phalanx of government leaders intent on bringing public pressure to bear on the nation’s wavering lawmakers to enact gun controls. “The overwhelming majority of Americans have been on our side,” noted Senator Richard Blumenthal, who had to concede, “but they have been the silent majority.”

He underlined the central question: Are the strong public opinion poll numbers for gun controls, which registered at 90 percent immediately after the December school massacre in nearby Newtown, already fading in the bewildering maw of gun politics on Capitol Hill?

Here on Main Street, the art of suffocating needed reform by Congress felt palpable. The proposed ban on the sort of assault rifle used in Newtown is sagely pronounced a political nonstarter even before the Senate votes. Hope fades for a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines. And the call for universal background checks for gun ownership is increasingly in doubt as Senate Republicans, sensing dwindling interest, resort to usual vows to filibuster.

The gathering here of a few score of people was one of more than 100 rallies organized by the Obama administration and mayors as part of a national grass-roots campaign. Hopeful speeches were delivered, but it seemed clear that a far more fully aroused public will be required to budge enough lawmakers from their obeisance to the gun lobby. Gov. Dannel Malloy of Connecticut made no secret of his frustration with the pace of nonaction, both in the Statehouse across town and in Congress. He denounced the “silliness” of a drawn-out police investigation that has kept basic information about the tragedy secret for three months — information the public and lawmakers need to know in driving for a solution."

Newtown officials have called for privacy on anniversary

In his weekly radio address%2C President Obama said the tragedy inspired nation to make communities safer

20 children and six educators were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School one year ago

A year after the deadly school shooting in Newtown, Conn., bells tolled across the town at 9:30 a.m. Saturday as the small community planned a day of quiet reflection with private memorial services.

The bells rang 26 times as names of each of the victims were read at St. Rose of Lima church in Newtown, one of several houses of worship that was holding private services Saturday for a community still grieving for the 20 children and six educators killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

President Obama and the first lady marked the anniversary of the shooting at the White House Saturday by lighting 26 candles and bowing their heads for a moment of silence.

In his weekly address, Obama asked Americans to consider their role in preventing future violence, saying the country has not done enough to make communities safer since the tragedy. Parents of children killed in the tragedy lent their voices to efforts to prevent such violence from happening again but more action is needed to stop violence, he said.

""We have to do more to keep dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun so easily,"" Obama said. ""We have to do more to heal troubled minds. We have to do everything we can to protect our children from harm and make them feel loved and valued and cared for.""

Gov. Dannel P. Malloy asked for houses of worship around the state to ring their bells at 9:30 a.m. and called for flags to be lowered to half-staff around the state.

St. Rose of Lima will host a service that will include the dedication of a memorial arch and the ringing of peace bells that also were rung at Virginia Tech after the mass shooting there in 2007 and in New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Newtown officials have called for privacy and asked town residents to honor the victims through acts of service and kindness. At a joint appearance earlier this week in Newtown, some of the victims' families urged people to find ways to give back to their own communities.

""In this way, we hope that some small measure of good may be returned to the world,"" JoAnn Bacon, whose 6-year-old daughter, Charlotte, was killed at Sandy Hook.

The town had no formal events planned for Saturday, and officials have discouraged the news media from coming to Newtown.

""We are trying to respect the world's interest in us, but we also have a real need in our community to gain a foothold,"" First Selectman Pat Llodra said.

The gunman, Adam Lanza, killed his mother inside their Newtown home on Dec. 14, 2012, before driving to the school, where he carried out his rampage. He killed himself as police arrived.

http://news.yahoo.com/federal-gun-prosecutions-decline-despite-obama-executive-action-233021126.html,,[],Federal gun charges decline despite Obama executive action,"More than a year after the Sandy Hook school shooting, President Obama’s directive to amp up prosecutions of federal gun laws hasn’t made much difference in how many people are charged with gun crimes.

U.S. attorneys that prosecute such cases charged 11,674 people with breaking federal gun laws in the fiscal year that ended in September, compared to 11,728 people the year before.

“The federal gun charge numbers are not an accurate reflection of the Department's efforts to investigate and prosecute gun violence,” said Allison Price, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, in a statement. “The fact that we may not prosecute a gun case in federal court does not mean the case is not prosecuted at all.”

Many gun cases are handled at the state and local level, she added. ""Our priorities are to keep our kids safe, help prevent mass shootings, and reduce the epidemic of gun violence in this country,” Price said.

Obama’s directive was one of 23 executive actions on gun violence he released last January, a month after the mass shooting at Connecticut’s Sandy Hook Elementary School that left 20 children dead. The president’s legislative efforts to limit ammunition magazine sizes and expand background checks to cover more gun sales died in the Senate a few months later.

The Justice Department says it has taken other steps to increase firearms enforcement, including forming a task force that advises federal prosecutors on how to reduce gun violence, and creating a database to allow law enforcement to trace weapons across jurisdictions.

But the figures show how ineffectual the president’s executive action was, at least in the short term, in ginning up prosecutions. Without new legislation or increased resources, U.S. attorneys are unlikely to prosecute more gun crimes, experts say.

The National Rifle Association and some Republican lawmakers have argued that the Justice Department does not adequately enforce gun laws that are already on the books. Even Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, formerly Obama’s chief of staff, said in October that the feds have done a “horrible” job of prosecuting gun crimes in Chicago .

Story continues

Obama’s directive to the Justice Department to “maximize enforcement efforts to prevent gun violence and prosecute gun crime” was supposed to be an answer to those critics.

“It’s been deplorable and woeful, the lack of prosecutions for criminals who break gun laws,” Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the NRA, told Yahoo News.

The powerful gun group helped defeat a bill to expand background checks in April in part by arguing that the Obama administration rarely prosecutes people who claim they are eligible to buy a weapon and then are found by the National Instant Crime Background Check System (NICS) to be felons or otherwise disqualified. In 2010, the Feds prosecuted only 44 people who tried to illegally purchase a weapon — less than 1 percent of all people who failed their background checks. The department has instead focused on prosecuting people who violate more serious federal gun laws.

The Justice Department would not say whether that number has increased since 2010. The department has focused on “complex multi-defendant cases” since 2008, Price said.

Over 10 years, NICS checked 100 million gun purchases, and declined people 700,000 times for being felons or having another disqualifying factor on their records. Increasing prosecutions of those people is a rare patch of common ground between the NRA and gun control groups.

“It’s a complicated problem, and frankly, we’re the ones who first raised it,” said Mark Glaze, the president of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a gun control group backed by Michael Bloomberg. “Out of tens of thousands of people, only a relative handful are prosecuted.”

Glaze said many of these cases are difficult to prosecute because U.S. attorneys already are overworked, and using them to charge people with a “paperwork violation” can seem wasteful. Glaze wants 50 U.S. attorneys added to prosecute people who didn’t pass background checks but still tried to buy guns.

The organization also has suggested that the Justice Department conduct a study of a random sample of the 700,000 illegal sales that were declined to try to figure out if any factors predict which buyers commit crimes in the future. That way, U.S. attorneys could focus on prosecuting cases that showed those risk factors.

But others have argued that prosecuting people for failing their background checks is a waste of time in a legal landscape littered with gun traffickers and other more serious offenders. Some buyers are declined because they didn’t realize something on their record disqualified them from purchasing a weapon.

“The reason the ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] doesn’t make it a high priority to target people who attempt to buy a gun from the gun dealer is they spend the majority of their time targeting violent offenders who use guns illegally,” said Mike Bouchard, the former assistant director for field operations of the ATF. “By taking that person and arresting them, it has little to no impact on violent crime.”

This prioritization of serious offenses predates Obama: The Justice Department under President George W. Bush also prosecuted well under 1 percent of people who attempted to buy a weapon and were declined."

(CNN) —

In a major defeat for supporters of tougher gun laws, the U.S. Senate on Wednesday defeated a compromise plan to expand background checks on firearms sales as well as a proposal to ban some semi-automatic weapons modeled after military assault weapons.

The votes were on a series of amendments to a broad package of gun laws pushed by President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders in the aftermath of the Newtown school massacre in December.

However, fierce opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association led a backlash by conservative Republicans and a few Democrats from pro-gun states that doomed key proposals in the gun package, even after they had been watered down to try to satisfy opponents.

After the votes, Obama angrily criticized the NRA and senators who voted against the expanded background checks for rejecting a compromise he said was supported by a strong majority of Americans.

Public opinion gets trumped in gun control defeat

“Instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill,” Obama told White House reporters.

Noting polls that showed 90% support for such a measure, Obama called it a “pretty shameful day for Washington” and wondered of Congress: “Who are we here to represent?”

He was flanked by relatives of gun violence victims as well as former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a gun owner who was disabled in a shooting attack and supported Obama’s proposals.

A statement by Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, said the Senate had “ignored the will of the American people,” adding that those senators who voted against the expanded background checks chose to “obey the leaders of the powerful corporate gun lobby, instead of their constituents.”

To Erica Lafferty, the daughter of the principal of the Newtown, Connecticut, school who was killed along with 20 first-graders and five other educators in the December attack, the vote amounted to inaction in the face of a national tragedy.

“The next time there’s a mass shooting and they’re asked what they did to prevent it, they’re going to have to say nothing,” she said.

On the other side, the NRA’s Chris Cox called the expanded background check proposal “misguided,” saying it would not reduce violent crime “or keep our kids safe in their schools.”

The broader gun package still under consideration by the Senate includes tougher laws on gun trafficking and straw purchases, and steps to devise ways to improve safety in schools.

Obama: ‘This was a pretty shameful day in Washington’

As originally proposed, with a provision to expand background checks, it would have been the most significant gun legislation before Congress in almost two decades.

Due to early opposition to the background check provision, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania worked out a compromise that was less comprehensive than what Obama wanted but still gained the president’s support.

The Manchin-Toomey plan would have expanded background checks to include private sales at gun shows and all Internet sales, while continuing to exempt most sales between family members and friends.

Due to procedural steps agreed to by both sides, all the amendments considered Wednesday required 60 votes to pass in the 100-member chamber, meaning Democrats and their independent allies who hold 55 seats needed support from some GOP senators to push through the Manchin-Toomey proposal.

The final vote was 54 in favor to 46 opposed with four Republicans joining most Democrats in supporting the compromise. With the outcome obvious, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, cast a “no” vote to secure the ability to bring the measure up again.

Meanwhile, four Democrats from pro-gun states voted with most Republicans in opposition.

Giffords on senators: ‘Shame on them’

When the result was announced by Vice President Joe Biden, who presided over the chamber for the vote, two women in the gallery of spectators shouted “shame on you” at the senators.

“They are an embarrassment to this country that they don’t have any compassion or care for people who have been taken brutally from their families,” said one of them, Patricia Maisch, who grabbed the gun magazine from the attacker who shot Giffords and several other people in Tucson in January 2011.

On the proposal by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California to update a 1994 ban on semi-automatic weapons that expired in 2004, the vote was 40-60, showing opposition by several Democrats as well as the chamber’s Republican minority.

Obama had pushed for Congress to include both the expanded background checks provision and the weapons ban in any gun package. In recent weeks, he and the White House focused their efforts on winning support for the Manchin-Toomey compromise.

However, the NRA promised political retribution against supporters of tougher gun laws, and it called the expanded background checks a first step toward a national gun registry and government confiscation of firearms.

Obama called that claim misinformation, noting the Manchin-Toomey proposal prohibited such a registry. He said the tactics of the NRA galvanized a vocal minority of gun owners against the legislation, which caused some senators to flinch.

Rand Paul: OBama used Newtown families as ‘props’

“They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment,” Obama said. “And obviously a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too. And so they caved to the pressure. And they started looking for an excuse, any excuse to vote ‘no.’”

Reid earlier warned Republicans that the strong majority of Americans who support expanded background checks won’t forget votes against the Manchin-Toomey compromise.

“The American people … have a long, long memory,” he said.

Meanwhile, an alternative package of gun proposal that reflected the NRA position also was defeated.

Offerd by conservative Republicans, the alternative plan introduced Wednesday after weeks of hearings and debate on Democratic proposals lacked any expansion of background checks but called for more funding to better enforce the existing system.

Emotions high as political world reacts

A sponsor of the Republican alternative, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, said it would target the gun violence problem in a way that the Democratic proposal before the Senate would not.

In response, Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vermont, called the GOP’s last-minute proposal a “weak and counterproductive alternative.”

Other proposed amendments defeated Wednesday included a plan by Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas to make state concealed weapons permits acceptable throughout the country., as well as a proposal by Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey to limit the number of rounds in ammunition magazines.

Any legislation passed by the Senate would then go to the Republican-led House. So far, House Speaker John Boehner has stopped short of promising a vote on whatever the Senate sends over.

Polls show that a strong majority of Americans support some type of initiative to stem gun violence. In a CNN/ORC International poll released last week, 86% of Americans say they support expanded background checks.

(CNN) – Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Sunday described the National Rifle Association as the biggest stumbling block to passing her assault weapons ban proposal.

""The NRA is venal. They come after you, they put together large amounts of money to defeat you,"" she said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""They did this in '93, and they intend to continue it.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Feinstein on Thursday introduced details on a ban that would stop the sale, transfer, importation and manufacture of more than 100 specialty firearms and certain semiautomatic rifles. It would also limit the number of rounds in a magazine to 10.

The restrictions would not apply to guns owned before enactment of any law. Feinstein noted her proposal exempts from the ban more than 2,000 models used for hunting or sporting purposes.

In order for the proposal to go anywhere, Feinstein needs enough support from conservative Democrats, who will likely face intense lobbying from the NRA and other pro-gun groups.

While she recognized Sunday that passing the ban will be an ""uphill fight"" and the ""hardest of the hard,"" she expressed confidence that she can at least get it to the Senate floor.

""There will be a package put together. If 'assault weapons' is left out of the package - and I'm a member of (the) Judiciary (committee), No. 2 in seniority - I've been assured by the majority leader I'll be able to do it as an amendment on the floor.""

Feinstein helped push through the 1994 assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. She argued Sunday that the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, last month was the tipping point in getting the ban reinstated.

""For me Sandy Hook was an epiphany,"" she told CNN's chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. ""(The gunman) got a very powerful weapon. He went out with that weapon, and he killed 5- and 6- and 7-year-olds, I understand, with three to 11 bullets in each of their bodies, with a weapon that had the velocity of which could really rip these bodies apart. That should not be able to happen.""

Vice President Joe Biden, who also helped champion the original assault weapons ban, expressed support for the ban on Thursday. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama announced that his legislative agenda to curb gun violence included a ban on assault weapons and a cap on magazine capacity.

Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, railed against Obama's inauguration speech, in which the president made a brief reiteration of his push for gun control.

""When absolutes are abandoned for principles, the U.S. Constitution becomes a blank slate for anyone's graffiti,"" LaPierre said in a speech Tuesday. ""Words do have meaning, Mr. President. And those meanings are absolute, especially when it comes to our Bill of Rights.""

Feinstein, however, said Sunday it boils down to one question: ""Does government have an obligation to protect those children?""

""I believe we do,"" she continued. ""I believe we do.""

President Obama unveiled a series of measures designed to prevent gun violence

It is the most sweeping gun-control proposal in two decades

Proposals could face rough ride in Congress

President Obama unveiled the most sweeping set of gun-control proposals in two decades on Wednesday, a package that includes universal background checks on all gun buyers and a renewed ban on ""military-style"" assault weapons.

Opponents were quick to take issue with the plan: The National Rifle Association issued a statement saying that ""only honest, law-abiding gun owners will be affected and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy.""

Obama, speaking at a White House ceremony, also proposed restricting ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds, as well as new school safety and mental health programs, all designed to prevent shootings like the one last month at an elementary school in Connecticut.

""This is our first task as a society, keeping our children safe,"" Obama said. ""This is how we will be judged.""

The president and Vice President Biden — who developed the plan after a series of meetings with 229 groups involved in gun violence issues — appeared with the children who wrote letters to the White House expressing concern about gun violence.

MORE:White House fact sheet, executive actions

After reading some of those letters, Obama said: ""And these are our kids. This is what they're thinking about. And so what we should be thinking about is our responsibility to care for them, and shield them from harm.""

Also attending were family members of victims of the Dec. 14 attack that killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. ""Our hearts go out to you,"" Biden said, saying he and Obama want to ""honor the memory of your children.""

Obama said no law can ""prevent every senseless act,"" but can be valuable if it can prevent one attack. ""If there is even one life that can be saved, we've got an obligation to try it,"" the president said.

The White House issued a written plan with four goals: keeping guns out of the wrong hands, getting ""weapons of war"" off the streets, upgrading school safety and improving mental health services.

Among the specific proposals:

Keeping guns out of the wrong hands. The White House is proposing ""universal background checks"" designed to target private gun sales that are not covered by the current system, which applies to federally licensed dealers. The plan also includes four executive orders designed to remove barriers to information sharing among state and federal agencies.

Restricting ""weapons of war."" Obama's plan calls for limiting ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds. The document notes that the Newtown killings and the July attack in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., involved the kinds of semiautomatic weapons that were targeted by the assault-weapons ban that expired in 2004. The administration also wants to maintain the effort to ban armor-piercing bullets.

Biden said he has no ""illusions"" about the political challenges, but the Newtown shooting has shaken the nation's conscience. ""The world has changed,"" he said.

Still, gun rights supporters criticized many of the president's plans as ineffective, unconstitutional and politically motivated. Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus said the plan amounts to ""an executive power grab that may please his political base but will not solve the problems at hand.""

Such sentiments are indicative of the battle the proposals face in Congress, especially in the Republican-run House of Representatives.

""House committees of jurisdiction will review these recommendations,"" said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""And if the Senate passes a bill, we will also take a look at that.""

House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said he will consider Obama's recommendations.

""However, good intentions do not necessarily make good laws,"" Goodlatte said. He said he wants to ensure that the proposals will ""actually be meaningful in preventing the taking of innocent life and that they do not trample on the rights of law-abiding citizens to exercise their constitutionally guaranteed rights.""

Even some Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., have questioned whether a new assault-weapons ban can pass Congress.

Reid, a gun rights supporter, told a Nevada television station over the weekend that ""in the Senate, we're going to do what we think can get through the House.""

Said Sen. Max Baucus, a pro-gun Democrat representing Montana, in a statement: ""Enforcing the laws we already have on the books is a good first step, and it's clear more needs to be done to address access to mental health care ... Before passing new laws, we need a thoughtful debate that respects responsible, law-abiding gun owners in Montana instead of one-size-fits-all directives from Washington.""

Not all the dissent is Washington-based.

Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry said the Obama plan wouldn't have prevented the Newtown shootings, which Perry attributed to a ""sad young man"" who ""was clearly haunted by demons.""

""Guns require a finger to pull the trigger,"" said Perry, a Republican presidential candidate in 2012, who added that ""the piling on by the political left and their cohorts in the media to use the massacre of little children to advance a pre-existing political agenda that would not have saved those children disgusts me personally.""

In Mississippi, Republican Gov. Phil Bryant called for state legislation making it illegal to enforce any new federal gun control measures in the state, The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson reports.

Bryant said in a letter to high-ranking state officials -- even before Obama's presentation -- that he expected the proposals would ""infringe our constitutional right to keep and bear arms as never before in American history.""

The NRA, the nation's largest gun lobby, has vowed to fight the gun-control proposals. It has proposed armed guards in all schools, and expanding databases to block gun purchases by people who have been declared mentally ill.

Before Obama's event, the NRA released a video criticizing the president as an ""elitist hypocrite"" for opposing armed guards in every school even though his daughters receive Secret Service protection. White House spokesman Jay Carney called the ad ""repugnant and disgusting.""

But there is also plenty of support for the White House effort.

Marsha Moskowitz, a Sandy Hook, Conn., resident and former bus driver who once drove some of the kids who were killed in the school massacre, said she ""definitely"" agrees with the president's proposals.

""I understand the Second Amendment, but there's no need for assault weapons in personal homes or for hunting,"" Moskowitz said. ""If we can get one gun that was built to kill a mass amount of people out of someone's hands, I'm all for it.""

Michael Pohle Sr., 57, of Flemington, N.J., lost his son, Michael Jr., then 23, in the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007.

""I'm just so proud -- I don't care whether he's a Democrat or a Republican -- that he has put this on the table because too many elected leaders have been so afraid,"" Pohle said. He likened the journey to the yellow brick road in The Wizard of Oz. ""It's like we're at the start of the yellow brick road now,"" he said.

Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said he expects the families of the victims from Newtown and several other mass shootings to be very involved in the effort to push action in Congress. He noted that New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg flew several of the Newtown families to Washington in his plane. The victim advocates will be only a part of the coalition, he said.

""It does take a village, and the village is ready to riot,"" Glaze said.

Some advocates for the mentally ill expressed cautious optimism that the nation may finally take meaningful action to repair a broken mental health system.

""It's a terrible thing that it takes terrible acts for everyone, from the public to the president, to look comprehensively at this situation,"" said Doris Fuller, executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center in Virginia. ""But we can't think in silos, such as just looking at gun control. If we leave the mental illness treatment piece out of it, we will never get to a solution.""

The civil rights community appeared divided over Wednesday's developments, applauding steps to address gun violence, and mental health issues, but opposing proposals to place armed guards in schools.

""Of particular concern to us is their (guards') interaction with children of color, whose discipline issues are often dealt with as criminal matters, effectively fast tracking them into the criminal justice system,"" wrote National Urban League president and CEO Marc Morial in a statement.

""Bringing police into schools often negatively impacts the very children we are trying to protect,"" said Damon Hewitt, director of the Education Practice Group of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, in a statement. ""Police in schools often cross the line between safety and discipline, using overzealous methods to address normal adolescent behavior. African-American students are significantly more likely than their peers to be arrested at school just for acting like teen-agers."".

Obama also signed 23 executive orders dedicated to curbing gun violence; they included directing to federal agencies to make more data available for background checks, nominating a director for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and ordering the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to do more research on neurological causes of gun violence.

The president is also proposing harsher punishments for gun trafficking between states, as well as federal money to help cities pay for more police officers. In addition, Obama nominated a new leader for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; his previous nominee has been held up for years. Other proposals:

School safety. The plan proposes money to help local school districts hire 1,000 school resource officers and school counselors.

Mental health. The administration is proposing Project AWARE, which stands for Advancing Wellness and Resilience in Education. It would be designed to reach about 750,00 people to identify mental illness early in young people and refer them for treatment. Obama said he will direct the CDC to step up research into the causes of violence, and ask Congress to fund research into the impact of violent video games on young minds.

It adds up to the biggest government anti-gun violence program since 1994, when Congress passed an assault-weapons ban that expired 10 years later. A year earlier, Congress approved the Brady Bill, requiring background checks on gun purchasers.

At the White House event, Obama said he believes in Second Amendment rights to gun ownership, and knows that nearly all gun owners are law-abiding citizens. His plans, he said, are aimed at ""an irresponsible, law-breaking few.""

While not citing the NRA by name, Obama did denounce groups that gin up ""fear"" about a fictitious plot to take away people's guns.

""The only way we can change is if the American people demand it,""' Obama said.

Shaun McClusky, who kicked off the program Monday, financed it with initial donor commitments of $12,000. He told FoxNews.com that with those private donations alone, he can arm and train 36 people -- and hopes to begin that process in 60 days.

McClusky said he's already received more than a dozen responses from residents, ""none of them negative, all of them positive.""

But with McClusky launching the gun handout program in the same area where former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot in 2011, he's running into stiff resistance from Arizona officials.

State Rep. Victoria Steele, who represents Tucson, called the program ""plain lunacy.""

""Arizonans in Tucson and across the state are demanding that we reduce gun violence and create safer communities. Handing out shotguns is not a solution,"" she said in a written statement.

House Minority Leader Chad Campbell called it ""ideological extremism at its worst"" and ""a political gimmick that could have dangerous consequences.""

The program, though, is actually the brainchild of a master's student at the University of Houston. The student, Kyle Coplen, launched what he calls the Armed Citizen Project, a nonprofit that is handing out ""defensive shotguns"" for free in certain neighborhoods of Houston and studying the effect on crime rates.

Reached Thursday, Coplen said it's too early to tell whether there is an effect -- but he said he intends to expand the program to 15 cities by the end of the year. Right now, the program is only in Houston and Tucson, with McClusky's help.

""His idea's great,"" McClusky said Thursday. ""So I took his idea and I ran with it here in Tucson.""

McClusky said he's working with a gun shop that will help procure the shotguns and run the background checks and another school that will help conduct training classes. He said he's identified three high-crime neighborhoods and estimates it will cost $300 to $350 to arm each person who signs up.

He stressed that everyone who applies for the free shotgun will have to go through the standard background check.

""Everyone will go through a background check. There is no getting around it,"" he said.

As for the criticism, he said the initiative is a product of the city council's failure to adequately fund public safety.

""The Democrats are the ones to blame. ... They're the ones that fail to fund public safety,"" he said. ""They are failing the citizens. The citizens are reacting.""

But others expressed concern about the unintended consequences of such a program.

Councilwoman Regina Romero told the Arizona Daily Star that the plan to proliferate shotguns is ""reckless.""

""Why doesn't he hand them out around his neighborhood?"" she asked.

The project comes amid a tense debate regarding the need for new gun laws, in the wake of mass shootings in Arizona, Colorado and most recently Connecticut.

Nearby Colorado recently passed a package of firearms measures that continue to be fiercely debated. In Washington, the Senate is preparing to vote on a package of measures that address gun trafficking and background checks -- another proposal to renew the national assault weapons ban will likely get a vote, but faces heavy resistance."

Story highlights NEW: Massachusetts politicians predict the bid to lure Smith & Wesson to Mississippi will fail The gun industry in Connecticut is being ""demonized,"" says Mississippi's House speaker Gunmakers in ""anti-Second Amendment states"" won't be criticized in his state, he adds A U.S. senator from Connecticut calls the pitch ""preposterous""

Mississippi House Speaker Philip Gunn has invited gunmakers such as Colt to relocate to his state from others including Connecticut, where firearms have been a controversial issue since a school shooting there last December left 20 students and six adults dead.

The gun industry in Connecticut is being attacked and “demonized” because of national politics, Gunn said in a letter this week to Colt’s Manufacturing Company CEO Dennis Veilleux.

He also invited gunmaker Magpul Industries Corp. of Colorado to relocate to Mississippi.

Gunn, a Republican, said firearm manufacturers are “under attack in anti-Second Amendment states.”

“In our state, you will not be criticized for providing goods to the law-abiding citizens who enjoy hunting, shooting or who just want the peace of mind that comes with the constitutional right to protect their families,” Gunn wrote to Colt on Thursday.

“We welcome you with open arms!” he said.

In an interview with CNN affiliate WLBT, Gunn said having gunmakers move their operations to Mississippi is a “natural match,” saying the industry “meshes well” in a state with citizens who “love to hunt, … love to shoot, (and) people enjoy the peace of mind that comes from knowing they have the right to defend themselves.”

U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said Gunn sent letters to three gunmakers in his state and called Gunn’s proposal “preposterous.”

Connecticut residents support the Second Amendment and responsible gun ownership, “far from demonizing firearms products made here,” Blumenthal said in a statement.

“This preposterous pitch to companies with long, successful histories in our state shows the need for national standards and statutes to reduce gun violence,” the senator said. “Competition among states for less protective laws is a race to the bottom that should be avoided. The poison of illegal gun trafficking respects no state boundaries and threatens to cause more horrific tragedies like Newtown and the 1,900 gun violence deaths that have occurred since then.”

Newtown is the name of the Connecticut town where last December’s mass shooting occurred, at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Representatives for Colt and Magpul couldn’t be reached immediately for comment Friday.

William “Mo” Cowan, interim U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, called Gunn’s attempt “gimmicky” and predicted it wouldn’t work to draw Smith & Wesson from its base in Springfield, according to CNN affiliate WGGB.

That sentiment was echoed by Springfield’s mayor, who said his city’s and Massachusetts’ skilled and educated workforce measured up favorably against those in Mississippi and other states.

“Smith & Wesson is not going anywhere,” Mayor Dominic Sarno told WGGB, adding he still stands by his support for “sensible gun control.” “They’ve been a vital and good corporate citizen here in the city of Springfield.”"

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/13/mo-gov-signs-gun-safety-course-for-first-graders/,2013-07-13 00:00:00,[],Missouri gov. signs gun-safety course for first-graders,"Missouri schools will be encouraged to teach first-graders a gun safety course sponsored by the National Rifle Association as a result of legislation signed Friday by Gov. Jay Nixon.

The new law stops short of requiring schools to teach the Eddie Eagle Gunsafe Program. But by putting it in state law, Missouri is providing one of the stronger state-sanctioned endorsements of the NRA-sponsored firearms safety course, which the group says is taught to about 1 million children annually.

The legislation also requires school personnel to participate in an “active shooter and intruder” drill led by law enforcement officers.

Both the staff and student training initially were proposed as mandates when the legislation was filed on Dec. 13, which was the day before a gunman massacred 26 people in a Connecticut elementary school, including 20 first-graders. The provision about the first-grade gun-safety course was amended to make it optional during Senate debate.

The legislation also transfers the responsibility for issuing identification cards for concealed gun permits from driver’s license clerks to local sheriffs. That change was prompted by concerns that the state licensing agency’s procedures had infringed on people’s privacy rights.

Nixon noted the change in concealed carry permits — not the school gun-safety programs — while announcing he was signing the legislation. Asked if he supported the NRA’s gun safety course for first-graders, Nixon merely noted that it was optional.

“Allowing the local school districts to make those choices is appropriate,” he said.

The legislation was one of several pro-gun measures passed this year by Missouri’s Republican-led Legislature.

Nixon, a Democrat, vetoed a bill last week that would have allowed federal agents to be charged with state crimes for trying to enforce various federal gun control laws. The vetoed bill also could have landed Missouri journalists in jail for publishing the names of gun owners and would have let specially trained teachers and administrators carry concealed guns into schools.

But Nixon signed a less aggressive gun-rights bill last week, which allows state employees to keep firearms in their vehicles and fire chiefs to get local approval to carry concealed guns.

According to the NRA, more than 20 state legislatures have passed measures encouraging the use of its Eddie Eagle course in schools since the gun safety program began in 1988. Ohio became the first state to provide financing for it about a decade ago. But Missouri is among just a few states — including North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia — to endorse the program with state laws.

The program includes a video in which an eagle character teaches children four basic rules if they see a gun: “STOP! Don’t touch. Leave the Area. Tell an Adult.”

“It’s teaching a great safety message to children that could possibly save their life,” said Eric Lipp, the NRA’s national manager of community outreach.

In many cases, Lipp said, the course is taught by police serving as school resources offices and the materials are provided for free by the NRA. He estimated that the program has been used in thousands of schools.

Some of Missouri’s school teacher and administrator groups took no position on the legislation, largely because it’s merely optional. It was unclear how many Missouri schools already are using the program, or whether the official allowance for it in state law will encourage more to do so.

“How many districts will do this is anyone’s guess,” said Brent Ghan, a spokesman for the Missouri School Boards’ Association."

By Tom Brown

MIAMI, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Florida lawmakers will hold hearings this fall on the state's ""Stand Your Ground"" self-defense law, which has become a lightning rod for criticism following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.

The announcement on Friday by Will Weatherford, the speaker of Florida's House of Representatives, marked the biggest concession yet by the state's Republican leaders to protesters' demands for a top-to-bottom review of the law, which allows people in fear of serious injury to use deadly force to defend themselves rather than retreat.

Since Zimmerman's acquittal on July 13, Martin's grieving parents, backed by African-American civic leaders, celebrities, students and political figures, including President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, have all said the Stand Your Ground law needs to be re-examined.

Weatherford, in an opinion column published in the Tampa Tribune, said he had asked Representative Matt Gaetz, a fellow Republican who chairs the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee, to lead the hearings. Weatherford did not set a date for the hearings or say how long they would last.

""Across Florida, representatives are receiving calls, letters, visits and emails from constituents with diverse opinions on 'Stand Your Ground,'"" Weatherford said. ""Passions are high, but every person has the right to express their views on this matter of great importance.""

""It's a critical step,"" said Phillip Agnew, who heads a group of young demonstrators calling themselves the Dream Defenders who have staged a nearly month-long sit-in outside Governor Rick Scott's office in a bid to change the law. ""We're excited about having an open debate,"" he told Reuters.

Advocates of the law, the first of its kind in the country and now copied in more than 20 other states, say violent crime has fallen since it was enacted.

But critics see the self-defense law as emblematic of racial bias and unequal justice in America, since some studies have shown that defense claims made under the law are far more likely to be successful when the victim is black.

Two of the six jurors in the Zimmerman case have said the Stand Your Ground law left them with no option but to acquit him.

""Our evaluation of its (the law's) effectiveness should be guided by objective information, not by political expediency,"" Weatherford wrote.

""Does the law keep the innocent safer? Is it being applied fairly? Are there ways we can make this law clearer and more understandable?"" he asked.

Most U.S. voters support the ""Stand Your Ground"" laws, although the question of whether to retreat or use deadly force in self defense divides Americans along gender, racial and political lines, a national Quinnipiac University poll found on Friday.

The poll found that a strong majority of white voters and men support the laws, while black voters generally oppose them and women are almost evenly divided. (Reporting by Tom Brown; additional reporting by Bill Cotterell editing by Jackie Frank)"

Biden said the issue of gun violence is one “that requires immediate action,” and the president and he were “determined to take action.”

“I want to make clear that we’re not going to get caught up in the notion that, unless we can do everything, were going to do nothing,” Biden told reporters before a meeting with gun safety advocates and victims of gun violence. “The president is going to act,” he said, adding the White House has determined that “executive action can be taken.”

As a practical matter, Biden’s comments reflect the political reality in the House of Representatives, controlled by Republicans who have been resistant to new restrictions on guns. Even in the Senate, Democrats are shy of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. And a number of the 53 Democrats there may face difficult reelection fights in 2014, in which pro-gun groups such as the National Rifle Assn. may exert their political muscle.

Biden did not specify what executive actions might be on the table, saying they still were being reviewed.

After the Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting, the administration pointed to some “common-sense efforts” it had already implemented using executive authority, primarily through improvements to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

Biden’s recommendations will no doubt still include legislative prescriptions, though. The president has indicated he is prepared to use the bully pulpit as he begins his second term to push for congressional action, and reform advocates are also mobilizing independently of the White House.

Actions are also possible at the state level. Gov. Jack Markell (D) of Delaware, chairman of the National Governors Assn., said at an event in Washington on Wednesday he would be introducing legislation in a matter of days addressing three components: access to mental health treatment, school security and access to guns.

In his state of the state address Wednesday, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy (D) promised “to make specific, actionable recommendations in the areas of school safety, mental health services and gun violence prevention.” But he noted that state action had its limits.

“This conversation must take place nationally. As long as weapons continue to travel up and down I-95, what is available for sale in Florida can have devastating consequences here in Connecticut,” he said.

The NGA as a group was unlikely to take an official position. “Each state is different. Each state has its unique needs,” said Gov. Mary Fallin (R-Okla.), the NGA vice chair.

“If all you’re going to do is legislate on guns, then you’re not dealing with the whole issue,” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) said on MSNBC. “You’ve got to do some stuff on guns, but you also have to deal with mental health, and substance abuse. Because if you don’t, then all you’re doing is being political.”

Biden was to hold a conference call Wednesday afternoon with a group of governors. Markell said one area that states may be drawn into the administration’s recommendations is in opening access to state mental health databases.

The vice president is also meeting this week with gun ownership groups, including the NRA, as well as manufacturers of video games and representatives of the entertainment industry.

The White House says Biden will be making recommendations to the president soon after the conclusion of his meetings. The U.S. Conference of Mayors, members of which have been at the forefront of the gun issue, announced Wednesday that Biden will be addressing the group at its convention in Washington on Jan. 17.

The group also spent $500,000 on Wednesday alone, on an advertising campaign criticizing “Obama’s gun ban” and using Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a deep-pocketed gun control advocate, as a foil. “Tell your senator to listen to America’s police instead of listening to Obama and Bloomberg,” the ad said.

The action on Wednesday was initially supposed to be only the first series of votes in a debate to take days if not weeks. But as the measures’ chances faded this week, Senate leaders decided to rush the process, reaching a bipartisan agreement to hold nine votes in succession, each with a 60-vote threshold for passage.

Using the 60-vote hurdle so early in the process allowed Democrats to prevent the passage of an amendment mandating that any state with a concealed-weapons law, no matter how rigorous, would have to recognize the concealed-weapons permit of residents from any other state. The amendment received 57 votes in favor, including those of 12 Democrats, and 43 votes against.

Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, a lifelong backer of the N.R.A. who also pushed for new restrictions in recent weeks, made one last plea for his amendment, which would extend background checks to Internet and gun show sales. While acknowledging that “the politics are risky,” he said it was “a defining time in politics, where you know the facts are on your side.”

The bipartisan measure, which had appeared to have a strong chance of passage, received 55 votes before Mr. Reid changed his vote to “no” to preserve the parliamentary right to bring the measure up again. Four Republicans voted “yes”: Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, a co-author of the legislation; John McCain of Arizona; Mark Steven Kirk of Illinois; and Susan Collins of Maine. An equal number of Democrats voted “no”: Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Max Baucus of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. All are from states that Mr. Obama lost by wide margins last fall, and all but Ms. Heitkamp face difficult re-election campaigns in 2014.

Debate over the measures consumed the Senate on Wednesday, with speeches from both sides meant to stir emotions. “I choose to vote my conscience,” Mr. Reid said, announcing his decision to vote for the bans on assault weapons and magazines that carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition, “because, if tragedy strikes again — if innocents are gunned down in a classroom or a theater or a restaurant — I could not live with myself as a father, as a husband, as a grandfather or as a friend knowing that I didn’t do everything in my power to prevent it.”

The assault weapons vote was 40 in favor and 60 against. The magazine ban fell with 46 in favor and 54 against."

Shear']",Obama Unveils Proposals for Toughening Laws on Guns,"The White House is planning a multifaceted effort to sell its plans, including speeches around the country by the president and vice president and concerted lobbying by interest groups to influence several dozen lawmakers from both parties seen as critical to passage. The White House created a Web page with video testimonials from victims of gun violence and a sign-up for supporters to help advocate the president’s plan.

“I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it,” Mr. Obama said. “And, by the way, that doesn’t just mean from certain parts of the country. We’re going to need voices in those areas, in those Congressional districts where the tradition of gun ownership is strong, to speak up and to say this is important. It can’t just be the usual suspects.”

The N.R.A. made clear that it was ready for a fight. Even before the president’s speech, it broadcast a provocative video calling Mr. Obama an “elitist hypocrite” for opposing more armed guards in schools while his daughters had Secret Service protection. After the speech the group said it would work to secure schools, fix the mental health system and prosecute criminals but criticized the president’s other proposals. “Attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation,” the N.R.A. said in a statement. “Only honest, law-abiding gun owners will be affected, and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy.”

Mr. Obama’s plan included 4 major legislative proposals and 23 executive actions that he initiated on his own authority to bolster enforcement of existing laws, improve the nation’s database used for background checks and otherwise make it harder for criminals and people with mental illness to get guns.

Mr. Obama asked Congress to reinstate and strengthen a ban on the sale and production of assault weapons that passed in 1994 and expired in 2004. He also called for a ban on the sale and production of magazines with more than 10 rounds, like those used in Newtown and other mass shootings. Mr. Obama’s plan would require criminal background checks for all gun sales, closing the longstanding loophole that allows buyers to avoid screening by purchasing weapons from unlicensed sellers at gun shows or in private sales. Nearly 40 percent of all gun sales are exempt from the system."

Struggling to maintain her composure, Francine Wheeler spoke of her 6-year-old son, Ben, who was killed on Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School, as President Obama took the unusual step of letting someone else deliver the White House’s weekly address.“I’ve heard people say that the tidal wave of anguish our country felt on 12/14 has receded — but not for us,” Ms. Wheeler said with her husband, David, by her side. “To us, it feels as if it happened just yesterday. And in the four months since we lost our loved ones, thousands of other Americans have died at the end of a gun. Thousands of other families across the United States are also drowning in our grief.”

“Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy,” she said.

The presence on Capitol Hill last week of the families of those killed in Newtown was considered a crucial element in getting the Senate to vote, 68 to 31, to proceed with debate on gun safety proposals. While the families of the 20 children and 6 educators killed do not all support tighter gun restrictions, those in favor of greater control have proved to be some of the most compelling advocates, successfully pushing for new laws in Connecticut.

Mr. Obama, after delivering his own appeal on gun control on Monday in Hartford, gave families a ride to Washington on Air Force One so they could lobby members of Congress. The president “believes their voices and resolve have been critical to the continued progress we’ve seen in the Senate,” Jay Carney, the press secretary, said of the families on Friday."

http://news.yahoo.com/despite-outcry-stand-ground-law-repeals-unlikely-154400836.html,,[],"Despite outcry, stand-ground law repeals unlikely","MIAMI (AP) — Despite an outcry from civil rights groups, a call for close examination by President Barack Obama and even a 1960s-style sit-in at the Florida governor's office, the jury's verdict that George Zimmerman was justified in shooting unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin is unlikely to spur change to any of the nation's stand-your-ground self-defense laws.

""I support stand your ground,"" Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said last week.

""I do not see any reason to change it,"" said Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, also a Republican.

At least 21 states have laws similar to that in Florida, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Many are conservative and lean toward laws that defend gun owners' rights. So far, there does not appear to be an appetite in Florida or other states to repeal or change the laws, which generally eliminate a person's duty to retreat in the face of a serious physical threat. In fact, some states are moving in the opposite direction.

""The debate about stand-your-ground laws largely reproduces existing divisions in American politics, particularly between blacks and whites and between Democrats and Republicans,"" said John Sides, associate professor of political science at George Washington University.

Zimmerman, a 29-year-old former neighborhood watch volunteer, was acquitted this month of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the 2012 shooting of 17-year-old Martin in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman told police he shot Martin only after the African-American teenager physically attacked him; Martin's family and supporters say Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, racially profiled Martin as a potential criminal and wrongly followed him.

Zimmerman's lawyers decided not to pursue a pretrial immunity hearing allowed by Florida's stand-your-ground law. But jurors were told in final instructions by Circuit Judge Debra Nelson that they should acquit Zimmerman if they found ""he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary.""

Story continues

Before the stand-your-ground law was passed in 2005, the instruction would have read that Zimmerman ""cannot justify his use of force likely to cause death or great bodily harm if by retreating he could have avoided the need to use that force.""

Since the law was enacted, justifiable homicides in Florida have risen from an annual average of 13.2 between 2001 and 2005 to an average of 42 between 2006 and 2012, including a record 66 in 2012, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. FBI data have shown similar increases in some states that enacted similar laws, such as Texas, while others haven't seen an uptick.

Beyond Florida, these states have some form of a stand-your-ground law, according to the national group: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.

Attorney General Eric Holder, in a speech last week to the NAACP convention in Orlando, said the Martin shooting demonstrates a need to re-examine stand-your-ground laws nationwide. He said they ""senselessly expand the concept of self-defense"" and increase the possibility of deadly confrontations.

On Friday, Obama said the nation needed to do some ""soul-searching."" He questioned whether a law could really promote peace and security if it sent a message that someone who is armed ""has the right to use those firearms even if there is a way for them to exit from a situation.""

Civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, said they would push for repeal of the laws, starting in Florida, where a group of young protesters occupied GOP Gov. Rick Scott's office demanding change.

""If we can do it in Florida, we can affect other states,"" Sharpton said last week.

On Saturday, Sharpton's National Action Network organized ""Justice for Trayvon"" rallies in more than 100 cities. In addition to pushing for federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman, the rallies attacked stand-your-ground laws.

""By standing his ground, George Zimmerman was able to get away with murdering a 17-year-old black man,"" said Chelsea Jones, a student who spoke at a Dallas rally. ""I can only imagine what the black community can achieve by standing their ground.""

Even entertainer Stevie Wonder has joined the outcry, vowing not to perform in Florida as long as stand-your-ground remains on the books. Sharpton suggested that the law's opponents might boycott Florida orange juice, and other groups want a boycott on the state's tourist destinations, both multibillion-dollar industries.

Florida state Sen. Chris Smith, a Fort Lauderdale Democrat, said the Zimmerman verdict was a ""wakeup call"" that should at least open fresh debate on stand-your-ground laws.

He noted that in the wake of the 2011 acquittal of Casey Anthony in the killing of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, Florida lawmakers passed legislation making it a felony for a parent or guardian to fail to report a missing child within 36 hours. Caylee's disappearance was not reported for 31 days.

""We are calling for the same type of action,"" Smith said.

But The Associated Press has found scant support for repeal of the laws in Florida and elsewhere. Scott told reporters Thursday that he agreed with the findings of a task force he appointed on the subject after Martin's shooting, which recommended no changes to the stand-your-ground law. Of the protesters in his Capitol office, Scott said, ""I think it is great that people are exercising their voices.""

After Holder's speech, the National Rifle Association, which strongly backs stand-your-ground laws and holds great sway in many state legislatures, issued a statement claiming that Obama's administration was aiming more at the broader political goal of restricting gun rights.

""The attorney general fails to understand that self-defense is not a concept, it's a fundamental human right,"" said Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action. ""To send a message that legitimate self-defense is to blame is unconscionable.""

In fact, in states with stand-your-ground laws similar to Florida's, the trend has been toward greater gun rights. In Oklahoma, for example, lawmakers in 2012 passed an ""open-carry"" measure that allows people with a concealed carry permit to now display their handguns openly in a holster. Other states have sought to expand what are known as ""castle doctrine"" laws — the right to defend one's self with deadly force in the home — to apply to businesses.

New Hampshire lawmakers this year considered repealing the state's-stand-your ground law, which was enacted in 2011 by a Republican Legislature over a Democratic governor's veto. After narrowly passing the Democratic-led House in March, the bill died in the Republican-led Senate.

Holder also announced this week that the Justice Department would investigate whether Zimmerman could be charged under federal civil rights laws, which would require evidence that he harbored racial animosity against Martin. Most legal experts say that will be a difficult charge to bring, leaving Martin's supporters to concentrate on trying to change stand-your-ground laws.

Republican Sen. John McCain joined the call on stand-your-ground laws Sunday, urging state legislatures to review their statutes — including the one in his home state of Arizona.

""I'm confident that the members of the Arizona legislature will ... because it is a very controversial legislation,"" he said on CNN.

Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, appeared Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and called the laws ""one of the things that has incited and ignited, I believe, this movement across the nation, which I think is the beginning of a new civil rights movement.""

Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said during the show that the question now is whether it's proper for the federal government to tell states with stand-your-ground laws how to change or remake them. His answer: ""No. I mean, this is something that's going to have to be worked out state by state.""

Charles Ogletree, a Harvard Law School professor who taught both Barack and Michelle Obama, agreed: ""The reality is that this is not a federal issue. This is a state issue.""

Pollak'],Obama Throws Tantrum over Gun Control Defeat,"President Barack Obama lashed out defiantly and viciously at political opponents who defeated his efforts to expand federal gun regulations today. Standing with families of victims of the Newtown school shooting at the White House, the president claimed that opponents of expanded federal background checks had “no coherent arguments” for their position, and that the “gun lobby” had “willfully lied” in the course of the debate.

Ironically, while accusing others of lying, President Obama resorted to false claims and statistics about current laws, including the repeatedly debunked argument that 40% of gun sales are private, and that guns can be bought over the Internet without background checks. It was partly the dishonesty of those very arguments that had led potential supporters of new bipartisan legislation to doubt the administration’s motives in supporting the bill.

The administration’s defeat came earlier Wednesday, when the Senate failed to pass a cloture motion to end debate on a bipartisan proposal introduced by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). Only 54 votes of the necessary 60 votes could be found to support an expanded federal background check system (among other changes), partly because of fears that extending such checks would require the creation of a federal gun registry that could lead to confiscation.

The failure brought an end to four months of fervent campaigning by the president during which he used the Newtown disaster–or, in the eyes of many critics, exploited it–to make an argument about the urgent need for new laws, even if such laws would not have prevented the Newtown atrocity itself. Many Democrats rallied behind him, hoping at first to pass a new assault weapons ban, then abandoning that effort for more modest regulations.

Along the way, the administration lost the support of Democratic Senators in conservative states, many of whom will face re-election in 2014. President Obama made clear his intention to use Wednesday’s defeat to rally supporters against Republicans, whom he blamed directly and angrily, suggesting that they had defied the will of the American people and attempted to silence the families of Newtown victims who had a “right” to be heard in the debate.

Forced to cover a rare political defeat for the president, the mainstream media largely echoed his emotions. Virtually all of CNN’s correspondents agreed that the Manchin-Toomey bill had been defeated because of the power of the National Rifle Association and the fear of politicians afraid to take on Second Amendment activists. None considered that support for gun control has been declining, or that the legislation itself was deeply flawed.

Again and again, President Obama noted that 90% of Americans, and a majority of National Rifle Association members, supported expanded background checks. The former constitutional law lecturer seemed to expect that that majority’s will should be self-executing, ignoring the fact that constitutional rights like the Second Amendment exist precisely to protect minorities against majoritarian passions and presidential demagoguery.

Indeed, while the president described the failure of the legislation as a failure of “Washington,” it was also–and primarily–a failure of his administration. A White House operation and Obama campaign apparatus that is regarded as brutally effective ought to have been able to sell a proposal allegedly supported by 90% of the voting public. Yet persistent troubles in execution and failures of policy raise questions about whether Obama secretly preferred failure to success.

His opponents, the president insisted, refused to make it more difficult for “dangerous criminals” to buy weapons–ignoring one of the core arguments of the other side, namely that dangerous criminals frequently ignore the law to obtain weapons, while law-abiding citizens bear the burden of new rules and restrictions. He reduced his opponents’ motives to pure politics, accusing them of being afraid of being punished by an organized, determined minority.

Rarely have Americans ever seen a president attack his opponents so viciously, expressing and evoking such visceral emotions–especially at a time of mourning. President Obama’s tirade contrasted with his reserved, measured response to the Boston Marathon bombings, in which he urged Americans to speak and act with restraint. If this has been, as he claimed, “a pretty shameful day in Washington,” the president’s tantrum was the most shameful moment of all."

Story highlights NEW: Sen. Manchin says a vote on background checks unlikely until later in the week A compromise amendment on background checks comes up this week Republicans who voted to open debate may not support the bill Debate on the overall gun package is expected to last two weeks

(CNN) —

A compromise proposal to expand background checks on gun sales lacks enough support to win Senate approval now, which will likely delay a vote on the measure that has strong public support, one of the sponsors told CNN on Monday.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, acknowledged the vote on the amendment he worked out with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania was being pushed back to try to build more support.

Asked if the vote would take place Tuesday or Wednesday, as supporters had hoped, Manchin said he didn’t think so.

“I would say by the end of the week, probably,” he added.

The Manchin-Toomey compromise had been scheduled as the first amendment to be considered as part of gun legislation pushed by President Barack Obama and Democrats in the aftermath of the Newtown school massacre in December.

Last week, the broader gun package received 68 votes, including 16 from Republicans, to bring it to the Senate floor.

Before discussion on the legislation began Monday, Manchin told CNN there was more work to do.

“We’ve got to work hard and the more people know about the bill, the more people read the bill, the more people see the facts of the bill, it breaks down all the misnomers,” he said of what he called misinformation about the background check proposal being spread by opponents.

Both Manchin and Toomey are self-professed gun lovers who have gotten high marks from the powerful National Rifle Association for their voting records on firearms issues.

However, the NRA opposes their compromise, casting doubt on whether it can get the 60 Senate votes necessary to pass under the filibuster threshold imposed by Republicans.

Far fewer Republicans than the 16 who voted last week to open debate are committed to backing the Manchin-Toomey amendment or supporting the final gun package.

So far, four GOP senators have declared they will support the Manchin-Toomey compromise or were leaning toward backing it.

With at least two moderate Democrats from pro-gun states known to oppose the measure, it needs at least seven GOP votes to have any chance of passing.

Gun rights group endorses background check deal

The amendment will be one of perhaps dozens to be debated on the broader package of gun laws drafted in response to the killing of 20 first-graders and six educators at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.

The package also contains measures to crack down on gun trafficking and straw purchases, and to find ways to improve school safety.

On Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney sought to keep up the pressure on senators to approve the expanded background checks, noting polls show about 90% of Americans support such a move.

“If they vote no, they will be siding with the 10% and not the 90% in the United States that support background check legislation,” Carney told reporters.

In debate expected to last two weeks, senators will consider efforts by both sides to either expand or weaken the gun package.

Republican Sen. Collins will support Manchin-Toomey gun compromise

A push by Democrats for an updated ban on semiautomatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons, as well as limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, is expected to fail.

Republicans will push an NRA proposal to make state concealed weapons permits acceptable nationwide, a concept opposed by many Democrats.

Since the Newtown attack by a lone gunman, Connecticut and a few other states have passed tougher gun laws.

While polls show Americans favoring expanded background checks and other proposals intended to crack down on gun trafficking, more pro-gun states have passed laws easing firearms restrictions.

In addition, the NRA has promised political retribution for legislators who back measures it opposes.

“This debate in some ways is underscoring just the extent to which there is a polarization in our society,” Toomey told CNN on Sunday, lamenting “the acrimony that has gotten into politics.”

Asked if he was concerned about political repercussions, the conservative Republican said: “I’ll just let the political chips fall the way they fall.”

In a separate interview on CBS, Manchin acknowledged the power of the NRA, saying: “They won’t be with us on this and I just would hope that they would allow their members to see the facts and let them vote their conscience.”

Both senators said Monday that part of the problem involves misconceptions about their compromise, and they urged colleagues to read the 49-page measure instead of relying on what they called erroneous political rhetoric by opponents.

Their amendment expands background checks to gun shows and all Internet sales, but exempts private transactions such as hunting rifles traded among family and friends.

Co-author of gun compromise says Senate support an ‘open question’

It also makes it easier for hunters and sport shooters to transport their firearms across state lines. It would also require states and the federal government to provide records on criminals and the “violently mentally ill” to the national background check system, addressing a criticism by the NRA and other opponents of gun laws that the existing system lacks substantive information.

In addition, the plan calls for a new National Commission on Mass Violence to report in six months on “all aspects of the problem, including guns, school safety, mental health, and violent media or video games.”

The NRA opposes the compromise as a possible first step toward a national gun registry and therefore a violation of the constitutional right to bear arms.

However, smaller pro-gun groups have come out in favor of the Manchin-Toomey amendment, indicating a rift in the gun lobby over the emotional issue of taking legislative action in response to the Newtown killings.

Manchin said Monday he was reaching out to senators who voted last week against beginning debate on guns.

“We’re working on all of them. Some of them who might not have voted for cloture might be more receptive once they see the facts,” he said. “Now that we have gun groups coming out in support, it really helps us.”

Manchin and Toomey noted Monday that their proposal includes a specific prohibition against a national gun registry as well as criminal penalties for misusing background check information for that purpose.

In a statement on Sunday, moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she would support the compromise because it exempted private family gun transactions from needing a background check, calling it a “commonsense approach” that required the screening only for commercial transactions.

No sense of urgency: Rocky road ahead for gun legislation in the House

Even if the compromise passes and the Senate proceeds to approve a broader gun package, it was unclear if the Republican-led House would go along.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has stopped short of promising a vote, saying only that the chamber would look at whatever the Senate sends over.

Obama has made the gun legislation a major focus of his second term, holding events across the country to push for congressional action and public pressure.

Last weekend, the mother of one of the Newtown schoolchildren killed in December delivered the weekly presidential address instead of Obama.

Francine Wheeler, whose 6-year-old son Ben died in the attack by a lone gunman, noted that since the December 14 killings, “thousands of other Americans have died at the end of a gun.”

“Thousands of other families across the United States are also drowning in our grief,” Wheeler said. “Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy.”

The issue has raised attention on overall gun deaths in the country, with supporters of tougher gun laws noting that more than half all homicides involve firearms and U.S. levels are higher than other countries.

On Saturday night, a man shot himself to death during a NASCAR event sponsored by the NRA in Texas.

It’s always the weapon and never the shooter. Twelve people are murdered in a rampage at the Washington Navy Yard, and before sundown Sen. Dianne Feinstein has called for yet another debate on gun violence. Major opprobrium is heaped on the AR-15, the semiautomatic used in the Newtown massacre.

Turns out no AR-15 was used at the Navy Yard. And the shotgun that was used was obtained legally in Virginia after the buyer, Aaron Alexis, had passed both a state and federal background check.

As was the case in the Tucson shooting — instantly politicized into a gun-control and (fabricated) tea-party-climate-of-violence issue — the origin of this crime lies not in any politically expedient externality but in the nature of the shooter.

On Aug. 7, that same Alexis had called police from a Newport, R.I., Marriott. He was hearing voices. Three people were following him, he told the cops. They were sending microwaves through walls, making his skin vibrate and preventing him from sleeping. He had already twice changed hotels to escape the men, the radiation, the voices.

Delusions, paranoid ideation, auditory (and somatic) hallucinations: the classic symptoms of schizophrenia.

So here is this panic-stricken soul, psychotic and in terrible distress. And what does modern policing do for him? The cops tell him to “stay away from the individuals that are following him.” Then they leave.

But the three “individuals” were imaginary, for God’s sake. This is how a civilized society deals with a man in such a state of terror?

Had this happened 35 years ago in Boston, Alexis would have been brought to me as the psychiatrist on duty at the emergency room of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Were he as agitated and distressed as in the police report, I probably would have administered an immediate dose of Haldol, the most powerful fast-acting antipsychotic of the time.

This would generally have relieved the hallucinations and delusions, a blessing not only in itself, but also for the lucidity brought on that would have allowed him to give us important diagnostic details — psychiatric history, family history, social history, medical history, etc. If I had thought he could be sufficiently cared for by family or friends to receive regular oral medication, therapy and follow-up, I would have discharged him. Otherwise, I’d have admitted him. And if he refused, I’d have ordered a 14-day involuntary commitment.

Sounds cruel? On the contrary. For many people living on park benches, commitment means a warm bed, shelter and three hot meals a day. For Alexis, it would have meant the beginning of a treatment regimen designed to bring him back to himself before discharging him to a world heretofore madly radioactive.

That’s what a compassionate society does. It would no more abandon this man to fend for himself than it would a man suffering a stroke. And as a side effect, that compassion might even extend to potential victims of his psychosis — in the event, remote but real, that he might someday burst into some place of work and kill 12 innocent people.

Instead, what happened? The Newport police sent their report to the local naval station, where it promptly disappeared into the ether. Alexis subsequently twice visited VA hospital ERs, but without any florid symptoms of psychosis and complaining only of sleeplessness, the diagnosis was missed. (He was given a sleep medication.) He fell back through the cracks.

True, psychiatric care is underfunded and often scarce. But Alexis had full access to the VA system. The problem here was not fiscal but political and, yes, even moral.

I know the civil libertarian arguments. I know that involuntary commitment is outright paternalism. But paternalism is essential for children because they don’t have a fully developed rational will. Do you think Alexis was in command of his will that night in Newport?

We cannot, of course, be cavalier about commitment. We should have layers of review, albeit rapid. But it’s both cruel and reckless to turn loose people as lost and profoundly suffering as Alexis, even apart from any potential dangerousness.

More than half of those you see sleeping on grates have suffered mental illness. It’s a national scandal. It’s time we recalibrated the pendulum that today allows the mentally ill to die with their rights on — and, rarely but unforgivably, take a dozen innocents with them.

The House voted in favor of a bill that would seek to block the federal government from restricting assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. It amended the bill to specify that federal officials who tried to enforce any ban would be subject to state misdemeanor charges instead of felony charges.

President Obama has called for reinstituting a federal assault weapons ban following the massacre of 20 Connecticut first-graders by a gunman last month.

The House on Wednesday also gave preliminary approval to a bill that would allow citizens who hold concealed carry permits to carry guns on campuses of public schools, colleges and the University of Wyoming.

Rep. Kendell Kroeker, R-Evansville, sponsored the bill to exempt assault rifles and magazines from federal control. He said Wyoming should get its position on record before a new federal ban comes down.

""It is clearly a different case than trying to nullify something that's already in existence,"" Kroeker said.

Rep. Mary Throne, a Democrat and attorney in Cheyenne, said some states have tried such nullification laws in the past. She said such efforts were common in the years before the civil war and then during the civil rights movement, when some segregationist states tried to ignore federal law and practice nullification of federal laws.

""If we want to make a statement we can do it, but let's not let's not pretend that it's consistent with the Constitution, because it's not,"" Throne said.

The non-partisan Legislative Service Office has issued a legal analysis of Kroeker's bill that notes the U.S. Supreme Court recognizes federal laws as the supreme law of the land.

Rep. Allen Jaggi, R-Lyman, sponsored the bill to allow people who hold state-issued concealed carry permits to carry guns on school campuses. A retired teacher, he said he worries about the safety of schools in the state, noting that they're currently classified as gun-free zones under state law.

""Most of the horrific accidents that we've heard about have happened in gun-free zones, and the bad guys really don't care what the laws are,"" Jaggi said. ""I'm a law-abiding guy, and if that's the law, I won't carry where I'm not supposed to carry. But the bad guys don't have that thought, they just want to do whatever they want to do.""

Rep. Jerry Paxton, R-Encampment, said that as a former school principal he had serious concerns about the including elementary and secondary school provision in this bill. ""I certainly don't want to get into a situation where we're creating a killing field inside of a school, but I think this bill creates the opportunity for many, many different things that could happen that would endanger kids.""

Paxton said he could see where a student could get ahold of a firearm inadvertently if a teacher forgot to lock a drawer.

Rep. Stephen Watt, R-Rock Springs, said school administrators don't currently know if guns are coming into their schools or who has them.

""Someone who wants to bring a gun into a school will do it, and if they want to use it for evil, they'll use it for evil,"" Watt said. ""It's that simple.""

Chris Boswell, lobbyist for the University of Wyoming, said after the House vote that the university administration is concerned about the prospect of losing its authority to maintain its current policy of prohibiting students from carrying weapons either openly or concealed.

""I believe the trustees, through the regulation, have indicated that the risks may outweigh the benefits of allowing guns to be carried on the university campus,"" Boswell said, adding that the university has a police force."

(CNN) - For the first time in his White House tenure, President Barack Obama handed the weekly address to someone outside his administration.

He stepped aside so a mother who lost her son in the Newtown school massacre could press Congress to act on new measure tightening access to guns.



“As you’ve probably noticed, I’m not the president. I’m just a citizen. And as a citizen, I’m here at the White House today because I want to make a difference and I hope you will join me,” said Francine Wheeler, whose son Ben, 6, was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December.

“I’ve heard people say that the tidal wave of anguish our country felt on 12/14 has receded,” Wheeler continued, referring to the day of the Newtown shooting. “But not for us. To us, it feels as if it happened just yesterday. And in the four months since we lost our loved ones, thousands of other Americans have died at the end of a gun. Thousands of other families across the United States are also drowning in our grief. Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy.”

White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Friday that Obama asked Wheeler to tape the address, which is heard on radio and seen on the Internet.

In an email from the White House on Saturday, Obama wrote he takes the address ""very seriously because it offers a chance to bring focus to an issue that needs to be part of the national dialogue.""

Wheeler and other families who lost loved ones at Sandy Hook have been in Washington this week to lobby Congress for passage of gun legislation that would expand background checks and take other steps designed to curb gun violence.

“We have to convince the Senate to come together and pass commonsense gun responsibility reforms that will make our communities safer and prevent more tragedies like the one we never thought would happen to us,” Wheeler said, noting that earlier this week it appeared gun control measures would stall in the Senate.

“Then, after the president spoke in Hartford, and a dozen of us met with senators to share our stories, more than two-thirds of the Senate voted to move forward,” she said, referring to Thursday’s Senate action that paved the way for debate on new gun laws.

“But that’s only the start,” she cautioned. “They haven’t yet passed any bills that will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. And a lot of people are fighting to make sure they never do.”

Carney told reporters the president believed the Newtown families in Washington have been “critical to the continued progress we've seen in the Senate.""

A senior Obama administration official told CNN Wheeler wrote the remarks with her husband, and taped the address in the library at the White House on Friday morning. The address features only Wheeler and her husband David on camera.

This is the first time someone other than the president or vice president in this administration has delivered the weekly presidential address, Carney said Friday.

CNN found one instance in the George W. Bush administration when first lady Laura Bush delivered the address on the Taliban oppression of women and children in Afghanistan.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt originated the practice of delivering radio addresses on current issues, which was renewed by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. All succeeding presidents have followed the tradition."
http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/bloomberg-nra-guns-assault-weapons-ban-173107813.html,,[],Bloomberg launches $12M ad assault on guns,"New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and National Rifle Association chief Wayne LaPierre squared off on Sunday's ""Meet The Press"" over the assault weapons ban being debated in Congress.

""I don't think there's ever been an issue where the public has spoken so clearly, where Congress hasn't eventually understood and done the right thing,"" Bloomberg, who has become one of the most vocal gun control advocates in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., school shootings, said in a taped interview with NBC's David Gregory.

""We are going to have a vote for sure on assault weapons and we're going to have a vote on background checks,"" Bloomberg continued. ""And if we were to get background checks only, it wouldn't be as good as if we got both, but we demanded a plan and then we demanded a vote. We've got the plan, we're going to get the vote. And now it's incumbent on us to make our voices heard.""

To do so, the billionaire mayor said he's spending $12 million on an advertising campaign—set to launch in 10 states on Monday—that touts tougher gun laws.

""I think I have a responsibility, and I think you and all of your viewers have responsibilities, to try to make this country safer for our families and for each other,"" he said. ""And if I can do that by spending some money and taking the NRA from being the only voice to being one of the voices, so the public can really understand the issues, then I think my money would be well spent, and I think I have an obligation to do that.""

LaPierre says Bloomberg would be better off spending his money elsewhere.

""He's going to find out this is a country of the people, by the people and for the people,"" LaPierre told Gregory. ""And he can't spend enough of his $27 billion to try to impose his will on the American public. They don't want him in their restaurants, they don't want him in their homes. They don't want him telling them what food to eat; they sure don't want him telling them what self-defense firearms to own. And he can't buy America.""

[Related: NRA's LaPierre slams critics of school gun plan]

The NRA chief criticized the gun control legislation currently on Capitol Hill, calling the proposed universal background checks a ""speed bump"" for law-abiding gun owners.

""The whole thing, universal checks, is a dishonest premise. There's not a bill on the Hill that provides a universal check. Criminals aren't going to be checked,"" LaPierre said. ""The mental health records are not in the system, and they don't prosecute any of the criminals that they catch. ... It slows down the law abiding and does nothing to anybody else.""

LaPierre then reiterated the NRA's post-Newtown plea for armed security officers in every American public school. ""Not a mom or dad wants to drop their kid off at school and leave their kids unprotected."""

Dishonorably discharged soldiers, after all, aren’t allowed to own firearms. Why should dishonored cops?

Like booted officer Christopher Jordan Dorner, who allegedly went on a vengeful killing rampage four years after being fired from the Los Angeles Police Department.

Maybe, at least, Dorner should have been required to undergo psychological testing upon being sacked to determine whether he was mentally fit to own weapons.

True, there may be a constitutional problem with that idea. He’s still a citizen, presumably with a 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms. That doubtless would be the argument of gun-rights groups.

He wasn’t convicted of a crime. If we’re going to confiscate the weapons of an axed cop or subject him to psychological testing, shouldn’t we also take that precaution with, say, a fired fast-food burger-flipper?

Advertisement

Well, no, there’s a difference: We expect and demand more from police, who have been trained at public expense to be expert killers.

But never mind.

Advertisement

Dorner seemingly was law-abiding — until he wasn’t.

And that brings up a larger point: At minimum, he is another example of a so-called law-abiding, innocent gun owner who apparently went berserk and used his arsenal to kill people.

Advertisement

It makes such comments as this one recently uttered by National Rifle Assn. executive Wayne LaPierre look particularly inane and off target: “Law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals.”

News flash: Some law-abiders do become violent criminals. And their kill rate too often increases with their firepower.

Advertisement

Of course, this gets into the whole definition of “law-abiding.” Unfortunately, you don’t need to be exactly law-abiding to legally purchase a gun.

“It’s one of the really pervasive myths,” says Garen Wintemute, director of the UC Davis Violence Prevention Research Program. “If you ask people the question, ‘Can criminals legally buy guns?’ they laugh and say, ‘Of course not.’ But a large segment of the population has a criminal record and can still buy guns.”

Advertisement

Especially under federal law. Less so under California law.

Wintemute, an emergency room doctor who has been researching gun violence for three decades, refers to one category of firearms owner as “not so law-abiding.” These are people who have committed misdemeanors, but still are allowed to own guns.

Advertisement

“Under federal law, if I assault my intimate partner, I’m prohibited [from possessing a gun] for life,” he says. “But I can beat you up and nothing happens. I can have any number of convictions for violent misdemeanors — assault and battery, brandishing a firearm in a threatening way — and can buy as many guns as I want.

“California is different. California almost uniquely bans possession for anyone who has been convicted of a violent misdemeanor.”

Advertisement

A national study of prisoners convicted of a firearms-related felony found that 60% were not legally barred under federal law from owning a gun when they committed their crime, Wintemute says.

If California’s tighter gun-eligibility rules were applied, however, only around a third of the criminals would have been legal gun owners.

Advertisement

Just because the law allows these creeps to keep and bear arms, does that make them “law-abiding?” You might think so by listening to the gun lobby.

But crime records don’t seem to matter to the NRA. It’s fighting expanded background checks that might turn up red flags on gun buyers. Criminals would avoid background checking, LaPierre asserts, and law-abiders would be inconvenienced.

Advertisement

“The evidence is that these people [with criminal records] are a much greater risk for committing a future crime than the truly law-abiding gun owners,” Wintemute says.

“The question for us and the rest of the nation is, are we OK with that?”

Advertisement

Clearly we’re allowing too many people to buy and possess guns — characters who, by almost any logical criteria, should not be armed.

“I grew up around guns,” Wintemute says. “I was a member of the Rifle and Pistol Club at UC Davis. I’m not anti-gun. I’m anti-what guns can do....

Advertisement

“Nobody thinks that any one policy is going to take care of the entire problem. But, for most people, denying a gun purchase works.”

The two most important steps Wintemute would take, he says, would be to prohibit alcohol abusers from owning guns and to confiscate the roughly 39,000 weapons currently possessed by about 20,000 Californians legally barred from holding them.

Advertisement

“It’s a huge gap in our current regulation,” Wintemute says of the liquor laxity. “There is solid evidence — it’s not a matter of dispute — that alcohol abuse is a risk factor for committing violence.”

One bill proposed in the Legislature last week would prohibit gun ownership for anyone convicted twice of driving under the influence.

Advertisement

Another measure, coauthored by Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) and budget Chairman Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) would appropriate the $20-million-plus needed to seize the illegally held weapons.

There was a heavy volley of gun control proposals — some good, some goofy.

Advertisement

The good: Ban possession — not just the sale — of ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds. That probably would necessitate an expensive government buy-back.

Also introduced: A requirement that all new semiautomatic rifles come with fixed magazines. No detachables.

Advertisement

The goofy: Requiring all gun owners to buy liability insurance. A boon for insurers and a ludicrous burden for someone who hasn’t shot grandpa’s old shotgun in 40 years.

But really goofy: The idea that an angry, deeply disturbed fired cop was deemed fit to own guns.

-- Carl Sandburg’s poem “Chicago.”

How tough are Chicago’s gun laws?

A 55-year-old woman who works as a researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago was jailed this week for bringing a pistol -- licensed, unloaded and in a case – to her office.

The woman, who also holds an “Illinois firearm owners registration card,” told Chicago police that she had brought the handgun, recently purchased for home defense, to her workplace because she did not want to leave it at her residence while a work crew was there doing a renovation project.

But Chicago has perhaps the toughest gun laws in the nation and carrying the weapon, even without ammunition, is a serious offense.

A co-worker spotted the pistol case and called police who came and snatched up the information specialist from her workplace. The Chicago Tribune reports that the woman was held on $25,000 bond pending trial and placed on leave by the university.

Not too far away on the city’s West Side, Chicago Police were having less luck in dealing with another crime that day than they did with the case of the pistol packing information specialist.

An unidentified male was found stabbed to death in an alleyway, marking the 50th murder in the city so far this year. The victim was later identified as a 22-year-old from across town in Calumet City, but given the low rate at which the city’s 535 murders last year were solved, it looks unlikely that police will soon be identifying the one who did the stabbing.

President Obama is back in his hometown today to make another pitch for his “cradle to career” educational initiatives. But while he’s in town, the president will surely have to address the murder epidemic that has gripped the city.

It’s not that Chicago rivals murder wastelands like New Orleans or Detroit, but what’s happening is very alarming for locals. While murder rates in the nation continue to decline, Chicago has seen sharp increases. While murder rates in New York dropped to an all time low last year, Chicago was approaching numbers not seen since the crack wars of the early 1990s.

So why is Chicago unraveling while New York is stabilizing? It’s hard to say exactly, but the city’s mayor, a former congressman, a former chief of staff to Obama and a potential future presidential contender, believes he knows. Rahm Emanuel has gone to war on guns.

Emanuel is doing everything he can to get the guns out of his city, taking up the cause with new vigor following the mass shooting in Connecticut last year.

[pullquote]

But as the jailed University of Illinois at Chicago researcher can attest, the gun laws are already pretty darn stiff. Remember, it’s not as if the police discovered the mix up and told her to take her gun home, they took her to jail for having a licensed, registered weapon that without ammunition was only about as deadly as a desktop stapler.

And one could hardly blame her for her recent purchase of the weapon given the deteriorating security situation in her neighborhood and the city at large. It’s not just murders. Shootings, robberies and other crimes are all up in the city, with shopkeepers and homeowners demanding protection.

As for her ignorance of the city’s gun laws, well, one supposes she understands now.

Emanuel urgently needs to stem the crime wave in his city. His political future and the city’s economic fate depend on erasing the growing perception of Chicago returning to its most lawless days, the era of Cabrini-Green and the crack wars. And at the very least he needs to demonstrate that it is gun makers who are more to blame than he, whose mayoralty has coincided with the crime wave.

The question for the president is whether he can make the case that a national gun ban would be effective in reducing murder rates given the results in Chicago.

And Now, A Word From Charles

“This isn't just any new entitlement. It's an entitlement that we know the $7 billion a year that we spend on Head Start doesn't make any difference after the third grade. There is a study that HHS has done that shows that. It's a failure, and yet he wants to double down to make it universal. That is probably a definition of a liberal.”

Minneapolis was nicknamed %27Murder-apolis%27 during the 1990s

Progress Minneapolis has made reducing gun violence caught Obama%27s attention

Still%2C Minneapolis city leaders are working to implement tougher gun laws

MINNEAPOLIS — This city has managed to shed the moniker of ""Murder-apolis,"" the ugly nickname it was tagged with during the worst days of the crack and gang wars of the 1990s, when it had a homicide rate that rivaled New York City.

The progress Minneapolis made reducing gun violence in the past few years has caught the attention of President Obama, who will visit the city Monday for his first trip outside the Beltway to tout his plan to overhaul the nation's gun laws.

Even as Minneapolis is being held up by the White House as a community that's been ahead of the curve in pushing the conversation on gun violence, city leaders here are clamoring for Congress and state lawmakers to implement tougher gun laws. They say it is a necessity to further reduce the epidemic of gun violence in their city.

""We have done so much, and we're committed to doing more,"" said Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, a Democrat. ""But there is also only so much you can do at this level to prevent illegal guns from getting into the hands of kids, the mentally ill and people who shouldn't have them.""

The White House has praised Minneapolis for a youth violence initiative the city launched in 2008 that has had success. And a bipartisan push by sheriffs in Minnesota to improve the state's background check system for gun buyers — including speeding up the input of felony and drug convictions, along with mental-health court orders — has also piqued administration interest.

""If you want to get right down to it, we have an access problem,"" said Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek, a Republican who is backing the push for bolstering background checks. ""Those who should not have guns is what we should focus on.""

The president's visit comes as the Democratic Farm Labor-controlled state Legislature begins debate this week on a slew of proposals to change gun regulations, including bills calling for a statewide ban on assault weapons and a limit on the size of ammunition clips.

Those proposals mirror some of what Obama wants to do on the federal level. Backers of the gun control proposals face stiff opposition from some state lawmakers in rural areas as well as gun owner groups.

Joe Olson, who heads the Minnesota Gun Owners Civil Rights Alliance, said that much of the legislation being proposed is unnecessary and has little chance of making it through the Legislature. ""The legislation is coming from the Democratic-wing that wishes they lived in Boston or New York,"" Olson said. ""They are trying very hard to bring values to Minnesota that don't fit.""

The violence here in Minneapolis, the state's largest city, peaked in 1995, when the city saw 99 murders, a spike of more than 50% from the previous four years. After leveling off in the late 1990s and early 2000s, this city of 387,000 faced another troubling trend. In a stretch between 2003 and 2006, some 80 Minneapolis residents ages 15 to 24 were killed — mostly by gunfire — making homicide the leading cause of death for young people in the city.

""The difference between the surge of violence in the 1990s and the surge we saw a few years ago was that those involved were much younger and much less predictable,"" Rybak said.

In response, the city launched a series of initiatives targeting youth in the most violent neighborhoods in the city. Among the steps the city has taken to reduce violence are: connecting high-risk youth with mentors, establishing a tip line where young people can call or text in tips about illegal weapons and mandating psycho-social assessments of every youth who comes into a city hospital with a violent injury.

Rybak says the initiatives have helped reduce the city's crime rate, which was up in 2012 after hitting a 30-year low in 2011. Minneapolis has also seen a 66% decrease in the number of youths involved in gun-related incidents and a 41% drop in youth injured by gun violence over the past five years.

But gun violence remains a serious problem here.

Obama will visit the north side of the city, a poor and predominantly African-American area where nearly two-thirds of the city's gun violence took place in 2012.

On Friday, a 17-year-old gang member, Stephon Shannon, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for the shooting death of 5-year-old Nizzel George. Nizzel was struck by a bullet as he slept on a couch in his grandmother's house, just blocks from a police outpost where Obama will deliver his remarks.

Six months before Nizzel's killing, another north Minneapolis boy, 3-year-old Terrell Mayes, was fatally wounded by a stray bullet, when he went scurrying for cover after he heard the sound of gunfire outside his house. Gunfire incidents were so frequent in his neighborhood that his family had developed a protocol. Mayes was running to his safe spot — with a spaghetti dinner in hand — when he was struck.

And in September, the city was shaken when a 36-year-old man with a history of mental illness opened fire at the north Minneapolis business Accent Signage System after he was fired from his jobs. He killed six before he turned the gun on himself. Police later found thousands of rounds of ammunition at the gunman's home.

""Newtown was a tragedy that shocked America,"" said City Council member Don Samuels in an interview at his home in one of the city's most violent neighborhoods. ""What is happening in north Minneapolis is a slow-moving massacre.""

Sami Rahamim, 17, the son of one of the victims of the last year's mass shooting incident in Minneapolis, recalled having a conversation about gun control with his father, Reuven Rahamim, weeks after the July mass shooting at the Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting that left 12 dead and wounded dozens of others.

His father was astonished that no new laws were passed after then-representative Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., was grievously wounded and six others were killed at a constituents' event in January 2011.

Reuven and five of his employees would be killed weeks after that conversation, and less than three months later 20 children and six adults would be killed in Newtown.

After the Newtown shooting, Rahamim said he was moved to act, and he's spent the weeks since the tragedy roaming the halls of the state capital in St. Paul, lobbying lawmakers to act. ""It may be impossible the fully end gun violence, but we can do something to reduce it,"" Rahamim said. ""This is the way I can honor him."""

The parents' emotion injected a palpable measure of heartache into the rough-and-tumble Illinois gun debate, where jockeying over how to put together a concealed carry law has drawn most of the headlines.

The bill considered Monday would limit the sale or delivery of a gun magazine to no more than 10 bullets. It advanced 12-3 but faces an uncertain fate in the full Senate amid the objections of gun manufacturers and the National Rifle Association.

Mark Barden, whose son, Daniel, was slain at Sandy Hook Elementary School, called it ""my duty"" to testify, saying he wished no other family had to go through the ""pain of losing a child.""

He and Nicole Hockley, the mother of another shooting victim, told the Senate Executive Committee that the Connecticut killer used 30-round magazines that allowed him to get off more shots. They said several children escaped while the shooter paused, but he killed 26 children and educators in about four minutes before killing himself.

Hockley gazed down at the witness table at a card with a picture of her late son, Dylan. She called up another picture on her iPad before she testified that Sandy Hook parents ""learned the brutal truth"" of what happens when a killer chooses a high-capacity magazine to achieve the ""best kill rate as possible.""

Sponsoring Sen. Dan Kotowski, D-Park Ridge, said the idea of his bill is to ""minimize the damage"" the magazines can cause. He called the legislation a ""perfect blend"" of gun rights and public safety. When a gunman uses a high-capacity magazine, ""you have real-life, dead bodies,"" Kotowski said.

But National Rifle Association lobbyist Todd Vandermyde questioned whether the measure would pass constitutional muster. Vandermyde said public officials are protected by police carrying guns with high-capacity magazines and questioned why his family should not have the same.

Tom Cross future?

The march to the end of the spring legislative session took on additional political intrigue amid discussion that House Republican leader Tom Cross of Oswego may soon leave his post.

Cross said he has not made a decision and is focused on a variety of high-profile issues as lawmakers face a May 31 adjournment deadline.

""I'm focused on pensions, fracking and the budget,"" said Cross, whose caucus suffered losses in the November election and fell further into minority status. ""So I'm going to stay on that.""

But other House Republican lawmakers said Cross has begun looking elsewhere, possibly at a run for attorney general or the private sector.

""Sometimes we're asked from time to time to look at things, and I would say … that it's fair to say that the leader is exploring options,"" said Rep. Dennis Reboletti, R-Elmhurst.

Reboletti and Rep. Mike Bost of Murphysboro each would not rule out a run for Republican leader if Cross were to step down. Both have been mentioned among possible successors, along with veteran Rep. Tim Schmitz of Batavia.

In other action, lawmakers sent the governor measures that would:

•Ban minors from using indoor tanning booths, even with parental consent. The bill, sponsored by Senate Republican leader Christine Radogno of Lemont, passed 34-12.

•Increase catastrophic injury coverage to student athletes by requiring public and private high schools to supply up to $3 million or five years in benefits, a bill pushed initially by Sen. Napoleon Harris, a former NFL linebacker.

http://news.yahoo.com/newtown-families-well-keep-fighting-131052016.html,,[],Newtown families: We'll keep fighting for gun law,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disappointment. Disgust. Grossly unfair.

That's how some families who lost loved ones in December's massacre at a Connecticut elementary school view the Senate's defeat this past week of the most far-reaching gun control legislation in two decades, as they pledged to keep fighting for measures to prevent gun violence.

Neil Heslin, Erica Lafferty and Carlee Soto were among the Newtown, Conn., family members who spent a week on Capitol Hill describing how their loved ones died at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14. But their stories of horror and heroism were no match for a threat from the National Rifle Association to rate the vote, and concern from Republicans and a small band of rural-state Democrats.

Lafferty, whose mother, school principal Dawn Hochsprung, lunged unarmed at the gunman to stop him from firing the assault weapon, said she was ""honestly disgusted that there were so many senators that are doing nothing about the fact that my mom was gunned down in her elementary school, along with five other educators and 20 6- and 7-year-old children.""

The Senate rejected on Wednesday a series of gun control bills that would have tightened background checks for buyers, banned assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, and loosened restrictions on carrying concealed weapons across state lines, the last measure backed by the NRA.

Within hours of the votes, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords accused senators who opposed the new regulations of ""cowardice"" in a piece published in the New York Times' op-ed page. Giffords was among 13 people wounded two years ago when a lone gunman opened fire as she met with constituents in a Tucson, Ariz., shopping mall, killing six others. She and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, had lobbied for the bills' passage.

On CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" moderator Bob Schieffer asked Heslin, Lafferty and Soto Sunday whether the words ""cowardice"" and ""cowards"" were appropriate to describe Wednesday's vote.

Story continues

""I do,"" said Heslin, who's 6-year-old son Neil Lewis died at Sandy Hook. ""I feel they're not standing up for what they should be.""

Carlee Soto, recounted her sister Victoria's courage to try to save her students, Neil Lewis among them.

""My sister wasn't a coward that day. My sister pushed the kids up against the wall, out of sight,"" she said, adding, ""She protected her kids. Why aren't they protecting us?"" referring to the senators who voted against the gun bills.

The families say the gun legislation would have strengthened laws already in effect rather than undercut the Second Amendment, which provides a constitutional right to bear arms.

""It's beyond me how these congressmen cannot stand up and support something that would prevent — or help prevent — something like this from ever occurring again,"" Heslin said.

""We aren't going to go away. I know I'm not,"" he added. ""We're not going to stop until there are changes that are made."""

They squeezed into the rotunda for their annual lobbying day only moments after Gov. Pat Quinn delivered his budget speech, an event that drew a sizable crowd of its own. The gun rights backers let lawmakers know they oppose both a proposed ban on military-style assault weapons and heavy restrictions on legislation to allow carrying concealed weapons in public.

Quinn wants both, but the Legislature is divided along regional lines on the issues. Lawmakers from Chicago and nearby suburbs have fought for gun control, while Downstate lawmakers and some suburbanites oppose legislation they feel might infringe on the rights of hunters.

The legislative fight over the shape of gun proposals has been playing out the last several weeks with advocates on both sides of the issue, but on Wednesday, thousands swelled around the statehouse lawn's showcase statue of Abraham Lincoln as they chanted, ""Concealed carry now.""

The concealed weapons issue has gained prominence since a federal appeals court ruled in December that Illinois should come up with legislation by early June to allow people to carry guns in public. Illinois is the only state in the nation without some form of concealed carry, a ban that lasted for decades.

At the rally, Republican Sen. Sam McCann of Carlinville drew heavy cheers as he thanked gun rights advocates, including the Illinois State Rifle Association and the National Rifle Association.

""Government of the people, by the people and for the people requires you — the people — not the politicians,"" McCann said.

The outpouring came a day after House Speaker Michael Madigan, D-Chicago, held a floor debate on the proposed assault weapons ban, a legislative move that allowed lawmakers to vote piece by piece on amendments. A week earlier, Madigan held a marathon hearing on concealed weapons before the full House. Lawmakers tacked on amendments that would ban carrying guns in public in places that ranged from commuter buses and trains to casinos.

But both gun proposals are a work in progress, and neither side appears to have gained a clear upper hand. Republicans have refused to cast votes, saying the hearings are a political game designed to put GOP lawmakers on controversial roll calls that could be used against them in their next campaigns.

""At the end of the day, that's not fruitful,"" said Republican Rep. Dennis Reboletti, a former prosecutor.

Even so, Democratic Rep. Brandon Phelps, a gun rights champion from Harrisburg, said the votes so far on the gun bills have represented tests of what might be acceptable to various legislators.

Phelps acknowledged that both sides are a ""long way from a compromise"" in concealed carry and assault weapons legislation but are trying to find a middle ground. Phelps said an assault weapons ban proposed by Rep. Eddie Acevedo, a Chicago Democrat and police officer, would represent an ""all-out attempt to ban most firearms.""

In turn, Acevedo said the gun issue is ""not a game"" and that he is ""trying to make a compromise with the NRA"" that can pass.

USA TODAY Poll finds support for a new gun-control law has ebbed to 49%25-45%25

Advocates of gun control back a strong bill%2C even if it won%27t pass%2C over a watered-down version

More than 7 in 10 support creating a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants

WASHINGTON -- Four months after the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School, a USA TODAY Poll finds support for a new gun-control law ebbing as prospects for passage on Capitol Hill seem to fade.

Americans are more narrowly divided on the issue than in recent months, and backing for a bill has slipped below 50%, the poll finds. By 49%-45%, those surveyed favor Congress passing a new gun-control law. In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll in early April, 55% had backed a stricter gun law, which was down from 61% in February.

The survey of 1,002 adults was taken Thursday through Sunday by Princeton Survey Research. The margin of error is +/- 4 percentage points.

Those who support a bill want advocates in Congress to hang tough and not compromise -- an attitude that also could complicate passing legislation. Sixty-one percent say members of Congress ""should only agree to a stronger version of the bill, even if it might not pass."" Just 30% say they should ""accept a weaker law"" they know can win approval.

""So much of the support for gun control is emotional, following the Newtown tragedy,"" says Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. The December shooting at the Connecticut school left 20 children and six adults dead. ""The longer you get away from there, people start thinking of other issues. They start thinking about terrorism or jobs or immigration, and not surprisingly, then some of the momentum behind gun control starts to fade.""

The Boston Marathon bombings last Monday also may have had an effect, he speculates. ""It wouldn't be shocking if people sitting in their homes in Massachusetts cities and towns thought to themselves, 'Boy, I wish I had something to protect myself with if a terrorist came through the door now.'""

Last week in the Senate, a bipartisan proposal for expanding background checks for gun buyers failed to win the 60 votes needed.

Those surveyed who oppose a gun-control bill are split on whether senators who agree should use a filibuster to block debate: 44% back the idea of a filibuster; 41% oppose it.

On immigration, support for taking action is strong: 80% back ""better border control"" and 71% favor creating a pathway to citizenship for immigrants now in the United States illegally, if they meet certain requirements. Just 25% oppose creating a process to gain citizenship.

Americans remain more concerned about tough enforcement, however. By 55%-33%, they say they place a higher priority on preventing illegal immigration in the future than on dealing with immigrants who already are in the U.S. illegally."

Bills to limit ammunition clips reintroduced in new Congress.

NRA says it expected the bills and will fight back.

Newtown shootings provided new momentum for gun regulation bills.

WASHINGTON — Supporters of tighter federal gun restrictions moved quickly Thursday, the first day of the new Congress, introducing bills in the wake of last month's deadly mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., that will set up a long and contentious fight over the shape of the nation's gun laws.

Democratic Reps. Carolyn McCarthy of New York and Diana DeGette of Colorado refiled the bill they had promoted in earlier Congresses and said they hoped the environment for gun laws would improve in the wake of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 20 students and six adults Dec. 14. The bill would ban high-capacity ammunition magazines.

""These devices are used to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time possible, and we owe it to innocent Americans everywhere to keep them out of the hands of dangerous people,"" McCarthy said. ""We don't even allow hunters to use them – something's deeply wrong if we're protecting game more than we're protecting innocent human beings.""

Despite a series of highly visible mass shootings in malls, on college campuses, at a movie theater and at workplaces, Congress has not passed any significant gun-related regulations since 2007. Since Newtown, several pro-gun legislators, such as Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., have called for greater restrictions.

The National Rifle Association, which has fought off many attempts to increase gun regulation, said Thursday it expected the gun control advocates to come ""full force"" at the NRA.

""This is something we are prepared to address with facts,"" said Andrew Arulanandam, an NRA spokesman.

""I think it's really put a lot of people over the edge,"" DeGette said of the violence in Newtown and a mass shooting in July at a theater in Aurora, Colo., her home state. ""Now is the time to take a tough, principled look at what we need to do.""

In addition to the magazine ban, McCarthy and DeGette reintroduced a bill that would stop the sale of ammunition online. The measure was introduced last year after the Aurora shooting.

More bills are expected soon in the Senate that will have House counterparts, said Shams Tarek, a McCarthy spokesman. They include the Fix Gun Checks Act by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., which would close loopholes that allow gun sales at shows without background checks and strengthen those checks. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has said she will reintroduce a ban on the ownership on assault weapons.

Feinstein sponsored the first ban, which was passed in 1994 and expired in 2004.

The White House, which has been quiet on gun-related legislation until Newtown, is likely to issue its plan Jan. 15. Last month, President Obama asked Vice President Biden, who helped pass the 1994 assault weapons ban while a senator, to lead the administration's effort to send proposals to Congress.

Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said the group is focused on keeping the momentum for this debate going while lawmakers sort out the details of what can be done.

""The administration has shown tremendous leadership on this issue, there are a number of Congress people that have come out in the same way,"" he said. ""While we're applauding every well-intentioned effort, we're looking at the issue holistically. We are not investing entirely yet in every one single solution until we really analyze all the (proposals).""

Getting these measures to the floor in both chambers could be extremely difficult. No Republican has expressed support for specific gun control measures, and the NRA has made it clear it will vehemently oppose any effort to curb gun rights.

In response to the Newtown shooting, the NRA has proposed that the government pay for armed guards in schools to prevent school shootings.

Support for stricter gun laws has risen since the Sandy Hook shooting, according to a recent USA TODAY/Gallup Poll. Fifty-eight percent of those surveyed said they backed tougher restrictions, an increase from 43% in October 2011. The poll also showed a split, as 47% said new laws were necessary while 46% said they preferred enforcing current laws."

200 members travel to DC to lobby Congress on assault weapons bill

Group says it hopes to emulate Mothers Against Drunk Driving

Gun rights advocate says he resents comparison to drunken drivers

INDIANAPOLIS -- Peg Paulson had never beaten a path through the halls of Congress before or met a U.S. senator's staffer or advocated for a controversial issue.

So at the end of a long, tiring day in Washington on Wednesday, the Carmel mother said her fatigue and concern percolated to the surface during a meeting about gun control in Indiana Republican Sen. Dan Coats' office

""I guess you could say I got a little emotional,"" she said. ""I didn't go to the 'ugly cry,' but my voice was cracking, and I was tearing up.""

Just getting an audience was an achievement for Paulson, 53, and the nascent group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. It was founded in December by Zionsville mother Shannon Watts after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newton, Conn.

The group now has 80 chapters and 80,000 members and made its first lobbying trip to the Capitol in advance of a vote on a gun proposal.

That bill, to ban assault weapons and ammunition magazines with more than 10 rounds, passed on a party-line 10-8 vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. It was the fourth gun-control proposal the committee approved in a week. The others would require federal background checks for all gun purchases, crack down on illegal gun purchases and beef up school safety.

About 200 members from Moms Demand Action split into small teams and visited congressional offices for 30 states. Paulson and Watts were in Coats' office when Paulson's emotions boiled over.

""I was a little embarrassed because the others in our group were so poised,"" she said. ""But they said a little emotion is good once in a while.""

Nikki McNally of Carmel, who also made the trip, said the group hopes to emulate Mothers Against Drunk Driving.

""Drunk driving seemed like the norm, and MADD changed the way we think about it,"" McNally said. ""We don't want owning assault weapons to be the norm.""

The group also visited the offices of Sen. Joe Donnelly and Rep. Andre Carson. Both are Democrats from Indiana.

McNally said the congressional staffers listened politely but were noncommittal about where their bosses would vote, or even stand, on the pending bills.

""I've done a lot of volunteering but never this type of thing,"" said Paulson, who works in finance and has two grown children. ""I found it frustrating because I want a position and the staffer often says, 'We are still looking at the issue.'""

Carson supports the background check legislation but wants to see a final version off the assault weapons bill, if it comes to the House, before he comments, said Blake Johnson, a spokesman.

""The congressman is fully aware of Moms Demand Action and appreciates what they are doing and that they started in Indiana,"" Johnson said.

Donnelly's office issued a statement. ""I will give serious consideration to proposals that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill without infringing on the rights of law-abiding gun owners,"" it read.

Coats' office did not respond to inquiries.

Though Moms Demand Action models itself after MADD, Mike Hammond, legislative director for Gun Owners of America, said he resented the comparison of gun owners to drunken drivers.

""It suggests that owning a gun is as culpable a behavior as getting into car drunk,"" he said. ""The difference is driving a car is a privilege, and owning a gun is a right protected by the Second Amendment.""

Gun Owners of America describes itself as more hardline than the National Rifle Association and opposes all the pending bills, including background checks, which experts say has the best chance of bipartisan support.

The bill would require private gun sellers to run criminal background checks on their buyers, something only gun shops have to do now.

Paul Helmke, a professor at Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs, said Moms Demand Action has a chance to make inroads in gun control where other efforts failed.

""I think they have struck a chord, and it's the best chance for something to get done in years,"" said Helmke, the former president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and ex-mayor of Fort Wayne.

He said it is a little more difficult for politicians to ignore mothers than to brush off mayors or police chiefs .

""They don't have a good way to put them off because they don't deal with them every day,"" he said. ""It's hard to tell a mom to get lost."""

1. McClelland was a trained former soldier who no doubt had the skills to use a firearm quickly and effectively, but that apparently had no impact whatsoever on the ability of his and his wife's murderer to get to them. The claims of the gun lobby that being armed is an effective deterrent or defense against murder are by now a laughable, sick joke discredited by a long and growing line of bodies, including those of bystanders shot in crossfire, as well as many people with in-depth firearms training. Now that one of the victims is a former soldier and Texas prosecutor acutely aware of a present danger, and surrounded by a community of similarly-armed people, the final nail has been hammered into the coffin of NRA Big Lies.

2. The fact that a white supremacist organized crime organization is so powerful and brazen in Texas, while it fits the Lone Star state's culture of violence and hate, still somehow manages to be shocking. Apparently the pervasive gun culture in the state has done nothing more than create terrorist groups who can murder public officials with impunity, and not one of the millions of firearms in the state stopped one or a handful of assailants from executing a prosecutor, and then two months later doing it again along with the second victim's wife in their own home.

This is what fascism looks like: A state that murders and imprisons people by the bushel (many of them innocent) out of sheer sadism, but can't and/or won't protect even its own prosecutors from the violence of murderous white supremacist terrorists. In fact, they won't even call it terrorism because the suspected perpetrators are part of the same extended political culture of racist, lawless, anti-government white conservative gun nuttery as the Republicans who control the state with an iron fist.

Apparently the Aryan Brotherhood has decided to exercise a ""2nd Amendment solution"" as the NRA routinely suggests, and its victim's own attempt to do so proved fruitless against superior firepower, superior malice, and the inherent advantage of the attack. Congratulations, Texas - you have now gone where only Sicily and Russia in all of Western civilization have gone in modern times: A state where public officials can be murdered with impunity. The difference is, Sicilians and Russians aren't proud of it.

According to a Huffington Post report, the assassinations may be linked to another that occurred in Colorado two weeks ago by another suspected white supremacist who later died in a shootout with police in the same region of Texas.

A quick perusal of media coverage of the murders doesn't find the word ""terrorism"" anywhere, and Texas media seem to be downplaying the fact that McClelland was armed.

A number of sources are reporting that an assault rifle was used in the assassination.

A comment below, attributed to a previous diary by another Kossack, makes a brilliant observation: ""A gun will not protect you from bullets."" Indeed, it seems gun anarchy is as stupid and insane a solution to criminals having guns than arming yourself with vials of smallpox would be if criminals had biological weapons.

Remember when Republicans were outraged about the Homeland Security Department investigating right-wing domestic terrorism, and had the report suppressed? Many of the political leaders involved in the outcry were Texas Republicans. Now we see more of the fruits of their politics.

As far as I can find, Texas - gun capital of the United States - is now the only state in US history to have had two prosecutors assassinated within months of each other."

President Obama delivered an impassioned and urgent plea in West Hartford, Conn., Monday evening for swift action, asking a state still shaken by the Newtown school massacre why there isn’t more support in Congress for gun control legislation. (The Washington Post)

With his proposed gun regulations in serious jeopardy, President Obama delivered an impassioned and urgent plea here Monday evening for swift action, telling a state still shaken by the Newtown school massacre, “We’ve got to expect more from Congress.”

The call for stricter gun laws — his most forceful yet — came in a campaign-style event in front of several thousand people packed into the University of Hartford’s basketball arena. Obama recalled last December’s slaughter of 20 small children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School as the toughest day of his presidency and added, “If we don’t respond to this, that will be a tough day for me, too.”

“We’ve got to expect more from ourselves,” he continued. “And we’ve got to expect more from Congress. We’ve got to believe that, you know, well, every once in a while we set politics aside and we just do what’s right.”

Obama, who met before his speech with parents of slain children, also vowed not to forget the Connecticut slayings. He wore a green bracelet, while many in the audience wore green ribbons, honoring the school’s colors.

“Newtown, we want you to know that we’re here with you,” Obama said. “We will not walk away from the promises we’ve made. We are as determined as ever to do what must be done.”

Obama’s visit to Connecticut comes at the start of a critical week on Capitol Hill that could determine the fate of his sweeping gun-control agenda, with signs that senators may be nearing a deal to expand background-check requirements but with other proposals in serious jeopardy.

“I know that some of these proposals inspire more debate than others, but each of them has the support of the majority of the American people,” Obama said. “All of them are common sense. All of them deserve a vote.”

The crowd cheered so loudly it was difficult at times to hear the president’s remarks. At one point, people interrupted Obama with chants of, “We want a vote! We want a vote! We want a vote!”

Obama ticked through each of his proposals, including universal background checks and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, highlighting polls showing nine in 10 Americans are in favor of expanding background checks.

“If our democracy's working the way it’s supposed to, and 90 percent of the American people agree on something, in the wake of a tragedy, you’d think this would not be a heavy lift,” Obama said. “And yet some folks back in Washington are already floating the idea that they might use political stunts to prevent votes on any of these reforms.”

A growing coalition of Senate Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), has warned it would filibuster gun legislation, meaning any bill would require a plurality of 60 votes rather than a simple majority to pass.

Obama is ratcheting up his efforts to somehow translate popular support for his proposals into legislative momentum. His visit here comes just days after Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy (D) signed into state law one of the nation’s strictest firearms restrictions.

On Monday night, 11 relatives of Sandy Hook victims plan to fly to Washington with Obama aboard Air Force One so they can lobby lawmakers Tuesday, according to a White House official. The White House offered to fly them so they could attend both the president’s speech in Hartford and their meetings the next day in Washington, the official said.

The Newtown families will be joined this week in Washington by survivors and the family members of victims from mass shootings in Arizona, Colorado, Wisconsin and Virginia, according to groups organizing the meetings.

Obama has made similar pleas on gun control, including an address last week in Denver, near the scene of last summer’s movie-theater shooting in Aurora.

Although the president’s push is resonating with voters, it has not yet led to momentum on Capitol Hill. Amid an intense lobbying effort by the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights groups, senators have yet to reach a deal on universal background checks for gun sales.

The prospects for passing his proposed bans on so-called assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines are significantly worse, and administration officials quietly acknowledge the prohibitions are unlikely to pass.

Obama and other gun control proponents are zeroing in on the background checks proposal, which advocates argue would be the most effective of the plans because it would help keep all guns — assault weapons as well as common handguns — out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.

This week, proponents are making their biggest public relations push yet to increase pressure on senators to pass expanded background checks. Vice President Biden and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. plan to deliver remarks Tuesday about reducing gun violence during an event at the White House with law enforcement officials. And on Wednesday, first lady Michelle Obama will return to her home town of Chicago to give a speech about gun violence from the perspective of a mother.

Meanwhile, other gun control advocates are trying to rally the public. Parents of Sandy Hook victims appeared on CBS’s “60 Minutes” on Sunday, making the emotional case for senators to back stricter gun laws.

Nicole Hockley, referring to a photograph of her dead son, told CBS: “They need to not just look us in the eyes, but look at our children and the lost ones and see those faces, see what’s gone and remember this isn’t just about political parties. This isn’t just about careers. This is about people. And this is about making change to save people. And it’s important to remember the people you are doing this for.”

On Monday morning, former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was shot and severely injured in 2011 during a constituent event in her Tucson district, tweeted: “What are we waiting for? I can’t remember a time when this many Americans spoke with such a united voice in favor of anything.”

Discuss this topic and other political issues in the politics discussion forums."

Destination of 400-mile ride is rally at the Capitol

Trip honors those killed at Sandy Hook

Organizer says nation is suffering %27epidemic of gun violence%27

NEWTOWN, Conn. — More than two dozen bicyclists plan to leave Saturday on a 400-mile ride to Washington to ""raise awareness for common-sense gun legislation"" and honor 26 children and adults killed by a gunman Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

The riders will stop for several rallies along the route, according to the event's organizer, Monte Frank. They will join members of the Virginia Tech Victims Cycling team Tuesday in College Park, Md.

The team, formed to honor 32 people killed in shootings at that university in April 2007, will accompany the Newtown-originated riders to the Capitol, where a final rally will take place.

During the first leg of the Sandy Hook Ride On Washington, the cyclists will be joined, Frank says, by Chris McDonnell, whose 7-year-old daughter, Grace, was one of the victims at the elementary school.

Frank, a Newtown lawyer and a former member of Cornell University's cycling team, says his 11-year-old daughter, Sarah, a sixth-grade student, was instrumental in founding the event.

Sarah's teacher three years ago at Sandy Hook Elementary was Victoria Soto, who was killed trying to defend her students Dec. 14.

Sarah had a close relationship with Soto, Frank says, and recently wrote an essay — posted on the Sandy Hook Ride on Washington Facebook page — about why her father was organizing the event.

""My dad rides to honor (Victoria Soto) and the other 25 victims,"" Sarah wrote. ""We have to prevent this from happening again and protect innocent lives. My dad rides to show that a small town in the middle of a tragedy can bring about change.""

Frank, who has lived in Sandy Hook, a village within Newtown, for 10 years and serves as a town attorney, says he senses a growing grass-roots movement pushing for stronger gun-control laws throughout the country.

""We have gotten to the point where we recognize we have an epidemic of gun violence,"" Frank says. ""The current situation is not tolerable for a sophisticated and developed nation.""

The ride will begin with a rally — to be attended by several local government officials and federal legislators, including Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy — at Newtown's Reed Intermediate School.

The riders will cycle to the Sandy Hook firehouse for a moment of silence for the victims and a show of support for first responders. The firehouse is at the end of a street leading to Sandy Hook Elementary School and the place where students and faculty took refuge after the shootings.

The riders will next pass the facilities of other fire, police and ambulance responders before heading for another rally in Ridgefield, Conn., Frank says.

Rallies are planned in three New Jersey towns and in Baltimore with the city's mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake.

The events are in sync with the sentiments of many Newtown residents who, Frank says, don't want the shootings to define the town as a place of tragedy.

""We want to be remembered as a town that went to work to change the gun culture in our society and put stronger laws in place to reduce gun violence,"" Frank says.

On Dec. 15 — one day after gunman Adam Lanza killed his mother, Nancy, at their Sandy Hook home before killing Soto and 25 others at Sandy Hook school — Frank and his wife, Leah, had to sit down and explain to Sarah what had happened to her former teacher.

""Those were not conversations any parent should have with their 11-year-old child, and those conversations will haunt me the rest of my life,"" Frank says. ""I'm committed to do what I can to prevent another tragedy from happening elsewhere."""

That’s good news. On the minus side, there’s what is happening in California.

Don’t get us wrong, there are some worthwhile bills floating around in Sacramento. But most of the bills either introduced or under proposal seem primarily designed to seize headlines on behalf of individual lawmakers in the aftermath of the Newtown, Conn., school massacre. As much as we support stricter gun-control laws, we don’t want just any old bill to pass; we want laws that will help solve demonstrable problems. California already ranks No. 1 in the nation when it comes to strict gun laws, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. If the rest of the nation took actions as strong as the Golden State already has, interstate gun trafficking would be far more difficult and the entire country would be immeasurably safer.

So does California need to do even more? To some degree, yes. There are still loopholes that allow felons and the mentally ill to acquire guns, and where possible, these should be closed. But most of the bills that are currently being considered wouldn’t address them, and in many ways the state would be better off enforcing the laws already on the books than imposing new ones.

SLIDESHOW: The 10 trigger-happiest states in America

As just one example of a questionable bill, there is AB 48 from Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley), which would apply to the sale of ammunition many of the same requirements the state now imposes when guns are sold, such as licensing sellers and requiring sales to be reported to the Department of Justice. The cost of all that? Unknown. A proposal from Assemblyman Roger Dickinson (D-Sacramento), meanwhile, would tax ammunition sales to pay for screening young children for mental illness. Yes, there is a connection between mental illness and mass murder, but it takes a flight of fancy to see this as a reasonable use for a tax that would mainly be paid by hunters.

Again, that’s not to say there isn’t room for progress. Imposing higher taxes on ammunition is a fine idea if the proceeds are spent on something more directly related, such as preventing gun violence. Also promising is a bill from state Sens. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) and President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) that would help officials pay for tracking and seizing firearms that were bought legally but whose owners were later convicted of felonies or diagnosed with mental illness. Although it would cost an estimated $25 million to clear the backlog of these gun owners within three years, the lawmakers think they’ve found a funding source in a $20-million surplus in the account in which fees are deposited when gun buyers register for new purchases. They should pursue it."

Senate Judiciary Committee considers three gun measures Tuesday%2C including assault weapons ban

Gabrielle Giffords and Mark Kelly are outspoken gun-control advocates

Mark Kelly says he%27ll make other gun purchases and write about those experiences

WASHINGTON — Retired astronaut Mark Kelly, husband of former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, recently purchased an assault weapon to make a point about the ease of background checks for gun owners.

In an interview with CNN on Monday, Kelly said his experience highlights the availability of such weapons. ""It is a pretty easy thing to do,"" he said about buying the military-style firearm.

Kelly announced Friday on his Facebook page that he bought an AR-15, one of the 157 military-style weapons that would be banned under a bill pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The panel is set to consider three gun bills Tuesday, including the proposed assault weapons ban authored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.

He told CNN that he wanted ""firsthand knowledge"" of gun issues. Kelly said he plans to buy a weapon at a gun show and to sell a weapon and will write about those experiences as well.

""Even to buy an assault weapon, the background check only takes a few minutes,"" Kelly said on Facebook. ""Scary to think of people buying guns like these without a background check at a gun show or the Internet. We really need to close the gun show and private seller loophole.""

Kelly, a retired Navy captain, and Giffords are both gun owners who have been outspoken about the need for new gun-control measures. Americans for Responsible Solutions, their super PAC, has been running ads featuring Giffords that tout the proposed assault weapons ban and universal background checks.

Kelly said on his Facebook page and in the TV interview that he plans to give the AR-15 to the Tucson Police Department when he receives the weapon. He said he will keep a .45-caliber handgun he purchased at the same time.

Giffords was shot in the head in January 2011 in a Tucson rampage that left six people dead. President Obama and others have pushed for new gun legislation in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., in December that left 20 students and six of their educators dead."

First neighborhood in the country to be trained and equipped

Supporters say gun giveaway is a better way to deter crime

Training%2C guns provided to residents of high-crime neighborhoods

HOUSTON (AP) — Houston resident Cheryl Strain's inexperience with guns was apparent as she struggled to load shells into a 20-gauge shotgun.

Over the piercing blasts of gunfire in the shooting range, Strain's instructor, Dan Blackford, patiently directed her on how to use her thumb to shove a shell all the way inside the barrel and feel it click.

""Now we got a round in the chamber ready to go,"" Blackford said as he positioned her body on the right way to hold the shotgun. ""Look down your sight, put that BB right in the middle of your target and press the trigger.""

Strain's northwest Houston community of Oak Forest is the first neighborhood in the country being trained and equipped by the Armed Citizen Project, a Houston nonprofit that is giving away free shotguns to single women and residents of neighborhoods with high crime rates.

While many cities have tried gun buy-backs and other tactics in the ongoing national debate on gun control, the nonprofit and its supporters say gun giveaways to responsible owners are actually a better way to deter crime. The organization, which plans to offer training classes in Dallas, San Antonio, and Tucson, Arizona, in the next few weeks, is working to expand its giveaways to 15 cities by the end of the year, including Chicago and New York.

But others in Houston, while expressing support for the right to bear arms guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, question whether more guns will result in more gun-related deaths rather than less crime.

Residents of Oak Forest say their neighborhood, made up of older one-story houses and a growing number of new townhomes, has experienced a recent rash of driveway robberies and home burglaries. On a recent Sunday afternoon, a group of 10 residents, including Strain, went through training at Shiloh Shooting, a northwest Houston gun range.

Kyle Coplen, the project's 29-year-old founder said his group expects to train at least 50 Oak Forest residents and put up signs saying the neighborhood is armed.

""When we have a crime wave, we don't just say let's just increase police and that's all we do. We do multiple things. I see this as one aspect of what we can do,"" said Coplen, who graduated from the University of Houston with a master's degree in public administration.

It costs the organization about $300 to arm and train an individual and about $20,000 for an entire neighborhood. All costs are paid through donations, said Coplen, though he declined to say how much his organization has raised so far.

While some residents in the neighborhood are supportive, several officials have mixed feelings about it.

Sandra Keller, Strain's neighbor, said she is participating in part because of the helplessness she felt after her furniture store was robbed a couple of years ago.

""If you don't have a gun, you're just a walking victim. You're just waiting for somebody to take advantage of you and your property,"" said Keller, 64, after practicing at the shooting range.

But Houston City Councilwoman Ellen Cohen, who represents Oak Forest, said, ""I have serious concerns about more guns in homes.""

Cohen said she supports Second Amendment rights and believes that such a responsibility should include proper training and background checks.

David Hemenway, a professor of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health who has written about firearms and health, said studies suggesting gun ownership deters crime have been refuted by many others that say the opposite.

""Mostly what guns seem to do is make situations more lethal because most crime has nothing to do with guns,"" he said. ""When there is a gun in the mix, there is much more likely to be somebody dying or somebody incredibly hurt.""

Proponents of increased gun ownership point to a variety of statistics to support their argument, including ones showing that some cities with strict gun control laws, like Chicago, still have high murder rates.

Blackford, the firearm instructor in the Oak Forest training, said the group is teaching residents not only how to handle and store a weapon but also when to use deadly force.

""The sad part is most people think if you're pro-gun, that you've got this gunslinger attitude, that you are walking around looking for a gun fight to get into and that is so far from the truth,"" said Blackford, a former Secret Service agent.

Harris County Precinct One Constable Alan Rosen, whose deputies patrol Oak Forest, said that while he believes the best deterrent to crime is effective neighborhood watch programs, he believes people should have the right to protect themselves.

""In terms of having a shotgun, after you've been properly trained on it, to have that in your home to protect your home, I'm for it,"" he said.

Strain, 46, a single mother who has never owned a gun, said she was nervous firing the shotgun but that more training will help. She also had her 12-year-old son Rory practice firing the shotgun so ""if God forbid something happens, he could be prepared as well.""

http://news.yahoo.com/conn-reaches-deal-tough-gun-laws-newtown-221504941.html,,[],Conn. reaches deal on tough gun laws after Newtown,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut lawmakers announced a deal Monday on what they called some of the toughest gun laws in the country that were proposed after the December mass shooting in the state, including a ban on new high-capacity ammunition magazines like the ones used in the massacre that left 20 children and six educators dead.

The proposal includes new registration requirements for existing magazines that carry 10 or more bullets, something of a disappointment for some family members of Newtown victims who wanted an outright ban on the possession of all high-capacity magazines and traveled to the state Capitol on Monday to ask lawmakers for it.

The package also creates what lawmakers said is the nation's first statewide dangerous weapon offender registry, creates a new ""ammunition eligibility certificate,"" imposes immediate universal background checks for all firearms sales, and extends the state's assault weapons ban to 100 new types of firearms and requires that a weapon have only one of several features in order to be banned.

The newly banned weapons could no longer be bought or sold in Connecticut, and those legally owned already would have to be registered with the state, just like the high-capacity magazines.

""No gun owner will lose their gun,"" said House Minority Leader Lawrence Cafero Jr., a Norwalk Republican. ""No gun owner will lose their magazines.""

The bill also addresses mental health and school security measures.

The shooting Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School reignited the gun debate in the country and led to calls for increased gun control legislation on the federal and state levels. While some other states, including neighboring New York, have strengthened their gun laws, momentum has stalled in Congress, whose members were urged by President Barack Obama last week not to forget the shooting and to capitalize on the best chance in years to stem gun violence.

Connecticut should be seen as an example for lawmakers elsewhere, said Senate President Donald E. Williams Jr., a Brooklyn Democrat.

Story continues

""In Connecticut, we've broken the mold,"" he said. ""Democrats and Republicans were able to come to an agreement on a strong, comprehensive bill. That is a message that should resound in 49 other states and in Washington, D.C. And the message is: We can get it done here and they should get it done in their respective states and nationally in Congress.""

The proposal was revealed to rank-and-file lawmakers Monday after weeks of bipartisan, closed-door negotiations among legislative leaders. A vote was expected Wednesday in the General Assembly, where Democrats control both chambers, making passage all but assured. The bill would then be sent to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who has helped lead efforts to strengthen the state's gun laws but has not yet signed off on the proposed legislation.

Earlier in the day on Monday, Malloy voiced support for the Newtown families and their desire to ban the possession of large-capacity magazines.

Ron Pinciaro, executive director of Connecticut Against Gun Violence, said his group will live with the lawmakers' decision not to ban them as other states have done. He said the leaders made their decision based on what was politically feasible.

""We have to be satisfied. There are still other things that we want, we'll be back for in later sessions,"" he said. ""But for now, it's a good thing.""

Robert Crook, executive director of the Connecticut Coalition of Sportsmen, contended the bill would not have changed what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary School, where the gunman fired off 154 shots with a Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle within five minutes. He went through six 30-round magazines, though half were not completely empty, and police said he had three other 30-round magazines in addition to one in the rifle.

""They can register magazines and do all the rest of this stuff. It isn't going to do anything,"" he said.

Gun owners, who've packed public hearings at the state Capitol in recent months, voicing their opposition to various gun control measures, are concerned they've been showing up ""for virtually nothing"" after learning about the bill, Crook said.

""Clearly we've made our point,"" Crook said. ""But I don't know what anybody can do at this point in time.""

Six relatives of Newtown victims visited the Capitol on Monday, asking lawmakers to ban existing high-capacity magazines. Some handed out cards with photographs of their slain children.

Allowing magazines that carry 10 or more bullets to remain in the hands of gun owners would leave a gaping loophole in the law, said Mark Barden, whose 7-year-old son, Daniel, was killed in the shooting.

""It doesn't prevent someone from going out of the state to purchase them and then bring them back. There's no way to track when they were purchased, so they can say, 'I had this before,'"" Barden said. ""So it's a big loophole.""

Barden and other victims' family members who visited the statehouse earlier on Monday did not immediately respond to messages seeking their reactions to the agreement.

Jake McGuigan, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which is based in Newtown, said he wouldn't comment on the proposal until he saw it in the writing, but he questioned the mechanics of a registry for magazines.

""How will they register a magazine? It seems a little weird,"" he said.

http://news.yahoo.com/nra-uses-justice-memo-accuse-134935625.html,,[],NRA uses Justice memo to accuse Obama on guns,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Rifle Association is using a Justice Department memo it obtained to argue in ads that the Obama administration believes its gun control plans won't work unless the government seizes firearms and requires national gun registration — ideas the White House has not proposed and does not support.

The NRA's assertion and its obtaining of the memo in the first place underscore the no-holds-barred battle under way as Washington's fight over gun restrictions heats up.

The memo, under the name of one of the Justice Department's leading crime researchers, critiques the effectiveness of gun control proposals, including some of President Barack Obama's. A Justice Department official called the memo an unfinished review of gun violence research and said it does not represent administration policy.

The memo says requiring background checks for more gun purchases could help, but also could lead to more illicit weapons sales. It says banning assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines produced in the future but exempting those already owned by the public, as Obama has proposed, would have limited impact because people now own so many of those items.

It also says that even total elimination of assault weapons would have little overall effect on gun killings because assault weapons account for a limited proportion of those crimes.

The nine-page document says the success of universal background checks would depend in part on ""requiring gun registration,"" and says gun buybacks would not be effective ""unless massive and coupled with a ban.""

The administration has not proposed gun registration, buybacks or banning all firearms. But gun registration and ownership curbs are hot-button issues for the NRA and other gun-rights groups, which strenuously oppose the ideas.

Whether to require record-keeping for private gun sales is holding up a congressional compromise on legislation to expand background checks, now required only for transactions by federally licensed dealers, according to people familiar with bipartisan Senate talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.

Story continues

Justice Department and White House officials declined to provide much information about the memo or answer questions about it on the record.

The memo has the look of a preliminary document and calls itself ""a cursory summary"" and assessment of gun curb initiatives. The administration has not release it officially.

But the NRA has posted the memo on one of its websites and cites it in advertising aimed at whipping up opposition to Obama's efforts to contain gun violence. The ad says the paper shows that the administration ""believes that a gun ban will not work without mandatory gun confiscation"" and thinks universal background checks ""won't work without requiring national gun registration"" — ideas the president has not proposed or expressed support for.

""Still think President Obama's proposals sound reasonable?"" Chris W. Cox, the NRA's chief Washington lobbyist, says in the ad.

Last month, White House spokesman Jay Carney said none of Obama's proposals ""would take away a gun from a single law-abiding American."" Other administration officials have said their plans would not result in gun seizures or a national gun registry.

A Justice Department official who would only discuss the issue on condition of anonymity said the NRA ad misrepresents Obama's gun proposals and that the administration has never backed a gun registry or gun confiscation.

While the memo's analysis of gun curb proposals presents no new findings, it is unusual for a federal agency document to surface that raises questions about a president's plans during debate on a high-profile issue such as restricting firearms.

Obama wants to ban assault weapons and ammunition magazines exceeding 10 rounds that are produced in the future. He wants universal background checks for nearly all gun purchases. Today, checks are only mandatory on sales by federally licensed gun dealers, not transactions at gun shows or other private sales.

His plan also includes tougher federal laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases, which occur when a person legally buys a firearm but sells it to a criminal or someone else barred from owning a weapon.

Interest in the gun issue has intensified since the December shootings in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 first-graders and six staffers at an elementary school. The Democratic-led Senate Judiciary Committee plans to write legislation addressing some of Obama's proposals in the next week or two.

The NRA's Cox declined to say how his organization obtained the memo.

He said the commercial is running online in 15 states, including many Republican-leaning states where Democrats will defend Senate seats next year, such as Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia. There are also ads in papers in five states.

The memo was written under the name of Greg Ridgeway, acting director of the National Institute of Justice, the Justice Department's research arm. It is dated Jan. 4, nearly two weeks before Obama announced his plan for restricting guns, and Ridgeway's first day as acting chief.

Justice Department officials said Ridgeway was not granting interviews. He came to the institute last July from the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research institution where he studied criminal justice issues, and has a Ph.D. in statistics.

The memo says straw purchases and gun thefts are the largest sources of firearms used in crimes, and that such transactions ""would most likely become larger if background checks at gun shows and private sellers were addressed.""

Gun control supporters said the NRA ad and the Justice memo don't mention that the current federal background check system blocked gun sales to 2.1 million criminals and others barred from owning guns between 1994, when the checks began, and 2010. Also ignored is that Obama has proposed cracking down on straw purchases to prevent a growth in illegal transactions, they said.

Advocates of restricting guns also said the memo omitted mention of several studies that affirm the effectiveness of firearms curbs. These include a 2010 police group analysis showing more than one-third of police departments found increased criminal use of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines since the 2004 expiration of the ban on those items.

""It doesn't appear to be a serious discussion of gun violence prevention policy, never mind an expression of administration policy,"" said Joshua Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.

The memo says that out of 11,000 annual gun homicides, an average of 35 deaths yearly are from mass shootings, defined as those with four or more victims.

""Policies that address the larger firearm homicide issue will have a far greater impact even if they do not address the particular issues of mass shootings,"" it says.

It says there were an estimated 1.5 million assault weapons before the 10-year ban on those firearms began in 1994, so their sheer number would weaken a new ban exempting existing weapons. Such guns accounted for just 2 percent to 8 percent of crimes before the 1994 ban, so eliminating assault weapons ""would not have a large impact on gun homicides,"" the memo said.

Recent data on the assault weapons ban impact is scarce because since the 1990s, Congress has blocked most federal research on the effect that firearms have on public health. As part of the gun restrictions Obama proposed last month, he ordered federal scientific agencies to research gun violence."

The parents' emotion injected a palpable measure of heartache into the rough-and-tumble Illinois gun debate, where jockeying over how to put together a concealed carry law has drawn most of the headlines.

The bill considered Monday would limit the sale or delivery of a gun magazine to no more than 10 bullets. It advanced 12-3 but faces an uncertain fate in the full Senate amid the objections of gun manufacturers and the National Rifle Association.

Mark Barden, whose son, Daniel, was slain at Sandy Hook Elementary School, called it ""my duty"" to testify, saying he wished no other family had to go through the ""pain of losing a child.""

He and Nicole Hockley, the mother of another shooting victim, told the Senate Executive Committee that the Connecticut killer used 30-round magazines that allowed him to get off more shots. They said several children escaped while the shooter paused, but he killed 26 children and educators in about four minutes before killing himself.

Hockley gazed down at the witness table at a card with a picture of her late son, Dylan. She called up another picture on her iPad before she testified that Sandy Hook parents ""learned the brutal truth"" of what happens when a killer chooses a high-capacity magazine to achieve the ""best kill rate as possible.""

Sponsoring Sen. Dan Kotowski, D-Park Ridge, said the idea of his bill is to ""minimize the damage"" the magazines can cause. He called the legislation a ""perfect blend"" of gun rights and public safety. When a gunman uses a high-capacity magazine, ""you have real-life, dead bodies,"" Kotowski said.

But National Rifle Association lobbyist Todd Vandermyde questioned whether the measure would pass constitutional muster. Vandermyde said public officials are protected by police carrying guns with high-capacity magazines and questioned why his family should not have the same.

Tom Cross future?

The march to the end of the spring legislative session took on additional political intrigue amid discussion that House Republican leader Tom Cross of Oswego may soon leave his post.

Cross said he has not made a decision and is focused on a variety of high-profile issues as lawmakers face a May 31 adjournment deadline.

""I'm focused on pensions, fracking and the budget,"" said Cross, whose caucus suffered losses in the November election and fell further into minority status. ""So I'm going to stay on that.""

But other House Republican lawmakers said Cross has begun looking elsewhere, possibly at a run for attorney general or the private sector.

""Sometimes we're asked from time to time to look at things, and I would say … that it's fair to say that the leader is exploring options,"" said Rep. Dennis Reboletti, R-Elmhurst.

Reboletti and Rep. Mike Bost of Murphysboro each would not rule out a run for Republican leader if Cross were to step down. Both have been mentioned among possible successors, along with veteran Rep. Tim Schmitz of Batavia.

In other action, lawmakers sent the governor measures that would:

•Ban minors from using indoor tanning booths, even with parental consent. The bill, sponsored by Senate Republican leader Christine Radogno of Lemont, passed 34-12.

•Increase catastrophic injury coverage to student athletes by requiring public and private high schools to supply up to $3 million or five years in benefits, a bill pushed initially by Sen. Napoleon Harris, a former NFL linebacker.

Eight weeks after the massacre of 20 Connecticut first-graders, a ban on the kind of semi-automatic rifle used by the killer remains elusive – if not impossible.

Such a ban became a rallying cry for victims’ families, advocacy groups and politicians supporting tougher gun laws in the emotional aftermath of the Newtown shootings in December.

President Barack Obama still calls for updating a 1994 assault weapons ban that expired 10 years later as part of his package of steps intended to reduce chronic gun violence in America, especially in major cities.

However, fierce opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association and millions of American gun owners has shifted debate away from prohibiting specific weapons to making it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns.

Along with a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, Obama also wants to limit magazine clips to 10 rounds, expand background checks to all gun sales, crack down on gun trafficking, and strengthen efforts to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.

The multi-faceted proposal provided Congress with options on legislation, enhancing chances of passing some provisions, said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, director of social policy and politics at Third Way, a Washington think tank that proposes policy compromises on major issues.

Gun violence plans: What’s in the works

While her group supports a renewed ban on military style weapons, Erickson Hatalsky said “political reality” dictated a different approach.

“Keeping guns out of the wrong hands is not only more politically palatable but also more effective to stop gun violence,” she explained.

That strategy reflects “an understanding of gun crime in the country,” she added.

Opinion polls back up her assertion.

A Quinnipiac University survey released Thursday showed that 92% of respondents support expanding background checks to all gun sales. In households with guns, support was 91%.

However, a majority of households with guns opposed a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, while the full survey showed 56% of respondents backed the provision.

The poll also found that 46% of respondents believe the NRA better reflects their views on guns, compared to 43% for Obama.

Newtown calls on Connecticut to ‘show America the way’ on gun control

Diverse views in America

Obama acknowledged on Thursday that Americans have diverse views on the issue, depending on where they grew up and how they live.

“There are different realities and we have to respect them,” he told House Democrats at their policy retreat, noting rural hunters and urban dwellers come from distinct gun cultures.

At the same time, the president called for action, saying “there are commonsense steps we can take and build a consensus around, and we cannot shy away from taking them.”

Earlier this week, White House spokesman Jay Carney made clear that the goal was progress on reducing gun violence, rather than any specific provision.

Carney called proposals backed by legislators from both parties “the first progress we’ve seen in many, many years dealing with gun violence.” But none of the measures he mentioned – expanded background checks, cracking down on gun trafficking, criminalizing “straw” purchases in which legal buyers obtain weapons for those unable to do so – included a new ban on semi-automatic weapons.

Gun debate: Where is the middle ground?

NRA President Bob Keene said he expected few substantive changes in law because “people are smarter than politicians,” which means “common sense ultimately prevails.”

“They hope that they can use emotion to achieve an anti-firearms agenda that they haven’t been able to achieve in the past,” Keene told a recent Christian Science Monitor breakfast event.

“I am convinced that as these things are discussed, that we’re going to come out about where we have come out in the past,” he added.

His organization keeps a scorecard for each Washington legislator on gun issues, and spends millions on campaign contributions to favored candidates.

In the nearly two months since the Newtown shootings, Obama and the White House have sought to maintain public attention on the issue.

Loaded language poisons gun debate

Vice President Joe Biden will take part in a roundtable discussion on gun violence on Monday in Philadelphia.

Four days later, Obama will award the Presidential Citizens Medal – the nation’s second-highest civiian honor – posthumously to the six educators killed with the 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

In Congress, some influential Democrats join virtually all Republicans in opposing, or at least questioning, a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons like the Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle used in the Newtown shootings.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who gets high marks from the NRA for his opposition to past gun control efforts, has indicated support for expanding background checks but refuses to endorse a new weapons ban.

According to Reid, a bill from the Senate Judiciary Committee was unlikely to include an updated weapons ban, but he would allow a vote on the provision during floor debate.

Weapons like the Bushmaster mimic the appearance and some features of fully automatic military rifles, though they technically do not meet the definition of an assault weapon because they are semi-automatic – meaning each shot requires a trigger pull.

Supporters of a ban say such weapons have no place in the general public because they are designed solely for rapid-fire killing capacity, rather than hunting or sport shooting.

Opinion: Nothing stops a bullet like a job

Right to bear arms

The NRA and other opponents contend that any limit on private gun ownership violates the constitutional right to bear arms. Even partial steps in that direction, such as prohibiting specific models, are considered a path to potential confiscation or other future elimination of Second Amendment rights, they argue.

In recent decades, the NRA has led lobbying efforts that shifted the discussion away from stronger gun controls – such as an outright ban on handguns and a national registration of gun ownership pushed by top Democrats in the 1980s and 90s – to the incremental measures under consideration now.

Erickson Hatalsky of Third Way noted examples of the NRA’s influence in the last significant gun legislation – the Brady Bill of 1993 that required background checks on guns purchased from licensed dealers, followed by the limited assault weapons ban a year later.

While the Brady Bill led to the background check system in use today, the NRA made sure it didn’t apply to private sales, such as those at gun shows, she said.

How the violent mentally ill can buy guns

Obama and other Democrats now want to close what they call a loophole to make background checks a requirement for any gun sale.

The issue gained prominence after the Columbine high school shootings in 1999 in which three guns used by the two underage killers had been purchased by 18-year-old Robyn Anderson at a Colorado gun show to avoid a background check.

Anderson later told a Colorado House of Representatives committee that the gun purchases had been “too easy.”

“I wish it had been more difficult,” she said. “I wouldn’t have helped them buy the guns if I had faced a background check.”

The 1994 weapons ban targeting military style weapons was gone 10 years later, when Congress let it expire in the administration of President George W. Bush – an outcome sought by the NRA.

Keene and other NRA officials argue the ban failed to reduce gun violence because it targeted firearms used in only a fraction of the nation’s gun violence. They also contend the government isn’t properly enforcing the background checks created by Brady Bill, making an expansion illogical.

“We are not willing to support measures we feel unduly burden innocent and law-abiding Americans, and on the other side do not have any real impact on the problem we’re trying to solve,” Keene said.

To Erickson Hatalsky, the goal is to get laws on the books that make it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns – either through private sales or from traffickers through straw purchases.

Minor exceptions would apply to family members giving guns to each other, or people borrowing guns on a hunting ground, she said.

“How are they going to stop somebody who’s a gun trafficker if there’s no federal law against that now,” she wondered.

January’s FBI gun background checks are second-highest

Limits on magazine rounds

A tougher issue involves proposed limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, she said. Larger capacity magazines allow semi-automatic weapons to fire dozens of rounds in seconds.

At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun control last week, Mark Kelly argued that the proposed limit could have prevented the death of a young girl in the Tucson, Arizona, attack that seriously wounded his wife – former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.

According to Kelly, the 13th shot fired killed 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, and the shooter got tackled when trying to reload. With a 10-round limit, Green might still be alive, he said.

Gabby and Mark: The new ‘Bradys’ of gun control

The NRA and its supporters say larger-capacity magazines are popular, with millions already in the possession of American gun owners who want them to feel secure against criminals armed with similar firepower.

They also contend citizens have the right to such weaponry to protect against future government tyranny, which they say was the intent of the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms.

Erickson Hatalsky rejected any inference by the NRA or its supporters that Obama’s proposals or other measures being discussed in Congress amount to taking away people’s guns.

She praised the president’s strategy of presenting a broad package for Congress to consider, saying: “It behooves people who are working on this issue to keep the NRA arguing about lots of different issues, rather than allowing it to concentrate on one and defeat it.”

http://news.yahoo.com/ny-town-defends-remington-factory-amid-gun-ban-200546621.html,,[],NY town defends Remington factory amid new gun ban,"ILION, N.Y. (AP) — The big brick Remington gun factory pieces together military-style rifles in a state that has just banned their sale after a string of mass shootings led to a national outcry over civilian ownership of them.

Residents of Ilion see the issue far differently: The gun factory is a major local employer and a source of pride for almost two centuries.

As Mayor John Stephens put it, ""Remington is Ilion. Ilion is Remington.""

Little wonder that residents in this blue-collar stretch of the Mohawk Valley are defending Remington after state lawmakers banned the sale of semi-automatic rifles like the Bushmaster weapon made there. The move came after the weapon was linked to gunmen in the deadly Connecticut school shooting and in the Christmas Eve slayings of two firefighters in western New York.

Remington employee Tom Bradle said don't blame the guns in mass shootings, blame the shooters.

""It's the person that pulls the trigger. I don't care what kind of gun it is,"" Bradle said as he walked back to the factory from lunch break on a chilly, gray day recently.

Chad Delmedico, who works on Remington's Model 700 bolt-action rifle, said it more simply: ""We have a bum rap.""

Remington has been intertwined with Ilion since shortly after Eliphalet Remington crafted a flintlock rifle on his father's forge in 1816. Even the elementary school shares the company's name. Company officials did not respond to calls seeking comment, but locals say the factory employs about 1,200 people and produces Bushmaster, Marlin and H&R products.

Parts of the Remington Arms Co. factory, with its imposing four-story front of brick and old-style, multi-paned windows, date back to the days when upstate New York was a manufacturing powerhouse. But factory jobs have become rarer in the string of modest towns along the Mohawk River, and Ilion, with about 8,000 residents, depends heavily on Remington.

Stephens, the mayor, was disgusted by the news last month of 20 first-graders and six adults killed by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. But he is critical of the New York state law approved last week banning certain semi-automatic rifles and large-capacity magazines and calling for background checks on ammunition purchases, among other measures. He dismisses the idea that there's an emotional link between Newtown and Ilion.

Story continues

""Are people disappointed and distraught?"" Stephens asked. ""Do they feel bad and are they sad? Absolutely! Absolutely! I would never wish that on anyone, never. But as far as an emotional attachment between us and them, I don't see it.""

Stephens voiced a sentiment heard frequently in this largely conservative area: New York's law and the sweeping gun regulation package proposed recently by President Barack Obama are wrongheaded.

The New York law, starting when Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed it Jan. 15, defined as illegal assault weapons semi-automatic rifles that accept detachable magazines and have one additional military-style feature such as a pistol grip, flash suppressor or bayonet mount. The old law required two such features.

At the State Bowling Center next to the Remington factory, Rod Brown said the weapon that the Newtown gunman used could easily have been a Smith & Wesson or a Browning instead of a Bushmaster model.

Kelley Holmes-Morton in her salon, Heads-R-Turning, said she is a National Rifle Association member who believes gun makers are not to blame. And Betty Watkins said as she pumped gas that the Second Amendment, about people's right to bear arms, is being ""pushed around and misused.""

Robbi Breit at the Sellers Avenue consignment shop seemed more conflicted than others in Ilion but still feels that closing Remington won't end gun violence.

""I cried my heart out"" after Sandy Hook, she said. ""I'm torn between both sides. But you can get another job. You can't get another kid.""

Bushmaster is owned by Freedom Group Inc., the largest firearms maker in the U.S., which has its headquarters on Remington Drive outside the neighboring small towns of Madison and Mayodan, N.C.

No guns or ammunition are manufactured there. Most people around know the 43,000-square-foot building near the high school and the Walmart as the home of Remington Arms, which moved to the site in the mid-1990s, and not the weapons conglomerate Freedom Group has become, said Mayodan Town Manager Michael Brandt.

""They're not big contributors to the community like a typical large company would be in an area,"" Brandt said. ""This is where they're located, but we don't really see much of them.""

Word that Freedom Group is for sale and changes are looming has generated little local concern in an area where surviving textile producers and a Miller-Coors brewery are bigger employers, said Sharon Chirichella, who runs a temporary staffing agency and is an officer with the local chamber of commerce.

That contrasts with Ilion, where the concern among people is the future of Remington. The company had said last March it could leave New York if the state went ahead with a move to add unique identifying information on spent bullet casings. That proposal is off the table, but people in town wonder where things stand in the wake of the new state law, which does not affect Remington's ability to manufacture military-style weapons.

""If I'm an executive at Remington, what's my attitude going to be toward the state that bans one of the premier products that I produce?"" local Assemblyman Marc Butler asked.

Obama's gun control proposal added more uncertainty. Jamie Rudwall, who has worked at the plant since 1995 and is president of the United Mine Workers of America Local 717, said he expected the gun business to increase in the short term amid new regulatory proposals, but he worries about jobs in Ilion long term.

""We've been here almost 200 years,"" he said. ""I hope to be here another 200.""

Here’s the problem: Universal background checks are the most insidious of all the gun control measures pushed heretofore. They will rob of us of more freedom than an “assault weapons” ban and a “high capacity” magazine ban combined, all in the name of preventing another Sandy Hook shooting. Yet they will actually do nothing to prevent such a shooting. Nothing at all.

As David Kopel so ably put it in his Jan. 30 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, universal background checks necessitate a gun registry if they are to be enforceable.

Put simply, this means that once a universal background state statute is in place, the government will require you to register every gun you own–shotguns, rifles, and handguns–so that they can be sure you do not sell a gun privately.

Which brings us to our second point: universal background checks will end private sales, period. No more sales to neighbors, no more sales between a father and his son or a mother and her daughter. No more sales between friends.

Once guns are registered, and private sales have been ended, the door will be opened for taxes allocated per number of guns owned, forced liability insurance payable based on number of guns owned, and for outright gun confiscation.

The NRA has warned about the confiscation that usually follows registration, historically speaking, and the Democrats themselves are already promoting per-gun taxes and liability insurance.

The bottom line: Universal background checks represent the crest of the hill atop the slippery slope. We must contact our Reps. and Sens. and demand that they say no to this insidious gun control measure.

It has nothing to with Sandy Hook Elementary, but everything to do with helping Democrats realize their dreams of crushing the 2nd Amendment."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/06/Criminals-Continue-to-Ignore-Gov-Efforts-to-Make-DC-Gun-Free,2013-07-06 00:00:00,['Brandon Darby'],Recent D.C. Arrests Demonstrate Futility of Gun Bans,"Washington, D.C. has historically been one of America’s most difficult places for law-abiding citizens to obtain and own a firearm, especially a handgun. D.C. had a complete ban on handguns since 1976 until a 2008 Supreme Court decision, District of Columbia v. Heller, that struck down what was ruled an unconstitutional ban.

“Local lawmakers in DC have managed to keep a de facto ban in tact by making it very difficult for law-abiding citizens to get guns,” said AWR Hawkins, Ph.D, a military historian and writer for Breitbart News. He pointed out in an interview for this article that D.C. officials’ gun control efforts only affect law-abiding citizens while criminals simply ignore the laws.

He pointed out that criminals did not pay attention to the past unconstitutional handgun ban or any of the D.C. rules on keeping guns unloaded and unlocked or disassembled. Dr. Hawkins explained his views on the previous formal ban and the now de facto ban:

These laws clearly give criminals the upper hand in at least two ways: 1) They make it clear that law-abiding citizens will be unarmed (defenseless) against an armed attack as they go through their daily routines on the streets of DC. 2) These laws are so burdensome they actually dissuade people from getting guns to begin with.

Dr. Hawkins’ analysis is reinforced greatly by the recent July 2, 2013 prison sentences handed down in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to six narcotics traffickers and money launderers. The U.S. Attorney’s office said “agents and detectives seized multiple handguns, more than a kilogram of powder cocaine, large quantities of crack cocaine, and over $40,000 in cash.”

The U.S. Attorney’s office described the investigation that led to the six arrests, prosecutions, and sentences as “a long-term investigation.” This indicates that the area’s gun-bans resulted in an extended period of time where the only people carrying firearms were criminals with no regard for law. The case further indicates that even with some of the nation’s strictest guns laws, it took a long-term effort to apprehend and charge gun-toting felons and prevent their guns from being a threat to law-abiding citizens who are left defenseless against such criminals."
http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/obama-stinging-gun-bill-defeat-personal-political-234849868--politics.html,,[],"For Obama, stinging gun bill defeat is personal and political","What happens to a president who romps to re-election, channels a national tragedy that sparked coast-to-coast outrage into a deeply personal crusade, then fails to get a measure backed by 9 out of 10 Americans through the Senate, where his party holds a majority? Thanks to the NRA-fueled defeat of a bill that might have mildly tightened limits on gun sales, President Barack Obama is learning the hard way.

For the families of those killed or wounded by gun violence and who watched with judging eyes as the Senate killed the measure by a vote of 54-46 (it needed a supermajority of 60 votes to pass), what to make of the vote was an easy call.

“Shame on you!” Patricia Maisch shouted from the visitors gallery above the Senate floor.

Maisch, a grandmotherly figure who disarmed the shooter in the Tucson carnage that nearly claimed the life of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, was happy to elaborate as reporters swarmed her after the vote. “I decided I could not sit still,” she said. “They have no souls, they have no compassion.”

But on Wednesday, they had the votes.

That’s Message One for Obama from this stinging legislative defeat: Having emotion and the majority on your side isn’t enough. NRA leader Wayne LaPierre, after all, didn't even need to show up.

The knock on Obama has often been that he’s Mr. Spock, viewing his approach as the most logical and assuming that logic will trump the other side’s arguments and emotions. But only the most cynical observers will argue that the president didn’t take this fight personally—with frequent flashes of very public anger and anguish ever since the slaughter of 20 schoolchildren at Sandy Hook Elementary. And supporters of the legislation deployed the families of the slain as lobbyists in the weeks leading up to the vote.

Moreover, as the White House never tired of pointing out, polls show roughly 90 percent of Americans support expanded background checks.

""I will put everything I've got into this, and so will Joe,"" Obama promised in January, with Vice President Biden at his side. ""But I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it.""

Story continues

In the end, though, four red-state Democrats joined 41 of the Senate's 45 Republicans to defeat the bill. Why stick their necks out for legislation whose death in the Republican-led House of Representatives was essentially foreordained?

""It came down to politics—the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment,"" Obama said in a passionate assessment in the White House Rose Garden after the vote. ""And obviously, a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too. And so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse—any excuse—to vote 'no.'""

That would seem to bode ill for Obama in the early months of a second term. A re-elected president at perhaps the height of his persuasive powers couldn't even get his own party in line behind this widely popular measure.

Obama's 2012 campaign juggernaut, overhauled and renamed Organizing for Action—an unprecedented grassroots effort devoted entirely to advancing his agenda—didn't tip the balance. There will be hard votes in the future on immigration, on taxes and spending, maybe on energy and climate change. He's doomed!

Message Two: No, he's not.

Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a staunch conservative and fierce Obama critic, told Yahoo News that Wednesday's vote was a fight over the Second Amendment. ""I wouldn't think it has any broader implication"" for Obama's agenda, he said.

So no spillover effect on immigration? ""I don't think so,"" Cornyn said.

Sure, former President George W. Bush's second term never really recovered from his failed push to partly privatize Social Security. But that effort was powerfully unpopular, including among Republicans, while the goal of tamping down gun violence is broadly popular.

Which brings up Message Three: Obama's push on gun safety has suffered a terrible setback, but it's far from over.

Surrounded in the Rose Garden by parents of slain Sandy Hook schoolchildren, Obama never said the words ""2014 mid-term elections."" He didn't need to.

""We can do more if Congress gets its act together. And if this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters,"" he declared. ""You need to let your representatives in Congress know that you are disappointed, and that if they don’t act this time, you will remember come election time.""

Maybe, but Message Four is that this White House needs to get better organized.

Democrats from states with large gun-owning populations complained privately that the Obama operation never seemed to know how to talk to gun owners. Several told Yahoo News that Obama hasn't really moved past his 2008 depiction of small-town Americans who ""cling to guns or religion."" Gun rights-favoring media, too, complained about the message.

There was a weird, telling little moment in the debate that highlighted the White House's struggle.

In early April, top Obama pollster Joel Benenson wrote a New York Times op-ed describing a poll his firm conducted that found, as he described it, that Americans don't really know what the country's gun laws actually say. Benenson was trying to beat back the core NRA argument against new gun laws: that authorities must enforce existing gun laws. But his column sent another message: that Team Obama had not really scrutinized the NRA argument until April.

Watch the entire speech on Yahoo! News:"

But if policymakers stop publicly arguing over gun control -- either because legislation appears moribund or because debates over fiscal and spending issues crowd it out -- the news media are likely to stop caring about it, too."

The bill was drawn up by a bipartisan task force created after the Dec. 14 Newtown massacre

It adds more than 100 weapons to the state%27s ban on assault weapons and requires background checks for all weapon sales

Also establishes the nation%27s first statewide registry for people convicted of crimes involving dangerous weapons

Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy signed the nation's most far-reaching gun control bill Thursday, the ceremony in Hartford concluding several emotional weeks of debate and compromise since the state was rocked and the world stunned by the mass murder of children in Newtown.

""This is a profoundly emotional day for everyone in this room,"" Malloy, a Democrat, said moments before signing the bill. He added that he hoped the state's bipartisan effort would provide an example for Congress.

""When 92% of Americans agree that every gun sale should be subject to a background check, there is no excuse"" not to make it federal law, Malloy said.

The Connecticut law adds more than 100 weapons to the state's ban on assault weapons, limits the capacity of ammo magazines and requires background checks for all weapon sales, including at gun shows.

It also establishes the nation's first statewide registry for people convicted of crimes involving dangerous weapons. Access to the registry would be available only to law enforcement.

READ:Bill summary

Nicole Hockley's 6-year-old, Dylan, was among the 20 children who died when Adam Lanza began shooting inside Sandy Hook Elementary on Dec. 14. He also killed six adult staff before killing himself. Hockley said she appreciated the bipartisan political effort that led to the law.

""While I am grateful for the progress being made, I wish more than anything that I was just back at home waiting for both Dylan and Jake to come home from school,"" she said.

Hockley said her effort to press the law forward was one way to honor her son's life. ""We want Newtown to be known not for tragedy, but for transformation,"" Hockley said.

The state House voted early Thursday in favor of the 139-page bill crafted by leaders from both major parties. The bill passed the Senate in a 26-10 vote Wednesday. Both bodies are Democrat-controlled.

The bill drew angry protests at the Capitol this week, with some gun rights supporters booing leading advocates of the bill. But in Newtown the bill and the bipartisan effort involved in its passage were warmly received.

Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman on Thursday thanked the families of all the victims for their leadership in the effort. ""I've been amazed at the strength of the families since that day at Newtown,"" said Wyman, a Democrat. ""Today won't make up for all that went on that day. But I have gained so much strength from these families, and I thank you.""

Newtown First Selectman Pat Llodra, the town's chief executive officer and a Republican, said she is ""pleased for the most part"" with the legislation.

""It includes action on some of the most critical elements in gun control and certainly signifies to the rest of the country — and maybe the world — that significant, meaningful change can come about through the political process,"" Llodra said.

The bill was drawn up by a bipartisan task force assembled after the Dec. 14 Newtown massacre.

""The tragedy in Newtown demands a powerful response, demands a response that transcends politics,"" said Senate President Donald Williams.

While Republican state Sen. John Kissel of Enfield acknowledged that ""you just can't have a heart at all if you don't feel for the families and friends and neighbors of the victims of that Newtown massacre,"" he expressed concern that the law is ultimately harmful to lawful gun owners.

""When it comes to further regulations on guns and ammunition in one of the states that's touted as having, right now, some of the most tough gun laws in the United States of America, I think it goes one step too far,"" said Kissel, who opposed the bill.

But Wyman said the intent was not to take away anyone's rights. ""The intent is simply to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them,"" she said.

Among the law's provisions are a requirement of eligibility certificates for the purchase of any rifle, shotgun or ammunition. Penalties for illegal possession and firearms trafficking would also be significantly increased.

In addition to the controls on guns and ammunition, the law sets safety standards for school buildings, allow mental health training for teachers and expand mental health research in the state.

The law does not ban large-capacity magazines outright, but grandfathers them in from Jan. 1, 2014. The magazines can be loaded only with 10 or fewer rounds, except in the owner's home or at a shooting range. Owners must register the magazines by year's end.

Thursday would have been the 7th birthday of Ana Marquez-Greene, who died at Sandy Hook. In an op-ed column appearing Thursday in USA TODAY, her parents, Jimmy Greene and Nelba Marquez-Greene, write:

""We don't need new laws to begin strengthening the bonds of family and community. We can be more giving, loving parents, friends and neighbors. We can offer love to those who are outcasts or alone. We can look to God and form an eternal relationship built from nothing but love.

""But we must do more. Today (Thursday), the governor of our home state of Connecticut will sign historic bipartisan legislation designed by legislators to make our communities safer. Their cooperative spirit should be a model for Congress, when the Senate considers legislation next week to reduce gun violence.""

From the Washington Post/ABC poll taken April 11-14, 2013.

The latest Washington Post/ABC poll shows little deviation in American views about new gun legislation from what we've been seeing in other polls since the elementary school slaughter in Newtown, Connecticut, four months ago. Americans, the poll showed, still support changes that would tighten rules on owning firearms. By a small plurality, however, 49 percent to 45 percent, they disapprove of how President Obama is handling the matter.

The poll, which also inquired about views on immigration, budget cuts, jobs and the economy, included 13 questions on guns.

Among them:

• Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons? 56 percent supported, 42 percent opposed.

• Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on high-capacity ammunition clips, meaning those containing more than 10 bullets? 56 percent support, 41 percent oppose.

• Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online? 86 percent support, 13 percent oppose.

• Say someone legally sells a gun that later is used in a crime. Do you think the crime victim should or should not be able to sue the gun seller for damages? 24 percent say they should be able to sue, 72 percent say they should not.

• Do you or does anyone in your house own a gun, or not? 43 percent say yes, 55 percent say no.

The proposal came hours ahead of the release late Tuesday morning of the National Rifle Association's report on school safety proposals. The NRA commissioned the study in the wake of the Newtown shooting, as the group pushed for enhanced school security rather than measures to curb gun ownership.

The Connecticut deal, by contrast, focuses on gun control measures -- though it left some on both sides of the debate unhappy. Gun control advocates, and particularly families of those killed or injured in the December Newtown shooting, were disappointed the proposal only included a ban on new high-capacity magazines -- and not existing ones.

And gun-rights groups argued that the latest proposal would not have prevented the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

""They can register magazines and do all the rest of this stuff. It isn't going to do anything,"" said Robert Crook, executive director of the Connecticut Coalition of Sportsmen.

Gun owners, who've packed public hearings at the state Capitol in recent months, voicing their opposition to various gun control measures, are concerned they've been showing up ""for virtually nothing"" after learning about the bill, Crook said.

""Clearly we've made our point,"" Crook said. ""But I don't know what anybody can do at this point in time.""

Connecticut lawmakers announced a deal Monday which would include a ban on new high-capacity ammunition magazines like the ones used in the massacre that left 20 children and six educators dead. The proposal includes new registration requirements for existing magazines that carry 10 or more bullets.

The package also creates what lawmakers said is the nation's first statewide dangerous weapon offender registry, creates a new ""ammunition eligibility certificate,"" imposes immediate universal background checks for all firearms sales, and extends the state's assault weapons ban to 100 new types of firearms and requires that a weapon have only one of several features in order to be banned.

The newly banned weapons could no longer be bought or sold in Connecticut, and those legally owned already would have to be registered with the state, just like the high-capacity magazines.

""No gun owner will lose their gun,"" said House Minority Leader Lawrence Cafero Jr., a Norwalk Republican. ""No gun owner will lose their magazines.""

The bill also addresses mental health and school security measures.

The shooting Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School reignited the gun debate in the country and led to calls for increased gun control legislation on the federal and state levels. While some other states, including neighboring New York, have strengthened their gun laws, momentum has stalled in Congress, whose members were urged by President Obama last week not to forget the shooting and to capitalize on the best chance in years to stem gun violence.

Connecticut should be seen as an example for lawmakers elsewhere, said Senate President Donald E. Williams Jr., a Brooklyn Democrat.

""In Connecticut, we've broken the mold,"" he said. ""Democrats and Republicans were able to come to an agreement on a strong, comprehensive bill. That is a message that should resound in 49 other states and in Washington, D.C. And the message is: We can get it done here and they should get it done in their respective states and nationally in Congress.""

The proposal was revealed to rank-and-file lawmakers Monday after weeks of bipartisan, closed-door negotiations among legislative leaders. A vote was expected Wednesday in the General Assembly, where Democrats control both chambers, making passage all but assured. The bill would then be sent to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who has helped lead efforts to strengthen the state's gun laws but has not yet signed off on the proposed legislation.

Earlier in the day on Monday, Malloy voiced support for the Newtown families and their desire to ban the possession of large-capacity magazines.

Ron Pinciaro, executive director of Connecticut Against Gun Violence, said his group will live with the lawmakers' decision not to ban them as other states have done. He said the leaders made their decision based on what was politically feasible.

""We have to be satisfied. There are still other things that we want, we'll be back for in later sessions,"" he said. ""But for now, it's a good thing.""

Six relatives of Newtown victims visited the Capitol on Monday, asking lawmakers to ban existing high-capacity magazines. Some handed out cards with photographs of their slain children.

Allowing magazines that carry 10 or more bullets to remain in the hands of gun owners would leave a gaping loophole in the law, said Mark Barden, whose 7-year-old son, Daniel, was killed in the shooting.

""It doesn't prevent someone from going out of the state to purchase them and then bring them back. There's no way to track when they were purchased, so they can say, `I had this before,""' Barden said. ""So it's a big loophole.""

Jake McGuigan, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which is based in Newtown, said he wouldn't comment on the proposal until he saw it in the writing, but he questioned the mechanics of a registry for magazines.

""How will they register a magazine? It seems a little weird,"" he said.

President Obama meets Thursday with survivors of gun violence and law enforcement officials

Families of four victims killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School are featured in a gripping new TV ad aimed at spurring action by Congress to reduce gun violence.

""Don't let the memory of Newtown fade without doing something real,"" pleads Terri Rousseau, whose daughter, Lauren, was a teacher at the Connecticut school where 20 children and six adults were killed on Dec. 14.

The ad is the first to feature Newtown families and coincides with President Obama's meeting Thursday at the White House with survivors of gun violence and law enforcement officials. There are also more than 120 events planned across the country in a National Day to Demand Action on reducing gun violence, led by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which sponsors the new commercials.

The Senate is expected to take up gun legislation in April, but the measure will not include a proposed ban on assault weapons and a limit on the ammunition contained in magazine clips. The legislation will incorporate bills to enhance background checks for gun owners, reduce gun trafficking and improve school safety.

In the spot, Neil Heslin speaks in the ad of dropping off his son, Jesse Lewis, at Sandy Hook and then receiving a 911 call about the shooting. An emotional Heslin told his story at a Senate hearing in February on the gun ban.

""I want to prevent any other family from having to go through what we're going through,"" said Chris McDonnell, father of 7-year-old Grace, who died in the rampage.

The ad also features Jillian Soto, sister of Vicki, who was a teacher at Sandy Hook. The commercial is running in the Hartford TV market because the Connecticut Legislature is considering gun-control bills.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns is co-chaired by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. Bloomberg in particular has been a vocal gun-control advocate, using both the mayors' group and his own super PAC to push for new legislation."

The Des Moines Register

EMC Insurance of Des Moines insures 85 percent to 90 percent of all Kansas school districts

Company refuses to renew coverage for schools allowing teachers%2C custodians to carry weapons

Insurance officials say decision all about risk

DES MOINES, Iowa -- A new Kansas law allowing gun owners to carry weapons in public buildings, including schools, has thrust a major Des Moines-based insurer into the national gun control debate.

The EMC Insurance Cos. insures 85 percent to 90 percent of all Kansas school districts and has refused to renew coverage for schools that permit teachers and custodians to carry concealed firearms on their campuses under the new law, which took effect July 1. It's not a political decision, but a financial one based on the riskier climate it estimates would be created, the insurer said.

""We've been writing school business for almost 40 years, and one of the underwriting guidelines we follow for schools is that any on-site armed security should be provided by uniformed, qualified law enforcement officers,"" said Mick Lovell, EMC's vice president for business development. ""Our guidelines have not recently changed.""

The Kansas Legislature passed the law after the fatal shootings of 20 elementary school children in Newtown, Conn., in December.

The law is similar to one in Utah. Around the country, firearms groups have called on schools to let teachers and staff carry weapons to protect children and prevent mass shootings.

A smaller Des Moines-area insurer — Continental Western Group, based in Urbandale — has followed EMC's lead with a similar position in response to the new law, according to the Kansas Association of School Boards' insurance program.

So has Wright Specialty Insurance, based in New York.

As of Saturday, no Kansas school districts had adopted a policy of allowing people with concealed carry permits on their campuses as permitted under the new law, said David Shriver, director of the Kansas school board association's insurance program.

Bob Skow, chief executive officer of the Independent Insurance Agents of Iowa, said he's not surprised by the companies' decisions. Insurance is all about risk and about pricing the cost of coverage in a way that correctly reflects it. That's one of the reasons many schools have gotten rid of their trampolines, he said.

""It's one thing to have a trained peace officer with a gun in school; it's a completely different situation when you have a custodian or a teacher with a gun,"" Skow said. ""That changes the risk of insuring a school and magnifies it considerably.""

Insurers simply don't know how to price the added risk yet, he said, but they know it's there.

While a trampoline can hurt one person, modern weapons have the potential to kill many people very quickly, he said, in a reference to Newtown. Adam Lanza, 20, fatally shot 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School there Dec. 14 before taking his own life.

Other shootings at schools include the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School, which caused 15 deaths and 21 injuries, and a 2007 shooting spree at Virginia Tech, which produced 33 deaths and 23 injuries. Mass shootings have claimed 934 lives in 146 shootings over the past seven years, according to a study by USA TODAY.

After the Newtown shootings, the National Rifle Association and its political allies called for an armed officer in every school. As stated on the NRA's website, the organization blames ""Gun-Free School Zones"" for turning American schools into the ""safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk.""

NRA opponents have called for stricter gun control to reduce the availability of firearms. Ladd Everitt, director of communications for the Washington, D.C.-based Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said he wasn't surprised that EMC and other insurers were balking at covering the risk of the new Kansas law.

""This is a logical response from insurers to a risk nightmare,"" Everitt said. ""Putting a teacher or an administrator with little firearms training in a school with a loaded weapon is clearly a threat to everyone, including the kids.""

Forrest Knox, the Kansas state senator who is the chief advocate of the new gun law, maintains that having legal guns in schools and other government buildings could prevent injuries. He's been pushing the legislation for years.

Knox said that local governments are free to opt out of the law allowing weapons in public buildings, but only 300 of the 3,000 counties and municipalities in Kansas have sent letters to the state attorney general seeking exemptions.

He said three community colleges in and around his district in Altoona, Kan., have found an insurer who will work with them. Shriver, the Kansas school board group insurance director, identified the company as IMA, or Insurance Management Association, which he described as a brokerage that would market the coverage to different companies.

He identified the schools as Independence Community College, Labette Community College and Neosho County Community College.

""I'm not an insurance expert, but it's hard for me to believe that if schools and other public buildings allow law-abiding citizens to carry that that increases risk — it's news to me,"" Knox said. ""Law enforcement responds better (to school shootings now), but it still takes a few minutes, and a lot of damage can be done in a few minutes."""

He is the editor of the politics blog The Dean’s Report and co-host of a new CNN podcast “The Big Three” that looks at the top three stories of the week. Follow him on Twitter @deanofcomedy.

(CNN) —

“I don’t consider criminal background checks to be gun control.”

Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey made this profound statement earlier this week while announcing a bipartisan Senate agreement to expand background checks to almost all gun purchasers.

Toomey is absolutely correct. Background checks are not about gun control, they’re about human safety. Having checks will make it more difficult for criminals and the insane to obtain guns.

Yet, despite polls showing that over 90% of Americans support universal background checks, it took a “breakthrough” deal to get this proposal simply to a vote by the U.S. Senate. What’s worse, there’s no guarantee this legislation will pass the Republican-controlled House.

Congress’ exasperating struggle to enact a law supported by most Americans is topic No. 1 of this week’s episode of the CNN podcast, “The Big Three,” co-hosted by CNN Opinion contributors Margaret Hoover, John Avlon and myself. Each week we look at three big issues from the week.

The second big issue is the death of Great Britain’s former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Is the fawning over her justified or did her failings outweigh her accomplishments?

And third, is the new song by country singer Brad Paisley and rapper LL Cool J, titled, “The Accidental Racist,” racially insensitive, or in today’s hypersensitive climate is it simply impossible to discuss race without causing an outcry?

Here’s a brief summary of this week’s episode:

1. Gun safety laws

Newsweek/Barry Morgenstein/Dean Obeidallah

John Avlon discussed the cowardice of the Republican senators who threatened a filibuster to prevent a vote on the proposed universal background check law, a point he also raised in his most recent column. Margaret Hoover – a reasonable voice on the right (almost an oxymoron) – agreed that Republican senators like Ted Cruz could cause the entire GOP to appear as extremists if they prevented a vote on this proposal via filibuster. I made the case that we need to stop calling these measures “gun control” laws and instead label them as “human safety” laws because the focus is on saving lives, not grabbing guns.

I also raised the point: Is the second amendment out of date? It was enacted when we had 13 states, a population of 4 million and muskets. Should we consider revising or repealing the second amendment to bring it up to date with today’s world so that owning guns is a privilege rather than a right?

2. Death of Margaret Thatcher

Margaret Hoover, a big Thatcher fan, shared the thrill of meeting the former prime minister years ago. I refused to speak ill of the recently deceased Thatcher. So instead, I read excerpts from a recent op-ed penned by British comedian Russell Brand (we all know comedians tend to write the best opinion pieces). Brand was highly critical of Thatcher’s reign. John and Margaret both defended Thatcher from Brand’s allegations that she was an uncaring person who favored the wealthy at the expense of the working class.

3. ‘The Accidental Racist’

Paisley and LL Cool J recorded a song in the hopes of easing racial tension and fostering more understanding. Instead, their song was met by almost universal criticism. Some said the lyrics are culturally insensitive, others said it’s just bad. All three of us agreed that some of the lyrics were ridiculous, such as LL Cool J’s line: “If you don’t judge my gold chains/I’ll forget the iron chains.” Was LL really saying that if a White man doesn’t judge his choice of flashy jewelry, then Black Americans should forget slavery? But the bigger point we discussed is that it’s almost impossible to talk about race in America without being attacked by people on both the far left and far right. I also tell a joke about “White people” that I had performed last month on a TV show that generated an avalanche of angry tweets and e-mails. Just shows, we’ve gone a long way to go.

We hope you will give a listen to this episode of “The Big Three” – and let us know what you think about the issues we discussed.

Republican state Rep. Carole Murray told FoxNews.com she doesn’t appreciate “East Coast politics” interfering in her state.

The concern comes ahead of a tense Senate vote -- which could come late next week -- and after a vote in the House that prompted the White House to take the unusual step of lobbying wavering Democrats. Biden’s office confirmed to FoxNews.com he made four phone calls to Colorado Democrats, two in moderate districts, but did not say what they were about.

Multiple sources, though, tell FoxNews.com that about eight hours into last week’s 12-hour House debate, Biden called Democrats Mark Ferrandino, Mike McLachlan, Tony Exum and Dominick Moreno to solidify support for the measures and to “remind them about the importance of the legislation.”

House lawmakers in Colorado, home to two of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, narrowly passed a handful of gun control bills last week. The measures are headed to the Senate in early March where they are expected to face an uphill battle, though it's unclear what steps the White House might take this time to solidify support.

Explaining the substance of the Biden call last week, Exum told The Denver Post the vice president ""said it would send a strong message to the rest of the country that a western state had passed gun-control bills.""

One measure would limit magazines to 15 rounds for firearms and eight for shotguns. Every House Republican, as well as three Democrats, voted against that measure, which passed 34-31. The House also approved a bill requiring background checks on all gun purchases, including those between private sellers and firearms bought online.

The third proposal would ban concealed firearms at colleges and stadiums, while the fourth would require gun purchasers to pay for their own background checks. The closest vote was on the background check measure, which passed on a 33-32 vote.

Republicans argue that the proposals restrict their Second Amendment rights and have called the bills a “knee-jerk reaction” to the recent mass shootings in Colorado and Connecticut.

Though Democrats have a majority in both Colorado chambers, they will have a tougher time passing the legislation in the Senate, where they have only a 20-15 majority. That means Republicans and other gun rights supporters need to turn only three Democrats to defeat the bills.

Colorado has taken center stage in the country’s fight over gun control. As the White House struggles to pass gun control legislation on Capitol Hill, where a Republican majority in the House ensures that only a bipartisan bill can make it through, a successful push for such legislation in the purple, pro-gun rights state of Colorado would be seen as a major victory.

Lawyer Jan Baran, though, said lobbying state legislators from Washington would only venture into illegal territory if Biden made a promise of money for a vote.

“Unless it’s some very specific promise that involves money, it’s just good ol’ politics,” Baran said.

Colorado has attracted national interest from the National Rifle Association as well. David Keene, president of the NRA, went to Denver last month to meet with Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper and Senate President John Morse.

Keene called universal background checks a political “sweet spot” and added that the current background check systems are underfunded and that forcing them on private sales would be logistically difficult.

Hickenlooper has said in the past he supports background checks but has flip-flopped on almost every other gun control issue – something Republicans point to as proof he’s being politically pressured.

While unusual, this is not the first time the White House has meddled in state battles.

In May 2002, negotiations over two New York congressional districts intensified after a panel of federal judges approved a plan to eliminate them, but said it was still “willing, indeed eager” to let state lawmakers create a fair plan of their own. Vice President Dick Cheney called the Republican leader of the state Senate to discuss concerns about the lines the court had drawn.

In February 2000, President Clinton used a meeting of the National Governors Association to recruit governors to lobby for a bill that would normalize trading relations with China, as part of a broad effort to build support for China’s administration to the World Trade Organization.

In June 1994, then-first lady Hillary Clinton pitched her husband’s universal health care plan to a group of Oklahoma state lawmakers, a labor leader and hospital administrators. One person who attended the event told The Saturday Oklahoman that “the implication” was there that they should ask the delegation to support the Clinton plan."

By Tom Brown

MIAMI, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Florida lawmakers will hold hearings this fall on the state's ""Stand Your Ground"" self-defense law, which has become a lightning rod for criticism following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.

The announcement on Friday by Will Weatherford, the speaker of Florida's House of Representatives, marked the biggest concession yet by the state's Republican leaders to protesters' demands for a top-to-bottom review of the law, which allows people in fear of serious injury to use deadly force to defend themselves rather than retreat.

Since Zimmerman's acquittal on July 13, Martin's grieving parents, backed by African-American civic leaders, celebrities, students and political figures, including President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, have all said the Stand Your Ground law needs to be re-examined.

Weatherford, in an opinion column published in the Tampa Tribune, said he had asked Representative Matt Gaetz, a fellow Republican who chairs the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee, to lead the hearings. Weatherford did not set a date for the hearings or say how long they would last.

""Across Florida, representatives are receiving calls, letters, visits and emails from constituents with diverse opinions on 'Stand Your Ground,'"" Weatherford said. ""Passions are high, but every person has the right to express their views on this matter of great importance.""

""It's a critical step,"" said Phillip Agnew, who heads a group of young demonstrators calling themselves the Dream Defenders who have staged a nearly month-long sit-in outside Governor Rick Scott's office in a bid to change the law. ""We're excited about having an open debate,"" he told Reuters.

Advocates of the law, the first of its kind in the country and now copied in more than 20 other states, say violent crime has fallen since it was enacted.

But critics see the self-defense law as emblematic of racial bias and unequal justice in America, since some studies have shown that defense claims made under the law are far more likely to be successful when the victim is black.

Two of the six jurors in the Zimmerman case have said the Stand Your Ground law left them with no option but to acquit him.

""Our evaluation of its (the law's) effectiveness should be guided by objective information, not by political expediency,"" Weatherford wrote.

""Does the law keep the innocent safer? Is it being applied fairly? Are there ways we can make this law clearer and more understandable?"" he asked.

Most U.S. voters support the ""Stand Your Ground"" laws, although the question of whether to retreat or use deadly force in self defense divides Americans along gender, racial and political lines, a national Quinnipiac University poll found on Friday.

The poll found that a strong majority of white voters and men support the laws, while black voters generally oppose them and women are almost evenly divided. (Reporting by Tom Brown; additional reporting by Bill Cotterell editing by Jackie Frank)"

President Obama will promote his plan to battle gun violence on Monday in Minneapolis because that community is doing some of the things he wants to see nationally.

Minneapolis has launched a youth violence initiative that has seen some success; and sheriffs in Minnesota have worked to improve the state's background check system for gun buyers.

During his visit Monday, Obama will ""discuss with local leaders and law enforcement officials his comprehensive set of common sense ideas to reduce gun violence,"" the White House says.

The president has called for universal background checks, renewal of an assault weapons ban, and restrictions on the size of ammunition magazines, as well as new school safety and mental health programs.

The gun-control push comes in the wake of a series of mass shootings, including the Dec. 14 attack on an elementary school in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six adults.

Obama has vowed to promote his plan in appearances across the country.

Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau and Hennepin County Sheriff Richard Stanek were among the local law enforcement officials who met at the White House this week with Obama and Vice President Biden, who helped develop the White House plan.

""Minneapolis is a city that has taken important steps to reduce gun violence and foster a conversation in the community about what further action is needed,"" said a White House statement. ""President Obama will visit with members of the community about their experiences and discuss additional steps that can be taken at the federal level to reduce gun violence."""

(CNN) —

Florida Gov. Rick Scott met with protesters overnight and defended his position to not amend his state’s controversial “stand your ground” law.

“Tonight, the protesters again asked that I call a special session of the legislature to repeal Florida’s ‘stand your ground’ law,” Scott said in a written statement. “I told them I agree with the Task Force on Citizen Safety and Protection, which concurred with the law.”

Scott issued a proclamation Friday for a “statewide day of prayer for unity.” The proclamation calls Trayvon Martin’s death a tragedy, notes that “emotions are running high” and calls for Floridians to show unity.

Earlier, Scott said that he mourns with Martin’s parents, but that he stands by the findings of the task force, which consulted with citizens and experts.

The protesters are students and members of Dream Defenders, an activist group that participates in civic engagement and promotes nonviolent social change.

They walked into Scott’s office Wednesday, led by Amon Gabriel, 9, and asked to speak to the governor.

After the protesters camped there for three days, Scott met with them overnight and told them he has not changed his position. The Dream Defenders say they will continue their sit-in until their demand is met.

“We’d like the repeal of ‘stand your ground’ or some type of modification where we can hold people responsible to a level that humanity expects, where we don’t have 17-year-olds getting gunned down with no justice for them and their families,” said the group’s legal and policy director, Ahmad Abuznaid.

A call for reforms

On Thursday, Florida officials joined state House Democratic Leader Perry Thurston in urging that reforms be made to the controversial law.

One of those officials, Senate Democratic Leader Chris Smith, is refiling his legislation to change “stand your ground.”

“We have a clear case that shows SYG has very troubling problems, and those problems are central to the well-being of Floridians,” he said.

Though former neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman’s defense never cited “stand your ground” laws in its case, the jury was instructed to consider them during deliberations. The jury acquitted Zimmerman of all charges Saturday in the 2012 shooting death of Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old.

Stevie Wonder says he’ll boycott ‘stand your ground’ states

The Florida version of the law states, “A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.”

Eight other states have laws worded similarly, while 22 total states, including Florida, have laws stating residents have no “duty” to retreat from a would-be attacker, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Civil rights groups attack the laws as racially motivated and are planning nationwide demonstrations. Stevie Wonder is refusing to perform in any state with such a law.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the laws “try to fix something that was never broken” and now encourage “violent situations to escalate in public.”

But just as adamantly as the laws are decried, the National Rifle Association has stood by the measure it helped many states adopt.

“The attorney general fails to understand that self-defense is not a concept, it’s a fundamental human right,” said Chris W. Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action. “To send a message that legitimate self-defense is to blame is unconscionable.”

What are the chances of repeal?

As for those Dream Defenders at the Florida governor’s office, their protest may be futile. Scott’s office noted that the gubernatorial task force recommends the law stay in place, though with minor tweaks, including limiting neighborhood watches to observing and reporting.

Daniel Webster, director of Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said he doubts the protests will change anything. Overturning laws isn’t incredibly common already, and with Stand Your Ground, there are complicating factors.

The NRA is strong in the 22 states that have the laws, and “I think there is some popular appeal to the notion, the very general notion that citizens should be able to protect themselves and you shouldn’t have to, in essence, run from crime.”

Also, the laws are relatively new, most of them enacted in the past eight years, and it’s unlikely the same legislators who put Stand Your Ground laws on the books would suddenly be inclined to think they were wrong.

“The more common response is they’re going to dig their heels,” he said.

As a parallel, Webster offered the “Draconian” drug-sentencing laws of the 1980s, which hugely expanded incarceration rates, were outrageously expensive and did little in the way of improving public safety. Yet, the country is only now examining those laws and considering their repeal.

“I assume, in part, that’s because the people who passed them are no longer there,” Webster said.

The trickiest factor, however, is that proponents and opponents of Stand Your Ground can find in the Zimmerman case facts to support their beliefs, he said.

One side believes Trayvon attacked Zimmerman, and ZImmerman had no choice but to fire his weapon to defend himself. The other side believes Zimmerman racially profiled Trayvon, followed him against a dispatcher’s order, then shot a teen who was only reacting, perhaps out of fear, to being followed.

“You can find whatever you want to back your assumptions,” Webster said.

Putting on his gun policy expert hat, Webster said he felt the laws are a “very bad idea,” and they don’t do what they were intended to do: deter criminals and protect the citizenry.

Doubts about ‘stand your ground’

After Florida expanded its “Castle Doctrine” laws to a “stand your ground” provision in 2005, the National District Attorneys Association released a report. It said a “diminished sense of public safety” after 9/11, a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system’s ability to protect victims, a perception that due process trumps victims’ rights and a decrease in gun legislation spurred the creation of “stand your ground” laws.

The study cited concerns from law enforcement officials, including doubts that it would deter criminals.

“There must be appreciation among the would-be criminals that deadly force can be used against them, leading to a change in criminal behavior,” the study said. “Unfortunately, attendees at the NDAA symposium expressed little confidence that criminals would take the provisions of the Castle Doctrine into consideration before committing a crime.”

Webster pointed to a Texas A&M University study examining crime in more than 20 states that passed Castle Doctrine or Stand Your Ground laws from 2000 to 2010. Researchers found that not only was there no decrease in robbery, burglary and aggravated assault, but there was an 8% spike in reported murders and non-negligent manslaughter.

“The data are pretty compelling, showing that it increased justifiable homicides and it increased homicides overall,” Webster said. “In all likelihood, it really led to more altercations similar to the Zimmerman-Martin exchange.”

Additional protests this weekend

The Zimmerman verdict has been met by strong reactions.

A national “Justice for Trayvon” day is slated for Saturday in 100 cities, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton. The protesters will call for federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.

The rallies will take place outside of federal court buildings in cities across the country, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.

While Giffords and her husband, former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, testified that they weren’t there as victims but as Americans, the reverse was clearly the case: as shooting victims, they have been trotted out by the left-leaning media to provide Cindy Sheehan-like “absolute moral authority.” The implication: disagree with the politics of these victims, and you don’t care enough about them.

The media coverage of Giffords’ testimony exploited Giffords’ victimhood to the hilt. But The Atlantic led the way with a picture of her “handwritten notes,” which The Atlantic labeled “pen-scrawled words … deliberate … diligent … written on a surface all too familiar to schoolchildren: binder paper.” And, The Atlantic added, “She is trapped in her injury. And few things make that point more powerfully than a piece of binder paper and a hand-scrawled message.”

The Atlantic got the photo from the Washington Post, which had put it up. Buzzfeed, too, put up the photo, quoting the Americans for Responsible Solutions Facebook page:

It will be hard. But the time is now. Be bold. Be courageous. Americans are counting on you” – Like and share Gabby Giffords’ handwritten testimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee on gun violence. Join her and Mark Kelly by texting SOLUTIONS to 90975.

So did ThinkProgress. And Business Insider.

Except that Giffords didn’t scrawl that message. Her speech therapist did.

That doesn’t mean that Giffords doesn’t think the things that her therapist wrote. It does show, however, how far the media is willing to go in order to exploit shooting victims to further the gun control agenda.

It is Giffords’ choice to be there. It is the Democrats’ and media’s and President Obama’s choice to exploit her presence. Then again, the left has never been shy about hiding behind victims to push their politics.

Reid said the Senate would “take a pause and freeze the background check bill where it is” and return to it at an undetermined date, likely with consideration of other proposed amendments.

“We’re going to come back to this bill,” Reid said.

Before making the announcement Thursday afternoon, Reid consulted with the White House about pulling the bill, and the White House supported the move, according to a White House official familiar with the talks.

The underlying bill hasn't been defeated and is still technically on the legislative calendar. As majority leader, Reid can bring up the bill again at a moment's notice.

When the Senate might reconsider the bill remains uncertain and may not occur for weeks or months. Reid said the Senate would move next to consideration of an Internet taxation bill, a proposal that is believed to enjoy bipartisan support.

Before Reid pulled the bill, senators voted Thursday to approve two amendments: One that would deter states from publishing lists of gun owners and a bipartisan plan to bolster federal funding for mental health efforts, including suicide prevention programs.

On Wednesday, senators blocked or defeated proposals that would ban certain military-style assault rifles, limit the size of ammunition magazines and expand background checks to most commercial gun sales. The action on background checks came despite polls showing that nine in 10 Americans support the idea, which was designed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.

Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.), who helped write the bipartisan background check proposal, said Thursday that he supported Reid's decision and was confident the Senate would return to the issue.

""The bottom line is, that the facts were just so clean and clear,"" Manchin said in an interview. ""The bill had been worked on for three months, it took everyone. It sure as heck wasn’t the president’s bill.""

Manchin said he was especially distressed Thursday as he sat listening to colleagues repeat incorrect information about the contents of his proposal.

“They were just getting talking points from somebody, whether it be staff or someone. Trying to find any little wiggle room that they could find to change the interpretation,"" he said.

Manchin said he was especially angry with the National Rifle Association, which had incorrectly claimed that background checks on Internet gun sales would infringe upon people trying to privately sell or transfer weapons to family members or close friends.

Manchin said it was unlikely that most transfers between close family and friends would require posting an advertisement about a weapon online.

""If you’re selling your gun on the Internet to your son, to your cousin or to your close family and friends, you better check your relationships,"" Manchin said.

Other Democrats admitted they should have moved faster to marshal support for the bill.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said that the family members of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School were the most effective advocates for reform.

""The more my colleagues have a chance to talk to them, the more powerful the impact is,"" he said in an interview with The Fold, a Washington Post video program. ""So bringing them into the process earlier, more visibly, might have been something that we could have done. I brought them to private meetings, but maybe we should have accelerated that process.”

The stock prices for Smith & Wesson Holding Co. (SWHC) and Sturm, Ruger & Co. (RGR) rose about 4%. The stock for Sturm, Ruger has risen 13% in the month since the shooting at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school that left 20 children and six educators dead.

Retailers that specialize in guns have also done well. The stock price for Cabela's (CAB) surged 6% on Wednesday and has gained 20% over the last month. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) notched up slightly, and has gained 6% over the month.

Obama issued the call for the assault ban as part of a broad response to the Newtown shooting.

""Congress should restore the ban on military style assault weapons and a 10-round limit for magazines,"" the president said. Obama was referring to a 10-year ban that expired in 2004, which limited the capacity of magazines and restricted military-style features on semiautomatic rifles.

Related: Obama seeks assault weapons ban

But the specter of a potential ban in the wake of mass shootings around the country has prompted gun enthusiasts to stock up on the weapons that may some day be denied to them.

""Consumers are flocking to stores to purchase certain types of firearms, including assault rifles, in fears of some type of ban going forward,"" said Rommel Dionisio, gun industry analyst for Wedbush Securities. ""It's people rushing to buy them before they're banned.""

Dick's said last month that it has suspended sales of assault rifles.

Related: Assault rifles are selling out

Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger manufacture a wide variety of firearms, including the semiautomatic rifles that are known various as assault weapons or modern sporting rifles.

There are many other non-public companies that manufacture semiautomatic rifles, including Bushmaster Firearms International, which makes the rifle used at the Newtown shooting and also a recent shooting in Webster, N.Y., where a convict burned down houses and then ambushed and killed two volunteer firefighters.

Such a ban, if it passes, would also impact manufacturers of high-capacity magazines. They include the Beta Company, which makes 100-round drums, and SGM Tactical, which produces 30-round and 100-round magazines.

Related: A month after Newtown, a massive gun trade show

High-capacity magazines face a potential ban because they were used by Adam Lanza in the Newtown shooting and by James Holmes, suspect in a mass shooting last year at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.

Obama acknowledged that he faces serious opposition in trying to get an assault weapon bill passed by a Republican-controlled House.

Even as Obama spoke, thousands of gun industry members packed into the SHOT Show -- an annual trade show -- in Las Vegas. The show is owned and sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an organization based in Newtown, less than two miles from the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting."

USA TODAY

The White House says President Obama is close to completing a series of executive actions to address gun violence, but they are not a substitute for congressional legislation.

In a report issued Tuesday, the administration has ""completed or made significant progress"" on 21 of 23 executive actions that Obama outlined Jan. 16 as part of a major gun-control initiative.

""But Congress must also act,"" the report says. ""Passing common-sense gun safety legislation, including expanding background checks and making gun trafficking a federal crime, remains the single most important step we could take to reduce gun violence.""

With Obama in Northern Ireland for the G-8 summit, Vice President Biden will discuss the report in a speech Tuesday afternoon.

The Senate blocked a background check bill in April, thanks mostly to the votes of Republicans. Obama administration officials and Senate Democrats are trying to revive the bill by pressuring senators who voted against it to reconsider.

Gun-control opponents say the proposals are ineffective, and undermine the Second Amendment rights to gun ownership.

The Obama administration began pushing for new gun legislation after the Dec. 14 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 students and six educators.

The new White House report listed the executive actions on guns taken by the administration.

Among them: Ending a freeze on federal research into the causes of gun violence, reducing barriers that prevent states from submitting certain records to the existing background check system, and easing the ways in which federal law enforcement agencies can trace guns recovered in investigations.

The report did not mention two other legislative proposals backed by gun-control supporters: A new ban on assault weapons, and restrictions on the size of ammunition magazines. Neither proposal has sufficient support in Congress as of yet.

The White House report says the president's executive actions are designed to address several goals, including improvements to the existing background check system, law enforcement, and school safety, as well as promote responsible gun ownership."

Background checks%2C permit requirements have decreasing homicide rates

States with most laws have lower mortality rates%2C study finds

States with more gun laws have fewer gun-related deaths, according to a new study released Wednesday by Boston Children's Hospital.

The leader investigator behind the research hopes the findings will drive legislators to pass gun reform across the country and increase federal funding to research on gun laws and violence. However, at least one critic argues that the study fails to take into account several important factors such as the types of laws, enforcement of laws, and gun ownership rates in states.

""Our research gives clear evidence that laws have a role in preventing firearms deaths,"" said Eric Fleegler, the study's lead investigator and a pediatric emergency doctor at Boston Children's Hospital. ""Legislators should take that into consideration.""

Fleegler and researchers from Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health studied information from all 50 states between 2007 to 2010, analyzing all firearm-related deaths reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and data on firearm laws compiled by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

States with the most laws had a mortality rate 42% lower than those states with the fewest laws, they found. The strong law states' firearm-related homicide rate was also 40% lower and their firearm-related suicide rate was 37% lower.

Specifically, Fleeger pointed to states with many gun laws like Massachusetts, which had 3.4 gun-related deaths per 100,000 people, and New Jersey, which had 4.9 gun-deaths per 100,000 people. Conversely, he focused on states with less laws like Louisiana, which had 18 deaths per 100,000 individuals and Alaska, which had 17.5 deaths per 100,000 individuals.

The study also found that laws requiring universal background checks and permits to purchase firearms were most clearly associated with decreasing rates of gun-related homicides and suicides.

Despite the findings, researchers did not establish a cause and effect relationship between guns and deaths. Rather, they could only establish an association.

That failure illustrates the limits of the study, said Garen Wintemute, an emergency physician and director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis.

""Policy makers can really draw no conclusion from this study,"" Wintemute said, explaining that the study doesn't provide critical answers to which laws work and why.

The larger problem is that the United States effectively stopped doing research on gun laws and violence 15 years ago and now has no evidence that shows causes and effect, he said.

Wintemute added, however, that he believes gun policies are important and can drive rates of violence down. In the future, researchers must look at how several factors including culture, gun ownership, and gun trafficking between states, he said.

Fleegler and his colleagues became interested in the relationship between gun laws and deaths last summer after the Trayvon Martin case sparked conversations about self-defense laws and the use of guns.

Trayvon, 17, was shot dead in a gated Florida community by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer. Zimmerman, who has plead not guilty to a second-degree murder charge, is claiming self-defense.

""There is very minimal research going on and very minimal funding for the research that is going gone,"" Fleegler said. ""We need to understand these relationships so that we can take action."""

If Connecticut doesn't take the lead to lessen the impact of one of the worst public health problems in the country, the movement could wither.

That's why we'd like to see one part of the bill made stronger, and that concerns large-capacity magazines, here defined as magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The bill immediately bans the sale or purchase of large-capacity magazines going forward. But it allows those who already have them to keep them, and then ties itself in knots creating hard-to-enforce restrictions on their use. Just ban the damn things, as Gov. Dannel P.

We hope that they will take it.

Ripe for the chopping block are Angela Giron, of Pueblo, and senate president John Morse, of Colorado Springs. Both ignored the will of their constituents and pushed for limits on the size of magazines and the extension of background checks to private sales. Now they may lose their jobs.

Because the United States is not a direct democracy, the dismissal of public officials outside the healthy rhythm of regularly scheduled elections is a tool that should be used sparingly. Nevertheless, there remain certain circumstances in which the offenses committed are sufficiently grievous to render such an approach appropriate, which goes some way to explaining why the citizens of Colorado have felt provoked to call for the first recall elections in the state’s 137-year history.

As in New York and Connecticut, lawmakers in Colorado were aware that gun-control efforts benefit immensely from the unlovely combination of legislative haste and emotional rawness — and they leveraged both. During debate, swathes of law-enforcement officers went to the capital to argue against the proposals; they were turned away at the door. Women, many of whom had been the victims of sexual violence, assembled to add their input; they were treated with condescension and impatience — if they were called to speak at all. Citizens who had driven down from other parts of the state were so frustrated at being kept out of committee meetings in Denver that they drove around the capitol building for eight hours honking their horns. This was not, to borrow a favored chant of the Left, what democracy looks like.

But momentum to take action has faded, and we still lose that many lives to gun violence every eight hours on average.

The price of our gun policy can be seen in this breathtaking statistic: More Americans have died from guns here in the United States since 1970 (nearly 1.4 million) than American soldiers have died in all the wars in our country’s history over more than 200 years (about 1.2 million).

Those gun killings have been committed by people like John Lennon (his real name, but no relation to the Beatles star), who, in 2001, used an assault rifle to shoot an acquaintance dead in a quarrel over drugs. Lennon is now locked up at Attica Correctional Facility in Attica, N.Y., and he underscores that while people kill people, so do guns.

“I do take responsibility for the murder; I’m sorry for taking his life, and all the life he could have had,” Lennon writes in an essay that he sent me out of the blue and that I’ve published on my blog. “But without a gun, I would not have killed.”"

Our Capitol Hill neighborhood drowned in the scream of sirens as police cars, vans, trucks, and armored vehicles streaked through the narrow streets at deadly speeds. The skies filled with the constant wapping of countless helicopters.

Just back from dropping children off at school, neighbors began frantically calling, texting and emailing one another to see what was wrong. The crisp morning reminded many of Sept. 11, 2001.

Police dispatched text and email alerts to residents that there was an “active shooter” at the nearby Navy Yard, just blocks from where our children play little league baseball. Many were dead and more injured, we were told.

Then the terrifying news: As many as two more shooters were on the loose and being sought.

D.C. police concluded their advisory to residents with the same admonishment that punctuates every crime alert: “DO NOT TAKE ACTION.” Instead, we are given an “event” number and instructed to call 911.

As any decent American knows, there is no feeling more powerless than to realize that a couple of mass murderers are loose in your neighborhood and you are denied the right to keep a gun to defend yourself, your family, or your home. A sickening knot tightens in your gut.

“DO NOT TAKE ACTION.”

Then came the latest Orwellian phrase in the “homeland security” lexicon: “Shelter in place!”

So, not only are you not allowed to defend yourself against mass murderers, you are not supposed to run from them either.

This, my fellow countrymen, is pure insanity.

And all the terror and real bloody carnage took place inside the most impenetrable fortress of gun control utopia.

The very guns Aaron Alexis used to kill 12 people are banned in this city, unless you submit to an exhaustive, invasive, and expensive process and prove to the city bureaucracy that you are worthy of your Second Amendment rights. Clearly, that failed.

We now know that Alexis was run through to the normal background checks already in place to purchase a gun from a gun dealer. He submitted to even more exhaustive background checks to get his job and access to the Navy Yard. All of those background checks, and he still massacred 12 people.

We also now know that Alexis had multiple run-ins with police in various states and was accused of committing numerous gun crimes, including firing a gun into his neighbor’s occupied apartment and blasting the tires off of a car in a fit of rage. In those cases, existing laws were already in place to nab the lunatic and strip him of his gun rights. For whatever reason, these laws that should have flagged him as a dangerous criminal were not enforced.

So here we are with 12 good people dead, living in the land of gun control, where terror reigns because the criminals have guns and the rest of us are scolded “DO NOT TAKE ACTION” and “Shelter in place!”

The great cartoon philosopher Gary Larson once drew a panel of what he imagined a boneless chicken ranch might look like. Already flightless, the limp birds lay all about unable to even raise their heads with their legs splayed out in ridiculous fashion.

That is what we are here. Flightless and defenseless. As a cartoon about boneless chickens is hilarious; as a way of life, it is terrifying."

“I would say that the likelihood is that they are not going to be able to get assault weapons ban through this Congress,” NRA President David Keene said on CNN’s “State Of The Union.”

Keene’s comments come two days before Vice President Joe Biden is expected to issue a series of recommendations to President Obama on reducing gun violence, and as gun stores in many areas report a dramatic spike in sales.

Biden’s focus has been on requiring universal background checks for gun sales and on limiting sales of high-capacity ammunition clips, two areas that appear to have widespread public support.

But administration officials have indicated that a ban on assault weapons could be included in an overall package of proposals. Obama has endorsed renewing such a ban, which was passed by Congress in 1994 but expired a decade later.

Congress is exhibiting new energy to restrict production and sales of certain firearms, with some pro-gun members speaking out for the first time against the spread of assault weapons.

But it’s far from clear if there’s enough support, particularly among Republicans, to approve a broad ban on such type of military-style guns.

“I think we have the possibility, but it’s going to be difficult,” said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) on CNN. He said prospects were better for Congress to push through restrictions on high-capacity magazines and expanded background checks.

Biden met with NRA officials last week as part of his efforts to reach out to all sides on the issue, but Keene described the meeting as disingenuous, saying that the administration had already made up its mind.

Keene insisted that new measures on assault weapons, as well as on high-volume magazines, would be ineffective in preventing gun violence, arguing instead that the focus should be on mentally ill people and curbing their ability to acquire guns.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Sunday sharply disagreed with Keene’s assessment that the current Congress would not take action on assault weapons.

“No, I think he’s wrong,” Murphy said on CNN. Saying that he believed such a ban would have prevented the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Murphy said: “Newtown fundamentally changed things. The NRA doesn’t get this.”

I'm just checking...","I've been told that here we are a ""reality-based community."" I do see some signs of that as finally, after years of outright hostility towards people who were trying to point out that the Democratic party establishment is on the take by the same moneyed corporatists cartels that own the Republican party establishment, more and more kossacks are beginning to accept that obvious fact.

But there is a topic I want to check on to assess whether we are actually making enough progress when it comes to being a ""reality-based"" community. I'll keep it short, since I think it is pretty straightforward...

You do know that so-called stand-your-ground, concealed-carry, ""castle-doctrine,"" and many other laws and regulations having to do with arming the population to the teeth have been pushed by corporatist business cartels like ALEC, and the gun industry, and the myriad astroturf front groups and think tanks they fund, right?

Now, you may ask, ""why would 'business' groups, or corporatist cartels would put so much effort on arming the population?""

Let's get a couple of facts out the way: The U.S. is in the final stages of a transition towards a plutocratic corporatocracy. I'm going to save space here and instead recommend these three information resources as support to this statement: ""America Is Ruled by Billionaires, and They Are Coming After the Last Shreds of Our Democracy,"" Lawrence Lessig: We the People, and the Republic we must reclaim.

And by now, you must also be aware about the fact that the entire U.S. mainstream media has the overall effect of a mind-numbing propaganda machine that serves the interests of the corrupt ruling class by spreading lies, misinformation, and false narratives. I'll direct you to this information resource: ""America's Sell Out Intellectuals and the Perks They Get.""

Now, after getting that out of the way, hopefully by now you see where I'm going since if those two facts are accepted as such, then the rest is easy to understand...

The ruling elite is currently engaging in a massive looting and pillaging of the country's wealth, mainly by increasingly exploiting and subjugating the citizenry.

Whatever is left of democracy is being systematically dismantled, along with our constitutional rights. The proper functioning of government is being purposely atrophied by a well-planned and systematic de-funding strategy.

That's where all the talk about ""entitlement"" reforms and ""austerity"" is coming from.

As this happens, the social safety net is dismantled, and with it, the social fabric starts to unravel.

Eventually this creates a siege mentality on affected groups, starting with the very poor and dispossessed, followed by those who are near poverty, and up the economic ladder.

This eventually exacerbates divisions based on economic class, ethnicity, religious beliefs, etc...

When conditions get sufficiently bad (due to increased austerity policies, which by the way, are being imposed on purpose), once you flood communities with guns, and once you put in place a regime of laws that expand the justification for justifiable homicides, then you've created the perfect conditions for people to start shooting at each other.

Once people start shooting and getting away with it, then the business cartels keep pushing more and more boiler-plate laws expanding the justification for more shootings.

Eventually this will bring about a situation where you will have mainly right wing groups across the country armed to the teeth, emboldened to intimidate social justice activists as the conditions deteriorate due to the imposition of austerity, i.e., purposely defunding the proper functioning of government (of the the people and by the people).

What's behind all this? That's also pretty straightforward. What these fascistic business cartels are doing is taking down the regulatory infrastructure, the social safety net, and etc., in order to eventually align labor costs to those of developing countries. Yes, folks, it's about money; it's about putting a fascist boot on your neck, figuratively and literally.

So there you have it. That's what's happening.

Now, some people may refuse to believe that there could be people so evil as to purposely and systematically help in bringing about the conditions for this type of mayhem.

Think again. These billionaires funding this stuff are as much as fascists thugs as any other tyrant in history.

You haven't seen half of what these people are capable of--yet."

Rep. Jeff Duncan%2C R-S.C.%2C has been aggressive in trying to lure firms

A Colorado ammunition manufacturer has been targeted by states

Texas Gov. Rick Perry has written to at least 13 companies

States claiming to be friendly to the Second Amendment are trying to poach gun and ammunition makers and related manufacturers from other states, especially those that have passed or are contemplating tougher gun laws.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, this month has written at least 13 manufacturers in states from Oregon to New York saying his state would not impose ""unwarranted government intrusion into your business.""

Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., has written manufacturers in New York and Colorado inviting them to relocate. Idaho economic development officials and Mississippi's Republican speaker of the House also have written similar letters.

""The enemies of freedom are waging an all-out assault on the Second Amendment to the Constitution, which we have sworn to protect and defend,"" said Duncan's letter to George Kollitides, chief executive officer of Freedom Group Inc., whose Remington Arms division has a manufacturing plant in Ilion, N.Y. ""At a time when our government is consistently thwarting the ability of individuals to own businesses, voluntarily trade goods and services, and grow our economy, South Carolina is committed to a different story. In South Carolina, we believe in the right to keep and bear arms.""

Duncan also wrote the chief operating officer of Magpul, a Colorado company that makes ammunition magazines, gun stocks and other custom add-ons for semi-automatic rifles that President Obama and some members of Congress, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., want to ban. Colorado's legislature is contemplating several gun-control measures, including limiting ammunition magazines to 15 rounds.

When the legislation first came to light, Magpul officials told the Denver Post they would consider leaving the state if the measure to limit rounds in magazines became law, saying it would be difficult doing business in a state that banned its products. Other companies that supply Magpul have since said they would follow if Magpul left.

Repeated attempts to reach Magpul officials were unsuccessful. So were attempts to reach a spokesperson for Remington Arms, which was founded in upstate New York but is now headquartered in North Carolina.

New York last month passed one of the most restrictive gun laws in the nation, which among other things banned assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. When he signed it, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, stressed that the new restrictions would not affect rifles and shotguns used by hunters.

In an interview, Duncan said that was not the point.

""This isn't about deer hunting,"" he said. ""The Second Amendment is about our right to keep and bear arms to defend ourselves.""

Rob Godfrey, a spokesman for South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican, said that ""while we appreciate Congressman Duncan's leadership and economic development efforts, we don't discuss details of ongoing talks with any company that may be interested in moving to South Carolina.""

The Colorado House has passed several gun-related measures, including limiting ammunition magazines to 15 rounds. Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, has said he would sign such legislation if it passes the state Senate.

Eric Brown, a spokesman for Hickenlooper, said that if a company left the state because of gun restrictions, ""that would be unfortunate.

""But Colorado is growing,"" he said. ""We are adding a lot of jobs.""

One company approached by Perry, the Texas governor, already has said no.

Crimson Trace Corp. of Wilsonville, Ore., which makes laser-sighting systems for handguns, will stay put. Kent Thomas, director of marketing for the company, said the firm is happy with the ""entrepreneurial spirit of Oregon"" and that ""there is no reason for us to move.""

Bills to ban the sale of high-capacity magazines and assault rifles were introduced in the Oregon legislature but they have stalled. State Sen. Floyd Prozanski, a Democrat and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said last week he would not take up either bill because they were issues that Congress should deal with.

Some states that have robust outdoors industries have been trying to attract gun and ammunition manufacturers for years.

Even before the most recent escalation in the gun-violence debate following the murder of 20 children and six adults in December in Newtown, Conn., Idaho was trying to attract companies ""not only within the arms and ammunition sector, but broader — companies that fall within what we call recreational technology,"" said Megan Ronk, spokeswoman for the Idaho Department of Commerce. The best way to explain the state's business targets, she said: makers of any products sold at Cabela's, a leading outdoors, hunting and fishing retailer.

Ronk said that as other states consider gun restrictions, ""that creates some advantages for us. We in this state have traditionally been very friendly to companies within this industry, and will continue to be so. Certainly looking at other states that are imposing more restrictive laws"" is part of a business-recruitment strategy.

http://news.yahoo.com/minn-capitol-sees-spike-gun-notices-230044241.html,,[],Minn. Capitol sees spike in gun notices,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Handgun holstered on his hip, Anthony Triemert showed up to Minnesota's Capitol on Friday for the latest in a number of recent legislative hearings on various gun control proposals.

""I just came down here today to show support for Second Amendment rights,"" he said. But Triemert's right to carry a loaded gun is safe in this building. Minnesota is one of at least nine states that allow people to carry guns into the brick-and-mortar homes of government.

All he and other Minnesotans have to do is notify the Minnesota Department of Public Safety in advance. As hundreds of pro-gun activists have streamed into the state's legislative hearings on gun controls, such notifications have spiked in the last month — almost 1/5th of all notifications given since the current permit law took effect in 2006.

Between Jan. 18 and Feb. 22, 150 people notified DPS of the intent to carry their weapons on the Capitol complex. By contrast, only 56 such notifications were filed in all of 2012. And since the law took effect, a total of 723 individuals have notified the agency.

On Friday, gun rights activists again came out in force for the second day of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Most of them didn't wear their guns openly like Triemert, though he was not the only one. An auto mechanic from Brooklyn Park who's now on disability, Triemert said he wears the gun almost everywhere he goes.

""I don't believe in gun safe zones. I think it's an advertisement for a killing zone,"" Triemert said, noting he carries a weapon for protection because of his own physical limitations.

Private establishments in Minnesota are allowed to post signs stating that guns are not allowed on the premises. But no such rules are in place at the Capitol, which has no metal detectors at its public entrances.

""I don't like people carrying weapons in the Capitol,"" said Sen. Barb Goodwin, DFL-Columbia Heights, a Judiciary Committee member and outspoken gun control supporter. ""This is a place where controversial decisions are made all the time. Emotions can run high.""

Story continues

Still, Goodwin said, any nerves about guns in the Senate hearing room wouldn't dissuade her from speaking out. Armed State Patrol officers were posted at the House and Senate hearings, a relative rarity in legislative proceedings.

Goodwin said she and colleagues tried to prohibit guns in the Capitol in 2006, but lacked the votes to do so. Some lawmakers have acknowledged carrying their own weapons at the Capitol, including Republican Rep. Tony Cornish of Good Thunder, a strong opponent of tighter gun laws.

Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-ST. Louis Park, and state Rep. Michael Paymar, DFL-St. Paul, both plan to assemble separate sets of gun control measures for lawmakers to consider. But there's been no talk of changing the state's carry permit law that allows guns at the Capitol.

Latz has said he would not pursue an assault weapons ban, which is sought by gun control activists but strongly opposed by the National Rifle Association and its allies.

Since Latz took that off the table, the debate has increasingly focused on a bill that would require background checks for all gun purchases in Minnesota — not just those that go through federally licensed dealers, but also sales at gun shows, online and between individuals. The NRA and Minnesota pro-gun groups oppose that measure, too.

Joe Isaacs, a real estate agent from the Stillwater area who has helped organize gun control opponents at the Capitol hearings, said he typically wears his gun everywhere. He notified DPS of plans to wear it at the Capitol, but changed his mind after realizing it could be seen as a provocative act.

""It could have been a distraction, and take the focus off the issue,"" Isaacs said. ""I don't wear it to be political. It's for safety."""

Political conventional wisdom has it that in a purple state, such as Virginia, support for gun-safety legislation is best played down. As manager of Mark Herring’s campaign for attorney general, I got a lot of advice. One of the things I heard most frequently was that we should soft-pedal his strong record and advocacy for sensible gun legislation. It would hurt us outside of Northern Virginia and wasn’t a voting issue within the Beltway, I was told.

Like much conventional wisdom, this was wrong — and we not only ignored this advice but did the opposite. There were stark differences between Herring and his Republican opponent, Sen. Mark D. Obenshain (R-Harrisonburg), on gun safety. Obenshain opposed comprehensive background checks and opposed closing the gun-show loophole. He opposed former governor Douglas Wilder’s landmark “one-gun-a-month” legislation. Obenshain also made a habit of voting for such irresponsible proposals as allowing guns in bars and restaurants where alcohol is served.

In short, Obenshain has opposed every constructive proposal to help reduce gun violence.

We knew this would open an opportunity for us to draw an effective contrast; public polling showed widespread support for sensible gun-safety laws, as did our own polling. Hence, more than a year out from Election Day, dealing with gun violence was a fundamental messaging point for Herring. And when the primary was over, and Herring and Obenshain met in their first debate, he drew a sharp contrast with his opponent on guns. We would prosecute that case throughout the fall campaign.

But how well do you know the NRA's history and background? Caption The National Rifle Association becomes a focus of coverage whenever gun-related massacres take place in the United States. But how well do you know the NRA's history and background? 1. Its first president might be better known for sideburns. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, formerly a gunsmith, bemoaned the Union's shooting inaccuracy and tactics in the Civil War. He became the NRA's first leader when it was founded in 1871 in New York with the goal to ""promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis.'' The word sideburns is a play on Burnside's last name, used to describe the hair on the side of his face that curled around to join his mustache. Library of Congress/AP Wait 1 second to continue.

Obenshain’s position against gun-safety legislation was standard GOP fare — but it reflected a state and a voter mind-set that no longer exist. Almost all Virginians support sensible gun-safety legislation. Over the years, the commonwealth has become more urban and suburban, not only in Northern Virginia but also in Norfolk and Richmond. We found broad support in the Washington suburbs, Richmond and Norfolk for comprehensive background checks and ending the gun-show loophole.

Campaigns must make difficult financial choices, and in the general election, we knew we were going to be outspent by as much as three to one. We also knew that two issues would be powerful to voters: gun violence and Obenshain’s extremist views on women’s health issues. We couldn’t afford to focus on both simultaneously, so we started our television campaign on Obenshain’s record on women. Our intent was to start with these issues, broaden the offensive and eventually close by focusing on Obenshain’s record of inaction, or worse, on gun violence.

Ultimately, we never stopped talking about Obenshain’s abysmal record on women’s health. Independence USA, the super political action committee started by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Americans for Responsible Solutions, the organization founded by former representative Gabrielle “Gabby” Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, joined the race in the closing weeks, running commercials that discussed gun violence issues.

The National Rifle Association ran commercials against Herring, but its messages were directed at voters who our own polling showed were never accessible to Herring. The NRA avoided the largest concentrations of swing voters in the Northern Virginia, Norfolk and Richmond markets. That is not a recipe for growth or success.

The swing vote began to shift dramatically in our favor at the end. When the ballots were counted in Northern Virginia, Herring not only beat Obenshain there by more than 100,000 votes, but he also increased the total Democratic vote in Northern Virginia for attorney general by more than 124,000 since the last election. A post-election survey of voters in Northern Virginia by the Global Strategy Group indicated that 57 percent of those who voted for Herring in Northern Virginia believe gun issues had a major impact on the way they voted.

This massive increase wasn’t just about the mechanics of campaigning. The painful and numbing record of senseless gun violence — from Columbine High School in Colorado to Virginia Tech to Newtown, Conn., and, during the heart of the fall campaign, the Navy Yard shooting — was the real determinant of voters’ sentiments. Our campaign pointed out the contrast, and voters lined up on our side. Even the NRA’s active opposition in its home state could not change the fact that voters rejected our opponent’s radical position on gun safety. Those perpetuating the conventional wisdom should take notice: In the end, voters were calling out for action on gun violence, and they flocked to the candidate who offered progress and a sensible, mainstream approach to protecting Virginians."

An Oregon sheriff is citing his constitutional duty in accusing politicians of ""attempting to exploit the deaths of innocent victims"" to enact new gun laws that he thinks would harm his law-abiding locals. Linn County Sheriff Tim Mueller has promised not to enforce any new gun laws enacted in the wake of the Newtown shootings, making him pretty much the​ gun-rights hero of a very big day for pro-gun America. The reason we're hearing so much from this obscure sheriff is that he sent a letter to Vice-President Joe Biden and shared it with multiple news outlets like the Associated Press. There are two main kernels from his complaint — the first implies that politicians are exploiting the Newtown massacre:

RELATED: Tampa Can Ban Water Guns But Not Actual Guns at the Republican Convention

And here's Mueller's promise not to enact what he deems ""unconstitutional"" new gun laws and ""actions,"" such as the 23 President Obama just signed into law:

RELATED: Wayne LaPierre Only Said What Gun Nuts Have Been Posting on Facebook

Somewhere in an undisclosed location, the powerful people behind the National Rifle Association are smiling. Mueller's points aren't unlike Wayne LaPierre's and the NRA's talking points — that the 2nd Amendment is very important, that there are good guys with the guns, and that good guys need guns to protect themselves with bad guys with guns. And Mueller's comments bear a close resemblance to New York State Senator Greg Ball, who admonished the state's newly passed and very tough regulations on Tuesday. Ball said:

I simply cannot support a bill that turns law abiding citizens into criminals by creating an entire new category of illegal firearms out of currently legal rifles and shotguns,” said Senator Greg Ball.

And Sheriff Mueller is already lauded on social media, by gun rights advocate, and alongside the conservative press. He's a hit on Breitbart:

RELATED: Why the NRA Is Still Winning the War on Guns

But despite his gun-rights fan base, Mueller's views don't represent all of America. An AP poll found that nearly ""six in 10 Americans want stricter gun laws in the aftermath of last month’s deadly school shooting in Connecticut"" and ""84 percent of adults would like to see the establishment of a federal standard for background checks for people buying guns at gun shows, the poll showed.""

http://news.yahoo.com/gun-victims-relatives-emerge-advocates-085524029--politics.html,,[],Gun victims' relatives emerge as advocates,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Several people whose lives have been shattered by gun violence will be watching from the packed House gallery as President Barack Obama gives his State of the Union speech.

But not Bill Sherlach, whose wife, Mary, was killed in the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14.

Washington officials fighting over gun control invited him to attend Obama's speech Tuesday night in the House chamber. Sherlach declined.

He said that rather than be the nationally televised face of tragedy, he prefers working within a group that wants the gun issue addressed as part of a comprehensive effort to reduce violence. He wants to work with Sandy Hook Promise, a group that deals with more than just gun control. Mary Sherlach was the Sandy Hook Elementary School psychologist.

Sherlach, who said he had other obligations the day of the speech, explained he also didn't want to be part of the heated rift over gun control that politics and dueling news conferences seem to inflame.

""I think the political aspect pulls people to one extreme or the other extreme,"" he said.

Rep. Jim Himes, Sherlach's congressman in Connecticut, had invited him to the president's address.

Victims of tragedy long have played major roles in the nation's most dramatic public policy debates, and there are few more bitter, or expensive than this year's legislative battle over gun control. Victims make riveting witnesses to wrenching problems and the consequences of doing nothing to prevent the nightmares they know.

The age of global multimedia sharing, however, opens them as never before to becoming pawns and targets in fights that can be more about the legacies and ambitions of others than their own lost loved ones.

Unfortunately, there's no shortage of gun victims in a nation that saw nearly 8,600 gun violence deaths in 2011, according to the FBI, or of politicians looking for real people to bolster their positions on gun control, mental health and other issues. There still will be representatives from Newtown in the House gallery for Obama's prime-time speech.

Story continues

After a gunman shot his own mother at home and then 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook, Obama pledged to tighten gun laws. And then came a parade of the sorrowful and the defiant filing through the virtual public square.

At the White House, Obama met with Newtown families. At a public hearing in Connecticut, Neil Heslin, whose 6-year-old son, Jesse, was killed at the school, questioned the need for any civilian to own semi-automatic, military-style weapons. ""The Second Amendment shall not be infringed!"" someone shouted back.

In Washington, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a shot to the head during a 2011 assassination attempt, told a Senate committee that Congress must revamp gun laws. Her husband, Mark Kelly, got into a terse discussion at the witness table with National Rifle Association's executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre.

At the Super Bowl, the Sandy Hook Elementary School chorus gave a stirring rendition of ""America the Beautiful"" that had some players on the sidelines and fans in the stands in tears.

The State of the Union address will showcase the results of intense campaigns by the White House and members of Congress to bring victims of gun violence, including some Newtown families, to the Capitol.

Cleopatra and Nathaniel Pendleton, the parents of a Chicago teenager slain just days after performing during Obama's inauguration, will sit with first lady Michelle Obama during the speech. Hadiya Pendleton, 15, was shot to death Jan. 29 in a park close to the Obama's Chicago home. Police say a gunman hopped a fence and opened fire on a group of young people. She was a majorette with the King College Prep band.

Twenty-four House members are bringing people affected by gun violence, according to Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., who spearheaded the effort. The guests include Natalie Hammond, Sandy Hook's lead teacher, who was shot in the foot, leg and hand but managed to crawl to safety behind a door. She'll be the guest of Rep. Elizabeth Esty, D-Conn.

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., will have as her guest a fourth-grader who attends a different elementary school in Newtown, but recently wrote to her about gun control.

""To have them in the gallery during the speech is a strong reminder to Congress that the American people want action on these issues,"" said Langevin, who has used a wheelchair since being paralyzed in a shooting accident as a teen.

Langevin was a 16-year-old Boy Scout cadet working with police in Warwick, R.I. He was in a locker room watching officers examine a gun they thought was unloaded, when the weapon accidentally fired. A bullet ricocheted off a metal locker and severed Langevin's spinal cord.

Taking sides on the gun issue while coping with grief can be a stunning and disillusioning experience, say veterans of victim advocacy.

""Families are not prepared to go through the onslaught,"" said John Walsh, host and executive producer of TV's ""America's Most Wanted"" show, who began his crime-busting crusade after the abduction and murder of his 6-year-old son, Adam, in 1981. Victims' relatives, he said, can get frustrated when their activism doesn't translate into swift action.

""They're not prepared for all the shenanigans in Congress,"" said Walsh. But, he added, some good could come from Sandy Hook. ""There is a tiny window here before everybody forgets about it. This could be a great time for these parents to make a loud statement.""

In his speech, Obama is expected to urge support for his plan to ban assault weapons and require background checks for all gun buyers. Last month he released his package of proposals for curbing gun violence in response to the Newtown shootings and vowed to use the powers of his office to fight for the proposals.

Most of them face tough opposition from the NRA and its friends in Congress. Conservative accused Obama of using children as political props. When he announced his gun proposals at the White House, he was surrounded by some kids who had written him in support of further gun restrictions.

While no family wants to be exploited, many in Newtown want to have a role in seeing something come of the tragedy, said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.

Their testimony, she said, ""puts a tangible human face on the issue.""

Jim Tyrell, a Warwick, R.I., bartender whose older sister, Debbie, was shot and killed nine years ago during a robbery at the convenience store she owned, said he's attending Obama's speech as Langevin's guest.

""Somebody took her life with a gun, and here I am trying to save another person's life by getting guns off the streets,"" he said.

Tyrell said he's not daunted by the prospect of public criticism. ""If somebody criticizes me, that is their opinion. I am not looking to offend anybody else, I just want to tell them my story and what happened to our family.""

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/01/ban-on-high-capacity-magazines-part-deal-struck-on-strict-connecticut-gun-laws/,2013-04-01 00:00:00,[],"Connecticut pols strike deal to expand assault-weapons ban, restrict high-capacity magazines","Connecticut lawmakers reached a bipartisan deal Monday on what they consider some of the toughest gun laws in the country and hope will be a model for other capitals, pushing to expand the state's assault-weapons ban and impose new restrictions on high-capacity magazines.

The proposal came hours ahead of the release late Tuesday morning of the National Rifle Association's report on school safety proposals. The NRA commissioned the study in the wake of the Newtown shooting, as the group pushed for enhanced school security rather than measures to curb gun ownership.

The Connecticut deal, by contrast, focuses on gun control measures -- though it left some on both sides of the debate unhappy. Gun control advocates, and particularly families of those killed or injured in the December Newtown shooting, were disappointed the proposal only included a ban on new high-capacity magazines -- and not existing ones.

And gun-rights groups argued that the latest proposal would not have prevented the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

""They can register magazines and do all the rest of this stuff. It isn't going to do anything,"" said Robert Crook, executive director of the Connecticut Coalition of Sportsmen.

Gun owners, who've packed public hearings at the state Capitol in recent months, voicing their opposition to various gun control measures, are concerned they've been showing up ""for virtually nothing"" after learning about the bill, Crook said.

""Clearly we've made our point,"" Crook said. ""But I don't know what anybody can do at this point in time.""

Connecticut lawmakers announced a deal Monday which would include a ban on new high-capacity ammunition magazines like the ones used in the massacre that left 20 children and six educators dead. The proposal includes new registration requirements for existing magazines that carry 10 or more bullets.

The package also creates what lawmakers said is the nation's first statewide dangerous weapon offender registry, creates a new ""ammunition eligibility certificate,"" imposes immediate universal background checks for all firearms sales, and extends the state's assault weapons ban to 100 new types of firearms and requires that a weapon have only one of several features in order to be banned.

The newly banned weapons could no longer be bought or sold in Connecticut, and those legally owned already would have to be registered with the state, just like the high-capacity magazines.

""No gun owner will lose their gun,"" said House Minority Leader Lawrence Cafero Jr., a Norwalk Republican. ""No gun owner will lose their magazines.""

The bill also addresses mental health and school security measures.

The shooting Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School reignited the gun debate in the country and led to calls for increased gun control legislation on the federal and state levels. While some other states, including neighboring New York, have strengthened their gun laws, momentum has stalled in Congress, whose members were urged by President Obama last week not to forget the shooting and to capitalize on the best chance in years to stem gun violence.

Connecticut should be seen as an example for lawmakers elsewhere, said Senate President Donald E. Williams Jr., a Brooklyn Democrat.

""In Connecticut, we've broken the mold,"" he said. ""Democrats and Republicans were able to come to an agreement on a strong, comprehensive bill. That is a message that should resound in 49 other states and in Washington, D.C. And the message is: We can get it done here and they should get it done in their respective states and nationally in Congress.""

The proposal was revealed to rank-and-file lawmakers Monday after weeks of bipartisan, closed-door negotiations among legislative leaders. A vote was expected Wednesday in the General Assembly, where Democrats control both chambers, making passage all but assured. The bill would then be sent to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who has helped lead efforts to strengthen the state's gun laws but has not yet signed off on the proposed legislation.

Earlier in the day on Monday, Malloy voiced support for the Newtown families and their desire to ban the possession of large-capacity magazines.

Ron Pinciaro, executive director of Connecticut Against Gun Violence, said his group will live with the lawmakers' decision not to ban them as other states have done. He said the leaders made their decision based on what was politically feasible.

""We have to be satisfied. There are still other things that we want, we'll be back for in later sessions,"" he said. ""But for now, it's a good thing.""

Six relatives of Newtown victims visited the Capitol on Monday, asking lawmakers to ban existing high-capacity magazines. Some handed out cards with photographs of their slain children.

Allowing magazines that carry 10 or more bullets to remain in the hands of gun owners would leave a gaping loophole in the law, said Mark Barden, whose 7-year-old son, Daniel, was killed in the shooting.

""It doesn't prevent someone from going out of the state to purchase them and then bring them back. There's no way to track when they were purchased, so they can say, `I had this before,""' Barden said. ""So it's a big loophole.""

Jake McGuigan, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which is based in Newtown, said he wouldn't comment on the proposal until he saw it in the writing, but he questioned the mechanics of a registry for magazines.

""How will they register a magazine? It seems a little weird,"" he said.

President Obama has given Vice President Joe Biden the task of surveying a wide range of interested parties to formulate a remedy for the horrific gun violence that bedevils American society. The shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and innocent bystanders at a shopping mall in Tucson, the slaughter in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., the heartbreaking murder of a class of first-graders in a schoolroom in Newtown, Conn., and a long string of similarly horrific incidents have become a recurring nightmare from which we all want to awake.

Supporters of gun rights make a fair point when they insist that guns are not the sole cause of the problem. They are very likely right that the ultra-violence in movies and video games inspires already troubled young minds to re-create bloody fantasies in real life. And they are right that something must be done to stop those warped-minded individuals who pull the triggers before they can do their evil deeds.

But the gun rights folks seem incapable of acknowledging that guns are part of the problem too. There are mentally deranged people and violent entertainment and video games in every developed country, but only in this one is there such frequent carnage. The one factor that is different is that, in the United States, there are as many guns as there are people.

This would suggest that it is at least worth considering measures that would make it more difficult for the wrong people to get hold of weapons. Yet, when better background checks or tighter regulation of private gun sales are proposed, too many gun enthusiasts immediately start screaming about confiscation. They insist that any step toward better regulation of firearms is an unthinkable slide toward a Stalinist world of gulags, government tyranny and defenseless citizens.

Right-wing talk show screamer Alex Jones went ballistic in a CNN interview when host Piers Morgan suggested a few sane steps to manage the gun problem might be a smart idea. “Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, Fidel Castro took the guns, Hugo Chavez took the guns!” Jones ranted. “And I am here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!”

Yes, it always seems to come down to that –- the paranoid certainty that even the most modest move toward better gun regulation is actually a smokescreen for some tyrant-in-waiting who wants to banish all guns and enslave America. That prevalent view among gun rights advocates pushes some of them to accept even loopier ideas.

In recent days, a tenured communications professor at Florida Atlantic University, James Tracy, wrote several blog posts that suggested the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown may well have been a staged event with actors hired by the Obama administration and orchestrated to provide a pretext for pushing gun control.

Now, that is about the most crazy and obscene allegation that has ever oozed from the right-wing blogosphere. But when the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported about the professor’s theory, quite a few readers called and emailed the newspaper to defend and applaud Tracy’s ideas.

This explains why laws that would keep guns out of the hands of crazy people are opposed by many firearms fans. So many of them seem to be totally nuts."

That claim, trumpeted by cable television, National Review, talk shows and comment threads, is, however, based on two polls, most particularly a CBS News poll showing only 47 percent now in favor of stricter gun-control measures compared with 57 percent in December.

There are three problems with this assessment.

First: it's one poll. A Marist poll (commissioned by MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" program) was released early Wednesday showing 60 percent of Americans replying ""more strict"" to the question: Do you think the laws covering the sale of firearms should be more strict, less strict, or kept as they are now?

That's not all. The fact is, the generic strict versus less-strict versus stay-as-they-are questions always elicit weaker support than more specific questions.

As the Center for American Progress has noted in a comprehensive look at this matter:



One of the most consistent findings in gun polling is that support for “gun control” broadly is lower than support for specific tighter gun laws. One reason is the lack of specificity in broad “gun climate” questions. What do respondents think of when asked whether they support “gun control” or “stricter laws covering the sale of firearms”? Are they thinking about a ban on all guns, including hunting rifles? Are they thinking about preventing people accused of domestic violence from getting a gun at a gun show without a background check and then bringing that gun across state lines? We simply don’t know. This is not to say that a broad question on attitudes toward gun laws can’t be useful, but we should simply understand its limitations.

Here's what else was asked in that CBS News poll in the third week of March which found the drop in support for stricter gun control:

Do you favor or oppose a nationwide ban on semi-automatic weapons—including some rifles, pistols, and shotguns—that have detachable magazines, allowing them to rapidly fire a high number of rounds?""

A total of 49 percent in favor, 49 percent opposed. That's a downward shift of three points from February, which is the same as the margin of error. Also asked:

""Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?""

A total of 90 percent in favor, 8 percent opposed. In February, the figure was 91 percent.

What's clear when you look at all the polls is that while there has been some slippage when questions about specific measures are asked, it is marginal. The majority of Americans still want universal background checks, an assault weapons ban and a limit on the capacity of gun magazines."

This is not a movie. There’s no dramatic music in the background. A happy ending, far from a guarantee.

The concern in Donnie Herman’s voice was clear as day. So was his stress. With two telephones to his ear, he listened to his wife, Melinda, as she fled into an attic of their Loganville home. With her: Her two 9-year-old children and a loaded .38 revolver.

In the house: An intruder with a crowbar.

On another line was the 911 operator Donnie Herman had called for help. Herman’s words to his wife, as he sat helplessly, an hour away from the home, were recorded.

“Stay in the attic,” he instructed her, calmly.

“He’s in the bedroom,” she told him. He repeated the words to the 911 operator.

“Shh. Relax,” Herman said, trying to calm his wife.

Then he instructed her to do what was fast becoming a realistic possibility.

Rich Phillips/CNN Melinda Herman fled to the attic with her two children when an intruder entered her Georgia home.

Rich Phillips/CNN Walton County Sheriff Joe Chapman, whose office responded to the shooting, praised Melinda Herman's actions.

“Melinda – if he opens up the door, you shoot him! You understand?”

What happened next has made the Hermans the new faces of the right to bear arms.

Melinda Herman fired a six-shot revolver at the intruder, hitting him five times, in his torso and in his face. Surprisingly, he managed to flee.

Opinion: The case for gun rights is stronger than you think

Gun rights groups say this shows that law-abiding citizens should be allowed to buy their weapon of choice and as big a magazine or ammunition clip as they like.

They remind people that Melinda Herman had only a six-shot revolver.

“It’s a good thing she wasn’t facing more attackers. Otherwise she would have been in trouble and she would have run out of ammunition,” said Erich Pratt, director of communications for the Gun Owners of America.

“She shot him five times and he still didn’t drop. This is going to endanger people’s safety.”

The right of self-protection has been thrust into the forefront in a national debate after last month’s Newtown, Connecticut, tragedy.

This week, a federal task force led by Vice President Joe Biden is holding talks with private industry groups, the NRA, and legislators – all to determine the correct balance between the right to self-protection and preventing further mass shootings.

Meanwhile, Americans are flocking to gun shops to buy guns and ammunition in record numbers – partly due to Newtown and partly due to their fears that the rules are about to change on what they can legally own.

The FBI said it conducted almost 2.8 million checks for gun purchases in December, a record high for a month.

Donnie and Melinda Herman own two guns for protection at home, but until two weeks ago, she had never fired a gun. Her husband told sheriff’s department investigator’s that he took her shooting so that she’d be familiar with the family’s guns if she ever had to use one.

Now, clutching the .38 revolver, Melinda Herman was in the middle of a heart-pounding crisis inside her own home.

She had already locked multiple doors before she and her children took refuge in an adjacent-room attic – the kind with a small door that you have to bend down to go through.

The intruder had used the crowbar to break through the front door and then two other doors upstairs, and she could hear him coming closer and closer.

On the phone, Donnie Herman calmly instructed his wife about the use of the weapon she had practiced on.

“Remember everything I showed you. Everything I taught you,” he told her, and he reassured her that help was on the way.

Then it happened.

“She shot him. She’s shooting him. She’s shooting him. She’s shooting him. She’s shooting him. … Shoot him again! Shoot him!” Donnie Herman said as the 911 dispatcher listened.

He then lost phone contact with his wife and children. His anguish and the pain of not knowing what had happened may be etched in his mind for eternity. But they were safe.

He learned later that his wife fired all six shots, and hit the intruder with all but one bullet.

Parents defend right to keep guns in the home

Not realizing she was out of ammunition, she ordered the man to stay on the floor as he bled. She then fled the house with her children.

Walton County Sheriff Joe Chapman – whose office responded to the shooting at the Hermans’ home – said he believes the mother and her two children were in a life-and-death situation and she had no choice but to exercise her constitutional right to self-defense.

“Had it not turned out the way that it did, I would possibly be working a triple homicide, not having a clue as to who it is we’re looking for,” he told CNN.

Despite being shot five times, the suspect, identified as Paul Ali Slater, still managed to get back into his SUV, but he drove off the road and crashed a short distance away.

He remains hospitalized. Due to privacy laws, the hospital cannot divulge any information on his condition.

But the controversy continues. Home gun ownership and self-defense will always be controversial.

The Hermans’ story of self-defense is being used by the National Rifle Association and the Gun Owners of America to make their point to the White House and Congress about gun ownership.

But Donnie Herman has told people he’s not interested in being a poster boy for anyone. He has not yet responded to CNN’s request for an interview with him and his wife.

“My wife is a hero. She protected her kids. She did what she was supposed to do as a responsible parent and gun owner,” Herman told CNN affiliate WSB.

Yet it’s unclear whether the benefits of having a loaded and readily available gun in one’s home outweigh the drawbacks.

“It’s more common for an armed homeowner in the United States to be a victim of suicide, homicide, assault or an accidental shooting than it is for that person to shoot an intruder,” according to Dr. Arthur Kellermann, a senior health policy analyst at Rand Corporation, a non-partisan think tank.

Kellermann led research for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the 1990s which found that people who have guns in their homes are nearly three times more likely to be a victim of homicide and nearly five times more likely to commit suicide.

Experts also say that simply having a gun for self-protection does not guarantee safety. They say the fear is that many people will take part in what might be considered a feeding frenzy by purchasing a gun, but not learn how to properly use it.

Sheriff Chapman holds courses for homeowners who want to learn how to safely and properly use a weapon.

“Be proficient with it. Be taught how to use it. Train with it,” he said.

“I often tell people, ‘If you don’t think that you have what it takes to take a human life then don’t bother buying one. Don’t waste your money. Don’t waste your time,” he told CNN.

“Don’t put it in a drawer and think that’s the answer to everything, because it isn’t.”

In letters to the state's congressional delegation and governor, Lawrence G. Keane, the senior vice president and general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said the industry is ""offended by the hypocrisy of our elected officials in Congress and the state government"" to advocate for legislation paying homage to the firearms industry and the iconic Colt firearms factory while pursuing gun control legislation.

""As major contributors to the state's economy, we find it unacceptable for lawmakers to propose banning our products and hindering our ability of Connecticut companies to grow their businesses, create more good-paying manufacturing jobs, and contribute hundreds of millions in taxes,"" Keane wrote in the letters released Tuesday.

He called the state's legislation ""job-killing"" because it bans many of the most popular and commonly owned firearms that the foundation's members manufacture.

Current and past delegation members have pushed for years for the National Historical Park designation at Coltsville, an area named after Samuel Colt, who designed a revolver that revolutionized personal firearms. The area includes manufacturing facilities and employee housing that his Colt Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Co. began building in 1855.

Coltsville was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2008, a step toward the national park designation.

U.S. Rep. John Larson, a Democrat who represents Hartford and a chief proponent of the national historical park designation, said the site is of national historic significance and ""anyone who understands the significance and importance of Coltsville gets it."" He said the location was and will remain the cradle of the Industrial Revolution, the site of precision manufacturing, assembly line production and interchangeable parts.

""Historic designation has nothing to do with universal background checks, which 91 percent of the American people support,"" Larson said.

The foundation is based in Newtown, the site of the Dec. 14 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. It filed a federal lawsuit on Monday claiming the state's emergency gun control bill was illegally passed in April without proper public input, time for adequate review by lawmakers and without a statement of facts explaining the need to bypass the usual"

One 82-year-old preacher even called for “Tea Party” style meetings in some of Chicago’s south side communities such as Altgeld Gardens and Trumbull Park.

“This was a historic event,” Paul McKinley of V.O.T.E. (Voices of the Ex-Offender) and former 2nd Congressional District GOP nominee to replace Jesse Jackson, Jr. told Breitbart News. “Not because of Al Sharpton coming to town,” he continued. “This was first time since electing Mayor Harold Washington in the eighties that all of these grassroots groups and community organizers have come together under one roof to talk about the problems plaguing our community.”

While the stated goal for Sharpton was to bring the many different groups together to discuss solutions to the city’s violence epidemic, he may not have gotten the types of responses he was looking for. Calls for more gun control laws and getting guns off the streets were nonexistent and not mentioned by residents throughout the session.

Instead, attendees offered solutions addressing the problems facing their community as a whole rather than just taking on “gun violence” itself. Audience members addressed the need for jobs and solving the foreclosure crisis plaguing Chicago’s south and west sides. Perhaps the loudest message–and one that Reverend Al or the Chicago media have yet to report on–echoed by several different people in attendance as well as panel members was that it is time for the black community to start voting differently.

“The manner in which we have been voting needs to change,” Wendy Pearson, an activist against Chicago school closings, told the room. “I’m here to say to you that we have been trained to vote in a specific manner… we need to start looking at the manner in which our elected officials have been voting… if they have not voted in a manner that is beneficial to you, yours, and your community, then you need to start voting them out.”

McKinley told the room, “Stop blaming just anybody for the violence in the city of Chicago. Blame the right people, not just white people, but the right people. Because it’s not just white folks a part of this, but it is on the fifth floor. The fifth floor took your schools, the fifth floor just took your jobs that he said that he gave to the ex-offender… and every single alderman was a part of this criminal process.”

McKinley called on President Obama to help the grassroots by discontinuing aid and government grants that go through Chicago’s political machine to “name-brand-blue-ribbon-negro-organizations” such as the NAACP and Urban League. McKinley told Breitbart News those groups “are poverty pimps, and are part of the problem and not the solution.”"
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/04/15/kerry-foreign-students-scared-of-guns-in-u-s/,2013-04-15 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",Kerry: Foreign students 'scared' of guns in U.S.,"8 years ago

(CNN) – Students in other countries assessing where to study abroad are increasingly scared of coming to the United States because of gun violence, the nation's top diplomat said Monday.

Speaking with CNN foreign affairs correspondent Jill Dougherty in Tokyo, Secretary of State John Kerry said he'd discussed the situation with officials there who said students felt unsafe in the United States.



""We had an interesting discussion about why fewer students are coming to, particularly from Japan, to study in the United States, and one of the responses I got from our officials from conversations with parents here is that they're actually scared. They think they're not safe in the United States and so they don't come,"" Kerry said.

He noted Japan's restrictive gun laws – which prevent private ownership of nearly all firearms, including handguns – and said the country was safer ""where people are not running around with guns.""

In 2011, Japan sent 21,290 students to study in the United States, making it the seventh largest country of origin for international scholars. That was down 14% from the previous year, according to numbers from the Institute of International Education.

Figures have shown international study is down markedly among Japanese students to all destinations, including the United States. Experts have attributed the decline to Japan's low birthrate, the expense of foreign study in a poor economy, and a desire among Japanese young people to remain at home rather than venture to other countries.

Unlike the United States, the right to private gun ownership in Japan is not guaranteed in law. Individuals wishing to possess any firearm must obtain a license and demonstrate a reason for owning the gun.

Out of a total 582 homicides in Japan in 2008, 11 were by guns.

http://news.yahoo.com/-navy-yard-shooting-to-spur-gun-debate-%E2%80%93-but-little-action-likely-154819330.html,,[],Navy Yard shooting to spur gun debate — but little action likely,"Congress is about as likely to impose firecracker control after a man lobbed some at the White House on Monday as lawmakers are to tighten gun laws after the slaughter of 12 people at the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., only a few hours earlier.

That’s the grim feeling among profoundly frustrated gun-control advocates and their Democratic allies on Capitol Hill. They say privately that if the Christmastime massacre of 20 schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., last year couldn’t spur action on modest steps to combat gun violence, what chance does the killing of a dozen adults have?

""We don’t have the votes. I hope to get them, but we don’t have them now,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday when asked if the Senate would revisit a bill to tighten background checks after Monday's shootings. The Senate rejected a similar measure in April.

That measure failed by five votes — Reid switched his “yes” vote to “no” in a procedural move that permits him to bring the proposal up again. On Tuesday, Reid said that he might consider revisiting a separate, limited bill that would exclusively address mental health issues.

“Anything we can do to focus attention on the senseless killings that take place,” Reid said. “That’s something we will look at.”



On Monday, the tone of frustration with Congress' inaction on gun legislation came from the very top, as President Barack Obama deplored that “we are confronting yet another mass shooting.”

“We're going to be investigating thoroughly what happened, as we do so many of these shootings, sadly, that have happened, and do everything that we can to try to prevent them,” he added.

Obama made no mention of another push in Congress — and White House press secretary Jay Carney added to the impression of congressional stalemate at his briefing not long afterward.

“We will continue to work to take action to reduce gun violence in this country through executive action, and hopefully Congress will take action to reduce gun violence as well,” Carney told reporters.

Story continues

Democrats facing an uphill re-election fight in the 2014 midterm elections “would rather see executive action on this than walk the plank with another vote on something that won’t go anywhere in the House,” said another Democratic congressional aide, who also requested anonymity to discuss the tragedy’s political dimensions.

That was the reality in Congress as about 75 gun-control advocates organized by the Newtown Action Alliance were poised to arrive in Washington around noon on Tuesday for a long-scheduled event urging congressional action on the issue.



The group had planned to attend a Tuesday Senate subcommittee hearing on ""stand your ground"" self-defense laws, but that hearing was postponed indefinitely on Monday due to the Navy Yard shootings. To mark the nine-month anniversary of the Newtown shootings, the advocates — including family members of victims at Sandy Hook Elementary School and Virginia Tech — will hold a press conference on Wednesday and meet with lawmakers to pressure them to pass gun-control legislation.

Dave Ackert, the founder of the Newtown Action Alliance, said they are not ""optimistic"" that gun laws will change any time soon, but they hope gun control will now again at least become a matter of debate.

""Maybe now that it came in their backyard it will be harder for a lot of these lawmakers to keep looking the other way. That's the hope anyway,"" Ackert told Yahoo News.

Some officials reflected on the mass shootings since Obama took office in January 2009 — at places such as Fort Hood, Tucson, Aurora, Oak Creek and Newtown.

“We are becoming far too familiar with senseless, tragic violence,"" West Virginia Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller said in a statement. “This is the seventh shooting since 2009, and these repeated incidents demand our attention.""

California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a longtime advocate for tightening federal gun laws, called on lawmakers to resume a debate over gun control.

“When will enough be enough? Congress must stop shirking its responsibility and resume a thoughtful debate on gun violence in this country. We must do more to stop this endless loss of life,” she said in a statement.

Earlier this year, Feinstein authored a bill in response to the mass shootings in Newtown that would have banned ""assault weapons,"" but the Senate rejected the proposal before going on to vote down the separate measure that sought to expand background checks.

And Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, pressed Congress to do something — but did not signal any aggressive new push.

“While it is too early to know what policies might have prevented this latest tragedy, we do know that policies that present a real opportunity to save lives sit stalled in Congress,” Gross said. “As long as our leaders in Congress ignore the will of the people and do not listen to those voices, we will hold them accountable. We hope Congress will listen to the voice of the people and take up legislation that will create a safer America.""

But what might that legislation look like? If early reports are true, the suspect, Aaron Alexis, had a violent past that included allegedly firing his gun through a neighbor’s ceiling, and he was being treated for mental illness. But under existing laws he could purchase firearms and had the necessary clearance as a Defense Department contractor to gain access to the Navy Yard.

Lawmakers have seemed more willing to tackle issues related to security clearances and contractors — perhaps a side effect of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden’s sweeping revelations about American surveillance. And they also have signaled a willingness to expand mental health treatment. Neither is likely to draw the kind of forceful lobbying campaign like the National Rifle Association’s no-holds-barred blitz after Newtown.

Democratic House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said on Tuesday at an event hosted by Politico that the Navy Yard suspect was “somebody who had a record of instability and certainly should have been, I think, subject to closer scrutiny.”



House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, R.-Calif., said he had received a Defense Department inspector general report on contractor access to Navy installations.



“The report details critical flaws in the practice of contracting access control for military installations to non-governmental personnel,” he said in a statement. “While the timing of the delivery of this report was coincidental, I believe it to be relevant to physical security on military installations and to the committee's hearing tomorrow on the impact of defense cuts.”

But gun rights advocates are sure to advance the argument that the solution isn’t more laws, it’s enforcement of existing laws. The Navy Yard suspect violated several gun-related Washington, D.C., laws, ABC News noted.

And David Kopel, adjunct professor of law at Denver University and an analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute think tank, said Alexis should have faced felony convictions for his previous gun-related wrongdoing.

""This was the case of another completely preventable mass murder that could have been stopped if we had a more effective criminal justice system and mental health system,"" Kopel told Yahoo News.

NEW YORK—New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the media need to improve their coverage of gun violence, arguing the press pays attention to gun-related deaths only after mass shootings.

In an interview with NBC’s Jimmy Fallon, Bloomberg called the Dec. 14 shooting that killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., “terribly tragic,” but said there is scant coverage of people who are killed by guns every day.

“This was a crazy person with an assault weapon,” Bloomberg said of the Sandy Hook shooting. “But there’s 33 people killed in America with guns every single day of the year. And nobody seems to care. It only catches the press’s attention when it’s young kids concentrated. And it was terribly tragic, but there are kids killed every day all across this country.”

Bloomberg has emerged as one of the most vocal advocates of new gun-control measures since the Sandy Hook shooting, urging President Barack Obama to make the issue a top priority in his second term. But the mayor insisted he’s not trying to ban guns, telling Fallon that “if you are responsible and you are adult and you don’t have a criminal record, there’s nothing wrong with you having a gun.”

The problem, Bloomberg said, is that Congress doesn’t “fund enforcement” of existing gun laws and “guns are getting into the hands of the wrong people.”

“There’s just too many guns in the world and certainly in this country,” Bloomberg said. “And we’ve just got to do something about it.”

The mayor discussed his meeting Wednesday with former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot at point-blank range and nearly killed during a constituent meeting two years ago. Giffords, who is set to visit Newtown today, resigned from Congress to focus on recovery.

“She's still recovering. She’s still doing therapy and yoga and struggling to learn to speak again. … And she’s lucky. She lived,” Bloomberg said."

Story highlights NEW: Massachusetts politicians predict the bid to lure Smith & Wesson to Mississippi will fail The gun industry in Connecticut is being ""demonized,"" says Mississippi's House speaker Gunmakers in ""anti-Second Amendment states"" won't be criticized in his state, he adds A U.S. senator from Connecticut calls the pitch ""preposterous""

Mississippi House Speaker Philip Gunn has invited gunmakers such as Colt to relocate to his state from others including Connecticut, where firearms have been a controversial issue since a school shooting there last December left 20 students and six adults dead.

The gun industry in Connecticut is being attacked and “demonized” because of national politics, Gunn said in a letter this week to Colt’s Manufacturing Company CEO Dennis Veilleux.

He also invited gunmaker Magpul Industries Corp. of Colorado to relocate to Mississippi.

Gunn, a Republican, said firearm manufacturers are “under attack in anti-Second Amendment states.”

“In our state, you will not be criticized for providing goods to the law-abiding citizens who enjoy hunting, shooting or who just want the peace of mind that comes with the constitutional right to protect their families,” Gunn wrote to Colt on Thursday.

“We welcome you with open arms!” he said.

In an interview with CNN affiliate WLBT, Gunn said having gunmakers move their operations to Mississippi is a “natural match,” saying the industry “meshes well” in a state with citizens who “love to hunt, … love to shoot, (and) people enjoy the peace of mind that comes from knowing they have the right to defend themselves.”

U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said Gunn sent letters to three gunmakers in his state and called Gunn’s proposal “preposterous.”

Connecticut residents support the Second Amendment and responsible gun ownership, “far from demonizing firearms products made here,” Blumenthal said in a statement.

“This preposterous pitch to companies with long, successful histories in our state shows the need for national standards and statutes to reduce gun violence,” the senator said. “Competition among states for less protective laws is a race to the bottom that should be avoided. The poison of illegal gun trafficking respects no state boundaries and threatens to cause more horrific tragedies like Newtown and the 1,900 gun violence deaths that have occurred since then.”

Newtown is the name of the Connecticut town where last December’s mass shooting occurred, at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Representatives for Colt and Magpul couldn’t be reached immediately for comment Friday.

William “Mo” Cowan, interim U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, called Gunn’s attempt “gimmicky” and predicted it wouldn’t work to draw Smith & Wesson from its base in Springfield, according to CNN affiliate WGGB.

That sentiment was echoed by Springfield’s mayor, who said his city’s and Massachusetts’ skilled and educated workforce measured up favorably against those in Mississippi and other states.

“Smith & Wesson is not going anywhere,” Mayor Dominic Sarno told WGGB, adding he still stands by his support for “sensible gun control.” “They’ve been a vital and good corporate citizen here in the city of Springfield.”"

The SHOT show draws more than 60,000 gun enthusiasts, dealers and manufacturers to see the latest weapons and accoutrements. The convention floor contains 12 miles of firearms displays, mostly military-style assault rifles, and many booths display the kinds of high-capacity clips the administration wants to ban.

On Wednesday, the brass from the NRA and other gun-advocacy groups spent the day in closed-door sessions planning a response to Obama’s proposals, according to people close to the groups who spoke on condition their names not be used in describing internal deliberations.

LaPierre accused Vice President Biden of lying when he said there would be an open discussion before the administration developed its plan to restrict access to certain weapons and clips.

“The NRA sat in on a White House meeting that was sold to the public as an ‘open discussion’ about how to improve school safety.” LaPierre wrote. “But that was a dirty lie. They didn’t listen to gun owners’ concerns…they didn’t consider any real solutions on how we can keep our kids safe. Instead Barack Obama, Joe Biden and their gun ban allies in Congress only want to BLAME you, VILIFY you, BULLY you, and STRIP you of your Second Amendment freedoms.”

LaPierre warned his members about Obama’s plan, saying: “Right now, they’re steamrolling ahead with legislation that would ban your guns, register your ammunition purchases and even force you to register the firearms you already own with Obama’s anti-gun bureaucrats.”

The president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which is sponsoring the SHOT show, said in a dinner address to more than 1,000 attendees last night that the huge multibillion gun industry is misunderstood.

“You didn’t cause the monstrous crimes in Newtown,” said Steve Sanetti, the CEO and president of the foundation. “And neither did we.” In his speech, he specifically addressed military assault rifles, which the NSSF has rebranded “modern sporting rifles.”

“Millions of law-abiding sportsmen across the nation own them, and when those misinformed about firearms say that 'no sportsman has any need for a gun that is only used to kill people,' they are in effect calling millions of American sportsmen murderers---not exactly the way to promote civil discourse,” said Sanetti.

LaPierre’s letter took a tougher line.

“The media has been on a vicious tirade to slander and intimidate you, me and our fellow NRA members, “ LaPierre wrote. “We’ve been called terrorists and worse. They’ve blamed us and our Second Amendment freedoms for the actions of violent criminals and madmen. Our lives have been threatened.”

Several gun industry executives now have 24-hour armed guards since the Newtown shootings, according to firearms industry officials interviewed here.

“But I won’t let these brutal and bitterly personal attacks on you and me go unchallenged. I’ll fight freedom’s enemies. I’ll fight to make our schools safer. And I’ll fight for your fundamental right to self-defense and your sacred Right to Keep and Bear Arms,” LaPierre wrote. “…I need you in our corner TODAY.”

As gun-control opponents often argue, no single law will prevent any single act of gun violence. But hardly a day goes by without a reminder of how out-of-control our gun culture is, how much violence is committed with guns—and how tragic it is that the gun lobbies want to prevent the government from even trying to rein things in.

In Colorado, hours before Gov. John Hickenlooper was scheduled to sign three laws that would require background checks for all gun transfers, charge buyers for those checks and limit magazines to 15 rounds (imagine that, only 15 rounds!), the head of the Department of Corrections, Tom Clements, was murdered by a gunman at his home in Monument, Colorado, hardly a locus of street crime. Given his job, it’s not unlikely he was killed by a felon who should never have been able to obtain a gun.

Colorado has long honored the right to own guns and some county sheriffs have said they won’t enforce the new measures, but the state legislature and Gov. Hickenlooper recognized they were needed.



Which brings us to Congress, where that realization has yet to sink in. When the debate over gun laws started after the Newtown murders, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who wrote the expired assault weapons ban, introduced a new one. And other lawmakers introduced proposals to ban high-capacity ammunition clips.

But Majority Leader Harry Reid made it clear from the outset that he wasn’t going to push for those measures and neither made it into the bill that will go to the Senate floor. “America has to stand up,” said a weary and angry Senator Feinstein, who will offer a separate assault-weapons ban amendment. “I can’t fight the NRA. The NRA spends unlimited sums, backed by the gun manufacturers, who are craven in my view.”

Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, also has not given up. He is calling for a vote on high-capacity magazines.

Ms. Feinstein’s proposal will almost certainly fail, and Mr. Murphy’s likely doesn’t have a chance, either. The opposition from the gun lobbies — the National Rifle Association and the Gun Owners of America — is too intense.

Rep. Mike Thompson, Democrat of California, who is a Vietnam veteran and dedicated deer hunter, told us this morning in a meeting at the Times that he was shocked at how much the gun lobby is now dominated by people who think they need to own the same gun the police or the army has so they can protect themselves against tyranny — a grandiose fantasy.

At least Mr. Thompson thinks there’s a good chance that Congress will act to make the background-check system more comprehensive. The strategy is to bring the more or less identical background check bills on to the floor of the Senate and the House at the same time and hope that overwhelming public support for those measures will overcome the gun lobby’s objections, and reflex opposition in the House to any Democratic proposal. Mr. Thompson is co-sponsor of the House bill, with Rep. Peter King of New York, a conservative Republican.

Those bills would finally mandate background checks at gun shows, and before the purchase of any gun advertised for sale on TV, in print media or on the internet, including on sites like Craigslist. That would be a huge step.

Mr. Thompson and other proponents of gun-control laws say there is also a good chance for passage of a law intended to crack down “straw purchasers” — meaning people who can pass background checks and then re-sell guns, sometimes in large quantities, to criminals who cannot pass background checks.

Both bills are important, but neither amounts to the sort of comprehensive gun control that other Western nations enacted years ago."

(CNN) —

The second Boston bombing suspect is in custody. Now everyone will focus on what it all means, what “lesson” we can learn from the events.

This is Martin Richard’s lesson:

“No more hurting people.”

JUSTIN LAROSE/cnn

Martin Richard was one of three innocent bystanders to die on Patriot’s Day. As we debate issues of life and death in our state legislatures and Congress, we need to keep the picture of this boy and his sign not in our memories or Facebook walls, but on display.

The worldwide response to that picture – which his teacher, Rachel Moo, said was made as part of a school lesson on the shooting of Trayvon Martin – has been both heart-stirring and heartbreaking. People are striving to remember and to honor, yes; even more, though, they are trying to make his words real.

Everyone killed in the Boston bombing, and during the events that flowed from it, was under 30. Martin Richard was 8 years old; how will his classmates handle their grief?

Krystle Campbell, age 29, had moved to live with and help care for her ailing grandmother. Doctors had told Krystle’s mother she had survived the blast, but they had mistaken Krystle’s friend for Krystle. What must her mother and grandmother feel?

Lingzi Lu was a 23-year-old graduate student, the only child of her parents in China, who said learning of her death was “a dagger in our hearts.” Sean Collier, 26, was shot multiple times while in his cruiser without drawing his gun. He had been a campus policeman with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for only a little over a year, and volunteered at the gym where one suspect trained as a boxer.

Three days after the bombing of the Boston Marathon, the U.S. Senate defeated a bipartisan proposal aimed at curbing gun violence; it would have required more widespread background checks for gun purchasers, something 90% of Americans want. As a result of the bombing, immigration reform may soon become another political pingpong ball in the dysfunctional Senate.

Every pundit and every politician feels every bit of bombast is justified.

And the children? Pictures and comments, memorials on Facebook. That’s all.

“No more hurting people. Peace.”

The injured: Martin’s father and older brother, Henry, escaped injury. His 6-year-old sister, Jane, lost a leg. Martin’s mother, Denise Richard, 43, had brain surgery for a serious injury. The father, Bill Richard, 42, returned home briefly from the hospital to get clothing, and a neighbor said he was pale, almost dazed, and too grief-stricken to talk.

The sidewalk in front of their house is still covered with colored chalk drawings of butterflies, flowers, and stars that Richard and his sister had drawn before leaving for the marathon.

Jack Hart, a former state senator, told the Boston Globe that the Richards are “pillars of the community … a model family, who somehow always found the time to give something back.”

“Any tragedy of this sort is extraordinarily difficult, but when you know people, when it’s people in your life, in your school, that’s when it really hits home,”

The Boston Globe quoted a classmate of Martin’s, Colin Baker, 9, who said about Martin: “If somebody was left out, he would come say, ‘Want to join my group?’ He sticks up for kids.”

“It should not have happened to him,” Colin said to the Globe.

“It should not have happened to nobody.”

As I read and hear these responses, I keep thinking, what are we – the adults – what are we telling the children? Do we think they don’t see the hollowness behind our hallowed words? Do we think they don’t know the difference between courage and cowardice?

There’s a cliché: “Perfect is the enemy of the good.” Apparently, legislation must be perfect, because even after this horror, we are still finding ways to divide people. Should suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev be treated as an enemy combatant? Did the intelligence community pay little heed to the warning it received? Questions. Questions.

But let us pause to bury our dead and stand by the wounded as their struggle with the new reality of their lives. Some will have to learn how to simply stand up again – wounded forever.

We should hold Martin’s sign in our hearts and resolve to do better. Because, with President Barack Obama, “I’m assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words.”

I, too, believe that, “sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of those who died and many who are still suffering demand it.”

“No more hurting people. Peace.”

http://uk.news.yahoo.com/sarah-palin-praises-nra-not-giving-090909818.html,,[],Sarah Palin Praises NRA For 'Not Giving Up',"Sarah Palin has urged America's National Rifle Association not to back down in the face of pressure.

Thousands of gun fans have been listening to speakers addressing the NRA's annual convention in Houston, Texas, at which the former vice presidential candidate praised members for 'not giving up'.

Mrs Palin said: ""The Washington establishment sneers at you, and you don't give up.

""The lamestream media just plain doesn't get you, and you don't give up, you don't retreat.""

The convention was the first since the start of a national debate over gun control following December's mass shooting of teachers and school children in Newtown, Connecticut.

Mrs Palin said recent mass shootings had prompted leaders in Washington DC to exploit tragedy in order to limit the freedoms of law-abiding people.

While she and others were saddened and angered by the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary, she added, the emotions that resulted from it would not make anybody safer and would not ""protect the good guys' rights"".

The former Governor of Alaska asked those at the convention to ""keep the faith"" and ""stand up and fight for our freedoms"".

Last month a US Senate bill aimed at forcing restrictions on who could own guns was thrown out.

More than 70,000 NRA members were expected to attend the three-day convention.

Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre said his organisation would not stop defending the rights of gun owners.

He told the convention: ""We will never back away from our resolve to defend our rights and the rights of all law-abiding American gun owners.""

US President Barack Obama, who has pushed for gun control measures, was a prime target for criticism.

Gary DuBois, a member of the NRA, claimed gun control pushes crime up.

He told a film crew: ""I hate to sound like I'm paranoid or something, but the deal is, any thinking person, you can look at Britain, Australia, any place where they put gun control in effect, crime goes up.

""They can say that they are doing it for public safety, but it's just not right, they are doing it for another reason. I think it's for control.""

Story continues

Across the street from the conference hall, America's campaign against gun violence - called No More Names - was protesting by reading out the names of all those shot dead since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre.

The campaign was trying to remind NRA members that 30,000 Americans die every year from gun violence.

Erica Lafferty, whose mother, Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung, was killed in the elementary school shooting, said: ""The most recent polling that I've seen was that 74 per cent of NRA members do support the universal background check.

""It seems like it's their leadership that's kind of way more right than that and is really giving a lot of push back against it.""

Recent national polls have indicated that a majority of US citizens are in favour of expanding background checks.

But many convention attendees said on Friday that they were not in favour of such efforts.

Politicians have said they intend to continue pressing for restrictions to be brought in at the federal level.

Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, has said he will re-introduce the bill to require criminal and mental health background checks for gun buyers.

Some states have taken matters into their own hands and introduced gun controls without the need for national legislation."

After the NRA school-guard strategy was denounced as crazy%2C Obama proposed armed guards in schools.

It%27s the gun critics who appear to be out of the mainstream.

Even Al Franken understands that voters might not be so keen on gun control

Ever since the Sandy Hook shootings, we've been hearing that now, at last, it's time for the National Rifle Association to drop its ""extremist"" views and accept the sort of gun control that Democrats — and their allies in the press — were pushing long before Sandy Hook. When NRA Executive Vice President Wayne La Pierre proposed armed guards in schools, it was portrayed as evidence of how out-of-touch the organization was. Democratic pundits called on Obama to crush the NRA while it was on the ropes — when they weren't calling for its members and officers to be killed.

Whose idea was it anyway?

But then a funny thing happened. After the NRA school-guard strategy was roundly denounced as outright crazy by the pundits, — the editors of the New York Times called it ""delusional, almost deranged"" — President Obama came out with ... a proposal for armed guards in schools. It is no small feat for an out-of-touch, on-the-ropes organization to get the president to basically endorse its signature policy proposal at a time of national debate.

But, then again, it turned out that 55% of Americans supported the NRA proposal. Turns out, it was the people calling it crazy — like the editors of the New York Times — who were out of the mainstream.

Meanwhile, pundits denounced gun-rights activists who said that the right to bear arms is in part a protection against government tyranny. Only a crazed militia type could possibly believe that, right? Except that — go figure — 65% of Americans see gun rights as a protection against tyranny. And only 17% say they disagree. Once again, it's the critics who appear to be out of the mainstream.

Outside the mainstream

And by out of the mainstream, I mean really out of the mainstream. According to a post-Sandy Hook Gallup poll, the NRA,with a 54% favorable rating, is actually more popular than President Obama. By contrast, Obama's most recent approval rating from Gallup was 48%. This is particularly striking given that the NRA has faced unrelentingly hostile treatment from most press and pundits, while President Obama has received treatment that is, to put it mildly, far more generous.

Even left-Democrat Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota says he's unsure about whether he'd support an assault weapon ban. This is, I presume, because he fears that even a blue state like Minnesota doesn't want more restrictive gun laws, and that a different position will hurt him in the coming election.

In other words, it seems likely that this Washington Post claim is right: That the NRA is actually winning.

How can that be? Simple enough. The NRA more closely reflects the views of most Americans on gun issues than do Democratic pundits — or Barack Obama.

Somebody's out of the mainstream, all right. It's just not the gun-rights supporters.

Washington (CNN) – Saying she felt ""patronized"" by Senate colleague Ted Cruz, Sen. Dianne Feinstein explained Thursday why she felt the need to raise her voice in anger at the Texas Republican during a debate over gun control.

""I felt he was somewhat arrogant about it,"" Feinstein said of Cruz's suggestion the Senate Judiciary Committee was ignoring the Constitution during its debate over banning semiautomatic firearms.



She spoke on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.""

""When you come from where I've come from ... when you found a dead body and put your finger in bullet holes, you really realize the impact of weapons,"" she continued, referring to the 1978 assassination of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk, whose bodies she discovered at City Hall.

""When you see these weapons becoming attractive to grievance killers, people who take them into schools, into theaters, into malls - you wonder, does America really need these weapons? My answer to that is no. And so it's based on my experience,"" she continued.

The furious exchange with Cruz came before the judiciary panel passed the assault weapons ban Feinstein introduced on a party line vote. After Cruz implored the committee not to forget the Constitution in its debate, Feinstein angrily replied, ""I'm not a sixth grader.""

""I've studied the Constitution myself. I am reasonably well-educated and I thank you for the lecture,"" she continued, noting that the assault weapons ban backed by President Barack Obama but opposed by the powerful gun lobby exempted certain weapons.

""Isn't that enough for the people in the United States? Do they need a bazooka? Do they need other high-powered weapons that military people use to kill in close combat? I don't think so,"" she said.

She concluded by telling Cruz that ""I come from a different place than you do. I respect your views. I ask you to respect my views.""

Afterward, Feinstein said she needed time to ""cool down"" before speaking to her Republican colleague.

""I did say, 'Look, I'm sorry. But, you know, this is one thing that I feel very passionately about,'"" Feinstein recalled saying.

Now that her assault weapons ban is heading to the full Senate, Feinstein said she expects Obama to begin working with lawmakers to build support.

Despite polls showing that such a prohibition resonates with Americans, most observers don't give the bill much of a chance in the full Senate.

The California Democrat isn't one of them.

""The people do want it,"" Feinstein said. ""So I hope the people make the connection now with their representatives. In the West, in the Midwest, in the South and in the East. And say, 'yes, we agree with the polls. We want this bill.'""

The legislation was prompted by December's school shooting in Connecticut."

Donna Brazile says others who died were also under 30 and were innocent victims of terror

During the same week, a bill to require background checks for more gun purchasers failed

Brazile: Will we continue to fail victims of senseless violence?

The second Boston bombing suspect is in custody. Now everyone will focus on what it all means, what ""lesson"" we can learn from the events.

""No more hurting people.""

Martin Richard was one of three innocent bystanders to die on Patriot's Day. As we debate issues of life and death in our state legislatures and Congress, we need to keep the picture of this boy and his sign not in our memories or Facebook walls, but on display.

The worldwide response to that picture -- which his teacher, Rachel Moo, said was made as part of a school lesson on the shooting of Trayvon Martin -- has been both heart-stirring and heartbreaking. People are striving to remember and to honor, yes; even more, though, they are trying to make his words real.

Everyone killed in the Boston bombing, and during the events that flowed from it, was under 30. Martin Richard was 8 years old; how will his classmates handle their grief?

Krystle Campbell , age 29, had moved to live with and help care for her ailing grandmother. Doctors had told Krystle's mother she had survived the blast, but they had mistaken Krystle's friend for Krystle. What must her mother and grandmother feel?

Lingzi Lu was a 23-year-old graduate student, the only child of her parents in China, who said learning of her death was ""a dagger in our hearts."" Sean Collier , 26, was shot multiple times while in his cruiser without drawing his gun. He had been a campus policeman with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for only a little over a year, and volunteered at the gym where one suspect trained as a boxer.

Three days after the bombing of the Boston Marathon, the U.S. Senate defeated a bipartisan proposal aimed at curbing gun violence; it would have required more widespread background checks for gun purchasers, something 90% of Americans want. As a result of the bombing, immigration reform may soon become another political pingpong ball in the dysfunctional Senate.

Every pundit and every politician feels every bit of bombast is justified.

And the children? Pictures and comments, memorials on Facebook. That's all.

""No more hurting people. Peace.""

The injured: Martin's father and older brother, Henry, escaped injury. His 6-year-old sister, Jane, lost a leg. Martin's mother, Denise Richard, 43, had brain surgery for a serious injury. The father, Bill Richard, 42, returned home briefly from the hospital to get clothing, and a neighbor said he was pale, almost dazed, and too grief-stricken to talk.

The sidewalk in front of their house is still covered with colored chalk drawings of butterflies, flowers, and stars that Richard and his sister had drawn before leaving for the marathon.

Jack Hart, a former state senator, told the Boston Globe that the Richards are ""pillars of the community ... a model family, who somehow always found the time to give something back.""

""Any tragedy of this sort is extraordinarily difficult, but when you know people, when it's people in your life, in your school, that's when it really hits home,""

The Boston Globe quoted a classmate of Martin's, Colin Baker, 9, who said about Martin: ""If somebody was left out, he would come say, 'Want to join my group?' He sticks up for kids.""

""It should not have happened to him,"" Colin said to the Globe.

""It should not have happened to nobody.""

As I read and hear these responses, I keep thinking, what are we -- the adults -- what are we telling the children? Do we think they don't see the hollowness behind our hallowed words? Do we think they don't know the difference between courage and cowardice?

There's a cliché: ""Perfect is the enemy of the good."" Apparently, legislation must be perfect, because even after this horror, we are still finding ways to divide people. Should suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev be treated as an enemy combatant? Did the intelligence community pay little heed to the warning it received? Questions. Questions.

But let us pause to bury our dead and stand by the wounded as their struggle with the new reality of their lives. Some will have to learn how to simply stand up again -- wounded forever.

We should hold Martin's sign in our hearts and resolve to do better. Because, with President Barack Obama, ""I'm assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words.""

I, too, believe that, ""sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of those who died and many who are still suffering demand it.""

""No more hurting people. Peace.""

Weld County, Colo., Sheriff John Cooke, left, with El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa, center right, and other sheriffs standing behind him, speaks during a news conference at which he announced that 54 Colorado sheriffs are filing a federal civil lawsuit against two gun control bills passed by the Colorado Legislature, in Denver, Friday, May 17 2013. (Photo: AP)

In the wake of the tragedy in Aurora, Colorado passed some of the strictest gun control measures in the country.

But in recent months, an overwhelming 55 of the state's 62 county sheriffs have joined a lawsuit aiming to block the measures.

""These bills do absolutely nothing to make Colorado a safer place to live, to work, to play or to raise a family,"" Weld County Sheriff John Cooke explained at a recent press conference. ""Instead these misguided, unconstitutional bills will have the opposite effect because they greatly restrict the right of decent, law-abiding citizens to defend themselves, their families and their homes.""

Sheriff Terry Maketa of El Paso County is one of the opposing sheriffs, and he explained on TheBlaze TV Wednesday how the public was ""duped"" into supporting overly vague legislation banning high-capacity magazines and requiring background checks.

Maketa says they believe the laws are unenforceable, but also violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments.

After explaining the tactics used to pass the bills that essentially ""eliminated all public input,"" Maketa reiterated that it's clearly an ""overreaching step"" for politicians to claim law enforcement supports stricter gun control.

When asked by Pat Gray whether he and other sheriffs are ""getting flak"" for standing against the stricter measures, Maketa replied that it's the ""exact opposite.""

""I would say the communications I've received are 99% in favor,"" he added.

""I think Colorado is the epicenter of this battle, and 55 Colorado sheriffs have drawn a line in the sand and said 'We're not going to tolerate it,' he concluded. ""[The laws] are unenforceable...and we certainly are not going to compromise citizens' rights [to claim] that we are.""

The bill is thorough and bipartisan. Swift approval would send a message to the entire country that, as John McKinney, the Republican State Senate minority leader, observed, some issues must rise above politics. Mr. McKinney represents Newtown, where, in December, a gunman armed with a Bushmaster XM-15 military-style rifle massacred 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

If the bill becomes law, no firearm could be sold in Connecticut until the buyer passes a national criminal background check; private sales of rifles and shotguns will be regulated; the list of banned assault weapons will be expanded from 66 to more than 150; and the sale, purchase, transfer or importing of large-capacity magazines (more than 10 bullets) will be prohibited.

Because of pressure from the gun lobby, lawmakers refused to add a ban on current possession of these magazines. They also failed to include a provision requiring the annual registration of handguns, including proof that a gun is still with the original owner. Connecticut Against Gun Violence, an advocacy group, says that most of the state’s gun murders occur in the cities of Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport; of these, most are committed with handguns no longer with the original owners. But lawmakers chose not to push back against the gun lobby’s false claim that registration leads to confiscation.

The gun lobby’s basic position is that the package would not have prevented the Newtown massacre. But it might have, if one of its provisions had been law: current state law requires secure firearms storage in households with anyone under 16; the bill extends that to households where the gun owner knows that someone living there poses a risk of imminent injury to himself or others. By significantly limiting access to the most dangerous firearms and ammunition, the package will not only contribute to public safety in Connecticut but will provide a laudable example to Congress and other states of what can be achieved with a serious bipartisan effort."

The same day that the NRA's GOP minions decided that it was okay for a violent criminal to shoot me in the face, I discover that the Boston investigators are blocked from doing a thorough investigation because of the NRA and their allies.

Identification taggants are used to make it possible to trace explosive materials after detonation back to the source of the bomb. It is simple, cheap, and allows tracing to a point of sale. Law enforcement, the ATF, and others have pleaded for it. Clinton tried to make it mandatory after the OK City bombing. Current experts say it would have helped with the current investigation.

""We really need five votes,"" Manchin, a Democrat, said during an interview at the Atlantic's New York Ideas Festival. The original bill, which Manchin co-sponsored with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, failed in a 54-46 Senate vote last month.

A new bill, Manchin said, is in the works. ""Oh, it's coming back,"" he said.

Manchin said he needs to educate law-abiding gun owners who support the legislation but don't trust the government.

""The big problem is that they're afraid that this is the first step because they've seen overreach,"" he said.

The background check bill, Manchin said, not only protects Second Amendment rights, but expands them.

Other detractors said the bill might infringe on gun transfers between family members. ""It doesn't at all,"" Manchin said.

The Democratic senator also scoffed at talk of the ""culture war"" discussed at the National Rifle Association convention in Houston over the weekend as cage-rattling rhetoric.

""What you saw was the division that's going on across the country,"" Manchin, a gun owner and member of the NRA, said. ""I don't know why we can't sit and talk and work together as Americans.""

Manchin said the school shootings in Newtown, Conn., affected his views.

""If Newtown didn't change you, nothing will,"" Manchin said. ""It made you think, 'Can we do something a little better?'""

Twenty-six people, including 20 children, were killed in the Dec. 14, 2012, shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Manchin added: ""None of those families came to my office and asked to repeal the Second Amendment."" They asked him to make it harder for people who are bent on killing to get guns.

""That was a small ask,"" he said."

On Wednesday, the same day the US Senate voted down gun control legislation, powerful Democrat Speaker Michael Madigan tried to push a restrictive gun control measure through his chamber. The result was an open revolt by downstate Democrats, with almost half the Democrat caucus joining the GOP to kill the measure. The bill went down 31-76, a rare defeat for the legendary Madigan.

Illinois is currently the only state in the country which doesn’t allow its citizens to have a concealed-carry gun permit. In December 2012, a federal appeals court struck down the state’s ban on concealed-carry permits, effectively ordering the state to enact the gun rights’ permit. The state is under a court-ordered deadline to pass the legislation.

On Wednesday, Dem leadership in the House moved legislation that would put severe restrictions on concealed-carry permits. It would provide that local law enforcement officials “may issue” permits, a provision that would allow local officials to effectively deny citizens in a particular jurisdiction a permit. “Must issue” permits, as long as certain criteria are met, conform more to our 2nd Amendment rights as local officials are not given the power to deny the permits.

My first political job was in the Illinois legislature a life-time ago. Madigan, who is Chair of the IL Democrat party and father to state Attorney General Lisa Madigan, was Speaker then, as well. He is among the more shrewd and calculating political power-brokers in the country. He almost never loses a floor vote.

It is possible, however, that he orchestrated the vote to allow his members from outside Chicago to vote against the measure. It wouldn’t be the first time he allowed the defeat of a progressive policy to protect members of his caucus.

Either way, the Democrat revolt on the gun control measure shows the bad politics around the issue. Even while Obama embraces gun control at the federal level, Democrats in his home state reject them. Unlike Obama, they have to face voters again.

A group with both the standing and expertise to effect change is trying to make it happen. United Physicians of Newtown, formed in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook killings, wants to turn the gun debate away from the usual contours and focus the discussion on public health. There ought to be some common ground. It's a regular refrain from the no-gun-regulations crowd that since cars cause thousands of deaths maybe we ought to ban cars, not guns. But the issue isn't banning. The issue is that cars and driving are heavily regulated, and as a result are much less harmful than they might otherwise be (for instance, because of seatbelts). The same is true for alcohol and cigarettes, both of which can cause serious harm but neither of which are banned.

United Physicians of Newtown is the group I'm a member of, and have been writing about here and here . The group does not fund raise. But we are into policy

Morgan Whitaker:

“They call me crazy, yet the people doing the finger pointing are doing things that are absolutely bizarre,” Wayne LaPierre said, adding, ”It’s time to take a look at the insanity that’s consumed the media and too many in this town.”

Of course we have learned that majority of the NRA’s 5 million members don’t agree with LaPierre, who argued that no new laws should be pursued to address gun violence, beyond arming teachers. A recent Johns Hopkins University survey shows 75% of self-identified NRA members support universal background check laws, a policy LaPierre opposes. He also claimed that “the vast majority of Americans” favor trained armed police and security officers in every school. Apparently LaPierre’s definition of “vast majority” is a two point margin, because an ABC News/Washington Post poll asked this question in the last week and found only 50% of Americans agreed with LaPierre, compared to 48% who disagreed. Moreover, support for that idea has declined in since the question was asked in January, only a few weeks after the Newtown school shooting. LaPierre wasn’t only confused about how Americans and his own organizations members feel about the issues. He also claimed that gun ownership is at an all-time high in America, despite a report released just this week that shows gun ownership has declined in the last four years.

Shannon Hicks, a reporter and photographer for the weekly Bee of Newtown, Connecticut, was perhaps the first journalist to arrive at the Sandy Hook Elementary School last December 14 to cover what turned out to be the massacre of 20 children and six adults. She took a picture of children leaving the school that showed up the next day on the front page of the New York Times, and a couple of weeks ago she served as the entree into Rachel Aviv's New Yorker story [behind paywall, alas] on the Bee's response to the massacre. In typically understated New Yorker style, Aviv brought her report into focus with the following paragraph:

""After the second class had been evacuated, the education reporter came to retrieve the memory card from Hicks's camera, and Hicks went over to the Sandy Hook Volunteer Fire & Rescue Company, which had just arrived. She bunched up her knee-length skirt and pulled bunker pants over it, and put on boots, a turnout coat, and a helmet. With three other firefighters, she set up a triage area near the school's baseball field, laying out medical bags, collars, backboards, and stretchers."" Reporters don't commonly double as volunteer firefighters. Reporters don't commonly surrender their memory cards and stop reporting the biggest story of their career because of a volunteer obligation. What obligation—as any Chicago reporter would ask you—could possibly exceed serving the people’s right to know? I read Aviv's article because someone in my book club, a retired Chicago homicide detective named Jim Hennigan, sent us all an e-mail recommending it. He explained in a later e-mail that Aviv's story interested him because it was about ""how the practice of that craft [journalism] might complement one's membership in a community or be challenged by it.""

http://news.yahoo.com/meet-sheriff-refuses-uphold-obamas-gun-laws-173901463.html,,[],Meet the Sheriff Who Refuses to Uphold Obama's New Gun Laws,"Well you can count out one local law-enforcement agent who's not buying the executive actions just signed at the White House or any potential new gun legislation to come. An Oregon sheriff is citing his constitutional duty in accusing politicians of ""attempting to exploit the deaths of innocent victims"" to enact new gun laws that he thinks would harm his law-abiding locals. Linn County Sheriff Tim Mueller has promised not to enforce any new gun laws enacted in the wake of the Newtown shootings, making him pretty much the​ gun-rights hero of a very big day for pro-gun America. The reason we're hearing so much from this obscure sheriff is that he sent a letter to Vice-President Joe Biden and shared it with multiple news outlets like the Associated Press. There are two main kernels from his complaint — the first implies that politicians are exploiting the Newtown massacre:

And here's Mueller's promise not to enact what he deems ""unconstitutional"" new gun laws and ""actions,"" such as the 23 President Obama just signed into law:

Somewhere in an undisclosed location, the powerful people behind the National Rifle Association are smiling. Mueller's points aren't unlike Wayne LaPierre's and the NRA's talking points — that the 2nd Amendment is very important, that there are good guys with the guns, and that good guys need guns to protect themselves with bad guys with guns. And Mueller's comments bear a close resemblance to New York State Senator Greg Ball, who admonished the state's newly passed and very tough regulations on Tuesday. Ball said:

I simply cannot support a bill that turns law abiding citizens into criminals by creating an entire new category of illegal firearms out of currently legal rifles and shotguns,” said Senator Greg Ball.

Kutztown%2C Shippensburg%2C Edinboro%2C Slippery Rock%2C Millersville universities changed policies

Students with concealed-carry permits had questioned the constitutionality of blanket weapons bans

22 states ban concealed weapons and 5 allow firearms on public university campuses

KUTZTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Students on some of Pennsylvania's college campuses might be carrying more than books.

At least five Pennsylvania state-owned universities are now allowing guns on campus after the state's lawyers concluded that an outright ban on weapons was likely unconstitutional.

Kutztown, Shippensburg, Edinboro, Slippery Rock and Millersville universities have all quietly changed their policies over the past year to reflect the advice of lawyers in the governor's office and the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. Students in those schools are now allowed to have weapons on campus, though they are still generally banned from school buildings and athletic events.

Students with concealed-carry permits had questioned the constitutionality of blanket weapons bans at state-owned universities, prompting a legal review that found such bans were vulnerable to court challenge.

Pennsylvania is among 23 states that allow individual colleges or universities to decide if they'll ban concealed weapons on campus, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Twenty-two states ban concealed weapons and five — Colorado, Mississippi, Oregon, Utah and Wisconsin — allow firearms on public university campuses.

Kutztown changed its policy April 19, though it had largely escaped notice until Kutztown President F. Javier Cevallos emailed students, faculty and staff about it Thursday night.

Under the new policy, licensed gun owners are permitted to bring their weapons onto campus, but not into buildings or athletic events without permission from the university police chief. The chief will consider making an exception if there is a ""compelling reason"" related to personal safety, the policy says.

Kutztown is not endorsing weapons on campus, spokesman Matt Santos said Friday.

""Our president does not believe that guns have a place on campus,"" he said. ""We will do what we can to keep our campus free of weapons and have written the policy to keep it as strong as possible to keep weapons away from buildings and campus events. We believe we provide a very safe environment for students to learn and live.""

Although there has been no legal challenge mounted in Pennsylvania, the state's lawyers cautioned that ""blanket firearms bans were vulnerable to constitutional challenge and exposed the universities"" to legal claims, said Nils Hagen-Frederiksen, a spokesman for the governor's Office of General Counsel.

About a year ago, the state system provided a model weapons policy for consideration by all 14 schools ""that more narrowly tailored the firearms restriction, addressing both public safety and constitutional concerns,"" Hagen-Frederiksen said.

Pennsylvania's concealed-carry law is silent on the issue of guns on college campuses. Other state laws do prohibit firearms in K-12 schools and court facilities, but there is no statute banning firearms possession at state-owned universities.

Thus ""an outright weapons ban on public college campuses may be a problem under Pennsylvania law,"" Michael Moreland, a vice dean and professor at Villanova University's law school, said via email.

Last year, he noted, the Colorado Supreme Court struck down the University of Colorado's ban, ruling it violated the state's concealed-carry law.

The new university weapons policies seemed unlikely to turn Pennsylvania's campuses into armed camps. At Kutztown, gun owners are generally limited to wandering the campus with their firearms, locking them in their cars, or checking them in at the police department.

Still, as word of the new policy spread across campus Friday, students debated whether it's a good idea to allow weapons.

""It promotes violence. You have lethal weapons on campus in a place where we're supposed to get a higher education, not carry bullets and guns and be prepared to kill someone. It's bizarre to me,"" said James Alexander, 21, a political science major from Pottstown.

But another student raised the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, in which a gunman killed 32 students before committing suicide, to argue in favor of a well-armed student body.

""It could potentially have been stopped,"" said Tony Pavoncello, 20, a freshman from York. ""If one or more students had been armed and had been there when he came in the door, you never know what might have happened. It might have changed something.""

Pennsylvania's largest university, Penn State, bans all weapons from campus, though students who hunt or shoot recreationally are permitted to store them with police. Penn State receives a state appropriation each year but is not owned by the state. The University of Pittsburgh — likewise state-supported but not state-run — also prohibits weapons anywhere on campus.

""Our feeling is that police, who are trained in handling firearms, shooting accuracy during stressful situations and in making quick decisions and judgments, should be the ones with weapons,"" Penn State spokeswoman Lisa Powers said via email Friday. ""They are the experts.""

Gun-rights advocates including Students for Concealed Carry — a group launched in the wake of Virginia Tech —maintain that an armed campus is a safer campus because police typically can't respond quickly enough to stop a mass shooter in the act.

A campus police chiefs' association, the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, takes an opposing view. Its board has declared that allowing guns on campus could ""dramatically increase violence.""

Although Kutztown changed its rules just a few weeks ago, the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education appeared to be having second thoughts Friday, telling all 14 member schools to hold off on weapons policy changes until a task force on campus safety can weigh in.

""Given the importance of this issue, the significance of this issue, we think it's a good idea to take a second look,"" state system spokesman Kenn Marshall said."

""The Second Amendment!"" was shouted by several gun enthusiasts in the meeting room as Neil Heslin, holding a photo of his 6-year-old son, Jesse Lewis, asked why Bushmaster assault-style weapons are allowed to be sold in the state.

The Connecticut Post , via Joe. My. God. I'm going to put ""heckling the father of murdered six year old"" right at the top of my updated list of signs that America can safely ignore you, or at least not give a single flying shit as to what supposed rights you think you have, but I do want to reiterate one point: For a sizable percentage of America's most aggressive gun fetishists (not ""enthusiasts,"" please—there's a difference between shooting as a hobby and stockpiling guns as your own personal anti-government, anti-society religion) the ability to quickly murder a classroom or two of elementary school kids isn't a bug. It's a feature.

This would be the prime argument of all the loons citing incipient ""tyranny"" as the reason they deserve guns, and all possible guns at that. If you're claiming that you need your guns because you might need to murder members of the government (yes, that is what ""fighting tyranny"" comes down to, when you're doing it with stockpiled ammunition), then the ability to murder a large number of people quickly is a prime feature. These aren't people who mumble about needing high capacity, military style weaponry because today's modern deer really need 30 or so shots pumped into them before they'll stay down—they're perfectly blunt about saying they need it because someday, there's gonna be ""tyranny,"" and if they themselves wake up one morning and decide that ""tyranny"" has come they need to be able to go to their closet, arm up, and start killing people who think otherwise. Often, for some reason that most of the rest of us can't even begin to parse, it's couched in crackpot religious terms, often citing ""prophesies"" and other Jesus-sounding stuff as the reason why potential mass murder is, well, just around the corner.

That someone can easily dispatch a roomful or two of elementary school children, or college students, or theater-goers, or restaurant-goers with these same weapons is not seen by these people as something that needs fixing—at all. Yes, it's sad that those particular people got murdered, but whether Americans have the God-given right to murder a large number of people quickly, and easily, if they feel the circumstances warrant it is something the tyranny fetishists will go to their graves, or your grave, or the local sheriff's grave believing in.

The other tricky part of this is that (of course) the people most obsessed with defending themselves against government ""tyranny"" are the people who see ""tyranny"" in absolutely everything. The United Nations is coming for them; Barack Obama is a crazy Marxist; bicycle paths are a sign of the devil. The most unhinged people among us are the people who have volunteered themselves as the judges, juries, and executioners of any American government figures they've decided they don't like—and those are the people that a large segment of our no-gun-regulations-ever crowd are catering to. Why? You could suppose the NRA, as obvious example, is merely acting as passthru for the manufacturer's lobby, which makes a very sizable income off of crazy frightened people, or you could suppose them to be unironic believers in the tyranny theory of American proto-terrorists someday becoming American freedom fighters—but why does the we'd like to maybe someday be able to kill members of the government theory get so much mainstream love from supposedly mainstream sources?

It seems rather obvious that we could take all the arguments as to why one might need a 30-round clip because of potential tyranny and just flush that entire population from legitimate discussion. If tyranny does come to America, your little closet stockpile is not going to do a damn bit of good against the Air Force, and basing all our public safety decisions around your own little delusion that it might, someday, is not a very good reason for our continued enabling of frequent, convenient mass murder. So that seems a good first step: If you're arguing that people need to be able to speedily murder other people because someday you and your little band of societal malcontents may want to murder the right people, the ones who really need murdering, all of the policymakers concerned with American public safety ought to write off your opinions on the matter from the outset. Then the rest of us can begin to have a discussion on guns in America that isn't objectively, you know, insane.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/03/house-to-vote-on-banning-plastic-firearms/,2013-12-03 00:00:00,[],House votes to renew ban on plastic firearms,"Amid fears that 3-D printers could produce plastic weapons that easily evade metal detectors, the House voted Tuesday to renew a ban on plastic and other non-metal guns.

The bill, which was approved by voice vote, is the rare piece of gun legislation that both parties seem capable of agreeing on. It was sponsored by Republican Rep. Howard Coble, of North Carolina, and Democratic Rep. Steve Israel, of New York.

The bill, which provides a 10-year extension of a ban that has been in place for 25 years, heads next to the Senate.

There is some partisan division, though, over how far Congress should go in regulating plastic guns.

The bill approved Tuesday would renew a 1988 measure that bans the manufacture, import or sale of any firearm that can't be picked up by a metal detector. The measure has taken on new urgency as some have figured out how to produce plastic weapons on emerging 3-D printer technology.

The bill would not necessarily ban someone from producing such a weapon -- but it would have to include a metal component.

Some Democrats, though, want to go further and require the metal components to be a permanent part of the gun. Right now, the metal parts on such weapons can snap on and snap off.

While the House approved the basic renewal Tuesday afternoon, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he will seek fast approval of a measure renewing the ban and tightening the restrictions when the Democratic-run Senate returns from a two-week Thanksgiving break next Monday, the day before the ban expires. His office says the current bill leaves in place a ""dangerous loophole.""

The National Rifle Association, which helped defeat last spring's background check measure, has said nothing publicly about whether it supports extending the ban on undetectable firearms.

But congressional aides and lobbyists say the group supports the renewal but opposes efforts to tighten the curbs. A longer renewal would limit Democrats' opportunities to use bills extending the ban to include other gun restrictions.

In a letter to lawmakers last month, the smaller National Shooting Sports Foundation -- representing the nation's gun-makers and retailers -- said it backs the extension but opposes added restrictions on undetectable guns.

""We are always concerned that laws and regulations do not hamper the ability of our members to take advantage of technological advancements,"" the group wrote.

The conservative Gun Owners of America opposes the extension, saying such laws wouldn't stop criminals intent on printing weapons.

""They've just spent all year trying to effectively destroy the gun lobby,"" Mike Hammond, legislative counsel of the small group, said of Democrats. ""So why in heaven's name, given this intransigence, should we give them this Christmas present?""

The ban was first enacted in 1988 under President Ronald Reagan, when today's computer and weapons technologies were in their early stages. It was renewed in 1998 and 2003.

Fast forward to 2013, a world where 3-D printers can spray repeated, thin layers of plastic or other materials to create objects from toys to automobile parts to medical devices. They are being used increasingly by companies, researchers and hobbyists, and the technology is constantly improving.

The use of 3-D printers to make guns received heightened attention in May when Cody Wilson, then a University of Texas law student, posted blueprints online for using the printers to make the Liberator pistol, which he says he designed.

Wilson, founder of Defense Distributed, a nonprofit that advocates the free distribution of information on 3-D printed weapons, was ordered by the State Department to take down the instructions after two days because of allegedly violating arms export controls, he said.

At that point, the plans had already been downloaded more than 100,000 times and they remain available on file-sharing websites, he said.

""If you want to do this, it's plainly obvious there's no one standing between you, your computer and your 3-D printer. Anyone can make this gun,"" Wilson said Monday.

Earlier this year, ATF tested two guns made from different plastics using Wilson's Liberator design. While one exploded when fired, the other shot eight rounds before ATF halted the test.

""The undetectable firearm threat has become real,"" agency spokesman Timothy Graden said in an emailed statement.

http://news.yahoo.com/-navy-yard-shooting-to-spur-gun-debate-%E2%80%93-but-little-action-likely-154819330.html,,[],Navy Yard shooting to spur gun debate — but little action likely,"Congress is about as likely to impose firecracker control after a man lobbed some at the White House on Monday as lawmakers are to tighten gun laws after the slaughter of 12 people at the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., only a few hours earlier.

That’s the grim feeling among profoundly frustrated gun-control advocates and their Democratic allies on Capitol Hill. They say privately that if the Christmastime massacre of 20 schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., last year couldn’t spur action on modest steps to combat gun violence, what chance does the killing of a dozen adults have?

""We don’t have the votes. I hope to get them, but we don’t have them now,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday when asked if the Senate would revisit a bill to tighten background checks after Monday's shootings. The Senate rejected a similar measure in April.

That measure failed by five votes — Reid switched his “yes” vote to “no” in a procedural move that permits him to bring the proposal up again. On Tuesday, Reid said that he might consider revisiting a separate, limited bill that would exclusively address mental health issues.

“Anything we can do to focus attention on the senseless killings that take place,” Reid said. “That’s something we will look at.”



On Monday, the tone of frustration with Congress' inaction on gun legislation came from the very top, as President Barack Obama deplored that “we are confronting yet another mass shooting.”

“We're going to be investigating thoroughly what happened, as we do so many of these shootings, sadly, that have happened, and do everything that we can to try to prevent them,” he added.

Obama made no mention of another push in Congress — and White House press secretary Jay Carney added to the impression of congressional stalemate at his briefing not long afterward.

“We will continue to work to take action to reduce gun violence in this country through executive action, and hopefully Congress will take action to reduce gun violence as well,” Carney told reporters.

Story continues

Democrats facing an uphill re-election fight in the 2014 midterm elections “would rather see executive action on this than walk the plank with another vote on something that won’t go anywhere in the House,” said another Democratic congressional aide, who also requested anonymity to discuss the tragedy’s political dimensions.

That was the reality in Congress as about 75 gun-control advocates organized by the Newtown Action Alliance were poised to arrive in Washington around noon on Tuesday for a long-scheduled event urging congressional action on the issue.



The group had planned to attend a Tuesday Senate subcommittee hearing on ""stand your ground"" self-defense laws, but that hearing was postponed indefinitely on Monday due to the Navy Yard shootings. To mark the nine-month anniversary of the Newtown shootings, the advocates — including family members of victims at Sandy Hook Elementary School and Virginia Tech — will hold a press conference on Wednesday and meet with lawmakers to pressure them to pass gun-control legislation.

Dave Ackert, the founder of the Newtown Action Alliance, said they are not ""optimistic"" that gun laws will change any time soon, but they hope gun control will now again at least become a matter of debate.

""Maybe now that it came in their backyard it will be harder for a lot of these lawmakers to keep looking the other way. That's the hope anyway,"" Ackert told Yahoo News.

Some officials reflected on the mass shootings since Obama took office in January 2009 — at places such as Fort Hood, Tucson, Aurora, Oak Creek and Newtown.

“We are becoming far too familiar with senseless, tragic violence,"" West Virginia Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller said in a statement. “This is the seventh shooting since 2009, and these repeated incidents demand our attention.""

California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a longtime advocate for tightening federal gun laws, called on lawmakers to resume a debate over gun control.

“When will enough be enough? Congress must stop shirking its responsibility and resume a thoughtful debate on gun violence in this country. We must do more to stop this endless loss of life,” she said in a statement.

Earlier this year, Feinstein authored a bill in response to the mass shootings in Newtown that would have banned ""assault weapons,"" but the Senate rejected the proposal before going on to vote down the separate measure that sought to expand background checks.

And Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, pressed Congress to do something — but did not signal any aggressive new push.

“While it is too early to know what policies might have prevented this latest tragedy, we do know that policies that present a real opportunity to save lives sit stalled in Congress,” Gross said. “As long as our leaders in Congress ignore the will of the people and do not listen to those voices, we will hold them accountable. We hope Congress will listen to the voice of the people and take up legislation that will create a safer America.""

But what might that legislation look like? If early reports are true, the suspect, Aaron Alexis, had a violent past that included allegedly firing his gun through a neighbor’s ceiling, and he was being treated for mental illness. But under existing laws he could purchase firearms and had the necessary clearance as a Defense Department contractor to gain access to the Navy Yard.

Lawmakers have seemed more willing to tackle issues related to security clearances and contractors — perhaps a side effect of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden’s sweeping revelations about American surveillance. And they also have signaled a willingness to expand mental health treatment. Neither is likely to draw the kind of forceful lobbying campaign like the National Rifle Association’s no-holds-barred blitz after Newtown.

Democratic House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said on Tuesday at an event hosted by Politico that the Navy Yard suspect was “somebody who had a record of instability and certainly should have been, I think, subject to closer scrutiny.”



House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, R.-Calif., said he had received a Defense Department inspector general report on contractor access to Navy installations.



“The report details critical flaws in the practice of contracting access control for military installations to non-governmental personnel,” he said in a statement. “While the timing of the delivery of this report was coincidental, I believe it to be relevant to physical security on military installations and to the committee's hearing tomorrow on the impact of defense cuts.”

But gun rights advocates are sure to advance the argument that the solution isn’t more laws, it’s enforcement of existing laws. The Navy Yard suspect violated several gun-related Washington, D.C., laws, ABC News noted.

And David Kopel, adjunct professor of law at Denver University and an analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute think tank, said Alexis should have faced felony convictions for his previous gun-related wrongdoing.

""This was the case of another completely preventable mass murder that could have been stopped if we had a more effective criminal justice system and mental health system,"" Kopel told Yahoo News.

You’ve made it clear that it’s time to do something.”

Before departing on his trip to Israel and Jordan, Obama spoke with lawmakers from both parties about the gun measures under consideration, according to a White House official. The president plans to continue pressuring Congress on the issue, including additional travel outside of Washington designed to mobilize public support, said the official, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.

Obama’s remarks come after a difficult week for his gun violence agenda. After a ban on assault weapons -- supported by Obama and authored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) -- did not gain enough bipartisan traction on Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) decided not to include it as part of a bill encompassing several other gun-control proposals that the Senate is scheduled to begin debating in early April. Reid’s decision severely diminished any prospect of passing a prohibition on hundreds of specific so-called assault weapons, although Feinstein still can introduce the assault weapons ban as an amendment to the full bill.

The centerpiece of Obama’s gun-control agenda is universal background checks, which has by far the most support among Americans, and appears to have more momentum in the Senate than the assault weapons ban.

In his radio address, Obama urged the Senate and the House to vote on each of the proposals he is championing – from background checks to bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines to school safety measures to the gun trafficking bill.

“These ideas shouldn’t be controversial – they’re common sense,” Obama said. “They’re supported by a majority of the American people. And I urge the Senate and the House to give each of them a vote.”"

And heading into the August 30 Gilberton Borough Council meeting–where he is expected to learn his professional fate–Kessler makes it clear he is willing to lose his job for the Second Amendment.

As time draws closer to the council meeting that could end his police career, Kessler says: “The support has been overwhelming, both national and international. I find it truly amazing how many people finally say, ‘You know what? This guy’s right.'”

In one of the video’s Kessler posted, he stands with an ‘assault rifle’ slung over his shoulder and reads a few pre-scripted words about Secretary of State John Kerry’s support of the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty–the treaty which undermines the Second Amendment by giving the international body ruling authority over small arms in the U.S.

Here’s what Kessler says in the video: “They’re at it again. They just don’t know when to quit. …Kerry says, ‘U.S. will sign U.N. treaty on arms regulations despite lawmaker’s opposition.'” Kessler then looks right into the camera and says, “Secretary of State of John Kerry, that piece of shit…who is he to decide what we can and can’t own? And fuck the U.N. Who are they to decide what we, the American people, can own?”

Kessler then adds: “I have a message to Kerry and to these $%#@suckers in the U.N., ….sign anything you want to sign, it’s not going to mean shit. It [doesn’t] mean shit to me.”

Kessler then screams the Gonzales battle cry, “Come and take it!” and turns away from the camera and opens full-auto fire into the hillside right behind him.

The man loves freedom and he does not want an international body taking it away by degrees. He says that if he loses his job for standing up for the Second Amendment he is “willing to pay that price.”

According to unofficial results, voters in Colorado Springs favored recalling state Sen. John Morse, the body's president, by 51 percent to 49 percent. With 100 percent of precincts reporting, state Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo was defeated in her recall election, 56 percent to 44 percent.

The Colorado Republican Party called the vote results ""a loud and clear message to out-of-touch Democrats across the nation"" in a statement released late Tuesday. Colorado's Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, said he was ""disappointed by the outcome of the recall elections"" before calling on state residents to ""refocus again on what unites Coloradans -- creating jobs, educating our children, creating a healthier state -- and on finding ways to keep Colorado moving forward.""

""We as the Democratic Party will continue to fight,"" Morse told supporters in Colorado Springs as he conceded the race. Republican Bernie Herpin, a former Colorado Springs city councilman, will replace him. Giron will be replaced by Republican George Rivera, a former deputy police chief in Pueblo.

""We will win in the end because we are on the right side,"" Giron said in her concession speech.

The votes marked the first time in Colorado history that a state lawmaker faced a recall effort and the biggest backlash in states that passed tougher gun-control laws following two mass shootings last year – at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater and a Newtown, Conn., elementary school.

Democratic-leaning Connecticut, Maryland, and New York also passed tougher gun laws without a recall effort making a state ballot.

The states’ effort came after President Obama’s unsuccessful attempt to get Congress to pass stricter federal laws – including tighter background checks and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity gun magazines.

In Colorado Springs, the majority of registered voters are Democrats, but many are conservative-leaning. 23 percent of them, in fact, signed the petition to recall Morse, according to The Denver Post.

The National Rifle Association and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg lined up on opposite sides of the recall effort, led by gun-rights advocates upset over the legislation and how the hearings were conducted.

Both state legislators voted for 15-round limits on ammunition magazines and for expanded background checks on private gun sales.

The legislation passed Colorado's Democrat-led legislature without any Republican support and was signed into law by Hickenlooper, who had initially rejected calls for stronger gun control laws.

Morse, a former police chief in suburban Colorado Springs, said Colorado's gun laws were commonsense ideas to reduce fatalities in mass shootings. He was first elected to the Colorado Senate in 2006.

Reported contributions to Morse and Giron totaled about $3 million, dwarfing the reported amount raised by gun activists who petitioned for the recall, though some independent groups didn't have to report spending. Both the NRA and Bloomberg contributed more than $300,000 to the pro- and anti-recall campaigns.

In addition, dozens of elected county sheriffs have sued to block the gun laws.

One of the Morse recall organizers, Timothy Knight, said supporters are upset that lawmakers limited debate on the gun legislation and seemed more inclined to take cues from the White House than their constituents.

""If the people had been listened to, these recalls wouldn't be happening,"" Knight said.

REUTERS/Jeff Christensen

Governor Rick Perry’s office said on Tuesday that he had signed a new law that expands Texans’ existing right to use deadly force to defend themselves “without retreat” in their homes, cars and workplaces.

“The right to defend oneself from an imminent act of harm should not only be clearly defined in Texas law, but is intuitive to human nature,” Perry said on his Web site.

The new law, which takes affect on September 1, extends an exception to a statute that required a person to retreat in the face of a criminal attack. The exception was in the case of an intruder unlawfully entering a person’s home.

The law extends a person’s right to stand their ground beyond the home to vehicles and workplaces, allowing the reasonable use of deadly force, the governor’s office said.

The reasonable use of lethal force will be allowed if an intruder is:

- Committing certain violent crimes, such as murder or sexual assault, or is attempting to commit such crimes

- Unlawfully trying to enter a protected place

- Unlawfully trying to remove a person from a protected place.

The law also provides civil immunity for a person who lawfully slays an intruder or attacker in such situations.

Texas joins several other states including Florida that have or are considering similar laws.

Sympathy for violent offenders and criminals in general runs low in Texas, underscored by its busy death row. The state leads the United States in executions with 388 since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976 by the U.S. Supreme Court.

A conservative political outlook and widespread fondness for hunting also means Texans are a well-armed people capable of defending themselves with deadly force.

It is easy to acquire guns over the counter in Texas and lawful to carry a concealed handgun with a permit."

Struggling to maintain her composure, Francine Wheeler spoke of her 6-year-old son, Ben, who was killed on Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School, as President Obama took the unusual step of letting someone else deliver the White House’s weekly address.“I’ve heard people say that the tidal wave of anguish our country felt on 12/14 has receded — but not for us,” Ms. Wheeler said with her husband, David, by her side. “To us, it feels as if it happened just yesterday. And in the four months since we lost our loved ones, thousands of other Americans have died at the end of a gun. Thousands of other families across the United States are also drowning in our grief.”

“Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy,” she said.

The presence on Capitol Hill last week of the families of those killed in Newtown was considered a crucial element in getting the Senate to vote, 68 to 31, to proceed with debate on gun safety proposals. While the families of the 20 children and 6 educators killed do not all support tighter gun restrictions, those in favor of greater control have proved to be some of the most compelling advocates, successfully pushing for new laws in Connecticut.

Mr. Obama, after delivering his own appeal on gun control on Monday in Hartford, gave families a ride to Washington on Air Force One so they could lobby members of Congress. The president “believes their voices and resolve have been critical to the continued progress we’ve seen in the Senate,” Jay Carney, the press secretary, said of the families on Friday."

http://news.yahoo.com/showdown-gun-control-vote-set-thursday-senate-214409268--politics.html,,[],Showdown gun control vote set Thursday in Senate,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate's top Democrat is setting Congress' first showdown vote for Thursday on President Barack Obama's gun control drive as a small but mounting number of Republicans appear willing to buck a conservative effort to prevent debate from even beginning.

Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada announced his decision Tuesday as the White House, congressional Democrats and relatives of the victims of December's mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., amped up pressure on GOP lawmakers to allow debate and votes on gun control proposals. Twenty first-graders and six educators were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School, turning gun control into a top-tier national issue.

""We have a responsibility to safeguard these little kids,"" Reid said on the Senate floor, pointing to a poster-sized photo of a white picket fence that had slats bearing the names of the Newtown victims. ""And unless we do something more than what's the law today, we have failed.""

""We don't have the guts to stand up and vote yes or no? We want to vote maybe? Tell that to the families in Newtown"" and other communities where there have been mass shootings, said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.

But Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, one of 13 conservative senators who signed a letter promising to try blocking debate, said the Senate bill puts ""burdens on law abiding citizens exercising a constitutional right."" He said none of its provisions ""would have done anything to prevent the horrible tragedy of Sandy Hook.""

Obama was calling senators from both parties Tuesday to push for the gun bill, according to a White House official.

Reid's determination to stage a vote came despite inconclusive talks between Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., aimed at finding compromise on expanding background checks to more gun purchasers.

But Manchin left a meeting in Reid's office late Tuesday and said he hoped a deal could be completed on Wednesday. Such a compromise would be likely to attract bipartisan support because both lawmakers are among their parties' most conservative members.

Story continues

The checks, aimed at keeping firearms from criminals and certain other buyers, are the cornerstone of Obama's gun plan, which has been struggling in Congress. Democrats have been buoyed by polls consistently showing more than 8 in 10 Americans support subjecting more buyers to background checks.

A Senate vote to begin debating the guns package would mark a temporary victory for Obama and his allies.

Some Republicans, though eager to avoid blocking debate, could vote against the measure on final passage. Coupled with resistance by leaders of the GOP-run House to main parts of Obama's effort — including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines — the ultimate outcome seems shaky for Democrats.

Reid said he did not know if he had the 60 votes he will need to defeat the conservatives' roadblock. But at least eight Republicans have said they want to begin debate or have indicated a willingness to consider it: Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Susan Collins of Maine, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Mark Kirk of Illinois.

But some moderate Democrats are remaining noncommittal and might oppose opening the gun debate, including Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska and Mark Pryor of Arkansas, who are seeking re-election next year.

Begich declined to directly state his position and said of Alaskans, ""We like our guns.""

There are 53 Senate Democrats and two independents who lean Democratic.

In a written statement, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said conservatives want to prevent Obama from rushing the legislation through Congress ""because he knows that as Americans begin to find out what is in the bill, they will oppose it.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he will join the conservatives' attempt to block debate.

The bill would expand required federal background checks to nearly all gun transactions, stiffen penalties for illegal firearms trafficking and provide a small boost in school safety aid.

Eleven Sandy Hook family members representing eight of the shooting victims were on Capitol Hill to lobby senators from both parties for gun legislation, including Isakson.

""We bring a face to this tragedy,"" said Mark Barden, who lost his 7-year-old son, Daniel. ""We bring a very personal perspective. People should listen to what we have to say and move the debate forward. It's not just about our tragedy. Lots of kids are killed every day in this nation. We have to help lead the change.""

Some relatives had breakfast with Vice President Joe Biden at his residence in the Naval Observatory. Later, Biden spoke to law enforcement officials at the White House and told reporters that conservatives would not succeed in blocking debate.

""This is not one of these votes that they block a vote and somehow we're going to go away,"" Biden said. ""The American public will not stand for it.""

The president's gun-control proposals have hit opposition from the National Rifle Association, which was using the Internet and emails to urge its members — it claims nearly 5 million — to tell members of Congress of their opposition.

In GOP-heavy Louisiana, where Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is seeking re-election next year, the NRA wrote to its members, ""Please contact Senator Landrieu and encourage her to oppose this anti-freedom legislation.""

Counteracting that has been an effort by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, one of whose leaders is billionaire New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The group was running a television ad in Pennsylvania asking voters to contact Toomey and tell him to back expanded background checks. It also said it will keep track of key gun-related congressional roll calls and make the information available to voters and contributors — a tactic long used by the NRA and other groups.

Manchin has been hoping for a deal with Toomey that would expand the requirement to sales at gun shows and online while exempting other transactions, such as those involving private, face-to-face purchases.

Currently, the checks are required only for sales through licensed gun dealers.

Jan Brewer.

The bill prohibits cities and counties from destroying any guns that come into their possession; instead, the firearms must now be sold to federally licensed dealers.

The law started out as a set of guidelines on how government agencies should handle property that was confiscated, used as evidence, or turned in to law enforcement agencies, with an eye toward generating money for strapped programs. Eventually, the provision preventing local government from destroying such weapons was added.

Brewer’s office did not issue a statement about her approval of House of Representatives Bill 2455, which she signed without fanfare Monday.

Firearms groups, however, pushed heavily for the bill. The National Rifle Assn.’s legislative action arm urged members to support the bill, saying, “firearms that are collected would maintain their value and their sale to the public would help recover public funds when budgets are strained.”

Earlier this year, Tucson held a buyback that collected more than 200 weapons. The police department arranged with the Safeway chain of grocery stores to donate $10,000 worth of gift cards for the buyback.

“It was tremendously successful,” Councilwoman Regina Romero said.

Romero told the Los Angeles Times on Saturday that HB 2455 was “ridiculous,” particularly in light of the rash of mass shootings in the United States over the past few years. Arizona has not been immune: In January 2011, Jared Lee Loughner went on a rampage in a Tucson shopping center, shooting to death six people and wounding 13 others, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.

“I think it’s tremendously hypocritical of the Republicans in the state Legislature to nag and cry about federal control but turn around and micromanage cities,” Romero said.

Gun buybacks have also been held to the east in Phoenix, and the police department there intends to make the best of the three months it has until the new law takes effect. The city will hold three buybacks this month, offering $100 gift cards for every handgun, shotgun and rifle turned in, and $200 for assault rifles. The collected guns will be destroyed.

Los Angeles routinely holds gun buybacks, with the most recent scheduled for Saturday.

http://news.yahoo.com/newtown-residents-upset-nra-robocalls-110326644.html,,[],Newtown residents upset about NRA robocalls,"NEWTOWN, Conn. (AP) — Some residents of the Connecticut community devastated by December's school shooting said they're outraged over robocalls they've received from the National Rifle Association only three months after a gunman killed 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Newtown residents said the automated calls from the NRA began last week and urge people to tell their state legislators to oppose gun control proposals. Some also said they received postcards from the NRA supporting gun owners' rights.

""It's ridiculous and insensitive,"" Newtown resident Dan O'Donnell told Hartford-area NBC affiliate WVIT-TV, one of several media organizations to report about the robocalls. ""I can't believe an organization would be so focused on the rights of gun owners with no consideration for the losses this town suffered.""

A message seeking comment was left Monday at the NRA's headquarters in Fairfax, Va.

Like Congress and other state legislatures, Connecticut's General Assembly has been considering gun control measures in the wake of the school shootings, including banning assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.

The NRA strongly opposes many gun control proposals including an assault weapons ban, saying government officials should better enforce existing gun laws and not impede on people's Second Amendment rights.

Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, has said his organization supports getting the records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent and dangerous into the background check system for gun dealers and beefed up penalties for illegal third-party purchases and gun trafficking.

Shortly after the Newtown shooting, LaPierre also called for armed security guards in schools.

A 20-year-old gunman killed 26 students and educators and himself at Sandy Hook on Dec. 14, after having shot his mother to death at their Newtown home.

Another Newtown resident, Christopher Wenis, told The Huffington Post that he received three of the NRA's robocalls last week.

""I've got a 5-year-old son who went to preschool on the Sandy Hook Elementary School campus,"" Wenis said. ""And this was a really hard week for me on a lot of levels. These calls were the very last thing I needed."""

Gun control. That's what it was called before Newtown. Remember how no one was talking about gun control?

Except for the NRA. They never stopped talking about it. This is from June 2012:

President Barack Obama has shown little interest in peddling a gun control agenda during his first term, but the National Rifle Association is urging its members not to let its guard down ahead of the 2012 election. In a new mailer, forwarded to us by a reader, the gun rights group lists ""Ten Reasons Why Obama is Bad for the Second Amendment."" We’ve been exploring several claims on the list this week -- you can see our findings here... The NRA has taken a fragment of an unclear quote and prescribed the most far-reaching, conspiratorial conclusion. There simply isn't enough evidence for such a sweeping claim. We rate it Pants on Fire.



If Dec. 14, 2012, was, as he said, his most difficult day in the White House, one unspoken aspect of his despair was a sense of deep remorse that, in the service of political survival, in the pursuit of power, in the obsession with avoiding traps, he had given little more than perfunctory attention to the issue of gun control. In word and deed since then, he has shown more passion and resolve. Perhaps the conscience of his late mother kicked in, her idealism finally overtaking his concern that people like her were too naive. Certainly the empathy of a father with young daughters had a transformative effect.

When the president returned from consoling families of teachers and children killed in the Newtown, Conn., massacre — he wept as they handed him photos and told him stories of victim after victim — aides could see in his face the toll of absorbing the nation’s traumas. “This is what I do,” Mr. Obama told them.

Top police commanders from several of the state's cities and towns have thrown their weight behind Newtown police Chief Michael Kehoe, who inserted himself firmly into the gun-control debate last week by calling for a ban on assault weapons.

DAVID GREGORY: You don't think guns should be part of the conversation? WAYNE LAPIERRE: I think that is the one thing that we can do immediately that will immediately make our children safe. DAVID GREGORY: Is it the only thing? WAYNE LAPIERRE: Gun control, you could ban all Dianne Feinstein's, you could do whatever she wants to do with magazines, it's not going to make any kid safer. We've got to get to the real problems, the real causes. And that's what the N.R.A. is trying to do. And I think, I'll tell you this, I have people all over the country calling me saying, ""Wayne, I went to bed safer last night because I have a firearm. Don't let the media try to make this a gun issue.""

For an interesting reminder of how Newtown changed the President's priorities, check out this brief video from Bloomberg on Dec 19th, or this one, same date, with Chuck Todd, entitled Tipping Point: David Maraniss has more:So does Jodi Kantor But it wasn't just the President. All over the country, from local forums to national platforms, everyone has been talking and debating about gun violence and what to do about it. From the Danbury News-Times Because it isn't just the NRA now, the discussion has been much more thoughtful and balanced than this guy The media didn't make it a gun issue. Shooting 20 first graders multiple times each—along with the brave adults who were shot trying to protect them from being massacred—made this a gun issue. Only a gun issue? No, not by any means. But a gun issue nonetheless? Despite LaPierre's tone-deaf response, yes.

And has it mattered? Here's the headline from the Jan 18th NY Times, referring to their own poll:

Massacre Sways Public in Way Others Did Not

The massacre of children at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., appears to be profoundly swaying Americans’ views on guns, galvanizing the broadest support for stricter gun laws in about a decade, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll.

Here's an even broader view, looking specifically at the question (not all polls ask it) of making gun laws more strict:Join us below the fold as we talk more about how Newtown changed the landscape."

pewsocialtrends.org

A group with both the standing and expertise to effect change is trying to make it happen. United Physicians of Newtown, formed in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook killings, wants to turn the gun debate away from the usual contours and focus the discussion on public health. There ought to be some common ground. It's a regular refrain from the no-gun-regulations crowd that since cars cause thousands of deaths maybe we ought to ban cars, not guns. But the issue isn't banning. The issue is that cars and driving are heavily regulated, and as a result are much less harmful than they might otherwise be (for instance, because of seatbelts). The same is true for alcohol and cigarettes, both of which can cause serious harm but neither of which are banned.

United Physicians of Newtown is the group I'm a member of, and have been writing about here and here . The group does not fund raise. But we are into policy

Morgan Whitaker:

“They call me crazy, yet the people doing the finger pointing are doing things that are absolutely bizarre,” Wayne LaPierre said, adding, ”It’s time to take a look at the insanity that’s consumed the media and too many in this town.”

Of course we have learned that majority of the NRA’s 5 million members don’t agree with LaPierre, who argued that no new laws should be pursued to address gun violence, beyond arming teachers. A recent Johns Hopkins University survey shows 75% of self-identified NRA members support universal background check laws, a policy LaPierre opposes. He also claimed that “the vast majority of Americans” favor trained armed police and security officers in every school. Apparently LaPierre’s definition of “vast majority” is a two point margin, because an ABC News/Washington Post poll asked this question in the last week and found only 50% of Americans agreed with LaPierre, compared to 48% who disagreed. Moreover, support for that idea has declined in since the question was asked in January, only a few weeks after the Newtown school shooting. LaPierre wasn’t only confused about how Americans and his own organizations members feel about the issues. He also claimed that gun ownership is at an all-time high in America, despite a report released just this week that shows gun ownership has declined in the last four years.

Shannon Hicks, a reporter and photographer for the weekly Bee of Newtown, Connecticut, was perhaps the first journalist to arrive at the Sandy Hook Elementary School last December 14 to cover what turned out to be the massacre of 20 children and six adults. She took a picture of children leaving the school that showed up the next day on the front page of the New York Times, and a couple of weeks ago she served as the entree into Rachel Aviv's New Yorker story [behind paywall, alas] on the Bee's response to the massacre. In typically understated New Yorker style, Aviv brought her report into focus with the following paragraph:

""After the second class had been evacuated, the education reporter came to retrieve the memory card from Hicks's camera, and Hicks went over to the Sandy Hook Volunteer Fire & Rescue Company, which had just arrived. She bunched up her knee-length skirt and pulled bunker pants over it, and put on boots, a turnout coat, and a helmet. With three other firefighters, she set up a triage area near the school's baseball field, laying out medical bags, collars, backboards, and stretchers."" Reporters don't commonly double as volunteer firefighters. Reporters don't commonly surrender their memory cards and stop reporting the biggest story of their career because of a volunteer obligation. What obligation—as any Chicago reporter would ask you—could possibly exceed serving the people’s right to know? I read Aviv's article because someone in my book club, a retired Chicago homicide detective named Jim Hennigan, sent us all an e-mail recommending it. He explained in a later e-mail that Aviv's story interested him because it was about ""how the practice of that craft [journalism] might complement one's membership in a community or be challenged by it.""

More politics and policy below the fold."

They're hard to aim, they're difficult to use. But shotguns, well, that's a different story.

During a Facebook Town Hall hosted by Parents magazine, Biden took a handful of questions from readers about gun violence. One questioner named Kate asked how gun owners would be able to sufficiently protect themselves if Congress passed a bill banning certain weapons and high-capacity gun magazines.

""Kate, if you want to protect yourself, get a double barreled shotgun,"" Biden responded. ""I promise you, as I told my wife, we live in an area that's wooded and somewhat secluded. I said, Jill, if there's ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony here, walk out, put [up] that double barreled shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house.""

The vice president said that by firing two shotgun blasts, anyone who might be trying to break in would be scared off.

""You don't need an AR-15,"" he said. ""Buy a shotgun! Buy a shotgun!""

Biden fielded a handful of other questions about gun reform proposals. He said he doesn't support making changes to the Second Amendment and described America's ""really healthy gun culture,"" which was a ""part of my father's ethic."" He clarified to another questioner that nobody wants to take away people's guns.

""I have two shotguns at home,"" he said. ""No one is going to come and take my guns.""

Biden appeared to get testy in some moments. When one person suggested that gun reforms would infringe on people's constitutional rights, Biden began his response by muttering, ""How can I say this politely?""

He also described his younger days of shotgun use, which were around the same time he was driving around in his cherished 1967 Corvette.

""Still have it,"" Biden said."

President Barack Obama said Friday that children from communities wracked by poverty and violence need help from the government, schools, family and clergy to have a chance to climb “ladders of opportunity” to reach the middle class and beyond.

Speaking at a Chicago high school near where he used to live, Obama cited gun violence that killed 443 people in the city last year as one reason why children need community wide support to help them believe they can improve their lives through education and hard work.

“In too many neighborhoods today, whether here in Chicago or the farthest reaches of rural America, it can feel like, for a lot of young people, the future only extends to the next street corner or the outskirts of town,” he said, adding “that no matter how much you work or how hard you try, your destiny was determined the moment you were born.”

Making his third campaign-style appearance in three days, Obama again emphasized proposals from Tuesday’s State of the Union address, such as raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour and providing good pre-schooling for every child as necessary to help people better themselves.

The president also called for Congress to vote on a package of gun proposals aimed at decreasing shootings like ones that occur daily on streets and in homes, as well as mass killings in recent months at a school, a movie theater and even a place of worship.

According to the Centers of Disease Control, there were 11,078 homicides by firearm in the United States in 2010, and 7,220 of the victims – 65% – were aged 15-34. In addition, 6,151 – or 56% – were African American, a demographic that comprises about 13% of the total U.S. population.

“This is not just a gun issue,” he continued. “It’s also an issue of the kinds of communities that we’re building, and for that we all share responsibility as citizens to fix it.”

It all starts at home, the president said, calling “strong, stable families” and “loving, supportive parents” the most important ingredients for reducing violence.

Noting he was raised by a single mother, he called for promoting marriage and encouraging fatherhood, saying he wished he had a father around and involved when he was a boy.

“By the way, that’s all kinds of parents,” he added, drawing applause when he specified “it includes gay or straight parents.”

He acknowledged the challenge, saying “it will not be easy, but it can be done.”

“No solution we offer will be perfect,” he said. “But perfection has never been our goal. Our goal has been to try and make whatever difference we can.”

Obama headed to his hometown after a White House ceremony Friday morning to award the Presidential Citizens Medal – the nation’s second-highest civilian honor – to 18 people. They included posthumous honors for six educators killed along with 20 first-graders in December’s Connecticut school massacre.

The president hugged family members of the slain teachers and administrators from Sandy Hook Elementary School in presenting the medals, saying: “We could not be more grateful to your loved ones, who gave everything they had” for the children in their care.

In his remarks later at Chicago’s Hyde Park Academy High School, Obama mentioned Hadiya Pendleton, 15, who was killed by gunfire in the city last month after returning from taking part in inaugural activities in Washington.

Pendleton’s parents were in the crowd Friday, just as they were at the State of the Union as guests of first lady Michelle Obama, who attended Hadiya’s funeral.

The president said his package of gun measures was intended to save young lives and that “they deserve a vote,” repeating the phrase a few times as he did in Tuesday’s address at the Capitol.

Chicago’s record murder rate: Don’t blame guns alone

Fierce opposition by the National Rifle Association makes passage of any significant gun legislation uncertain. In response to Obama’s State of the Union address, the NRA has sought to discredit the motives and impacts of legislation proposed by the president and Democrats.

“They only care about their decades-old gun control agenda — ban every gun they can, tax every gun sold and register every gun owner,” NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre said in a statement on Thursday. “This president has taken the art of public deception and manipulation to a whole new level.”

Obama seeks an updated version of the 1994 assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004, that would prevent the manufacture and sale of some semi-automatic rifles modeled after fully automatic assault weapons.

Obama’s emotional plea might lead to vote on guns

He also proposes limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, expanding background checks to all gun transactions, including sales at gun shows. In addition, the president wants Congress to take steps to better screen people with mental illnesses, so they cannot obtain weapons.

Legislation proposed so far also would crack down on so-called straw purchases, in which a legal buyer purchases weapons for distribution to non-legal buyers.

The NRA and other opponents argue the Democratic proposals are veiled attempts to limit gun ownership and eventually take away weapons, and therefore violate the constitutional right to bear arms.

In particular, opponents contend the proposed ban on semi-automatic rifles focuses on a weapon used in a tiny percentage of killings and other gun violence.

Opinion: Chicago’s violence took my dad, friends

Harold Pollack, co-director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab, confirmed on Friday that so-called assault weapons targeted by the proposed ban account for a small fraction of murders in the United States.

However, Pollack said the ban proposed by Obama can help reduce gun violence, especially what he called the psychologically impactful mass shootings such as the Newtown attack in which a lone gunman used a Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle.

The combination of such weapons with high-capacity magazines “facilitates mass homicides,” Pollack told CNN, noting that professional criminals generally don’t use such rifles that look like military weapons.

“The people who do use these weapons are often the most dangerous or most sociopathic,” Pollack said. The Newtown shooter, a 20-year-old man living with his mother, took her legally owned guns and killed her before going to the school to open fire on students and teachers.

New player in gun control ad wars

To Pollack, such a mass killing – while relatively rare – “traumatizes communities and the entire society in a way that demands attention.”

Studies show that street crime such as shooting deaths cost communities more than lives, Pollack said, citing emergency medical services and criminal investigation as tangible costs along with intangibles such as residents moving away to escape the threat.

Obama also made that point in his remarks on Friday, saying “it’s very hard to develop economically if people don’t feel safe.”

In the aftermath of the Newtown shootings, the NRA called for putting armed guards at every school, rather than seeking to limit the ability of people to obtain weapons. It also wants tougher enforcement of existing gun laws, which Pollack agreed was necessary.

“A lot of the underground gun market could be stopped if we treated guns with the same amount of determination and tools as the drug market,” he said.

For example, Pollack noted how committing a crime with a gun brought additional charges, and he called for similar treatment for illegally possessing a firearm.

How we talk about guns in my Chicago classroom

In a Google Hangout online chat on Thursday, a participant asked Obama how renewing the assault weapons ban would help reduce gun violence caused primarily by handguns.

He responded that his proposed package would affect handgun violence through the expanded background checks and cracking down on straw purchases. Renewing the weapons ban focused on what Obama called “weapons of war.”

“It’s not going to solve every problem,” the president continued, noting that some restrictions are already in place.

“We can’t purchase a grenade launcher from a store, although there may be some folks who want to buy those,” he said. “And the reason is we think on balance, the Second Amendment does not automatically assume that any weapon that’s available you can automatically purchase.”

President says his goal is to keep guns out of the wrong hands

Lobbying Congress to pass meaningful gun control, President Obama sought Monday to build public support through local law enforcement officials -- including police chiefs from cities that saw mass killings in 2012.

""If law enforcement officials who are dealing with this stuff every single day can come to some basic consensus in terms of steps that we need to take, Congress is going to be paying attention to them,"" Obama said.

The president spoke as he and Vice President Biden met at the White House with the police chiefs of Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., and Oak Creek, Wis.

The Dec. 14 shooting in Newtown killed 20 children and six adults at an elementary school, and prompted the new gun push by Obama and Biden.

The administration's proposal calls for a renewed assault weapons ban, universal background checks and restrictions of the sizes of ammunition magazines, as well as new school safety and mental health programs.

Aurora, Colo., is the city where 12 people died in a mass shooting at a movie theater in July; Oak Creek, Wis., is the site of the Sikh temple where six people died during a shooting in August.

Obama's plan also received an endorsement Monday from another group of local officials: The U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, the current conference president, called for ""a national commitment to reduce the culture of violence, stop the easy access to guns by those who should not legally possess them, and increase access to badly needed mental health services.""

Some of the police chiefs who met with Obama were Michael Kehoe of Newtown, Daniel Oates of Aurora and John Edwards of Oak Creek.

The meeting also featured police chiefs and sheriffs from Alabama, Arizona, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Utah.

Gun rights groups such as the National Rifle Association have vowed to block Obama's gun-control proposals, calling them ineffective violations of Second Amendment rights.

Obama said he realizes the gun issue ""elicits a lot of passion,"" but the goal is to keep guns out of the wrong hands.

While Obama has issued executive orders designed to bolster the existing background check system and promote research into the causes of violence, he said that ""the only way that we're going to be able to do everything that needs to be done is with the cooperation of Congress.""

The White House meeting also featured representatives from the Major Cities Chiefs Association and the Major County Sheriffs' Association. Obama said it's important to listen to law enforcement officials at the local level because ""they are where the rubber hits the road.""

Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Janet Napolitano also attended the meeting at the White House."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/13/George-Soros-13-New-Gun-Laws-That-Are-Needed-Now,2013-01-13 00:00:00,['Awr Hawkins'],Soros: 13 New Gun Laws Needed Now,"George Soros’ Center for American Progress (CAP) has published a list of 13 new pieces of legislation they claim we need right now, in the wake of the crime at Sandy Hook Elementary.

As you will see, these proposals–like others from liberals–would not have stopped the shooting from taking place: they would not even have hindered it. But they would make it harder for law abiding citizens to get the guns they need to defend their lives and families.

For example, one of new laws that CAP wants is an end to private gun sales. This would include, of course, an end to those dreaded gun shows.

Question: Did Adam Lanza buy his guns in a private sale? No. He took them illegally and used them illegally.

Another proposal by CAP is for states to turn over more personal information on citizens to the federal gov. so that background checks work better.

Question: Did Adam Lanza foil the background check system to get his weapons? No. As a matter of fact, reports indicate he purposely forewent the background check because he knew he wouldn’t pass it.

Many of the other proposals include things which you probably guessed Soros & Co. would suggest–“assault weapon” ban, “high capacity magazine” ban, start gun registry database, and “treat gun trafficking as a serious crime.”

Seriously–what does a gun registry have to with ending crime?

And it’s funny that we need to treat gun-trafficking “as a serious crime,” when the highest ranking law enforcement official in our nation–AG Eric Holder–sat over a gun trafficking scheme that eventually meant 2,500 firearms were smuggled out of the U.S. and into Mexico. I do not remember Soros calling for Holder’s prosecution over that.

To be fair, Soros & Co. do make one point that’s quasi-sensible. And that’s that federal agencies need to communicate with one another more when one agency has pertinent information on a potential gun buyer (conservatives have said this same thing concerning terrorism and terrorists for years).

They highlight this need by pointing out that Tuscon shooter Jared Loughner was denied entrance into the Army because of drug abuse problems in 2008. They believe this information, had it been shared with other agencies, would have prevented Loughner from passing a background check for the handgun he used in his crime against former Rep. Gabby Giffords.

It must be noted, however, that even this quasi-sensible suggestion is a non-starter if it is a backdoor avenue to a new registry.

Soros & Co. undoubtedly believe guns are the problem. Rational people, on the other hand, know that criminals are the problem.

Incoming president says NRA growth is due to sense of outrage

Organization membership is at a record 5 million

NRA vows to fight any compromise on gun-control legislation

HOUSTON — The board of the National Rifle Association will elect as its president Monday a hard-line culture warrior who has worked for decades to make the NRA a more aggressive political force.

The election of James Porter — ensured after the endorsement of outgoing President David Keene last week — is one of many defiant signals to come out of the NRA's annual meeting in Houston over the weekend. The organization vowed to continue to fight any compromise on gun-control legislation in Congress.

""Revenge is what's motivating the president's unrelenting attacks on gun owners today,"" Porter told the group's meeting Saturday amid news that the NRA's membership had grown to a record 5 million.

""Millions of Americans are becoming first-time gun owners,"" Porter said. ""The media calls it fear. That's not it. It's a sense of natural outrage that's been building for quite some time.""

Porter, 64, a lawyer from Birmingham, Ala., who defends gun manufacturers, has been building that outrage his whole life. His father, Irvine C. Porter, was president of the NRA in 1959 — when the son says the NRA was ""a glorified shooting society."" At a breakfast Friday, Porter told grass-roots organizers that they are on the front line of a ""culture war.""

""He seems to come out of a mold that's much closer to the base than David Keene,"" said Josh Horwitz of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. Whereas Keene was a ""steady hand"" for the NRA amid controversy, Porter is ""a complete wild card,"" Horwitz said. ""The world's changing around them, and they're hunkering down.""

The weekend also featured speeches from politicians such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas — who challenged Vice President Biden to a debate on gun violence — and the NRA's crowd-pleasing executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre.

""We will never surrender our guns. Never,"" LaPierre said. ""The media and the political elites can lie about us and demonize us all they want, but that won't stop us.""

Observers said the tone of the convention wasn't surprising, given the debate over universal background checks in Congress, which the NRA has fought bitterly. ""The rhetoric has been ramped up,"" said Josh Sugarmann of the Violence Policy Center. ""They've doubled down on their absolutism.""

As more than 70,000 people visited the weekend event — primarily for the gun trade exhibits on the floor of the Houston convention center — about 70 protesters held vigil across the street, reading the names of 3,863 victims of gun violence since the shooting in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14. The last name on the list: Carlos Serrano, 48, shot in a robbery while going to work Friday 6 miles from the convention."

The measure, approved by the Ohio House and sent to the Senate, would eliminate the traditional requirement that a person prudently retreat in the face of danger before resorting to deadly force. It would make Ohio the latest of more than a score of other states following the foolhardy lead of Florida — where the first Stand Your Ground law has proved to be rife with risks to public safety and effective law enforcement.

Statehouse opponents pointed to the notorious gunshot slaying of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teenager, in Florida last year as a clear warning of what could be in store for Ohio. But there is a dangerous disconnect between statehouse politicians’ allegiance to the gun lobby and the mortal reality in the most gun-threatened neighborhoods. “We’re talking about human life,” said Representative Alicia Reece, Democrat of Cincinnati. “We have to get it right.”

A recent report in The Times by John Eligon underscored the checkerboard pattern of gun deaths in the nation, where one city’s fatality average can be improving even as its poorest and toughest neighborhoods suffer a spike in gunshot violence. “There’s a sense of hopelessness on behalf of a lot of people,” said a resident who sleeps with a shotgun in a part of North St. Louis where there were 17 murders last year, up from five in 2009, while citywide homicides dropped nearly 60 percent.

This imbalance, which has grave consequences in the most hard-pressed black communities, is rarely acknowledged in the national gun debate. Statehouses too often are working to increase the numbers of armed civilians and their freedoms, as in Ohio, where professional police organizations strongly oppose Stand Your Ground."

The shooting deaths in December of 20 children and six adults in Newtown as well as mass shootings in Colorado and Arizona, spurred Democratic legislators in California to look for ways to tighten the state’s gun laws, which are already some of the toughest in the nation.

“We all can recite the horrific acts that have occurred in our country over the last year,” said Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento). “These bills attempt to respond to those well publicized tragedies and many more that go unpublicized.”

The measures include a requirement that Californians who want to buy ammunition, and the vendors who sell it, would have to submit personal information for a background check to determine whether they have a criminal record, severe mental illness or a restraining order that would disqualify them from owning guns.

The goal of SB 53 is “to ensure that criminals and other dangerous individuals cannot purchase ammunition in the state of California,” said Sen. Kevin De Leon (D-Los Angeles), the bill’s author.

“To purchase a product that has the potential to maim or kill another human being you can (now) walk into a gun store, no questions asked,” he added. “I think that’s a little outrageous.”

Ammunition purchasers would submit their information and a $50 fee to the state Department of Justice which would maintain a list of qualified buyers that would be checked by ammo stores. Purchasers would have to show their driver’s license or other ID at the time they buy bullets.

Sen. Jim Nielsen (R-Gerber) opposed the measure as too broad. “We are criminalizing legal, historic behavior in the state of California and putting onerous burdens and regulations and requirements on law-abiding citizens.”

Sen. Roderick Wright of Inglewood was one of four Democrats to vote against the bill. He said the Constitution guarantees citizens the right to own guns. “Implied in that is the right to buy the ammo to go with it,” Wright said before the 22-14 vote.

The Senate also approved a bill that would outlaw the sale, purchase and manufacture in California of semiautomatic rifles that can accept detachable magazines. SB 374 also would require those who own such weapons to register them with the state.

Other measures approved by the Senate would ban the possession of ammunition magazines capable of holding more than 10 bullets, and regulate mechanisms, called “bullet buttons,” that allow the quick replacement of ammunition magazines on semiautomatic rifles.

All the bills next go to the Assembly for consideration.

As you will see, these proposals–like others from liberals–would not have stopped the shooting from taking place: they would not even have hindered it. But they would make it harder for law abiding citizens to get the guns they need to defend their lives and families.

For example, one of new laws that CAP wants is an end to private gun sales. This would include, of course, an end to those dreaded gun shows.

Question: Did Adam Lanza buy his guns in a private sale? No. He took them illegally and used them illegally.

Another proposal by CAP is for states to turn over more personal information on citizens to the federal gov. so that background checks work better.

Question: Did Adam Lanza foil the background check system to get his weapons? No. As a matter of fact, reports indicate he purposely forewent the background check because he knew he wouldn’t pass it.

Many of the other proposals include things which you probably guessed Soros & Co. would suggest–“assault weapon” ban, “high capacity magazine” ban, start gun registry database, and “treat gun trafficking as a serious crime.”

Seriously–what does a gun registry have to with ending crime?

And it’s funny that we need to treat gun-trafficking “as a serious crime,” when the highest ranking law enforcement official in our nation–AG Eric Holder–sat over a gun trafficking scheme that eventually meant 2,500 firearms were smuggled out of the U.S. and into Mexico. I do not remember Soros calling for Holder’s prosecution over that.

To be fair, Soros & Co. do make one point that’s quasi-sensible. And that’s that federal agencies need to communicate with one another more when one agency has pertinent information on a potential gun buyer (conservatives have said this same thing concerning terrorism and terrorists for years).

They highlight this need by pointing out that Tuscon shooter Jared Loughner was denied entrance into the Army because of drug abuse problems in 2008. They believe this information, had it been shared with other agencies, would have prevented Loughner from passing a background check for the handgun he used in his crime against former Rep. Gabby Giffords.

It must be noted, however, that even this quasi-sensible suggestion is a non-starter if it is a backdoor avenue to a new registry.

Soros & Co. undoubtedly believe guns are the problem. Rational people, on the other hand, know that criminals are the problem. If we create registries, pass bans, and give the government a greater share in our daily lives than they already have, we will soon realize that we ourselves have infringed on the very right our Founders marked as sacrosanct–private gun ownership."

According to the San Jose Mercury News, the gun-control bills, which include proposals to ban a wide range of semi-automatic rifles and strict new regulations on ammunition, could reignite the national debate that erupted after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school last year.

""When we see movement on the California bills and the sort of tenacity that you had post-Newtown, it makes it really hard for the gun lobby to say the momentum has gone away. And it's certainly something Congress pays attention to,"" Kristin Rand, legislative director at the Violence Policy Center in Washington, D.C. , told the paper. ""You can't underestimate how important it is for Congress to see movement in the states, especially big states like California.""

[pullquote]

Gun-rights advocates tell a different story.

""While they may try to reignite their lost momentum, I don't think anything California does is going to affect what Washington does,"" said Larry Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms trade group coincidentally based in Newtown. ""We constantly see a barrage of anti-gun, anti-industry legislation being introduced in California, far more than in any other state.""

On Monday, the state Senate will hear bills that would create a database of all ammo purchases in the state, make it a crime to have a gun that’s not locked up when not being carried, and extends the time someone who makes a violent threat is banned from owning a firearm. The bills reportedly have already been passed by the Assembly.

On Tuesday, the San Jose Mercury News reports, a state Assembly committee will hear bills that would ban all semi-automatic rifles with detachable magazines, make it a crime to leave a gun unlocked when a person is not at home, and require people who own high-capacity magazines to get rid of them. The bills have already been passed by the state Senate, the paper reports.

The Obama spokesman added: ""But to go so far as to make the safety of the president's children the subject of an attack ad is repugnant and cowardly.""

The NRA issued its own statement, saying the ad is about Obama's opposition to more armed guards in school.

""Whoever thinks the ad is about President Obama's daughters are missing the point completely or they're trying to change the subject,"" said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam.

He added: ""This ad is about keeping our children safe. And the president said he was skeptical about the NRA proposal to put policemen in all schools in this country. Yet he and his family are beneficiaries of multiple law enforcement officers surrounding them 24-hours a day. That's the real issue. Anything else is an attempted calculated distraction.""

""Are the president's kids more important than yours?"" the narrator says. ""Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school?

Eight weeks after the massacre of 20 Connecticut first-graders, a ban on the kind of semi-automatic rifle used by the killer remains elusive – if not impossible.

Such a ban became a rallying cry for victims’ families, advocacy groups and politicians supporting tougher gun laws in the emotional aftermath of the Newtown shootings in December.

President Barack Obama still calls for updating a 1994 assault weapons ban that expired 10 years later as part of his package of steps intended to reduce chronic gun violence in America, especially in major cities.

However, fierce opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association and millions of American gun owners has shifted debate away from prohibiting specific weapons to making it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns.

Along with a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, Obama also wants to limit magazine clips to 10 rounds, expand background checks to all gun sales, crack down on gun trafficking, and strengthen efforts to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.

The multi-faceted proposal provided Congress with options on legislation, enhancing chances of passing some provisions, said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, director of social policy and politics at Third Way, a Washington think tank that proposes policy compromises on major issues.

Gun violence plans: What’s in the works

While her group supports a renewed ban on military style weapons, Erickson Hatalsky said “political reality” dictated a different approach.

“Keeping guns out of the wrong hands is not only more politically palatable but also more effective to stop gun violence,” she explained.

That strategy reflects “an understanding of gun crime in the country,” she added.

Opinion polls back up her assertion.

A Quinnipiac University survey released Thursday showed that 92% of respondents support expanding background checks to all gun sales. In households with guns, support was 91%.

However, a majority of households with guns opposed a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, while the full survey showed 56% of respondents backed the provision.

The poll also found that 46% of respondents believe the NRA better reflects their views on guns, compared to 43% for Obama.

Newtown calls on Connecticut to ‘show America the way’ on gun control

Diverse views in America

Obama acknowledged on Thursday that Americans have diverse views on the issue, depending on where they grew up and how they live.

“There are different realities and we have to respect them,” he told House Democrats at their policy retreat, noting rural hunters and urban dwellers come from distinct gun cultures.

At the same time, the president called for action, saying “there are commonsense steps we can take and build a consensus around, and we cannot shy away from taking them.”

Earlier this week, White House spokesman Jay Carney made clear that the goal was progress on reducing gun violence, rather than any specific provision.

Carney called proposals backed by legislators from both parties “the first progress we’ve seen in many, many years dealing with gun violence.” But none of the measures he mentioned – expanded background checks, cracking down on gun trafficking, criminalizing “straw” purchases in which legal buyers obtain weapons for those unable to do so – included a new ban on semi-automatic weapons.

Gun debate: Where is the middle ground?

NRA President Bob Keene said he expected few substantive changes in law because “people are smarter than politicians,” which means “common sense ultimately prevails.”

“They hope that they can use emotion to achieve an anti-firearms agenda that they haven’t been able to achieve in the past,” Keene told a recent Christian Science Monitor breakfast event.

“I am convinced that as these things are discussed, that we’re going to come out about where we have come out in the past,” he added.

His organization keeps a scorecard for each Washington legislator on gun issues, and spends millions on campaign contributions to favored candidates.

In the nearly two months since the Newtown shootings, Obama and the White House have sought to maintain public attention on the issue.

Loaded language poisons gun debate

Vice President Joe Biden will take part in a roundtable discussion on gun violence on Monday in Philadelphia.

Four days later, Obama will award the Presidential Citizens Medal – the nation’s second-highest civiian honor – posthumously to the six educators killed with the 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

In Congress, some influential Democrats join virtually all Republicans in opposing, or at least questioning, a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons like the Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle used in the Newtown shootings.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who gets high marks from the NRA for his opposition to past gun control efforts, has indicated support for expanding background checks but refuses to endorse a new weapons ban.

According to Reid, a bill from the Senate Judiciary Committee was unlikely to include an updated weapons ban, but he would allow a vote on the provision during floor debate.

Weapons like the Bushmaster mimic the appearance and some features of fully automatic military rifles, though they technically do not meet the definition of an assault weapon because they are semi-automatic – meaning each shot requires a trigger pull.

Supporters of a ban say such weapons have no place in the general public because they are designed solely for rapid-fire killing capacity, rather than hunting or sport shooting.

Opinion: Nothing stops a bullet like a job

Right to bear arms

The NRA and other opponents contend that any limit on private gun ownership violates the constitutional right to bear arms. Even partial steps in that direction, such as prohibiting specific models, are considered a path to potential confiscation or other future elimination of Second Amendment rights, they argue.

In recent decades, the NRA has led lobbying efforts that shifted the discussion away from stronger gun controls – such as an outright ban on handguns and a national registration of gun ownership pushed by top Democrats in the 1980s and 90s – to the incremental measures under consideration now.

Erickson Hatalsky of Third Way noted examples of the NRA’s influence in the last significant gun legislation – the Brady Bill of 1993 that required background checks on guns purchased from licensed dealers, followed by the limited assault weapons ban a year later.

While the Brady Bill led to the background check system in use today, the NRA made sure it didn’t apply to private sales, such as those at gun shows, she said.

How the violent mentally ill can buy guns

Obama and other Democrats now want to close what they call a loophole to make background checks a requirement for any gun sale.

The issue gained prominence after the Columbine high school shootings in 1999 in which three guns used by the two underage killers had been purchased by 18-year-old Robyn Anderson at a Colorado gun show to avoid a background check.

Anderson later told a Colorado House of Representatives committee that the gun purchases had been “too easy.”

“I wish it had been more difficult,” she said. “I wouldn’t have helped them buy the guns if I had faced a background check.”

The 1994 weapons ban targeting military style weapons was gone 10 years later, when Congress let it expire in the administration of President George W. Bush – an outcome sought by the NRA.

Keene and other NRA officials argue the ban failed to reduce gun violence because it targeted firearms used in only a fraction of the nation’s gun violence. They also contend the government isn’t properly enforcing the background checks created by Brady Bill, making an expansion illogical.

“We are not willing to support measures we feel unduly burden innocent and law-abiding Americans, and on the other side do not have any real impact on the problem we’re trying to solve,” Keene said.

To Erickson Hatalsky, the goal is to get laws on the books that make it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns – either through private sales or from traffickers through straw purchases.

Minor exceptions would apply to family members giving guns to each other, or people borrowing guns on a hunting ground, she said.

“How are they going to stop somebody who’s a gun trafficker if there’s no federal law against that now,” she wondered.

January’s FBI gun background checks are second-highest

Limits on magazine rounds

A tougher issue involves proposed limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, she said. Larger capacity magazines allow semi-automatic weapons to fire dozens of rounds in seconds.

At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun control last week, Mark Kelly argued that the proposed limit could have prevented the death of a young girl in the Tucson, Arizona, attack that seriously wounded his wife – former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.

According to Kelly, the 13th shot fired killed 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, and the shooter got tackled when trying to reload. With a 10-round limit, Green might still be alive, he said.

Gabby and Mark: The new ‘Bradys’ of gun control

The NRA and its supporters say larger-capacity magazines are popular, with millions already in the possession of American gun owners who want them to feel secure against criminals armed with similar firepower.

They also contend citizens have the right to such weaponry to protect against future government tyranny, which they say was the intent of the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms.

Erickson Hatalsky rejected any inference by the NRA or its supporters that Obama’s proposals or other measures being discussed in Congress amount to taking away people’s guns.

She praised the president’s strategy of presenting a broad package for Congress to consider, saying: “It behooves people who are working on this issue to keep the NRA arguing about lots of different issues, rather than allowing it to concentrate on one and defeat it.”

So the weeklong programming effort titled “After Newtown,” arriving two months after the mass killings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., represents a major effort in high-metabolism reporting and producing for a network accustomed to moving at a more deliberate pace.

And it’s hard to imagine an ambitious package about gun violence anywhere else on television, with the possible exception of premium cable. It would never make it past the talking stage in the advertiser-supported realm, even though several of the broadcast networks have plenty of underperforming prime-time shows they could pre-empt. It’s painfully obvious, but let’s not miss the chance to say it: a lot of television organizations could do something like this, but PBS is just about the only one that would.

That leaves the question of whether the effort — which includes nightly segments on “PBS NewsHour,” which began on Monday, and will encompass episodes of “Frontline” and “Nova” as well as a pair of new documentaries, “Guns in America” and “The Path to Violence” — was worth it. The answer, based on the four centerpiece programs available for review, is a qualified yes."

In the two months since the massacre in Newtown, Conn., there are a lot of people who still can’t shake it — who don’t want to shake it, really. They keep replaying in their minds what it must have been like in Sandy Hook Elementary School that awful December morning when Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six adults at the school before taking his own life. They think about their own children. They wonder how America can stop such senseless, random, murderous spectacles.

Rebecca and Jon Bond are two such people. They have three children, ranging in ages from 4 to 8. (Jon has two older children as well.) They live in a townhouse in Greenwich Village. Previous mass shootings had spurred the usual “when will this stop?” thoughts, but like most of us, they soon moved on. The Bonds knew so little about guns that “I thought a magazine was, you know, a magazine,” says Rebecca, a contributing editor at Architectural Digest.

Newtown changed them. Jon, 55, is a well-known advertising executive (he co-founded the hip firm Kirshenbaum & Bond in 1987); Rebecca, 46, is a branding expert. As they found themselves obsessively thinking and talking about Newtown, they decided to use their considerable talents and contacts to try to do something about it. On Thursday, I went to Minneapolis to get a glimpse of the earliest, tentative fruits of their labors.

Here is Jon and Rebecca’s big idea: They want to create an anti-violence organization — a “brand,” they call it — that will appeal to gun owners and nongun owners alike. “When you talk to gun owners, if your purpose is to make them feel bad, they will push back,” said Jon, “and you will lose them.”"

Newsflash you stupid cocks: AMERICANS DON'T LIKE COWARDS. Oh wait, DOUBLE FUCKING NEWSFLASH: AMERICANS DO NOT WANT TO VOTE FOR YOU IF YOU FUCKING SUCK, which by the way in case you're an idiot and need it spelled out for you, YOU FUCKING SUCK SO FAR. This also applies to you little shits that have talked openly about how background checks won’t change anything IN FRONT OF NEWTOWN FAMILIES. Are you people fucking retarded? That's not a rhetorical question, I LITERALLY want you to email me back telling me if you're mentally slow so I can make sure you don't go to anymore votes. If your constituents openly said ""Yeah we're gonna screw you the next chance we get"", would you be happy? WOULD YOU? No you wouldn't, so WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU DO IT TO THEM?? IN FRONT OF THEM?!! First of all, you SHOULDN'T be voting against 90% of Americans interests, I don't give a FUCK if Wayne LaPierre wants you to, if Ted Nugent wants you to, or if the entire NRA wants you to. YOU DON'T. YOU. DON'T. And you ESPECIALLY do fucking NOT convince other Senators to vote with you.

""But Barry!"", you say in a whiny little bitch voice to your TV screen as you listen to this speech, ""I've been saying I’m appalled by the tragedies, doesn't that count for something?"" NO YOU STUPID FUCKING ASS HATS, IT FUCKING DOESN'T. DO YOU WANNA KNOW FUCKING WHY?!! IT DOESN'T COUNT BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN FUCKING UP ON INTERNATIONAL FUCKING VOTES TOO. I've not only gotten texts about Senators being fucking WEIRD on the UN Arms Trade Treaty (for example, being stupid shits and adding amendments to budget bills saying ""durr we don’t approve treaty…"" is not fucking funny), but I've gotten texts about Senate Democrats voting with the opposing team. The opposing. Fucking. Team. ARE YOU FUCKING STUPID?!! I don't give a SHIT about bipartisanship, YOU VOTE FOR OUR GODDAMN TEAM AND NOT THE OTHER ONE, HAVE YOU NEVER BEEN IN AN ELECTION? ARE YOU FUCKING BLIND? Or are you just so fucking obsessed with making the NRA like you that you think being a good little supporter of the gun community is going to make your voters happy? Well it's time someone told you, NO ONE FUCKING LIKES THAT, ESPECIALLY YOUR FUCKING VOTERS. I will fucking cunt punt the next person I hear about doing something like that, and I don't give a fuck if you IMPEACH me, I WILL FUCKING ASSAULT YOU.

""Ohhh Barry, I'm now crying because your speech has made me oh so so sad"". Well good. If this speech applies to you in any way, meaning if you are a little asswipe that votes against dead children or if you're a weird shit that thinks a gentle breeze can infringe on the second amendment, this following message is for you:

DO NOT RUN FOR REELECTION.

I'm not fucking kidding. Don't run. Seriously, if you have done ANYTHING I've mentioned in this speech and have some rare disease where you're unable to NOT do these things, then you are HORRIBLE, I repeat, HORRIBLE PR FOR THIS COUNTRY. I would rather have 40 Senators that are reasonable, talk to the families of victims, and not fucking cowardly than 80 that are fucking bitches. If you are one of the people that have told me ""Oh nooo boo hoo I can't talk to victims families I have an A rating from the NRA"", then I pity you because I don't know how you got this far in life, and with that in mind don't fucking run for reelection unless you're going to stop being a goddamn cock block for legislation that can save fucking lives. Seriously. I swear to fucking God if I see anyone being a goddamn boner at the next vote, I will tell you to resign even if you're a Democrat. I'm not even kidding. Try me.

And for those of you who are offended at this speech, I would apologize but I really don't give a fuck. Go fuck yourself."

(CNN) —

Was it a debate? A berating? A surreal televised “stunt”? No matter what you call radio host Alex Jones’ appearance on “Piers Morgan Tonight,” one thing is certain: It’s generating a great deal of social media buzz.

On Tuesday morning, Jones was a top-trending topic on Twitter as people read about the interview, watched clips online or shared their thoughts after watching Monday night’s fiery exchange live.

The man behind a petition to deport Morgan back to the UK for expressing his views on gun control went on the attack, calling the CNN host “a hatchet man of the new world order.”

“1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!” Jones yelled. “It doesn’t matter how many lemmings (mindless followers) you get out on the street begging for them to have their guns taken! We will not relinquish them! Do you understand?”

Morgan has pushed for stricter gun control regulations since a gunman killed 27 people before committing suicide last month in Newtown, Connecticut – 26 of them in a mass shooting at an elementary school, including 20 children.

“I’m in favor of a nationwide ban on military-style semiautomatic assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,” he said as he opened his Monday night show, before introducing Jones.

Alex Jones: “The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns”

Watch: ‘Deport Piers Morgan’ host’s rant, Part 1

Jones’ petition, posted on the White House website, accuses Morgan of being “engaged in a hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution by targeting the Second Amendment.” It has more than 100,000 signatures.

Morgan prefaced his confrontation with Jones with a live report on Monday’s testimony in a preliminary hearing for Aurora movie theater shooting suspect James Holmes and a live interview with relatives of two victims who died in a hail of bullets from a military-style rifle in that shooting in July.

“I appreciate you having your First Amendment right. I am glad you are speaking out,” said Dave Hoover, whose nephew died in the movie theater.

The White House also made reference to First Amendment freedoms, in a statement Monday night.

“The White House responds to all petitions that cross the threshold, and we will respond to this one,” spokesman Jay Carney said, referring to petitions on whitehouse.gov that get at least 25,000 signatures. “In the meantime, it’s worth remembering that freedom of expression is a bedrock principle in our democracy.”

’World tyranny’ warning

Jones thanked Morgan for having him on the show, and then said he and others started the petition to point out that “we have all of these foreigners” and globalist forces, including “megabanks that control the planet,” trying to take away American guns.

“When they get our guns, they can have their world tyranny,” he said.

Morgan’s attempt to interject questions ran up against Jones’ heated chatter, leading up to a crescendo with Jones reciting a list of despotic world leaders who he said took away guns: Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Castro, Chavez.

As Jones continued, Morgan looked on, tight-lipped and silent.

After 2½ minutes, Jones rounded off his monologue with a friendly offer to take Morgan out shooting, so he could “become an American” and “join the Republic.”

He also offered to climb into a boxing ring with Morgan. At the end of the interview, he imitated the Briton’s English accent, before declaring him a “Redcoat” who should go back to where he came from.

Morgan asked: “Are you finished?”

Jones said: “Yes.” Then he began a tirade against makers of antidepressant drugs.

Jones said he owns about 50 weapons. His radio show can be heard on 140 radio shows around the country, he said.

Morgan: No better advertisement for gun control

Morgan says Jones’ rant backfired, making Morgan’s point for him.

“I can’t think of a better advertisement for gun control than Alex Jones’ interview last night,” he said Tuesday on CNN’s “Newsroom.” “It was startling, it was terrifying in parts. It was completely deluded. It was based on a premise of making Americans so fearful that they all rush out to buy even more guns.”

“I think silence was the best weapon against him because he just dug himself an ever bigger hole,” Morgan said, adding that Jones “spouts dangerous nonsense.”

Jones, on his website infowars.com, had an image of Morgan dressed as a “Redcoat” next to Jones himself dressed as a “patriot.”

A summary of his plan for Tuesday’s radio show said he would discuss “his effort to defend the Constitution and the Second Amendment from attack by the establishment media as the government prepares its latest gun-grabbing assault on law-abiding Americans.” The description adds that through the interview, “we have put the globalists on notice.”

On the program, he said that 95% of people he has heard from “think that I just told it like it was” and “slammed them hard,” delivering an important message.

“I have been overworked,” Jones added, describing a busy schedule. “But I did the best job I could and I’m proud of the job I did overall.”

Responding to Morgan’s depiction of how the interview went, Jones asked whether that was because he is “a hillbilly that won’t be your slave and knows history.”

He described Morgan as being like “a mannequin, a vampire.”

’Piers Morgan can’t understand being American’

Though many found fault with Jones’ performance, some found common ground with his arguments.

“The tact with which Jones presented himself with was inexcusable. However; looking past that (I know… hard to do especially after that English accent he so offensively portrayed)… I have to say that his statistics were much more compelling than Piers’s. I mean, ok, gun violence is higher here in America… but it has a lower violent crime rate than those countries with banned fire-arms?” PhilipCabibi wrote in the comments section of this article.

“I see where Jones was trying to go, but unfortunately, he presented his facts in such a manner that it will turn most off to them. Which is unfortunate… because no matter how rude someone is, it doesn’t change facts and it doesn’t change history.”

’Meltdown’ or ‘punching out?’

Reactions on social media were blunt.

New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen called the interview a “meltdown” and called Jones “revolting.”

James Poniewozik, TV columnist for Time – which, like CNN, is part of Time Warner – wrote, sarcastically: “Shocking: You reward a lunatic on TV for pulling a stunt,” and he fails to “behave with civility.”

Facebook user Steve Spark made similar comments in a CNN discussion. “If you have a nutjob as a guest, you can’t be surprised when they act like a nutjob,” he wrote, adding, “Some might say it makes for good TV, but I think it’s just embarrassing.”

The Huffington Post summarized the program this way: “Piers Morgan’s pro-gun guest goes absolutely nuts at him.”

Jones retweeted a supportive note from Gerald Celente, who has 36,000 followers. “Bravo,” the tweet said, praising Jones for “punching out CNN Presstitute Piers Morgan.”

CNN iReporter Jason Asselin posted a video saying he believes that Morgan has no right to debate gun control in America, and that only U.S. citizens should do so.

Piers Morgan: Sandy Hook must be a tipping point for change

Jones’ appearance on “Piers Morgan Tonight” was followed by an interview with famed attorney and Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz.

“We lawyers refer to people like that not as witnesses, but as exhibits,” he said of Jones. “He was an exhibit, like a piece of evidence. You see him speaking and you say to yourself, ‘I don’t want that man to have a gun.’”

Dershowitz said Americans who want even-handed gun policy should not leave the arguments up to gun advocates such as the National Rifle Association and Jones without speaking up themselves.

“We have to fulfill what the real meaning of the Second Amendment is: reasonable access to guns for self-protection and for hunting. And there’s no room in America for these semiautomatic, automatic and other kinds of weapons that are simply designed to cause mass havoc,” Dershowitz said.

In addition to the limitations on military-style rifles, Morgan wants gun show loopholes closed and demands that gun dealers be required to run background checks on purchasers at shows.

He also advocates an increase in federal funding for mental health treatment to anyone who needs it.

Morgan recently wrote a column in the Daily Mail saying that for every critic, he has had many Americans thank him for speaking up in favor of gun control.

“If you don’t change your gun laws to at least try to stop this relentless tidal wave of murderous carnage, then you don’t have to worry about deporting me.

“Although I love the country as a second home and one that has treated me incredibly well, I would, as a concerned parent first – and latterly, of a one-year-old daughter who may attend an American elementary school like Sandy Hook in three years’ time – seriously consider deporting myself,” he wrote.

First neighborhood in the country to be trained and equipped

Supporters say gun giveaway is a better way to deter crime

Training%2C guns provided to residents of high-crime neighborhoods

HOUSTON (AP) — Houston resident Cheryl Strain's inexperience with guns was apparent as she struggled to load shells into a 20-gauge shotgun.

Over the piercing blasts of gunfire in the shooting range, Strain's instructor, Dan Blackford, patiently directed her on how to use her thumb to shove a shell all the way inside the barrel and feel it click.

""Now we got a round in the chamber ready to go,"" Blackford said as he positioned her body on the right way to hold the shotgun. ""Look down your sight, put that BB right in the middle of your target and press the trigger.""

Strain's northwest Houston community of Oak Forest is the first neighborhood in the country being trained and equipped by the Armed Citizen Project, a Houston nonprofit that is giving away free shotguns to single women and residents of neighborhoods with high crime rates.

While many cities have tried gun buy-backs and other tactics in the ongoing national debate on gun control, the nonprofit and its supporters say gun giveaways to responsible owners are actually a better way to deter crime. The organization, which plans to offer training classes in Dallas, San Antonio, and Tucson, Arizona, in the next few weeks, is working to expand its giveaways to 15 cities by the end of the year, including Chicago and New York.

But others in Houston, while expressing support for the right to bear arms guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, question whether more guns will result in more gun-related deaths rather than less crime.

Residents of Oak Forest say their neighborhood, made up of older one-story houses and a growing number of new townhomes, has experienced a recent rash of driveway robberies and home burglaries. On a recent Sunday afternoon, a group of 10 residents, including Strain, went through training at Shiloh Shooting, a northwest Houston gun range.

Kyle Coplen, the project's 29-year-old founder said his group expects to train at least 50 Oak Forest residents and put up signs saying the neighborhood is armed.

""When we have a crime wave, we don't just say let's just increase police and that's all we do. We do multiple things. I see this as one aspect of what we can do,"" said Coplen, who graduated from the University of Houston with a master's degree in public administration.

It costs the organization about $300 to arm and train an individual and about $20,000 for an entire neighborhood. All costs are paid through donations, said Coplen, though he declined to say how much his organization has raised so far.

While some residents in the neighborhood are supportive, several officials have mixed feelings about it.

Sandra Keller, Strain's neighbor, said she is participating in part because of the helplessness she felt after her furniture store was robbed a couple of years ago.

""If you don't have a gun, you're just a walking victim. You're just waiting for somebody to take advantage of you and your property,"" said Keller, 64, after practicing at the shooting range.

But Houston City Councilwoman Ellen Cohen, who represents Oak Forest, said, ""I have serious concerns about more guns in homes.""

Cohen said she supports Second Amendment rights and believes that such a responsibility should include proper training and background checks.

David Hemenway, a professor of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health who has written about firearms and health, said studies suggesting gun ownership deters crime have been refuted by many others that say the opposite.

""Mostly what guns seem to do is make situations more lethal because most crime has nothing to do with guns,"" he said. ""When there is a gun in the mix, there is much more likely to be somebody dying or somebody incredibly hurt.""

Proponents of increased gun ownership point to a variety of statistics to support their argument, including ones showing that some cities with strict gun control laws, like Chicago, still have high murder rates.

Blackford, the firearm instructor in the Oak Forest training, said the group is teaching residents not only how to handle and store a weapon but also when to use deadly force.

""The sad part is most people think if you're pro-gun, that you've got this gunslinger attitude, that you are walking around looking for a gun fight to get into and that is so far from the truth,"" said Blackford, a former Secret Service agent.

Harris County Precinct One Constable Alan Rosen, whose deputies patrol Oak Forest, said that while he believes the best deterrent to crime is effective neighborhood watch programs, he believes people should have the right to protect themselves.

""In terms of having a shotgun, after you've been properly trained on it, to have that in your home to protect your home, I'm for it,"" he said.

Strain, 46, a single mother who has never owned a gun, said she was nervous firing the shotgun but that more training will help. She also had her 12-year-old son Rory practice firing the shotgun so ""if God forbid something happens, he could be prepared as well.""

Public speakers are exposed to microphones so often that it would be shocking if the occasional boneheaded remark didn’t slip out. But in the case of National Rifle Assn. Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, the achingly incongruous statements tend not to come from off-the-cuff remarks but carefully vetted prepared statements.

Which leaves us to wonder: How can anybody possibly attract such a large and financially powerful following by uttering statements that defy third-grade logic?

One does not have to dig deep into the LaPierre highlight reel to find footage of him dismissing the real point in order to bring up a complete irrelevancy, or simply ignoring an issue when it is in fact at the heart of the problem he’s discussing. For example, here he is in a speech in Reno on Tuesday dismissing President Obama’s common-sense proposals to limit gun violence:

""[Obama] wants to put every private, personal firearms transaction right under the thumb of the federal government,” LaPierre said. “He wants to keep all of those names in a massive federal registry. There’s only two reasons for a federal list of gun owners: to either tax ‘em or take ‘em. That’s the only reasons.”

Well, no. There are plenty of other reasons to create a list of potential gun owners. Here are two: to create a reliable federal database that prevents convicted felons, the mentally ill and other clearly unsuited people from buying guns, and to trace them in case they are used in crimes. Did LaPierre forget about these two, or were they simply inconvenient to his case?

But the non sequiturs just kept flying. Filling out background check paperwork would mean “forcing family members to fill out forms to leave a family heirloom to a loved one — standing in line and filling out a bunch of bureaucratic paperwork, just so a grandfather can leave a grandson a Christmas gift.” For the record, Obama’s proposal doesn’t require transfers of firearms to family members to go though background checks (although, as California already does, it should).

There was, unfortunately, a lot more, including a rambling defense of “absolutism.” Under LaPierre’s definition, absolutism in support of freedom is a virtue. Presently, this means that supporting every picayune gun law, including those that make it easier for criminals to obtain firearms, is doing the work of the angels, while coming up with common-sense restrictions that wouldn’t affect law-abiding gun owners is a form of extremism. Are people buying this?

In a word, LaPierre’s arguments aren’t just slightly out of touch; they are absurd. If the NRA wants to continue using him as its chief spokesman, it will have only itself to blame."
http://us.cnn.com/2013/02/08/politics/weapons-ban/index.html,2013-02-08 00:00:00,['Tom Cohen'],Gun focus shifts from ban to checks and trafficking,"Story highlights NEW: President Obama will honor the six educators killed in the Newtown shooting Obama includes a partial weapons ban in his package of gun measures The National Rifle Association mounts fierce opposition to any kind of ban A policy expert says political reality shifts the debate from a ban to background checks

Eight weeks after the massacre of 20 Connecticut first-graders, a ban on the kind of semi-automatic rifle used by the killer remains elusive – if not impossible.

Such a ban became a rallying cry for victims’ families, advocacy groups and politicians supporting tougher gun laws in the emotional aftermath of the Newtown shootings in December.

President Barack Obama still calls for updating a 1994 assault weapons ban that expired 10 years later as part of his package of steps intended to reduce chronic gun violence in America, especially in major cities.

However, fierce opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association and millions of American gun owners has shifted debate away from prohibiting specific weapons to making it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns.

Along with a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, Obama also wants to limit magazine clips to 10 rounds, expand background checks to all gun sales, crack down on gun trafficking, and strengthen efforts to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.

The multi-faceted proposal provided Congress with options on legislation, enhancing chances of passing some provisions, said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, director of social policy and politics at Third Way, a Washington think tank that proposes policy compromises on major issues.

Gun violence plans: What’s in the works

While her group supports a renewed ban on military style weapons, Erickson Hatalsky said “political reality” dictated a different approach.

“Keeping guns out of the wrong hands is not only more politically palatable but also more effective to stop gun violence,” she explained.

That strategy reflects “an understanding of gun crime in the country,” she added.

Opinion polls back up her assertion.

A Quinnipiac University survey released Thursday showed that 92% of respondents support expanding background checks to all gun sales. In households with guns, support was 91%.

However, a majority of households with guns opposed a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, while the full survey showed 56% of respondents backed the provision.

The poll also found that 46% of respondents believe the NRA better reflects their views on guns, compared to 43% for Obama.

Newtown calls on Connecticut to ‘show America the way’ on gun control

Diverse views in America

Obama acknowledged on Thursday that Americans have diverse views on the issue, depending on where they grew up and how they live.

“There are different realities and we have to respect them,” he told House Democrats at their policy retreat, noting rural hunters and urban dwellers come from distinct gun cultures.

At the same time, the president called for action, saying “there are commonsense steps we can take and build a consensus around, and we cannot shy away from taking them.”

Earlier this week, White House spokesman Jay Carney made clear that the goal was progress on reducing gun violence, rather than any specific provision.

Carney called proposals backed by legislators from both parties “the first progress we’ve seen in many, many years dealing with gun violence.” But none of the measures he mentioned – expanded background checks, cracking down on gun trafficking, criminalizing “straw” purchases in which legal buyers obtain weapons for those unable to do so – included a new ban on semi-automatic weapons.

Gun debate: Where is the middle ground?

NRA President Bob Keene said he expected few substantive changes in law because “people are smarter than politicians,” which means “common sense ultimately prevails.”

“They hope that they can use emotion to achieve an anti-firearms agenda that they haven’t been able to achieve in the past,” Keene told a recent Christian Science Monitor breakfast event.

“I am convinced that as these things are discussed, that we’re going to come out about where we have come out in the past,” he added.

His organization keeps a scorecard for each Washington legislator on gun issues, and spends millions on campaign contributions to favored candidates.

In the nearly two months since the Newtown shootings, Obama and the White House have sought to maintain public attention on the issue.

Loaded language poisons gun debate

Vice President Joe Biden will take part in a roundtable discussion on gun violence on Monday in Philadelphia.

Four days later, Obama will award the Presidential Citizens Medal – the nation’s second-highest civiian honor – posthumously to the six educators killed with the 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

In Congress, some influential Democrats join virtually all Republicans in opposing, or at least questioning, a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons like the Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle used in the Newtown shootings.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who gets high marks from the NRA for his opposition to past gun control efforts, has indicated support for expanding background checks but refuses to endorse a new weapons ban.

According to Reid, a bill from the Senate Judiciary Committee was unlikely to include an updated weapons ban, but he would allow a vote on the provision during floor debate.

Weapons like the Bushmaster mimic the appearance and some features of fully automatic military rifles, though they technically do not meet the definition of an assault weapon because they are semi-automatic – meaning each shot requires a trigger pull.

Supporters of a ban say such weapons have no place in the general public because they are designed solely for rapid-fire killing capacity, rather than hunting or sport shooting.

Opinion: Nothing stops a bullet like a job

Right to bear arms

The NRA and other opponents contend that any limit on private gun ownership violates the constitutional right to bear arms. Even partial steps in that direction, such as prohibiting specific models, are considered a path to potential confiscation or other future elimination of Second Amendment rights, they argue.

In recent decades, the NRA has led lobbying efforts that shifted the discussion away from stronger gun controls – such as an outright ban on handguns and a national registration of gun ownership pushed by top Democrats in the 1980s and 90s – to the incremental measures under consideration now.

Erickson Hatalsky of Third Way noted examples of the NRA’s influence in the last significant gun legislation – the Brady Bill of 1993 that required background checks on guns purchased from licensed dealers, followed by the limited assault weapons ban a year later.

While the Brady Bill led to the background check system in use today, the NRA made sure it didn’t apply to private sales, such as those at gun shows, she said.

How the violent mentally ill can buy guns

Obama and other Democrats now want to close what they call a loophole to make background checks a requirement for any gun sale.

The issue gained prominence after the Columbine high school shootings in 1999 in which three guns used by the two underage killers had been purchased by 18-year-old Robyn Anderson at a Colorado gun show to avoid a background check.

Anderson later told a Colorado House of Representatives committee that the gun purchases had been “too easy.”

“I wish it had been more difficult,” she said. “I wouldn’t have helped them buy the guns if I had faced a background check.”

The 1994 weapons ban targeting military style weapons was gone 10 years later, when Congress let it expire in the administration of President George W. Bush – an outcome sought by the NRA.

Keene and other NRA officials argue the ban failed to reduce gun violence because it targeted firearms used in only a fraction of the nation’s gun violence. They also contend the government isn’t properly enforcing the background checks created by Brady Bill, making an expansion illogical.

“We are not willing to support measures we feel unduly burden innocent and law-abiding Americans, and on the other side do not have any real impact on the problem we’re trying to solve,” Keene said.

To Erickson Hatalsky, the goal is to get laws on the books that make it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns – either through private sales or from traffickers through straw purchases.

Minor exceptions would apply to family members giving guns to each other, or people borrowing guns on a hunting ground, she said.

“How are they going to stop somebody who’s a gun trafficker if there’s no federal law against that now,” she wondered.

January’s FBI gun background checks are second-highest

Limits on magazine rounds

A tougher issue involves proposed limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, she said. Larger capacity magazines allow semi-automatic weapons to fire dozens of rounds in seconds.

At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun control last week, Mark Kelly argued that the proposed limit could have prevented the death of a young girl in the Tucson, Arizona, attack that seriously wounded his wife – former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.

According to Kelly, the 13th shot fired killed 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, and the shooter got tackled when trying to reload. With a 10-round limit, Green might still be alive, he said.

Gabby and Mark: The new ‘Bradys’ of gun control

The NRA and its supporters say larger-capacity magazines are popular, with millions already in the possession of American gun owners who want them to feel secure against criminals armed with similar firepower.

They also contend citizens have the right to such weaponry to protect against future government tyranny, which they say was the intent of the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms.

Erickson Hatalsky rejected any inference by the NRA or its supporters that Obama’s proposals or other measures being discussed in Congress amount to taking away people’s guns.

She praised the president’s strategy of presenting a broad package for Congress to consider, saying: “It behooves people who are working on this issue to keep the NRA arguing about lots of different issues, rather than allowing it to concentrate on one and defeat it.”

Senate Judiciary Committee considers three gun measures Tuesday%2C including assault weapons ban

Gabrielle Giffords and Mark Kelly are outspoken gun-control advocates

Mark Kelly says he%27ll make other gun purchases and write about those experiences

WASHINGTON — Retired astronaut Mark Kelly, husband of former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, recently purchased an assault weapon to make a point about the ease of background checks for gun owners.

In an interview with CNN on Monday, Kelly said his experience highlights the availability of such weapons. ""It is a pretty easy thing to do,"" he said about buying the military-style firearm.

Kelly announced Friday on his Facebook page that he bought an AR-15, one of the 157 military-style weapons that would be banned under a bill pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The panel is set to consider three gun bills Tuesday, including the proposed assault weapons ban authored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.

He told CNN that he wanted ""firsthand knowledge"" of gun issues. Kelly said he plans to buy a weapon at a gun show and to sell a weapon and will write about those experiences as well.

""Even to buy an assault weapon, the background check only takes a few minutes,"" Kelly said on Facebook. ""Scary to think of people buying guns like these without a background check at a gun show or the Internet. We really need to close the gun show and private seller loophole.""

Kelly, a retired Navy captain, and Giffords are both gun owners who have been outspoken about the need for new gun-control measures. Americans for Responsible Solutions, their super PAC, has been running ads featuring Giffords that tout the proposed assault weapons ban and universal background checks.

Kelly said on his Facebook page and in the TV interview that he plans to give the AR-15 to the Tucson Police Department when he receives the weapon. He said he will keep a .45-caliber handgun he purchased at the same time.

It also voted down other key measures and counterproposals, defeating a string of amendments in a series of procedural votes that likely doomed any major legislation to curb gun violence.

The background check measure -- painstakingly crafted by the bipartisan duo of Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) -- was seen as the key to passing the first legislation in decades to address the sorts of mass slaughters that so recently horrified the country in Newtown, Conn., where 20 children and six educators were gunned down at an elementary school, and in Aurora, Colo., where 12 people were killed in a theater.

The amendment failed 54 to 46, falling short of the 60-vote threshold needed to break a filibuster. That failure upset anew victims of the Sandy Hook shootings and other slaughters who watched from the Senate gallery.

""Shame on you!"" shouted two women in the gallery after the vote. One was Patricia Maisch, who grabbed the third clip from the gunman who opened fired at then-Rep. Gabby Giffords in the Tuscon., Ariz., shooting in 2011. The other was Lori Hass, whose daughter was injured in the Virginia Tech shootings six years and one day ago.

""I think we're going to continue to work for the right thing to be done. I think the senators who voted against this will have to live with that vote, and I think they're going to have to account for themselves,"" said Peter Read, whose daughter, Mary, was among the 33 killed at Virginia Tech.

An angry and disappointed-looking President Barack Obama also hammered the vote in a Rose Garden speech on Wednesday.

""All in all, this is a pretty shameful day for Washington,"" Obama said.

""The American people are trying to figure out -- how can something that has 90 percent support not happen?"" Obama said.

He was echoed by other victims of mass shootings who watched the Senate vote.

""I was extremely disappointed,"" said retired Col. Bill Badger, one of the people who tackled Jared Lee Loughner in Tucson. ""When 90 percent of the people want something, and the senator votes against them, the next election, we're going to take care of those senators, because they're not representing the people.""

Passage of the background check amendment had been seen as key because it represented a bipartisan agreement in a highly polarized debate. It also would have preserved a major part of the overall bill that many advocates against gun violence saw as a minimum step toward stemming gun massacres.

Stronger measures up for a vote also failed, including a ban of assault weapons sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that went down 40 to 60, in spite of an impassioned plea from the senator.

""I know how this is going to end, and the despair and the dismay of the families standing out there whose safety we need to protect, and we don't do it. I am really chagrined,"" said Feinstein, who argued that lawmakers with six-year terms should have the fortitude to take tough votes.

""Show some guts,"" Feinstein said.

The only significant steps that all sides agreed on were stemming illegal trafficking of weapons and improving mental health efforts, but even an amendment written with NRA input to crack down on trafficking failed 58 to 42.

A vote on improving mental health services was delayed until Thursday.

The background check measure would have expanded the current check system to cover sales of weapons on the Internet and at gun shows.

Democratic aides privately conceded that with the failure of background checks, the rest of the bill would likely go down. One described it as a ""pyrrhic victory,"" noting that a majority of the Senate backed the bill that is so popular outside the halls of Congress. ""It's the farthest we've come,"" said the aide, speaking on background to talk freely.

The aides saw little hope of it being resurrected, although leaders kept that option open.

Opponents, citing a National Institute of Justice study, argued that the expanded check system would have laid the groundwork for a national registry of gun owners, although the measure expressly forbid such a step, with a 15-year jail sentence for anyone who tried to do that.

They also called it a useless step that would achieve little.

""Expanded background checks would not have prevented Newtown,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who offered an alternative measure with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) lacking new background checks. That measure also failed, 52 to 48.

But Toomey said his amendment would have at least been a modest step in the right direction.

""The goal was to see if we can find a way to make it a little bit more difficult for people who have no legal right to have a gun for them to obtain it,"" Toomey said. ""That was the goal.""

The Senate failed to meet it.

But even though it's not an election year, the office is in full campaign mode, with volunteers working the phones and reviewing maps in anticipation of a new front of modern campaigning -- the recall phase.

A handful of Democratic state lawmakers in Colorado face recall petition efforts in what looks to be the first wave of fallout over legislative votes to limit gun rights. In an era in which recall efforts are booming, from governor's offices down to town councils and school boards, the Colorado efforts will serve as the first test of gun-rights groups' ability to punish elected officials who expanded gun control laws after last year's Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., shooting massacres.

In Colorado, gun-rights activists wasted no time seeking recalls to oust state Senate President John Morse and three other Democratic lawmakers. The targeted lawmakers weren't necessarily the main advocates for ratcheting back gun rights, but all come from districts with enough Republicans to give opponents hope they can boot out the Democrats and replace them with lawmakers friendlier to guns. Colorado is the only state outside the East Coast to have adopted significant statewide gun controls this year.

""Colorado seems to be the testing ground for some of the gun measures, so this has national implications,"" said Victor Head, a plumber from Pueblo who is organizing a recall attempt against a Democratic senator.

Two of four recall efforts in Colorado already have evaporated from lack of support. But in Colorado Springs, Morse opponents are piling up signatures in gun shops and outside libraries and grocery stores. The National Rifle Association sent a political mailer saying it was coordinating the recall effort with local groups, though the local recall petitioners have denied that. The NRA did not return calls for comment on their involvement in the Colorado Springs effort.

Morse has mounted a campaign to urge voters not to sign petitions. In an indication of the national stakes, that push is largely funded by a $20,000 contribution from a national progressive group called America Votes. The Morse campaign said the donation came through the group's local Colorado office.

The recall group's main funding comes from a $14,000 contribution from a nonprofit run by a local conservative consultant, Laura Carno. She said that contribution was made possible by some out-of-state donors.

""People in other states that are further down this road, like New York and Massachusetts, are calling up and saying `What can we do to help?""' Carno said. ""This isn't what Colorado stands for.""

In an interview, Morse seemed resigned to facing a recall vote after signatures are verified. He believes national gun-rights supporters are using his district to make a national statement about the political peril officials face if they take on gun control.

""That's what's going on here. They want to take out the Senate president,"" Morse said.

The organizer of the Morse recall effort, Anthony Garcia, didn't disagree. Garcia doesn't live in Morse's district but in the northern Colorado town of Brighton. Garcia said Morse was targeted not just because of his votes for gun control but because he's a prominent Democrat from a competitive district.

""It's as much about saying Colorado is angry as it is about getting one guy out,"" Garcia said. ""Legislators need to know when citizens are outraged that they can't ignore the people.""

Immediate accountability seems to be a common thread in recall attempts, said Joshua Spivak, who tracks recall elections nationwide at the Hugh L. Carey Institute for Government Reform at Wagner College in New York. Technology makes it easier to organize, Spivak said, and modern-day voters watching political activity in real time on Twitter and TV aren't content to wait until another election to show their displeasure when they feel ignored.

Spivak said at least 169 officials at all levels of government faced recalls last year, up from 151 the year before. The number this year could go even higher, he said.

Technology isn't the only explanation.

""The other reason,"" Spivak said, ""is that they succeed.""

Most recalls actually fail, as in the case last year of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who survived a recall election after attacking collective bargaining rights for state employees. But compared with re-election campaigns, when incumbents face up to 75 percent likelihood of winning, Spivak said recall elections have a much lower rate of success for incumbents.

In Colorado last year, seven recall efforts made it to ballots, all local races, Spivak said. Of those seven, two officials were ousted and two more resigned.

Nationwide, 108 recalled officials last year lost or left office after a recall. That makes the recall a powerful tool -- and one likely to be used more often, Spivak said.

Back in Colorado Springs, a couple of Morse opponents defended the recall attempt as the best way for citizens to keep their representatives accountable.

""I believe in gun rights. And he didn't listen. He's supposed to represent the people, and when he doesn't do that, what are supposed to do? Nothing?"" asked Bianca McCarl, a 40-year-old merchandiser who is supporting Morse's recall.

Assuming the Morse recall goes to ballots, with an election to be held by late summer, the incumbent holds a slight party registration advantage in the district. He believes most voters liked his gun votes.

He's counting on the support from voters like Joan Muir, a retiree who placed a pro-Morse sticker on her car bumper after seeing other cars carrying messages calling for his ouster. In an interview, Muir said she was dismayed by the recall campaign.

""I live here. I'm for gun control,"" Muri said. ""I don't care for guns, period, so they don't speak for all of us when they say Morse didn't listen to the people."""

White House weighs broad gun-control agenda in wake of Newtown shootings

By Philip Rucker,

The White House is weighing a far broader and more comprehensive approach to curbing the nation’s gun violence than simply reinstating an expired ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition, according to multiple people involved in the administration’s discussions.

A working group led by Vice President Biden is seriously considering measures backed by key law enforcement leaders that would require universal background checks for firearm buyers, track the movement and sale of weapons through a national database, strengthen mental health checks, and stiffen penalties for carrying guns near schools or giving them to minors, the sources said.

To sell such changes, the White House is developing strategies to work around the National Rifle Association that one source said could include rallying support from Wal-Mart and other gun retailers for measures that would benefit their businesses. White House aides have also been in regular contact with advisers to New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I), an outspoken gun-control advocate who could emerge as a powerful surrogate for the Obama administration’s agenda.

The Biden group, formed last month after the massacre at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school that killed 20 children and six adults, plans to submit a package of recommendations to President Obama this month. Once Obama’s proposals are set, he plans to lead a public-relations offensive to generate popular support.

“They are very clearly committed to looking at this issue comprehensively,” said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, who has been involved in the discussions. The proposals under consideration, he added, are “a deeper exploration than just the assault-weapons ban.”

The gun-control push is just one part of an ambitious political agenda that Obama has pledged to pursue after his decisive reelection victory in November, including comprehensive immigration reform, climate-change legislation and long-term deficit reduction. Obama also faces a reshuffling of his Cabinet, and a looming debate over the nation’s debt ceiling that will compete for his time and attention in the coming months.

Seeking expansive mandate

In addition to potential legislative proposals, Biden’s group has expanded its focus to include measures that would not need congressional approval and could be quickly implemented by executive action, according to interest-group leaders who have discussed options with Biden and key Cabinet secretaries. Possibilities include changes to federal mental-health programs and modernization of gun-tracking efforts by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

“Simply coming up with one or two aspects of it really falls short of the magnitude of the gun issue in the country,” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum.

Wexler was among a dozen law enforcement leaders who met with Biden and other administration leaders in the aftermath of the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. The Dec. 20 summit, which stretched an hour beyond an allotted one hour, included Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., Education Secretary Arne Duncan, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.

Biden “wanted to talk to us about the assault-weapons ban, automatic weapons, high-capacity magazines,” said Hennepin County (Minn.) Sheriff Richard Stanek, president of the Major County Sheriffs’ Association.

The vice president said the White House group would consider a variety of proposals — from requiring background checks for all gun buyers to creating a new database that would allow the ATF to track all gun sales, according to participants.

Stanek said the meeting also included significant discussion of mental-health issues, violence in video games and movies, and the poor quality of information contained in databases used to conduct criminal background checks before issuing gun permits.

Some of the options the administration is considering may not ultimately be included in Obama’s package. A White House spokesman said Biden’s group was in the midst of its review and has made no decisions on its final recommendations.

The White House is also developing strategies to navigate the rocky and emotionally fraught terrain of gun politics once final policy decisions are made. The administration is quietly talking with a diverse array of interest groups, including religious leaders, mental-health professionals and hunters, to build as broad a coalition as possible, those involved in the discussions said.

The president is expected to face fierce opposition from the NRA and its allies in Congress, including most Republicans and some Democrats.

But Biden signaled to those involved in the policy discussions that the White House is not afraid of taking on the NRA, the nation’s largest gun rights group. At the Dec. 20 meeting, according to Stanek, when one law enforcement leader suggested focusing on only the most popular proposals, Biden responded: “Look, what I’m asking you for is your candid opinion and ideas about extreme gun violence. Leave the politics to the president. That’s our job with Congress.”

NRA officials declined a request for comment. In response to the shooting in Newtown, Wayne LaPierre, the group’s executive vice president, called for installing armed police officers in every school.

“The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” LaPierre said at a news conference Dec. 21.

One potential strategy would be to win support for specific measures from interest groups that are normally aligned with the NRA, according to one person who works closely with the administration on gun-related issues and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the issue’s sensitivity.

For instance, this person suggested, Wal-Mart and other major gun retailers may have an incentive to support closing a loophole that allows people to bypass background checks if they purchase firearms at gun shows or through other types of private sales. That could result in more people buying guns in retail stores.

Timing is imperative

Obama’s advisers have calculated that the longer they wait, the more distance there is from the Newtown massacre and the greater the risk that the bipartisan political will to tackle gun violence will dissipate.

“This is not something that I will be putting off,” Obama said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” in an interview broadcast last Sunday.

At the White House meeting, Stanek said, “the vice president indicated that there was a very short timeline for him to get back to the president with his recommendations because the American public has a short memory.”

Already, three weeks after the Newtown shooting, gun-control advocates are growing impatient with a legislative process that is just beginning.

“As we get involved in these ad nauseam debates over the Second Amendment, our children are still at risk,” said Jon Adler, national president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. “Debating is not the action verb we need to protect our children.”

With the start of the 113th Congress last week, several lawmakers filed bills to address gun violence. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who co-wrote a 1994 assault-weapons ban that expired in 2004, plans to introduce legislation this month that would ban the sale or manufacture of about 120 firearms, including semiautomatic rifles and military-style handguns, as well as ammunition magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds.

The expired federal assault-weapons ban prohibited the manufacturing of 19 models of semiautomatic guns classified as assault weapons, including certain rifles and shot guns. The law also banned ammunition magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds. But it did not ban the sale of previously manufactured assault weapons or high-capacity magazines.

Since the law’s sunset, efforts in Congress over the past decade to reinstate the ban have faced stiff opposition from the NRA and the firearms industry and have never passed.

Adler, who has submitted recommendations to Biden’s group, said he has told administration officials that they need to pursue multiple measures to increase their chances of success.

“We can’t put all our protection-effort eggs in one basket with one piece of legislation,” he said. “We’ve got to do more than that.”"

(CNN) - It's not the first time this has happened: Students return to school after a few weeks off, and a few things have changed. Maybe the gym floor got a shine, the new physics teacher arrived - or there's an adult with a gun.

As students across the country returned to school this week, some schools implemented new security policies or brought in new personnel. Some are temporary or pilot programs. Others are refreshes of existing plans and training.

In Utah and Texas, some educators trained in shooting or self-defense. Arizona's Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio put a ""posse"" of armed volunteers around school perimeters. The National Rifle Association said all schools should immediately have armed officers, later adding that schools should decide for themselves how to protect children.

It's all in reaction to the December 14 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children and six staffers were killed.

“This is Columbine déjà vu,” said Kenneth Trump, a school security consultant who works with school districts across the country. For weeks he's been hearing from schools that want to review emergency plans, train staff or invest in technology they hope will increase security.

""I’m happy to see these conversations happening now,"" Trump said. ""I’m frustrated you couldn’t pay someone to have those conversations the day before Sandy Hook.""

A lot has changed for Sandy Hook students. They returned to school last week in a different building in a different town. The school was outfitted with familiar rugs and furniture - even the school's pet turtle made the move.

In his State of the State address on Wednesday, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy emotionally rejected the idea of guns in schools, whether teachers carrying weapons or guards outside every classroom.

But Sandy Hook students did return to a school with more cameras, more locks and an obvious police presence nearby.

""I think, right now, it has to be the safest school in America,"" Monroe Police Lt. Keith White said on the students' first day back.

""Right now"" is the timeline security pros struggle with. Trump expects schools to keep calling until budget decisions and new crises draw their attention.

""There’s a buzz at the local level,"" Trump said. ""The question is always going to be sustainability, a dollar cost and time cost. Are you willing to do those things?""

Next week, Schools of Thought will consider five perspectives on how to make schools safer, but for now, here are some security shifts we've heard of across the country.

Starting this fall, all incoming freshman at San Diego State University will undergo ""active shooter"" training, where students learn how to respond, fight back or set up barricades between themselves and a shooter. Other universities have used the training, too.

In Marlboro Township, New Jersey, the mayor shifted police officers to each school for at least 90 days, until they've done a full security assessment. The officers will be paid from the Board of Education's budget.

In San Antonio, the owner of a self-defense and fitness studio began to offer free self-defense classes to anybody who works for a school, CNN affiliate KENS reported.

It's not yet in place, but Arizona's attorney general proposed a plan to arm principals or another designated person. Budgets are too tight for armed school resources officers on most campuses, Attorney General Tom Horne said.

The Utah Shooting Sports Council is stepping up courses that offer free firearms training to teachers.

According to the San Jose Mercury News, the gun-control bills, which include proposals to ban a wide range of semi-automatic rifles and strict new regulations on ammunition, could reignite the national debate that erupted after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school last year.

""When we see movement on the California bills and the sort of tenacity that you had post-Newtown, it makes it really hard for the gun lobby to say the momentum has gone away. And it's certainly something Congress pays attention to,"" Kristin Rand, legislative director at the Violence Policy Center in Washington, D.C. , told the paper. ""You can't underestimate how important it is for Congress to see movement in the states, especially big states like California.""

[pullquote]

Gun-rights advocates tell a different story.

""While they may try to reignite their lost momentum, I don't think anything California does is going to affect what Washington does,"" said Larry Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms trade group coincidentally based in Newtown. ""We constantly see a barrage of anti-gun, anti-industry legislation being introduced in California, far more than in any other state.""

On Monday, the state Senate will hear bills that would create a database of all ammo purchases in the state, make it a crime to have a gun that’s not locked up when not being carried, and extends the time someone who makes a violent threat is banned from owning a firearm. The bills reportedly have already been passed by the Assembly.

On Tuesday, the San Jose Mercury News reports, a state Assembly committee will hear bills that would ban all semi-automatic rifles with detachable magazines, make it a crime to leave a gun unlocked when a person is not at home, and require people who own high-capacity magazines to get rid of them. The bills have already been passed by the state Senate, the paper reports.

In the early hours on Thursday, CT passed a new comprehensive bipartisan gun responsibility law.

Interesting read from AP:

How Conn. Gun Bill Compares to New NY, Colo. Laws Gun control measures proposed in Connecticut after the December massacre in Newtown and expected to win approval Wednesday would be among the strongest such laws in the country. Here is a look at how the proposals compare to laws passed this year in Colorado and New York:

Connecticut legislators are expected to pass sweeping gun-control legislation on Wednesday, becoming the third state since the Dec. 14 shooting in Newtown to do so. But until recently, it wasn’t clear whether any legislation would even come to a vote. Connecticut has several strict gun laws in place — it was one of the few to pass a state assault weapons ban in 1993. But in recent years, the state’s pro-gun groups, using grassroots and legislative pressure, have killed two major pieces of gun-control legislation in a coordinated offensive. They strongly opposed any new laws after Newtown. This time, though, something was different. Local residents in support of gun-control began turning up at hearings that were once largely attended by gun advocates.

Empty threats made by the gun lobby. They were ignored by CT legislators.

NY Times:

But from beginning to end, the victims were never far away. Around 12:40 a.m. Mitch Bolinsky, a freshman Republican who has been elected from Newtown a month before the tragedy, rose to speak. ""On Dec. 14, evil visited my town and everything changed,” he said. He cited the strength he’d seen in Newtown, the compassion shown for the town, the painful journey everyone had been through and read the names of those who died at the school. He said the legislation was not perfect, especially on mental health but said his constituents overwhelming supported the firearms provisions and as a result he would vote in favor of the bill. ""I dedicate my vote to the memory of those whose lives were lost at Sandy Hook Elementary School,” he said.

More politics and policy below the fold, including a new gun responsibility poll from Quinnipiac."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/16/conservatives-confident-on-gun-measures/,2013-03-16 00:00:00,[],Conservatives confident federal gun measures will be scaled back,"Conservatives are all but declaring victory on their defense of gun rights, exuding confidence as calls for aggressive controls in the wake of the Newtown elementary school massacre have given way to scaled-back expectations to firearm restrictions in Congress.

""They can call me crazy and whatever else they want, but NRA's nearly 5 million members and America's 100 million gun owners will not back down — not now, not ever,"" an emboldened Wayne LaPierre, the CEO and executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, told conservatives gathered at an annual conference. He pointedly ignored President Barack Obama's most restrictive proposals in his speech, using it instead to assail the one that has the potential of getting approved — a near-universal background check for gun owners.

It's a sign that LaPierre — and others at the Conservative Political Action Conference — thinks the nation's largest pro-gun lobby has successfully beaten back the most limiting proposals.

Indeed, a bipartisan deal on near-universal background checks for firearms buyers remains a real possibility. And Congress still could pass a ban on high-capacity magazines. But Democrats haven't been able to muster enough support, even within their own ranks, to push through an assault weapons ban.

That's by far the most restrictive of the series of changes Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have sought following the Connecticut school shooting that killed 26 children and educators and a series of deadly shootings in Aurora, Colo., Oak Creek, Wis., and elsewhere.

In the hallways of the Conservative Political Action Conference, many activists echoed LaPierre. Few of them talked with urgency about the outcome of an assault weapons ban or some of the other proposed restrictions. And many exuded a quiet confidence that a divided Congress won't act on even the more modest proposal to implement mandatory background checks.

""I don't think it's going to get done,"" said Randy Smith, a California technology company owner. ""There's no way.""

Mel Wilcox, a medical professor from Birmingham, Ala., who owns guns and hunts, said he ""doesn't really have a problem"" with the mandatory background checks but said he didn't expect Congress to act. ""I don't think they'll ever push something through,"" he said.

Several activists pointed to simple arithmetic to explain their confidence in limited gun measures: Republicans remain adamantly opposed to restrictions to assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and several Senate Democrats are facing re-election next year in rural states populated with many gun owners.

""There are too many Democrats who know they won't last long,"" said William Temple, a tea party member from Brunswick, Ga.

Connor Martin, Marine veteran and a gun owner from Bay City, Wis., said the upcoming re-election campaigns of several Senate Democrats, including Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Max Baucus of Montana, would make it extremely difficult for Democrats to muster enough votes to pass the changes.

It's clear where Republicans in Congress stand on the measures.

Every Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee voted against bills the panel approved this week on background checks and the assault weapons ban. A third measure toughening federal penalties against illegal gun trafficking won committee passage last week with the support of only one Republican — Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the top GOP committee member. The other seven GOP senators opposed it. A fourth bill, slightly increasing federal aid for school safety, passed the committee with bipartisan support.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has said he will decide soon how to bring the measures to the Senate floor, where debate is expected next month.

In his speech, LaPierre called the proposal for mandatory background checks for gun owners a ""placebo"" that would not make schools or streets safer but would lead to a registration of lawful gun owners — lists that he said could be made public in local newspapers.

""In the end, there are only two reasons for government to create that federal registry of gun owners: to tax them or to take them,"" he said.

LaPierre ridiculed Biden's suggestion during a Facebook town last month that women like his wife, Jill, could fire ""two blasts"" from a shotgun if they felt threatened.

""Have they lost their minds over at the White House?"" LaPierre said, noting that Biden has had armed protection in the Senate and as vice president. ""You keep your advice. We'll keep our guns.""

Support for the NRA was omnipresent at the conference. Many participants wore red NRA stickers on their coats with the motto, ""Stand and Fight,"" and an NRA booth in the conference's exhibit hall offered bright-orange bags with pamphlets and bumper stickers carrying the group's message. The sign above the booth underscored the NRA's heft: ""I'm a bitter gun owner and I vote.""

Prominent Republicans have expressed support from the podium.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told attendees that the path forward for the GOP was ""rooted in respect for the Constitution and respect for the individual. Part of that respect is allowing Americans to freely exercise one of their most basic rights, the right to bear arms.""

The White House expressed support Friday that some compromise could be found. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said aboard Air Force One en route to Chicago that nothing proposed by Obama would ""take a firearm away from a law-abiding citizen.""

""There's plenty of common ground for us to seize, to move forward, that would reduce gun violence in our communities,"" Earnest said."

The bill also focuses on high-capacity ammunition magazines.

The National Rifle Associations calls it a misguided attack on constitutional gun rights.

WASHINGTON — Congressional Democrats, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, have reintroduced a bill that would ban assault weapons despite opposition in the Republican-led House and the reluctance of some Senate Democrats.

Feinstein wrote the original assault weapons ban, which became law in 1994 and expired in 2004. Democratic Reps. Carolyn McCarthy of New York and Ed Perlmutter of Colorado will lead the effort to push the bill through the House.

The new bill would do the following:

• Ban the sale, transfer, importation or manufacturing of about 150 named firearms, plus certain rifles,handguns and shotguns fitted for detachable magazines and having at least one military characteristic.

• Strengthen the 1994 ban by moving from a two- to a one-characteristic test to determine what constitutes an assault weapon.

• Ban firearms with ""thumbhole stocks"" and ""bullet buttons.""

• Ban the importation of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines.

• Ban high-capacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.

The legislation would grandfather in weapons legally owned on the day of enactment and exempts more than 2,000 specific weapons ""used for hunting or sporting purposes.""

Feinstein said changes had been made in the new version to reflect lessons learned from the 1994 law and to keep pace with the technology of the weapons being manufactured today.

""One criticism of the '94 law was that it was a two-characteristic test that defined that, and that was too easy to work around,"" Feinstein said, noting that manufacturers would tweak models to remove one of the two characteristics making the gun legal. ""The bill we are introducing today, it will be -- will make it much more difficult to work around by removing a one-characteristic test.""

The National Rifle Association, which opposed the original ban and the attempts to revive in 2004, dismissed the bill as a misdirected effort to limit Second Amendment rights.

""Senator Feinstein has been trying to ban guns from law-abiding citizens for decades,"" said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. ""It's disappointing but not surprising that she is once again focused on curtailing the Constitution instead of prosecuting criminals or fixing our broken mental health system. The American people know gun bans do not work and we are confident Congress will reject Senator Feinstein's wrong-headed approach.""

Bill supporters said they were under no illusions it will be easy to pass the bill, which faces significant opposition in the Republican-controlled House.

""This is going to be hard; this is going to be difficult, but to honor those 20 lives and six more in Newtown, we are going to get it done,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. Twenty children and six adults were killed in a mass shooting with an assault weapon on Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.





Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., became emotional as he recalled standing with parents outside the Newtown school who realized their children were not coming out of the school.

""I came there as a public official but what I saw was through the eyes of a parent and I will never forget the sights and sounds of that day,"" he said.

Police who responded to the shooting said they could not have stopped the massacre because of the assault weapon carried by shooter Adam Lanza, Blumenthal said.

Victims and relatives of other shootings also joined the lawmakers Thursday.

Colin Goddard was shot four times when a mentally ill student killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in April 2007.

""I carry three of those four bullets with me now for the rest of my life,"" he said. ""I'm here on behalf of the 32 Hokies who didn't make it that day, and the 32 Americans, the 32 of us that are murdered by guns every single day.""

White House weighs broad gun-control agenda in wake of Newtown shootings

By Philip Rucker,

The White House is weighing a far broader and more comprehensive approach to curbing the nation’s gun violence than simply reinstating an expired ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition, according to multiple people involved in the administration’s discussions.

A working group led by Vice President Biden is seriously considering measures backed by key law enforcement leaders that would require universal background checks for firearm buyers, track the movement and sale of weapons through a national database, strengthen mental health checks, and stiffen penalties for carrying guns near schools or giving them to minors, the sources said.

To sell such changes, the White House is developing strategies to work around the National Rifle Association that one source said could include rallying support from Wal-Mart and other gun retailers for measures that would benefit their businesses. White House aides have also been in regular contact with advisers to New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I), an outspoken gun-control advocate who could emerge as a powerful surrogate for the Obama administration’s agenda.

The Biden group, formed last month after the massacre at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school that killed 20 children and six adults, plans to submit a package of recommendations to President Obama this month. Once Obama’s proposals are set, he plans to lead a public-relations offensive to generate popular support.

“They are very clearly committed to looking at this issue comprehensively,” said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, who has been involved in the discussions. The proposals under consideration, he added, are “a deeper exploration than just the assault-weapons ban.”

The gun-control push is just one part of an ambitious political agenda that Obama has pledged to pursue after his decisive reelection victory in November, including comprehensive immigration reform, climate-change legislation and long-term deficit reduction. Obama also faces a reshuffling of his Cabinet, and a looming debate over the nation’s debt ceiling that will compete for his time and attention in the coming months.

Seeking expansive mandate

In addition to potential legislative proposals, Biden’s group has expanded its focus to include measures that would not need congressional approval and could be quickly implemented by executive action, according to interest-group leaders who have discussed options with Biden and key Cabinet secretaries. Possibilities include changes to federal mental-health programs and modernization of gun-tracking efforts by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

“Simply coming up with one or two aspects of it really falls short of the magnitude of the gun issue in the country,” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum.

Wexler was among a dozen law enforcement leaders who met with Biden and other administration leaders in the aftermath of the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. The Dec. 20 summit, which stretched an hour beyond an allotted one hour, included Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., Education Secretary Arne Duncan, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.

Biden “wanted to talk to us about the assault-weapons ban, automatic weapons, high-capacity magazines,” said Hennepin County (Minn.) Sheriff Richard Stanek, president of the Major County Sheriffs’ Association.

The vice president said the White House group would consider a variety of proposals — from requiring background checks for all gun buyers to creating a new database that would allow the ATF to track all gun sales, according to participants.

Stanek said the meeting also included significant discussion of mental-health issues, violence in video games and movies, and the poor quality of information contained in databases used to conduct criminal background checks before issuing gun permits.

Some of the options the administration is considering may not ultimately be included in Obama’s package. A White House spokesman said Biden’s group was in the midst of its review and has made no decisions on its final recommendations.

The White House is also developing strategies to navigate the rocky and emotionally fraught terrain of gun politics once final policy decisions are made. The administration is quietly talking with a diverse array of interest groups, including religious leaders, mental-health professionals and hunters, to build as broad a coalition as possible, those involved in the discussions said.

The president is expected to face fierce opposition from the NRA and its allies in Congress, including most Republicans and some Democrats.

But Biden signaled to those involved in the policy discussions that the White House is not afraid of taking on the NRA, the nation’s largest gun rights group. At the Dec. 20 meeting, according to Stanek, when one law enforcement leader suggested focusing on only the most popular proposals, Biden responded: “Look, what I’m asking you for is your candid opinion and ideas about extreme gun violence. Leave the politics to the president. That’s our job with Congress.”

NRA officials declined a request for comment. In response to the shooting in Newtown, Wayne LaPierre, the group’s executive vice president, called for installing armed police officers in every school.

“The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” LaPierre said at a news conference Dec. 21.

One potential strategy would be to win support for specific measures from interest groups that are normally aligned with the NRA, according to one person who works closely with the administration on gun-related issues and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the issue’s sensitivity.

For instance, this person suggested, Wal-Mart and other major gun retailers may have an incentive to support closing a loophole that allows people to bypass background checks if they purchase firearms at gun shows or through other types of private sales. That could result in more people buying guns in retail stores.

Timing is imperative

Obama’s advisers have calculated that the longer they wait, the more distance there is from the Newtown massacre and the greater the risk that the bipartisan political will to tackle gun violence will dissipate.

“This is not something that I will be putting off,” Obama said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” in an interview broadcast last Sunday.

At the White House meeting, Stanek said, “the vice president indicated that there was a very short timeline for him to get back to the president with his recommendations because the American public has a short memory.”

Already, three weeks after the Newtown shooting, gun-control advocates are growing impatient with a legislative process that is just beginning.

“As we get involved in these ad nauseam debates over the Second Amendment, our children are still at risk,” said Jon Adler, national president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. “Debating is not the action verb we need to protect our children.”

With the start of the 113th Congress last week, several lawmakers filed bills to address gun violence. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who co-wrote a 1994 assault-weapons ban that expired in 2004, plans to introduce legislation this month that would ban the sale or manufacture of about 120 firearms, including semiautomatic rifles and military-style handguns, as well as ammunition magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds.

The expired federal assault-weapons ban prohibited the manufacturing of 19 models of semiautomatic guns classified as assault weapons, including certain rifles and shot guns. The law also banned ammunition magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds. But it did not ban the sale of previously manufactured assault weapons or high-capacity magazines.

Since the law’s sunset, efforts in Congress over the past decade to reinstate the ban have faced stiff opposition from the NRA and the firearms industry and have never passed.

Adler, who has submitted recommendations to Biden’s group, said he has told administration officials that they need to pursue multiple measures to increase their chances of success.

“We can’t put all our protection-effort eggs in one basket with one piece of legislation,” he said. “We’ve got to do more than that.”"

And there are a lot. But as interesting as the stories are, they don't do us any good if we don't collect them in some more permanent way. So here's my first attempt at doing so. But to avoid going completely crazy, I'm limiting myself (with a few notable exceptions), to incidents from January 2013 only. Where possible, I've tagged each incident with the date on which the actual shooting took place, according to the linked stories.

Before we even get started, what is this all about? Does it mean you can't or shouldn't have guns? No, not by itself. But what it does mean is that people who start out with the best of intentions sometimes get themselves mixed up in some serious trouble, and often people die because of it. These are the stories you should think about every time you handle a weapon, or are near someone else who's handling one.

And yes, these stories have special relevance now that more and more people are carrying concealed weapons, often with the idea in mind that they're protecting both themselves and the community. It's also relevant to the question of whether or not we should be putting guns in our schools. Whether you're trained or not, experienced or not, or were raised around guns or not, where guns go, accidents follow. That's just statistics. You can do your best to prevent accidents, but everyone thinks they're a responsible gun owner, until something happens. Sometimes because you were kidding yourself. And sometimes although you think you did everything right.

But the mistakes are very often of the kind that cannot be taken back.

Before we begin with January's stories, here's some follow-up news on some prominent cases that actually happened in December:

12/08/12: No charges filed in accidental shooting of 7-year-old boy. On a trip with dad to the gun shop. Shot and killed in his safety seat in dad's truck, when the pistol everyone thought was unloaded inexplicably fired all by itself while sitting on the center console.

12/10/12: This one could've been prevented with a simple, ""Who's there? I have a gun!"" Which would have been answered with, ""Don't shoot, Grandpa! It's me!"" But instead, he shot first. Because he's a fucking ninja. Well, actually, he's the pastor of the local Seventh Day Adventist church. But whatevs.

12/28/12: Involuntary manslaughter charges, though, for the uncle who killed his 12-year-old nephew in a hunting accident. Seems the uncle didn't bother obtaining a hunting license, and skipped the mandatory hunting safety course. Wonder why they have those? Probably tyranny.

Now, new incidents from this month, beginning with the traditional woundings and deaths caused by New Year's celebratory gunfire:

1/01/13: Houston Co. man injured by celebratory New Year's gunshot

1/01/13: 67-year-old Laurie Eileen Eberhardt was sitting on a patio at the St. Pete Yacht Club watching the fireworks when a bullet struck her hand at about 12:08 AM

1/01/13: Police say celebratory gunfire a growing problem in Jacksonville after 8-year-old boy is shot in foot on New Year's Eve

1/01/13: 10-yo girl killed by celebratory gunfire to mark the New Year.

January's hunting accidents. I don't always tweet about these, because as tragic as they are, hunters know they can be shot. So many others of these accidents happen to people who really think things won't happen to them, and that puts them in a different category:

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is calling for a review of the controversial Stand Your Ground laws that were at the heart of the killing of Trayvon Martin.

""I think it would be useful for us to examine some state and local laws to see if it -- if they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case, rather than defuse potential altercations,"" Obama told reporters in a surprise press conference at the White House on Friday.

Florida was the first state in the nation to pass a law that allows an individual who feels threatened to ""stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force."" There are now about 30 states with such statutes.

George Zimmerman was recently found not guilty of second-degree murder in the killing of Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager. Police originally did not arrest Zimmerman for six weeks because of Stand Your Ground.

Although Zimmerman's defense team did not invoke a Stand Your Ground defense, it was still central to the trial and read to the jury as part of its instructions.

""If we're sending a message as a society in our communities that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms, even if there's a way for them to exit from a situation, is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we'd like to see?"" asked Obama on Friday.

""And for those who resist that idea, that we should think about something like these 'Stand Your Ground' laws, I just ask people to consider if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk? And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened? And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws,"" he added.

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) also announced on Friday that his Senate judiciary subcommittee will hold a hearing on such laws in September. It will delve into how these laws and racial profiling mix and the role of the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council in pushing these statutes nationwide. In May, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission voted to launch an investigation into whether Stand Your Ground laws have a racial bias.

A June 2012 study by the Tampa Bay Times found that in Florida, defendants who cited the Stand Your Ground law were more likely to prevail when the victim was black. Seventy-three percent of those who killed a black person walked away with no penalty, compared to 59 percent of those who killed a white victim."

Background checks%2C permit requirements have decreasing homicide rates

States with most laws have lower mortality rates%2C study finds

States with more gun laws have fewer gun-related deaths, according to a new study released Wednesday by Boston Children's Hospital.

The leader investigator behind the research hopes the findings will drive legislators to pass gun reform across the country and increase federal funding to research on gun laws and violence. However, at least one critic argues that the study fails to take into account several important factors such as the types of laws, enforcement of laws, and gun ownership rates in states.

""Our research gives clear evidence that laws have a role in preventing firearms deaths,"" said Eric Fleegler, the study's lead investigator and a pediatric emergency doctor at Boston Children's Hospital. ""Legislators should take that into consideration.""

Fleegler and researchers from Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health studied information from all 50 states between 2007 to 2010, analyzing all firearm-related deaths reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and data on firearm laws compiled by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

States with the most laws had a mortality rate 42% lower than those states with the fewest laws, they found. The strong law states' firearm-related homicide rate was also 40% lower and their firearm-related suicide rate was 37% lower.

Specifically, Fleeger pointed to states with many gun laws like Massachusetts, which had 3.4 gun-related deaths per 100,000 people, and New Jersey, which had 4.9 gun-deaths per 100,000 people. Conversely, he focused on states with less laws like Louisiana, which had 18 deaths per 100,000 individuals and Alaska, which had 17.5 deaths per 100,000 individuals.

The study also found that laws requiring universal background checks and permits to purchase firearms were most clearly associated with decreasing rates of gun-related homicides and suicides.

Despite the findings, researchers did not establish a cause and effect relationship between guns and deaths. Rather, they could only establish an association.

That failure illustrates the limits of the study, said Garen Wintemute, an emergency physician and director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis.

""Policy makers can really draw no conclusion from this study,"" Wintemute said, explaining that the study doesn't provide critical answers to which laws work and why.

The larger problem is that the United States effectively stopped doing research on gun laws and violence 15 years ago and now has no evidence that shows causes and effect, he said.

Wintemute added, however, that he believes gun policies are important and can drive rates of violence down. In the future, researchers must look at how several factors including culture, gun ownership, and gun trafficking between states, he said.

Fleegler and his colleagues became interested in the relationship between gun laws and deaths last summer after the Trayvon Martin case sparked conversations about self-defense laws and the use of guns.

Trayvon, 17, was shot dead in a gated Florida community by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer. Zimmerman, who has plead not guilty to a second-degree murder charge, is claiming self-defense.

""There is very minimal research going on and very minimal funding for the research that is going gone,"" Fleegler said. ""We need to understand these relationships so that we can take action."""

Feinstein warns of an ""uphill road"" to get her proposal passed The NRA says it is ""confident"" Congress won't pass Feinstein's measure The proposals come almost six weeks after the Newtown school massacre

Can there be a solution to America’s gun problems? Anderson Cooper looks at both sides of the debate in “Guns Under Fire: an AC360º Town Hall Special” Thursday at 8 p.m. ET on CNN.

On one side were pegboard panels mounted with various assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons – including a Bushmaster similar to the one used in last month’s Newtown school massacre.

Behind the stage stood police officers supporting a renewed ban on such firepower. One by one, victims of gun violence told their brief stories and expressed support for a new federal ban being proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein on some assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons.

Almost six weeks after the Connecticut shooting rampage that killed 20 first graders, Feinstein said she planned to introduce her measure later Thursday, with Reps. Carolyn McCarthy of New York and Ed Perlmutter of Colorado doing the same in the House.

What’s in Feinstein’s gun bill?

Feinstein’s proposal would upgrade an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 and also outlaw ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.

She said the goal is to “dry up the supply of these weapons over time.”

“These massacres don’t seem to stop,” the California Democrat lamented, listing notorious rampages of past years known by the lone name of their locations – Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Tucson and Oak Creek.

“We should be outraged at how easy it is” for attackers to get hold of the semi-automatic weapons or large-capacity magazines used in those slaughters, Feinstein told the event at the U.S. Capitol that she organized.

Sandy Hook probe to extend until summer

Her legislation is opposed by the nation’s powerful gun lobby, led by the National Rifle Association. That means that despite a push by the White House and Democrats for tougher gun control steps, Feinstein’s full measure is given little chance of winning congressional approval.

In a statement on Thursday, the NRA said that Feinstein “has been trying to ban guns from law-abiding citizens for decades.”

“The American people know gun bans do not work and we are confident Congress will reject Senator Feinstein’s wrong-headed approach,” the organization added.

In a sign of the gun lobby’s influence, a nine-day sports and outdoor show scheduled to take place in Pennsylvania next month was postponed Thursday because the NRA withdrew its support over the decision by organizers to ban the display of “modern sporting rifles” – the kind of semi-automatic weapons targeted by Feinstein’s proposal.

At her Washington event, Feinstein acknowledged that enacting a ban was “really an uphill road,” adding: “If anyone asks if we can win this, the answer is we don’t know, because it’s really uphill.”

She then made a plea for people to call their senators and House members to declare “enough is enough,” adding that a mobilized public is “stronger than the gun lobby.”

Later Thursday, Vice President Joe Biden made a similar appeal in an online discussion on Google, saying: “Make your voices heard.”

He insisted that a reasonable ban on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as strengthening background checks, presented no threat to the constitutional right to bear arms.

“It’s not about keeping bad guns out of the hands of good people,” Biden said. “It’s about keeping all guns out of the hands of bad people.”

President Barack Obama called for renewing the assault weapons ban as part of his package of gun control proposals announced earlier this month in response to the December 14 Newtown school massacre and overall gun violence in America.

Marine to senator: ‘No ma’am,’ I won’t register my guns

Feinstein’s measure would stop the sale, transfer, importation and manufacture of more than 100 specialty firearms and certain semi-automatic rifles, as well as limiting magazines to 10 rounds or less, she said. Not all of the weapons in the bill meet the technical definition of assault weapons.

The restrictions would not apply to guns owned before enactment of any law. Feinstein noted her proposal exempts from the ban more than 2,000 models used for hunting or sporting purposes.

“They are by make and model exempted from the legislation,” she said, adding that the old ban had 375 such exemptions.

Those exemptions were an apparent effort to garner support for the measure from conservative Democrats and others expected to face fierce lobbying by the NRA and constituents.

Supporters of more gun control acknowledge the constitutional right to bear arms, but argue that rifles capable of firing multiple rounds automatically or semi-automatically exceed the reasonable needs of hunters and other gun enthusiasts.

They also contend that high-capacity ammunition magazines provide the capability for mass shootings such as the Newtown massacre.

Opponents contend the Second Amendment forbids the government from this type of limit on weapon ownership by citizens.

They worry that such a weakening of gun rights would signal a shift that would leave citizens defenseless against criminals and, some also argue, against potential future government tyranny or abuse. Instead, the NRA has called for increasing armed guards at schools to protect students.

Speakers at the event organized by Feinstein rejected arguments that anyone beyond the military or law enforcement officers needed such firepower.

“How are you going to hunting with something like that?” asked Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, pointing to the assault weapons displayed to his left. “You kill something, there’s nothing left to eat.”

With new Congress comes a new push for gun laws

Continuing bloodshed on the nation’s streets – with dozens dying every day from gun violence – should be enough evidence to overcome the past inability to get gun control legislation enacted, he argued.

“If the slaughter of 20 babies does not capture and hold your attention, then I give up because I don’t know what else will,” Ramsey continued, thrusting a pointed finger for emphasis.

At Feinstein’s request, people who were injured or lost loved ones to gun violence, including several from the Virginia Tech massacre, then offered their support for her efforts.

Some told of losing a parent or child. Others described how attackers inflicted carnage so quickly.

Pam Simon, a staff member to Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, said she was a few feet away from the congresswoman on the day both were shot outside a Tucson grocery store.

“On that day, 30 bullets were delivered in less than 30 seconds,” Simon said.

NRA chief: Obama makes ‘mockery’ of American freedoms

Some of the weapons on display Thursday are currently against the law in the District of Columbia, and Democratic sources told CNN that Feinstein coordinated with police on being able to have the guns there.

NBC’s David Gregory was recently investigated for holding a banned ammunition magazine on the network’s “Meet the Press” program broadcast from Washington. No charges were brought in that case.

Obama’s proposals include expanding and strengthening background checks on gun buyers to ensure all sales include screening to prevent weapons from going to criminals and the mentally ill.

While the gun lobby has indicated support for some improvements in background checks, it remains opposed to other steps, saying they won’t prevent criminals from getting weapons.

Instead, gun advocates urge tougher enforcement of existing laws and making criminals serve their full sentences.

Biden led a panel assembled by Obama in December to examine gun control steps after the Newtown shootings, which sparked a fierce public debate over how to prevent such mass killings. Biden’s recommendations formed the basis of the package of proposals Obama announced this month.

A recent CNN/Time Magazine/ORC International poll indicated that Americans generally favor stricter gun control, but they don’t believe that stricter gun laws alone would reduce gun violence.

In announcing his gun control package, Obama also signed executive actions that call for tougher enforcement of existing laws and require federal agencies to provide data for background checks.

New York state recently enacted a series of new gun regulations, the nation’s first since the Newtown shootings. Ten other states are reviewing some form of related action.

The issue is among the most politically divisive in the country, as demonstrated by the decision by Reed Exhibitions to postpone the nine-day Eastern Sport and Outdoor Show scheduled to start February 2 in Harrisburg.

On Tuesday, the NRA withdrew its support for the show due to the decision by organizers to ban modern sporting rifles from exhibition.

“We had called on Reed Exhibitions to reconsider their decision; unfortunately they have steadfastly refused to do so,” an NRA statement said. “As a result, the NRA will not be participating in the upcoming show in Harrisburg or in any other shows hosted by Reed Exhibitions that maintain this policy.”

In announcing Thursday that the show was off, a Reed Exhibitions official said the intent of excluding “certain products” was to focus on hunting and fishing traditions of the event.

“It has become very clear to us after speaking with our customers that the event could not be held because the atmosphere of this year’s show would not be conducive to an event that is designed to provide family enjoyment,” said Chet Burchett, the company’s president for the Americas.

“It is unfortunate that in the current emotionally charged atmosphere this celebratory event has become overshadowed by a decision that directly affected a small percentage of more than 1,000 exhibits showcasing products and services for those interested in hunting and fishing,” he added.

Attorney general issues first public comment since verdict

Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges in state court

Justice Department could bring civil rights charges

WASHINGTON — Attorney General Eric Holder called the death of Trayvon Martin ""unnecessary"" Monday and vowed to proceed with a civil rights inquiry after the acquittal of George Zimmerman on murder and manslaughter charges.

In his first public comments since Saturday's jury verdict in the racially charged case, Holder told a convention of the nation's largest black sorority that the federal government is ""determined to meet division and confusion with understanding and compassion – and also with truth.''

""The Justice Department shares your concern. I share your concern,"" Holder told the Delta Sigma Theta delegates to thunderous applause.

A jury in Sanford, Fla., found Zimmerman, 29, not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Trayvon, 17, in February 2012. Zimmerman, a Latino neighborhood watch volunteer, claimed self-defense. Trayvon was black.

The shooting drew nationwide attention, protests and claims of racial profiling — as did the verdict. NAACP leader Benjamin Jealous was among those who called Saturday night for the Justice Department to file civil rights charges against Zimmerman. Holder is scheduled to address the NAACP's national convention Tuesday in Orlando, Fla.

By Monday afternoon, more than 325,000 people have signed an online petition started by the NAACP on MoveOn.org calling on the Justice Department to open a civil rights case against Zimmerman. Sunday, Justice officials said they were reviewing the case.

""This tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised,'' Holder told the sorority delegates. ""We must not – as we have too often in the past – let this opportunity pass.''

The attorney general urged calm in recognition of Martin's parents ""who have lost the most.''

""They suffered a pain that no parent should have to endure – and one that I, as a father, cannot begin to conceive,'' Holder said. ""Even as we embrace their example and hold them in our prayers, we must not forgo this opportunity to better understand one another and to make better this nation we cherish.''

Discussing the federal investigation, opened last year, Holder said authorities will ""continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law.''

""We are committed to standing with the people of Sanford, with the individuals and families affected by this incident, and with our state and local partners in order to alleviate tensions, address community concerns and promote healing. … And we will never stop working to ensure that – in every case, in every circumstance and in every community – justice must be done.''

Delegates said they looked forward to the federal inquiry's conclusions.

""A life was lost,'' said Roxanne Booth, 52, a New York pastor. ""To have an acquittal is to say that life didn't matter. It does matter.''

Lannie Fountain, 79, a delegate from Georgia, said the trial lacked an important voice.

""I felt like nobody spoke for Trayvon Martin.''

http://news.yahoo.com/nra-uses-justice-memo-accuse-134935625.html,,[],NRA uses Justice memo to accuse Obama on guns,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Rifle Association is using a Justice Department memo it obtained to argue in ads that the Obama administration believes its gun control plans won't work unless the government seizes firearms and requires national gun registration — ideas the White House has not proposed and does not support.

The NRA's assertion and its obtaining of the memo in the first place underscore the no-holds-barred battle under way as Washington's fight over gun restrictions heats up.

The memo, under the name of one of the Justice Department's leading crime researchers, critiques the effectiveness of gun control proposals, including some of President Barack Obama's. A Justice Department official called the memo an unfinished review of gun violence research and said it does not represent administration policy.

The memo says requiring background checks for more gun purchases could help, but also could lead to more illicit weapons sales. It says banning assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines produced in the future but exempting those already owned by the public, as Obama has proposed, would have limited impact because people now own so many of those items.

It also says that even total elimination of assault weapons would have little overall effect on gun killings because assault weapons account for a limited proportion of those crimes.

The nine-page document says the success of universal background checks would depend in part on ""requiring gun registration,"" and says gun buybacks would not be effective ""unless massive and coupled with a ban.""

The administration has not proposed gun registration, buybacks or banning all firearms. But gun registration and ownership curbs are hot-button issues for the NRA and other gun-rights groups, which strenuously oppose the ideas.

Whether to require record-keeping for private gun sales is holding up a congressional compromise on legislation to expand background checks, now required only for transactions by federally licensed dealers, according to people familiar with bipartisan Senate talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.

Story continues

Justice Department and White House officials declined to provide much information about the memo or answer questions about it on the record.

The memo has the look of a preliminary document and calls itself ""a cursory summary"" and assessment of gun curb initiatives. The administration has not release it officially.

But the NRA has posted the memo on one of its websites and cites it in advertising aimed at whipping up opposition to Obama's efforts to contain gun violence. The ad says the paper shows that the administration ""believes that a gun ban will not work without mandatory gun confiscation"" and thinks universal background checks ""won't work without requiring national gun registration"" — ideas the president has not proposed or expressed support for.

""Still think President Obama's proposals sound reasonable?"" Chris W. Cox, the NRA's chief Washington lobbyist, says in the ad.

Last month, White House spokesman Jay Carney said none of Obama's proposals ""would take away a gun from a single law-abiding American."" Other administration officials have said their plans would not result in gun seizures or a national gun registry.

A Justice Department official who would only discuss the issue on condition of anonymity said the NRA ad misrepresents Obama's gun proposals and that the administration has never backed a gun registry or gun confiscation.

While the memo's analysis of gun curb proposals presents no new findings, it is unusual for a federal agency document to surface that raises questions about a president's plans during debate on a high-profile issue such as restricting firearms.

Obama wants to ban assault weapons and ammunition magazines exceeding 10 rounds that are produced in the future. He wants universal background checks for nearly all gun purchases. Today, checks are only mandatory on sales by federally licensed gun dealers, not transactions at gun shows or other private sales.

His plan also includes tougher federal laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases, which occur when a person legally buys a firearm but sells it to a criminal or someone else barred from owning a weapon.

Interest in the gun issue has intensified since the December shootings in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 first-graders and six staffers at an elementary school. The Democratic-led Senate Judiciary Committee plans to write legislation addressing some of Obama's proposals in the next week or two.

The NRA's Cox declined to say how his organization obtained the memo.

He said the commercial is running online in 15 states, including many Republican-leaning states where Democrats will defend Senate seats next year, such as Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia. There are also ads in papers in five states.

The memo was written under the name of Greg Ridgeway, acting director of the National Institute of Justice, the Justice Department's research arm. It is dated Jan. 4, nearly two weeks before Obama announced his plan for restricting guns, and Ridgeway's first day as acting chief.

Justice Department officials said Ridgeway was not granting interviews. He came to the institute last July from the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research institution where he studied criminal justice issues, and has a Ph.D. in statistics.

The memo says straw purchases and gun thefts are the largest sources of firearms used in crimes, and that such transactions ""would most likely become larger if background checks at gun shows and private sellers were addressed.""

Gun control supporters said the NRA ad and the Justice memo don't mention that the current federal background check system blocked gun sales to 2.1 million criminals and others barred from owning guns between 1994, when the checks began, and 2010. Also ignored is that Obama has proposed cracking down on straw purchases to prevent a growth in illegal transactions, they said.

Advocates of restricting guns also said the memo omitted mention of several studies that affirm the effectiveness of firearms curbs. These include a 2010 police group analysis showing more than one-third of police departments found increased criminal use of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines since the 2004 expiration of the ban on those items.

""It doesn't appear to be a serious discussion of gun violence prevention policy, never mind an expression of administration policy,"" said Joshua Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.

The memo says that out of 11,000 annual gun homicides, an average of 35 deaths yearly are from mass shootings, defined as those with four or more victims.

""Policies that address the larger firearm homicide issue will have a far greater impact even if they do not address the particular issues of mass shootings,"" it says.

It says there were an estimated 1.5 million assault weapons before the 10-year ban on those firearms began in 1994, so their sheer number would weaken a new ban exempting existing weapons. Such guns accounted for just 2 percent to 8 percent of crimes before the 1994 ban, so eliminating assault weapons ""would not have a large impact on gun homicides,"" the memo said.

Recent data on the assault weapons ban impact is scarce because since the 1990s, Congress has blocked most federal research on the effect that firearms have on public health. As part of the gun restrictions Obama proposed last month, he ordered federal scientific agencies to research gun violence."

Brown OKs funds to confiscate guns from criminals, mentally ill","SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday signed legislation aimed at taking handguns and assault rifles away from 20,000 Californians who acquired them legally but have since been disqualified from ownership because of a criminal conviction or serious mental illness.

The measure, the first of several gun-related bills to reach the governor, allocates $24 million in surplus funds to hire dozens of additional special agents to tackle a backlog of 40,000 weapons in the hands of people not allowed to possess firearms.

“This bipartisan bill makes our communities safer by giving law enforcement the resources they need to get guns out of the hands of potentially dangerous individuals,” said Evan Westrup, a spokesman for the governor.

The state operates a database that cross-references a list of gun owners with those disqualified later from owning guns. But, budget cuts have prevented the state Department of Justice from keeping up with the growing number of people on the list.

State Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) introduced SB 140, which takes the money from fees paid when people buy guns and allocates it to a three-year campaign to take guns from those ineligible to have them.

“We know for the safety of our communities that these people should not possess guns, and our reinvestment in this tracking program gives us the opportunity to confiscate them,” Leno said in a statement.

The measure was opposed by Sam Paredes, executive director of Gun Owners of California, who said it should be paid for by the state general fund.

“Going after criminals is a good thing, but the way they are paying for it is grossly unfair,” Paredes said. “They are putting the entire burden on the back of law-abiding gun purchasers.”

The measure, supported by state Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, is one of more than a dozen gun-control bills introduced in the California Legislature following the massacre of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

“California is leading the nation in a common-sense effort to protect public safety by taking guns away from dangerous, violent individuals who are prohibited by law from owning them,” Harris said.

The bombers, he said, were “small, stunted individuals who would destroy instead of build, and think that somehow makes them important.”

For President Bill Clinton, the Oklahoma City bombing in April 1995 helped him reclaim the mantle of leadership after a dispiriting period in which the Democrats were trounced in midterm elections and Mr. Clinton had seemed almost marginalized by House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

The Boston bombings could allow Mr. Obama to achieve a different goal: moving the country’s response to acts of terrorism away from the sense of national crisis that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to a narrower focus on effective law enforcement.

“Boston is not big enough to change the narrative about President Obama,” Mr. Feaver said, “but it might be big enough to change the public’s response to terrorism.”

With the loss of the gun vote, by contrast, the president does not have a clear path forward. The Senate’s rejection of even a watered-down system of background checks, experts say, all but extinguishes the chances to pass new legislation, and from here on, any significant action on gun-safety laws will be at the state level.

For Mr. Obama, the loss is especially stinging because it came after the national revulsion at the schoolhouse slaughter in Newtown raised hopes for a once-in-a-generation change. Devastated personally, the president pledged at a memorial service to use “whatever power this office holds” to turn the tide on gun regulations.

As they debated what Mr. Obama should do, administration officials said they were well aware that it would be an uphill struggle. But they believed that it was better to try and lose, than to appear cynical."

""It's difficult to get laws changed when politicians are bought out, but we have to start somewhere…I want to ensure that they (children) are safer, not just my children but all across the United States.""

And, this quote brings us (back) full-circle to Mike McIntire’s stunning feature story in Sunday’s NY Times.

As you’ll learn in the article--god forbid, if anyone was ever going to walk into an elementary school classroom with an assault weapon again—if the Newtown, CT-based National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) has their way, eight-year-olds throughout America will be fully proficient with firearms, up to and including semi-automatic assault weapons; and, they’ll have the knowledge and skills necessary to take the shooter out!

I mean, “seriously!” Why waste taxpayer money on training educators how to handle guns, when you may accomplish the same end result by encouraging the parents of students in the second grade to pay for their kids to learn how to handle AR-15s and semi-automatic pistols, instead?

Apparently, as we learn in today’s NYT, this is the logic behind the NSSF’s “First Shots” program. And then, as it’s explained in Mike McIntire’s piece, you’ll learn more about folks like, “Larry Potterfield, the founder of MidwayUSA, one of the nation’s largest sellers of shooting supplies… who said his own children started shooting ‘boys’ rifles’ at age 4, getting young people engaged with firearms — provided they have the maturity and the physical ability to handle them — strengthens an endangered American tradition.”

You’ll also read about “Junior Shooters, an industry-supported magazine that seeks to get children involved in the recreational use of firearms, once featured a smiling 15-year-old girl clutching a semiautomatic rifle. At the end of an accompanying article that extolled target shooting with a Bushmaster AR-15 — an advertisement elsewhere in the magazine directed readers to a coupon for buying one — the author encouraged youngsters to share the article with a parent.”



“Who knows?” it said. “Maybe you’ll find a Bushmaster AR-15 under your tree some frosty Christmas morning!”

… acknowledged in an editorial that some of his magazine’s content stirred controversy. “I have heard people say, even shooters that participate in some of the shotgun shooting sports, such things as, ‘Why do you need a semiautomatic gun for hunting?’ ” he wrote. But if the industry is to survive, he said, gun enthusiasts must embrace all youth shooting activities, including ones “using semiautomatic firearms with magazines holding 30-100 rounds.” In an interview, Mr. Fink elaborated. Semiautomatic firearms are actually not weapons, he said, unless someone chooses to hurt another person with them, and their image has been unfairly tainted by the news media. There is no legitimate reason children should not learn to safely use an AR-15 for recreation, he said.

And, then there’s this gem from Junior Shooters’ editor Andy Fink, who…

State bill would ban magazines that hold 15+ rounds

Wyo.%2C Texas have expressed interest in Magpul%27s business

State Democrats would allow Magpul to sell large magazines out of state

ERIE, Colo. (AP) — Unnoticed amid dozens of tract homes in the Denver suburbs, a nondescript industrial building is suddenly in the middle of the gun-control debate in Colorado.

Magpul, started in an ex-Marine's basement in 1999, is in a standoff with Colorado Democrats who want to restrict the size of ammunition magazines after mass shootings in a suburban Denver movie theater and a Connecticut elementary school. The company has issued lawmakers an ultimatum potentially worth millions: Pass the bill, and the business will move.

It's a bold threat from a company that, by its founder's admission, has distanced itself from politics.

""The people who wrote the bill didn't even know we existed in the state,"" said Richard Fitzpatrick, the founder and president of the company that produces magazines and other firearm accessories for gun enthusiasts, law enforcement and the military.

The warning from Erie-based Magpul underscores the political pressures Democrats are weighing as they advance the strictest gun-control measures lawmakers have ever considered in a state that still prides its frontier spirit. Other gun-control proposals include universal background checks, a ban on concealed firearms on campuses, and holding assault-weapon sellers and owners liable for shootings.

Opponents need only three Democrats in the Senate to vote no against the magazine proposal to defeat it, and two have already said they won't support the bill. But most Democrats are not budging.

""When you have the means available to you at every single corner to commit a horrendous act, we will continue to see what we've seen, which is the status quo, where unfortunately gun violence and violence in general is prevalent in our communities,"" said Democratic Sen. Jessie Ulibarri, who will be considering the magazine bill on Monday in the Judiciary Committee. The bill has already passed the House, and Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper has promised to sign it.

The bill would make it a crime to have magazines that can carry more than 15 rounds, with a stricter limit of eight for shotguns. People who own larger magazines now would be allowed to keep them.

As the debate unfolds, states have made overtures to Magpul, including offering to pay their moving costs. The company won't name the states, but Wyoming and Texas have expressed interest in netting the $85 million the company projects it will spend in Colorado next year in payments to suppliers, subcontractors and service providers. Magpul said the move would also impact its 200 employees, plus an additional 400 who work for suppliers and subcontractors.

""It's not so much, 'Oh, these people are making something that's going to cost Colorado lives.' We truly believe this bill will do nothing. It's a feel-good measure,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""But these (workers) will be directly affected.""

Fitzpatrick said the bill's requirement that all magazines have serial numbers adds enough production costs to make it worth leaving. He also said smaller magazines can be easily connected to each other — magazines can be hooked up to make a 60-round magazine, for example — and the company fears it would legally liable if people were to do that.

Democrats have tried to ease Magpul's fears, amending the bill to make clear that the company can still manufacture magazines of any size, as long as they're sold only out-of-state, to the military or law enforcement.

Republicans who oppose the restrictions argue Democrats are sending mixed messages about gun control to keep a company in Colorado.

""It's being hypocritical. These things are either bad or they're not,"" said Republican Rep. Brian DelGrosso.

Magpul argues that limiting magazine sizes will not reduce gun violence, and that criminals will find ways around laws, including going to other states to buy larger magazines. Magpul officials note that some of their products sometimes end up in California, which limits magazine sizes to 10 rounds.

""The solutions that people want to bring up are hardware solutions,"" said Magpul Director Duane Liptak. ""And they want to talk about this physical piece of equipment that's not inherently evil. It's not inherently good. It's a tool like anything else. It can be used for good, and it can be used improperly by people who have evil in their hearts.""

Supporters of the proposals say Magpul is bluffing and that a move would prove too costly.

""I don't think Magpul is about to pull out,"" said Bill Hoover, 83, whose grandson AJ Boik was among the 12 killed in the theater shooting. ""It's going to cost them a bundle of money.""

Fitzpatrick said his company is serious.

""It's not really a threat. It's a promise,"" he said.

Sens. Lois Tochtrop and Cheri Jahn are the two Democrats voting against the bill. Both say they don't believe it addresses the main problem — mental health — and Tochtrop also cited Magpul's potential departure.

""I think we really need to address that problem. Look at the cause, not the tool,"" Tochtrop said."

Vice president says he's considering several recommendations from stakeholders

Universal background checks and limiting high-capacity magazines considered

Biden says he wants to also meet with gun manufacturers

WASHINGTON — The National Rifle Association took aim Thursday at the White House task force on gun violence led by Vice President Biden, suggesting that the Obama administration is focused on imposing unnecessary restrictions on lawful gun owners in the aftermath of last month's shooting tragedy in Connecticut.

The powerful gun rights organization's sharp rebuke followed a meeting with Biden and gun-owners groups to discuss the White House's response to recent mass shootings. The vice president and other top administration officials have been meeting with various stakeholders in the gun debate in an effort to generate a broad proposal on steps to curb gun violence.

""We were disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the Second Amendment,"" the NRA said in a statement following the 95-minute meeting on White House grounds. ""While claiming that no policy proposals would be 'prejudged,' this task force spent most of its time on proposed restrictions on lawful firearms owners — honest, taxpaying, hardworking Americans.""

Biden, who was tapped to lead the task force after the Dec. 14 mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school, said he plans to deliver his recommendations to President Obama by Tuesday, and suggested Thursday that his proposal may include instituting universal background checks and limiting the size of high-capacity magazines.

Biden said that his proposal might also bolster the ability of the federal government to research gun violence, suggesting he may look for a way to relax rules that prohibit the release of information from the ATF firearms-trace database to anyone other than a law enforcement agency or prosecutor in connection with a criminal investigation

""There is a surprising, so far, recurrence of suggestions that we have universal background checks,"" Biden said. He added, ""Among ... my former colleagues in the Senate, who have been pretty universally opposed to any restrictions on gun ownership or what type of weapons can be purchased, etc., I have never quite heard as much talk about the need to do something about high-capacity magazines as I have heard spontaneously from every group I have met with so far.""

The vice president, notably, did not mention re-instituting the assault-weapons ban which expired in 2004, a move backed by several Democratic lawmakers and Obama. A USA TODAY/Gallup Poll published last month following the Connecticut shooting found 51% of respondents oppose an assault weapons ban, while 44% support reinstating the ban.

Biden, along with Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, were also meeting with entertainment industry executives Thursday, and a separately with some of the nation's top gun sellers, including the megaretailer Wal-Mart, to discuss the issue.

Biden has said that he may recommend Obama use presidential ""executive order"" power as part of the effort to stem gun violence. Gun-control advocates said that the president could take several steps without congressional action, including bolstering the national instant criminal-background-check system and stepping up prosecutions of felons and others prohibited from buying weapons when they try to purchase them.

Biden is also hoping to solicit the input of gun manufacturers before making his recommendations.

""There has got to be some common ground, to not solve every problem but diminish the probability"" of mass shootings, he said. ""That's what this is all about. There are no conclusions I have reached.""

The NRA had set low expectations for the meeting, but the sharpness of its rebuke was notable.

""We will now take our commitment and meaningful contributions to members of Congress of both parties who are interested in having an honest conversation about what works — and what does not,"" the group said.

The NRA instead is pushing for the federal government to implement a program to put armed guards in every school in the country.

The Advancement Project, a Washington, D.C.-based civil rights group, has long complained that cops in schools actually make safety worse for many kids, making it more likely that they'll end up in trouble with the law.

The proposed ban on “high capacity” magazines and the call for universal background checks are both reflective of similar measures being pushed by Democrats around the country.

As I have made clear in earlier posts, if universal background checks are implemented, they will not only stop private sales and close the “gun show loophole,” but will also take away a grandfather’s ability to simply give his favorite rifle to his grandson or for a mother to give a handgun to her daughter for self-defense.

In both scenarios, the guns will have to be registered, the government will have to be notified, specified fees will have to be paid, and background checks will have to be performed.

The measure to add a fee to existing background checks for gun purchases is nothing less than a new state-level tax on gun purchases. If this law passes, the fee could eventually be raised high enough to rule out buying a gun in the first place.

The proposal to allow crime victims to sue gun manufacturers is very onerous for gun companies. Although it would ostensibly only apply to makers of “assault weapons” if implemented, Colorado state Sen. Greg Brophy (R) said it “is the equivalent of holding Coors, the distributor, and the 7-Eleven from which the 12-pack of beer was stolen responsible for the drunk-driving accident.”

Even if the law allowing Coloradans to sue gun manufacturers passes, it will be impossible to implement currently because a federal law bans lawsuits against gun manufacturers over the misuse of their products.

The state’s Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, has yet to show his hand regarding where he stands on all these proposals. One thing that is known is that 56% of Coloradans say the NRA best represents their views on guns and gun rights."

Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school?

I swear to you, if I didn't know any better, and I'm not a big conspiracy guy, after seeing that ad, I would think the NRA is either an elaborate avant-garde Joaquin Phoenix-style joke, or a false flag operation run by Michael Moore in an attempt to discredit responsible gun owners.

But anyway, your response, Mr. President.



BARACK OBAMA (1/16/2013): I believe the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms. ... I also believe most gun owners agree that we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible law-breaking few from inflicting harm on a massive scale.

But anyhow, at that conference today at the White House, the President unveiled legislative proposals and 23 executive actions to begin to address gun violence, including recommendations to limit magazine size, restrict assault weapons — that's going to happen through Congress if it happens at all — expand background checks, and oddly enough, also provide money for increased school security, which had originally been suggested by that really charming ad. Um, so how did his recommendations go down with the pro-gun crowd?



JERRY HENRY, GEORGIA CARRY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR (1/16/2013): All the things that he pointed out will only affect law-abiding citizens who already abide by the law. ... We've got over 20,000 gun laws on the books. We need to enforce those gun laws.

EX-REP. TODD TIAHRT, R-KS (7/11/2007): And when crimes are committed, or when there's a dealer selling guns illegally, we have an organization that goes after them, 24/7, every day. It's called the ATF, and they have officers completely assigned to do this.

(audience laughter and applause)

Depends on where you're registered. Although when you get those, they don't have to be registered. That's the beauty.

I'd like the ATF's director to explain to us law-abiding citizens, if you're out there 24/7, why is this country ass-deep in illegal guns?



NEW YORK CITY MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (12/18/2012): We have not had a director of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Fire for six years.

PETER JOHNSON, JR. (8/1/2012): We don't have a permanent director. BOB CUSACK, THE HILL MANAGING EDITOR (1/16/2013): They haven't had a permanent director of that gun agency in six years.

So there's no director of the ATF. So is the ATF like a Montessori agency, where there's no director, but agents are just encouraged to be curious, and regulate weapons at their own pace?



JOHN AVLON, CNN (12/19/2012): The current acting director commutes from Minnesota. He's the U.S. Attorney from Minnesota as well as Acting Director of the ATF.

You're telling me this dude, the guy who is the Acting Director of the ATF, has another full-time job. That regulating alcohol, and tobacco, and firearms, is his side gig? He's just moonlighting, pickin' up a little extra dough.

Why?? There's 7.8% unemployment in this country, we could find someone to take that job who doesn't already have another job!



RACHEL MADDOW (6/20/2011): The Senate won't confirm anybody to the full-time job.

I'm being told the Senate has to confirm the ATF director, because apparently Wisconsin Congressman James Sensenbrenner, for some reason, inserted that provision into the PATRIOT Act in 2006. Sorry, I don't have footage of that, it was apparently done on the Q.T. I do have footage of Sensenbrenner from that very same year accepting the NRA's coveted Defender of Freedom award.

(audience groans in disgust)

Coincidence!! Unrelated action.

But you know, I mean, OK, they don't have a director, they still have ATF agents.



FORMER ATF AGENT JAMES CAVANAUGH (6/14/2011): In 1972, and I went on ATF in the '70s, there was 2,500 agents. And there's still 2,500 agents, 39 years later.

So policing over 100,000 gun dealers in this country, with just a couple of thousand agents, who are also responsible for tobacco and alcohol may seem impossible, but here's the good news. 18 years ago, a professor analyzed ATF tracing data, and found that 57% of guns used in crimes — the illegal guns — could be traced back to just 1% of licensed gun dealers. All the ATF has to do is create some sort of federal registry of these transactions, trace them back to the bad dealers, and those dealers — the dealers ruining it for the law-abiding gun dealer and citizen, flooding cities with illegal guns — they can be stopped!



LAWRENCE O'DONNELL (12/27/2012): According to today's New York Times, the Bureau is prohibited from creating a federal registry of gun transactions.

Are there any other somewhat comical limits on federal law enforcement's ability to enforce federal law? (sound of letter arriving via pneumatic tube)

I'm sorry, I normally get that through my ear, but I guess the old pneumatic tube system didn't realize the question was rhetorical. But I'll bite, let's see what we got here. All right, hold on.

(reads message) Oh! Apparently, the ATF isn't allowed to inspect dealers for inventory discrepancies more than once a year. And in reality, get to inspect them once every 17 years. 17 years! I'm assuming that's because the ATF doesn't have enough agents, and not that the ATF agents are cicadas. (audience laughter) Let that insect joke just wash over ya.

Well, I guess self-reported inventories from dealers are better than nothing.

Oh my God! Why, it's Gunther, my messenger pigeon!

(reads message) Oh, I see, we can't rely on self-reported inventories either, because the ATF cannot require dealers to keep track of their own inventory!

You see, about 10 years ago, a Congressman stuck an amendment into a federal spending bill that severely restricted the ATF's ability to do what the NRA says they want them to do, which is enforce existing gun laws! It allowed dealers to ignore police requests for assistance. It denied Congress formerly public crime gun data. It ended the oversight of used firearm sales. It required the destruction of background check records within 24 hours, you know, to make sure no mistakes could be corrected!

Who did this? What Congressman jammed this amendment into an unrelated spending bill, completely castrating the ATF's ability to enforce existing gun laws?



PETER JOHNSON, JR. (7/19/2011): It was the amendment named with your name, Tiahrt. EX-REP. TODD TIAHRT (7/11/2007): The Tiahrt Amendment is to protect those who protect us.

That amendment couldn't be worse if the NRA wrote it themselves. (sound of letter arriving via pneumatic tube) Oh boy.

Noooo!!! Gunther, why??? Why would you be in the tube?? You're never supposed to cross antiquated message delivery systems like this!

(reads message) The NRA did write that law.

Well, it's not like the ATF has been completely de-balled. Thanks to the First Amendment, they still do have a YouTube channel that they use to warmly encourage gun dealers to act responsibly.



ATF AGENT PATRICK HOOVER: Although conducting a firearms inventory is not required by federal law, ATF suggests that you conduct a complete firearms inventory at least once a year. ATF ATTORNEY ERIKA RITT: If you observe a buyer who appears to be under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, and it appears their judgment may be impaired, you may want to deny the sale. Not because it would be a violation of the Gun Control Act to complete the sale... but because that person's judgment is likely impaired.

""But obviously it's up to you. It's not our job at the ATF to tell you, you can't sell guns to drunk people. I will say this, though, to the gun dealers. You can sell the gun to the drunk people, but if those motherfuckers try and get in a car and drive home, you take them down!""

We'll be right back."

Bruce Abramski is a former police officer whose uncle wanted to buy a firearm. His uncle is a law-abiding person who can legally purchase, but since Abramski is a former policeman, there are gun shops where he can buy firearms at a discount. Thus, he decided to buy the gun for his uncle.

Everyone who purchases a firearm at a federally-licensed firearm retail store is familiar with Form 4473. The form is created by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and, among other things, asks whether you are the actual purchaser of the firearm, versus purchasing for someone else. Form 4473 tells you that if you say you are not the actual buyer, you cannot purchase the gun.

Abramski and his uncle checked with several gun dealers, all of whom said the legal way to proceed was for Abramski to purchase in his home state of Virginia as the actual buyer, then go to his uncle’s home in Pennsylvania, where they could go to another federally-licensed firearm dealer to have his uncle fill out the same ATF paperwork and undergo the same background check, then have the firearm transferred to the uncle.

Abramski did so. Then he was charged and convicted of a federal felony for making a false statement that is “intended or likely to deceive” a gun dealer “with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the [gun] sale.”

Federal appeals courts with jurisdiction over many of the states in America understand that this provision of federal law is designed only to prevent “straw man” sales, where a buyer obtains the firearm on behalf of a convicted felon, domestic batterer, mentally ill person, or some other sort of person prohibited from buying guns. It is to make sure someone doesn’t get a gun on behalf of someone else who would be refused the sale after they failed a federal background check. In the Supreme Court’s words from 1976, it is to “keep firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age, criminal background, or incompetency.” It was not written to prevent a policeman from being a nephew who tried to save his law-abiding uncle some money.

Nonetheless, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond (with jurisdiction over the Mid-Atlantic states) agreed with two other federal appeals courts in holding that when Abramski checked the box affirming he was the purchaser, he committed a serious federal crime.

If Abramski purchased the gun on his own, then decided to give it to his uncle as a free gift, that would be legal. Or if Abramski bought it for himself, then the following week decided to sell it to his uncle, that would be legal. But because his uncle wrote him a check for the gun before Abramski went to the store to buy the gun, and thus was acting as his uncle’s agent to buy a gun, Abramski became a federal felon.

Question 11a on Form 4473 is poorly worded. That wording was chosen by ATF, not Congress. If Question 11a instead asked if you are purchasing on behalf of someone who cannot legally purchase a firearm, then Abramski would honestly have said “no,” and there would not be any criminal conviction.

On Oct. 15, the Supreme Court granted review in Abramski v. U.S. Arguments are likely around February, with a decision before July 2014.

http://news.yahoo.com/yorks-assault-weapon-registration-begins-150938487.html,,[],New York's assault weapon registration begins,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Key measures of New York's tough new gun law kicked in Monday, with owners of firearms now reclassified as assault weapons required to start registering the firearms and new limits on the number of bullets allowed in magazines.

As the new provisions took effect, New York's affiliate of the National Rifle Association planned to file a court request for a federal injunction to immediate halt to the magazine limit.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo calls those and other provisions in the state's new gun law common sense while dismissing criticisms he says come from ""extreme fringe conservatives"" who claim the government has no right to regulate guns.

""Yes, they are against it, but they are the extremists and the extremists shouldn't win, especially on this issue when it is so important to the majority,"" Cuomo said in a radio interview last week. ""In politics, we have to be willing to take on the extremists, otherwise you will see paralysis.""

New York's new gun restrictions, the first in the nation passed following December's massacre at a Connecticut elementary school, limit state gun owners to no more than seven bullets in magazines, except at competitions or firing ranges.

The new regulations in New York commence as the U.S. Senate prepares to debate expanded gun legislation and weeks after Connecticut joined Colorado in signing into law tougher new gun restrictions.

The New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, the state's NRA affiliate, has a pending federal lawsuit against the new provisions. Attorney Brian Stapleton said the request for an immediate halt to the magazine limit would be filed electronically, probably late Monday or possibly early Tuesday.

The law violates the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens ""to keep commonly possessed firearms"" at home for self-defense and for other lawful purposes, the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association said in court papers. It is advising members to obey the law in the meantime.

Story continues

""We are lawful and legal citizens of New York state and we always obey the law,"" association President Tom King said. ""It's as simple as that.""

The new registrations, required over the next year, will be the group's focus later, King said.

State Police posted forms Monday on their website for registration, which can be filed electronically. Owners of those guns, now banned from in-state sales, are required within a year to register them. Alternatively, they can legally sell them to a licensed dealer or out of state by next Jan. 15.

Rich Davenport, recording secretary of the Erie County Federation of Sportsmen's Clubs, said their nearly 11,000 members are united in opposition to the law, which he considers a hasty, illogical and emotional response to the Newtown, Conn., school shooting. He also questioned likely compliance with the registration requirement.

""I'm guessing it'll be pretty low,"" said Davenport, a longtime hunter. He said that even though he's not personally affected by the registration provision, ""I'm offended as an American.""

The toughest part of the new statute — banning in-state sales of those guns newly classified as ""assault weapons"" — immediately took effect Jan. 15. The new classification related to a single military-style feature, such as a pistol grip on semi-automatic rifles with detachable magazines. Other listed features include a folding or thumbhole stock, bayonet mount, flash suppressor, or second protruding grip held by the non-trigger hand.

It requires owners to register an estimated 1 million guns previously not classified as assault weapons by April 15, 2014, though law enforcement officials acknowledge they don't know exactly how many such guns New Yorkers have.

The assault weapon definition also applies to some shotguns and handguns. They include shotguns that are semi-automatic, or self-loading, and have another feature, such as a folding stock, a second handgrip held by the non-shooting hand or the ability to accept a detachable magazine.

Also covered are semi-automatic pistols that can take detachable magazines and have another feature, such as a folding or thumbhole stock, a second handgrip and a threaded barrel that can accept a silencer.

Many county boards in New York have passed resolutions urging at least partial repeal of the law while warning that new registration requirements would be a costly burden on them.

Herkimer County Clerk Sylvia Rowan said Thursday she had received no registration forms for those guns. ""There's a lot of confusion on this,"" she said.

Rowan noted that she had received few formal requests filed from the holders of the county's 12,000 pistol permits to exempt their information from public disclosure, something else authorized under the new law.

Passed Jan. 15, a month after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., the statute originally banned magazines with more than seven bullets effective April 15. Connecticut officials said that shooter Adam Lanza used a semi-automatic Bushmaster AR-15 and five 30-round magazines to kill 20 children and six adults in minutes.

However, acknowledging that manufacturers don't make seven-bullet magazines, the Cuomo administration and New York lawmakers amended their law on March 29, keeping 10-bullet magazines legal but generally illegal to load them with more than seven bullets.

The statute restates the ban on magazines with capacity to hold more than 10 bullets, while adding also banning those that were grandfathered in under the old law.

The new Colorado bill, signed into law last month, bans ammunition magazines that hold more than 15 rounds.

Vote to proceed with gun-control package carries 68 to 31 with bipartisan support

Democrats needed 60 votes to break threatened filibuster

National Rifle Association closely watched procedural vote to %22score%22 senators

Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that while the National Rifle Association has said it may ""score"" senators on votes during the current gun debate, it did not specify that Thursday's cloture vote would be scored.

WASHINGTON — The Senate voted 68 to 31 Thursday morning to move forward on a gun safety bill, breaking a threatened filibuster from conservative Republicans who wanted to draw out debate on a measure that they say threatens their Second Amendment rights.

The vote was just the first step in what could be a weeks-long saga fraught with procedural perils and subject to a barrage of amendments from both sides.

But it ensures an open debate on gun control for the first time in nearly a decade, and four months after 26 children and adults were shot and killed by a gunman bearing a semi-automatic rifle at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

""We've got the attention of the American people, and frankly, the world,"" Majority Leader Harry Reid said after the vote, as families of Sandy Hook victims watched, hands over mouths, from a gallery.

The vote -- on ""cloture,"" or closing debate and allowing a bill to come to the floor — was one of the most-watched procedural votes in recent history. The National Rifle Association said it would take senators' votes on the gun legislation into account in sending out pre-election letter grades.

It also broke some party and regional lines. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., voted to move forward with the bill despite his ""A+"" rating from the NRA. Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, and Mark Pryor, D-Ark., voted against.

The 16 Republican senators voting to move forward were Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Dean Heller of Nevada, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Mark Kirk of Illinois, John McCain of Arizona, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Roger Wicker of Mississippi.

A trio of conservative GOP senators — Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas — said they forced the filibuster-breaking ""cloture"" vote because the legislation was unfinished, and no one has seen the final language of a key amendment.

""We believe the abuse of the process is how the rights of Americans are systematically eroded and we will continue to do everything in our power to prevent it,"" they said in a joint statement sent out just before the vote.

Even with the 60 votes necessary to proceed on the gun bill, Senate rules require 30 hours of debate. That time is often routinely waived — but a single senator can insist on allowing the full time for arguments. Reid said Thursday morning that senators from both sides are ""waiting in the wings"" to offer amendments.

First up: a proposal from Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would expand background checks to guns shows and Internet sales, but exclude many of the person-to-person transfers that President Obama wanted to be covered. That amendment will come up for debate Tuesday, Reid said. After that will come Democratic-sponsored amendments to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and then an alternating series of Republican and Democratic amendments on mental health, school safety, straw purchases and others.

But the language of those amendments still hasn't been introduced.

As senators headed to the chamber to vote, the Obama administration formally came out in support of the underlying bill, ushered through the Senate Judiciary Committee by Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vt., that would expand background checks but would not create new limits on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.

""The administration urges the Congress to make the legislation even stronger by adding provisions to keep weapons of war and high-capacity ammunition magazines that facilitate mass killings off the nation's streets,"" said the statement released through the Office of Management and Budget.

Vice President Biden, in an interview that aired Thursday on MSNBC, pointed to public opinion polls to show Americans favoring legislation such as expanded background checks for gun purchasers.

""This is one of the cases where the public is so far ahead of the elected officials — I mean so far ahead,"" Biden said on the Morning Joe program. ""You saw it in immigration, you saw it in marriage issues, you're seeing it now. The public has moved to a different place."""

(CNN) – The chief of a powerful gun owners group said Wednesday he doesn't trust the methodology of polls showing an overwhelming number of Americans favoring universal background checks on gun sales.

""I'm not sure I believe any polls at this time. I don't think they know how to ask the right questions,"" Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer during a contentious interview on ""The Situation Room."" When Blitzer asked if that included Fox News' survey, Pratt said it did.



Nearly every national survey released over the past several months has shown a large percentage of Americans support increased background checks. The latest, a CNN/ORC International poll released Wednesday, showed 86% of those questioned favoring some form of background checks that are not currently required by law for gun sales.

The CNN survey, along with the previous polls, found no real partisan divide, with very strong support for the checks from Democrats, Republicans, and independents.

Those figures, however, weren't enough to convince Pratt.

""Your polls are hokum,"" he said, explaining that polls of gun owners groups, like Gun Owners of America and the National Rifle Association, show only small support for increasing background checks. Gun Owners of America has 300,000 due-paying members, per its website, while the larger National Rifle Association has 5 million. Both reflect a small percentage when compared to the overall population.

""When you ask the people involved, maybe we have a reason to suspect how these polls are put together,"" Pratt said.

At the core of his opposition was the potential for the federal government to keep a registry of gun owners, which he declared unconstitutional.

""The background check is national gun registration,"" he said. ""And all that's on the table right now is to make that more comprehensive gun registration scheme than we've already had.""

Sen. Pat Toomey, the Pennsylvania Republican who played a key role in negotiating a deal on expanding background checks, will receive backlash from gun groups, Pratt argued.

""He ought to be held politically accountable, and the way to do that is in the primaries,"" he said, adding his group was ""looking for a viable candidate.""

Toomey is up for re-election in 2016."

(CNN) - For the first time in his White House tenure, President Barack Obama handed the weekly address to someone outside his administration.

He stepped aside so a mother who lost her son in the Newtown school massacre could press Congress to act on new measure tightening access to guns.



“As you’ve probably noticed, I’m not the president. I’m just a citizen. And as a citizen, I’m here at the White House today because I want to make a difference and I hope you will join me,” said Francine Wheeler, whose son Ben, 6, was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December.

“I’ve heard people say that the tidal wave of anguish our country felt on 12/14 has receded,” Wheeler continued, referring to the day of the Newtown shooting. “But not for us. To us, it feels as if it happened just yesterday. And in the four months since we lost our loved ones, thousands of other Americans have died at the end of a gun. Thousands of other families across the United States are also drowning in our grief. Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy.”

White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Friday that Obama asked Wheeler to tape the address, which is heard on radio and seen on the Internet.

In an email from the White House on Saturday, Obama wrote he takes the address ""very seriously because it offers a chance to bring focus to an issue that needs to be part of the national dialogue.""

Wheeler and other families who lost loved ones at Sandy Hook have been in Washington this week to lobby Congress for passage of gun legislation that would expand background checks and take other steps designed to curb gun violence.

“We have to convince the Senate to come together and pass commonsense gun responsibility reforms that will make our communities safer and prevent more tragedies like the one we never thought would happen to us,” Wheeler said, noting that earlier this week it appeared gun control measures would stall in the Senate.

“Then, after the president spoke in Hartford, and a dozen of us met with senators to share our stories, more than two-thirds of the Senate voted to move forward,” she said, referring to Thursday’s Senate action that paved the way for debate on new gun laws.

“But that’s only the start,” she cautioned. “They haven’t yet passed any bills that will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. And a lot of people are fighting to make sure they never do.”

Carney told reporters the president believed the Newtown families in Washington have been “critical to the continued progress we've seen in the Senate.""

A senior Obama administration official told CNN Wheeler wrote the remarks with her husband, and taped the address in the library at the White House on Friday morning. The address features only Wheeler and her husband David on camera.

This is the first time someone other than the president or vice president in this administration has delivered the weekly presidential address, Carney said Friday.

CNN found one instance in the George W. Bush administration when first lady Laura Bush delivered the address on the Taliban oppression of women and children in Afghanistan.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt originated the practice of delivering radio addresses on current issues, which was renewed by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. All succeeding presidents have followed the tradition."
http://news.yahoo.com/federal-gun-prosecutions-decline-despite-obama-executive-action-233021126.html,,[],Federal gun charges decline despite Obama executive action,"More than a year after the Sandy Hook school shooting, President Obama’s directive to amp up prosecutions of federal gun laws hasn’t made much difference in how many people are charged with gun crimes.

U.S. attorneys that prosecute such cases charged 11,674 people with breaking federal gun laws in the fiscal year that ended in September, compared to 11,728 people the year before.

“The federal gun charge numbers are not an accurate reflection of the Department's efforts to investigate and prosecute gun violence,” said Allison Price, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, in a statement. “The fact that we may not prosecute a gun case in federal court does not mean the case is not prosecuted at all.”

Many gun cases are handled at the state and local level, she added. ""Our priorities are to keep our kids safe, help prevent mass shootings, and reduce the epidemic of gun violence in this country,” Price said.

Obama’s directive was one of 23 executive actions on gun violence he released last January, a month after the mass shooting at Connecticut’s Sandy Hook Elementary School that left 20 children dead. The president’s legislative efforts to limit ammunition magazine sizes and expand background checks to cover more gun sales died in the Senate a few months later.

The Justice Department says it has taken other steps to increase firearms enforcement, including forming a task force that advises federal prosecutors on how to reduce gun violence, and creating a database to allow law enforcement to trace weapons across jurisdictions.

But the figures show how ineffectual the president’s executive action was, at least in the short term, in ginning up prosecutions. Without new legislation or increased resources, U.S. attorneys are unlikely to prosecute more gun crimes, experts say.

The National Rifle Association and some Republican lawmakers have argued that the Justice Department does not adequately enforce gun laws that are already on the books. Even Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, formerly Obama’s chief of staff, said in October that the feds have done a “horrible” job of prosecuting gun crimes in Chicago .

Story continues

Obama’s directive to the Justice Department to “maximize enforcement efforts to prevent gun violence and prosecute gun crime” was supposed to be an answer to those critics.

“It’s been deplorable and woeful, the lack of prosecutions for criminals who break gun laws,” Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the NRA, told Yahoo News.

The powerful gun group helped defeat a bill to expand background checks in April in part by arguing that the Obama administration rarely prosecutes people who claim they are eligible to buy a weapon and then are found by the National Instant Crime Background Check System (NICS) to be felons or otherwise disqualified. In 2010, the Feds prosecuted only 44 people who tried to illegally purchase a weapon — less than 1 percent of all people who failed their background checks. The department has instead focused on prosecuting people who violate more serious federal gun laws.

The Justice Department would not say whether that number has increased since 2010. The department has focused on “complex multi-defendant cases” since 2008, Price said.

Over 10 years, NICS checked 100 million gun purchases, and declined people 700,000 times for being felons or having another disqualifying factor on their records. Increasing prosecutions of those people is a rare patch of common ground between the NRA and gun control groups.

“It’s a complicated problem, and frankly, we’re the ones who first raised it,” said Mark Glaze, the president of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a gun control group backed by Michael Bloomberg. “Out of tens of thousands of people, only a relative handful are prosecuted.”

Glaze said many of these cases are difficult to prosecute because U.S. attorneys already are overworked, and using them to charge people with a “paperwork violation” can seem wasteful. Glaze wants 50 U.S. attorneys added to prosecute people who didn’t pass background checks but still tried to buy guns.

The organization also has suggested that the Justice Department conduct a study of a random sample of the 700,000 illegal sales that were declined to try to figure out if any factors predict which buyers commit crimes in the future. That way, U.S. attorneys could focus on prosecuting cases that showed those risk factors.

But others have argued that prosecuting people for failing their background checks is a waste of time in a legal landscape littered with gun traffickers and other more serious offenders. Some buyers are declined because they didn’t realize something on their record disqualified them from purchasing a weapon.

“The reason the ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] doesn’t make it a high priority to target people who attempt to buy a gun from the gun dealer is they spend the majority of their time targeting violent offenders who use guns illegally,” said Mike Bouchard, the former assistant director for field operations of the ATF. “By taking that person and arresting them, it has little to no impact on violent crime.”

This prioritization of serious offenses predates Obama: The Justice Department under President George W. Bush also prosecuted well under 1 percent of people who attempted to buy a weapon and were declined."

A proposal on the issue was introduced this month by South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who on Thursday again expressed his interest in getting the measure passed.

“I believe that the best way to interrupt the shooter is to have a mental health system that actually records and enters into the database people who should not be able to buy a gun,” Graham said.

He made his remark while voting against a bill passed by the committee to ban assault weapons and high-capacity gun magazines.

Graham’s proposal would require that people found mentally incompetent be added to the National Instant Criminal Background System – the database for all new gun sales.

Those added to the list would have to be found incompetent by a federal court or other official body. The proposal is based on a 2005 South Carolina case in which a women pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity for threatening to kill President George W. Bush. The woman, Alice Bolan, was later able to legally buy a gun and attempted to shoot somebody earlier this year.

“The … case is Exhibit A of a broken background check system,” Graham said. “As astonishing as it sounds, that actually happened.”

Graham’s proposal was introduced earlier this month and has bipartisan support.

""I’m a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights,” Arkansas Democrat Rep. Mark Pryor said in support of the bill. “That said, it’s evident that our background check system needs some improvements.”

Under the proposal, a person would be added to the database for such reasons as being an imminent danger to themselves or others, found guilty but mentally ill in a criminal case, found guilty by reason of insanity, found incompetent to stand trial, committed to a psychiatric hospital or required to have psychiatric outpatient treatment.

Meanwhile, several states are addressing the issue.

New York passed legislation that requires therapists to report to the state cases of potentially dangerous behavior. And the Maryland and Florida legislatures are considering similar legislation.

The Florida proposal attempts to close a loophole that allows the mentally ill to voluntarily commit themselves to treatment to avoid getting added to a database. The bill also would require the mandatory reporting of mental illness.

The U.S. Senate committee has now voted in favor of four gun-control measures: the assault weapons ban, more school safety aid, expanding federal background checks on potential gun buyers and helping authorities prosecute illegal gun traffickers.

However, the ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines faces tough odds in passing the full Senate. The measure would need 60 votes, which would require support from Republicans and some Democrats seeking re-election in pro-gun districts."

He Left In']",Many mentally ill missing from gun background check system,"WASHINGTON — Swept along by the tide of outrage and sorrow after the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, Congress passed a law to try to prevent future tragedies by keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill.

The measure, signed by President George W. Bush, promised to strengthen the 14-year-old National Instant Criminal Background Check System by establishing incentives and penalties to prod states to submit records of people legally barred under federal law from buying guns — including those who had been committed to mental institutions.

But today, that promise remains unfulfilled. More than half the states haven’t provided mental health records to the federal database that gun dealers use to check on buyers. And the gap in dealing with the mentally ill is just one of myriad problems that have hampered background checks.

In the shock that followed the Sandy Hook Elementary School killings last month in Newtown, Conn., improving that system has emerged as a major focus of the Obama administration’s plans for combating gun violence. Vice President Joe Biden, who could make recommendations to the president as soon as Tuesday, said he believed there was support for expansion to cover private gun sales, which make up much as 40% of all purchases but do not require background checks.

The history of the last change, the NICS Improvement Amendments Act, shows how difficult it will be to fix this broken system. Many states haven’t even begun to figure out which of their mentally ill residents should be included, or how to gather paper records from courthouses and mental hospitals. There is federal funding for the work, but not nearly enough.

Last year, after the 2010 Tucson shootings by a mentally ill Jared Lee Loughner, President Obama acknowledged in an opinion column that the law “hasn’t been properly implemented.”

The background check system, which became effective in 1998, was part of a 1993 law that prohibited people from possessing guns if they were convicted of a felony, addicted to drugs, committed domestic violence or were involuntarily sent to a mental institution.

Gun rights organizations, including the National Rifle Assn., have fought expansion of those checks. Though the NRA says it supports making sure the names of “violent schizophrenics” are in the database, the group also made it tougher for states to comply — by successfully lobbying for a provision in the 2007 law that requires an appeals process so the mentally ill can seek to have their gun rights restored. States must set that up before they can receive federal grants to help collect records.

As many as 2 million mental health records are not in the system, the National Center for State Courts has found. Gun control advocates say plugging holes like that could be one of the most effective ways to stem gun violence.

“Having 2 million prohibited purchasers out there whose names are not in the background check database is a ticking time bomb,” said Mark Glaze, executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

Tighter standards in 2007 might have prevented the Virginia Tech shooter, Seung-hui Cho, from buying guns. He passed two background checks even though a judge had found him to be a danger to himself and ordered him to get mental health treatment. The state had interpreted the law to cover only in-patient treatment, so his name wasn’t submitted. Virginia has since changed those rules.

Loughner too was able to pass background checks despite mounting evidence of mental problems; he had not been involuntarily committed to an institution or convicted of crimes, the main triggers under the law.

The 2007 improvement act was supposed to speed development of the system by providing grants to states to help pay for hunting down records and setting up electronic databases. But Congress has handed out just a fraction of the grants allowed. Last year, $125 million was authorized under the law, but just $5 million was appropriated.

“The cost of making those changes far outweighs the grant money coming in,” said Carol Cha, acting director for homeland security and justice issues at the Government Accountability Office. “So states are having to make that difficult choice.”

There has been progress, though. The number of gun sales denied for mental health reasons increased from 365 in 2004 to 2,124 in 2011, according to FBI data, although that still accounts for less than 2% of all denials. And the database now has 1.2 million mental health records, up from about 200,000 in 2004.

But most of those records came from just 12 states, while nearly half the states have sent in just a handful of names, according to a July GAO report. “Most states have made little or no progress in providing these records,” the report said.

Federal agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Defense, also have been slow to submit relevant records.

California in recent years has become one of the most cooperative states, submitting more than a quarter of a million mental health records to the federal database by October 2011, more than any other state, according to FBI statistics cited by Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

For more than two decades, the state has kept centralized records on people who are ineligible under state law to possess firearms for mental health reasons. But because of privacy concerns, as well as differences in state and federal reporting standards, it took years for the state to begin sharing them.

California also goes beyond federal law in trying to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. The state bans firearms possession for five years after someone is placed on a 72-hour psychiatric commitment.

One of the main obstacles in developing the federal mental health database for the background check system is confusion over who should be included. The law says the database should include people who have been judged “mentally defective.”

“Not only is that term highly offensive, it’s completely outdated,” said Ron Honberg, policy director at the National Alliance on Mental Illness. “I think there’s a lack of clarity, so states are all over the map on how to interpret it.”

Advertisement

In Alabama, for example, state officials decided to submit the names of people who had been involuntarily committed to institutions only when they’d also been found guilty of an “inappropriate use of firearms” or shown to be a threat to do so. That turned out to be just 243 people, according to a report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

Some states have delayed over worries about privacy concerns. Others have antiquated database systems or say they don’t have the money to provide the records.

In Idaho, state officials have just begun to submit mental health records to the database, 17,000 so far of an estimated 60,000. But it took the state four years to prepare, said Dawn Peck, manager of the Idaho State Police criminal identification bureau.

The first challenge was passing the state law and setting up the appeals process, she said. An early version said judges could restore gun rights if there was “clear and convincing” evidence that the person wasn’t a threat. Peck said the NRA thought that was too tough; the Legislature set the bar lower, at a “preponderance” of evidence.

The NRA did not return calls seeking comment.

Once the law was passed, Peck said, the state began the laborious process of gathering two decades of files from county courthouses. “That’s probably the more cumbersome issue,” she said.

Advertisement

One huge hang-up: turning over the records is voluntary. The U.S. Department of Justice can penalize states that don’t participate by cutting other federal crime grants, but it has not done that.

“What the federal government does need to do,” Glaze said, “is enlarge both the carrots and the sticks necessary to get states to do the right thing.”

Advertisement

A proposed federal law, the Fix Gun Checks Act, aims to plug the holes in the system by making the checks apply to all gun sales and authorizing deep cuts in federal aid for states that don’t go along.

Pennsylvania is one of the states that hasn’t turned over any mental health records — even though some of the records are already in the state’s background check system. Republican state Rep. Todd Stephens, a former prosecutor, says the State Police have cited technical difficulties. He’s planning to submit a bill to speed the process.

“It ought to be a national initiative,” he said. “Barring a tragedy, we would have no way of knowing whether someone with a mental health history from Pennsylvania was buying a gun somewhere else.”

http://news.yahoo.com/gop-house-panel-chairman-consider-gun-bills-232642640--politics.html,,[],GOP House panel chairman will consider gun bills,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said Friday that he's interested in writing legislation this year improving background checks for gun buyers and cracking down on illegal firearms sales.

In an interview, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., provided little detail about his plans. But he said the federal background check system should be fixed to make sure more people with serious mental illnesses don't get firearms.

Criminals and people with significant mental problems are among those barred by federal law from buying guns. States are supposed to supply the federal background check system with purchasers' mental health records, but often they do not because of privacy rules and other barriers.

""We want to improve that system to try to screen out people who should not be able to possess firearms,"" Goodlatte said.

Until now, House GOP leaders have only said they will wait to act until the Democratic-run Senate produces legislation. The Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., could begin writing its own gun curb measure in the next week or two.

Goodlatte did not say when his panel might write legislation, but he said he would not necessarily wait for the Senate to pass legislation.

President Barack Obama has proposed near-universal background checks. Currently, the checks are only required for purchases from federally licensed gun dealers, not sales between private individuals at gun shows, online or elsewhere.

Goodlatte said his legislation would be unlikely to require private background checks for private gun sales between people.

Obama also wants to ban assault weapons and ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds. Goodlatte said he opposes those ideas.

Goodlatte did not say when his panel might write legislation. His comments that the House would begin acting on gun legislation were first reported by Roll Call, a newspaper that covers Congress.

Details remain unclear about the mental health of Adam Lanza, who shot 26 people to death at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school in December. But shooters in some recent mass shootings have been afflicted with mental problems, including those involved in the Virginia Tech killings in 2007 and the 2011 Tucson attack that killed six people and wounded 13, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz.

As other congressional Republicans have done, Goodlatte also complained that current gun laws are not being enforced sufficiently. He and other GOP members of the Judiciary Committee wrote letters Friday to Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, asking for data on federal firearms prosecutions for the past 11 years."

Pew/Stateline Staff Writer

21 states have laws similar to Florida%27s %22stand your ground%22

It allows people to defend themselves with force if they feel threatened in their space

Florida reviewed its laws%2C but made only minor recommendations

The acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla., raised fresh discussion of ""stand your ground"" laws.

The case centered around whether Zimmerman acted in self defense and drew national attention to Florida's law, which allows people to defend themselves with force if they feel threatened in their home, business, car, or a place where they ""have a legal right to be."" At least 22 states have a similar law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

While Zimmerman did not ultimately use the ""stand your ground"" defense in his case, Sanford police did not arrest him until almost two months after the shooting because of the Florida stand your ground rules that require police to have specific evidence to refute a self defense claim in order to arrest someone claiming self defense.

That provision of the law ""does a disservice to Floridians because it's so vague,"" said Florida Sen. Dwight Bullard, a Democrat, in an interview Sunday with CBS Miami.

The police initially did not have evidence to disprove Zimmerman's self-defense claim, said former Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, Jr.

It was not until the case drew national attention and a Department of Justice investigation that prosecutors found evidence to charge Zimmerman with second-degree murder. The NAACP Legal Defense Fund is urging Attorney General Eric Holder to undertake a review of the case and encouraging Trayvon Martin's family to pursue civil action against Zimmerman.

Last year, a Florida task force headed by the lieutenant government reviewed the state's ""stand your ground"" law, but in a final report, the task force only made minor recommendations that required no action from the legislature. No changes were made to the law this year.

""The liberal activists tried to use that tragedy (the shooting death of Trayvon Martin) as an opportunity to take our rights as Americans,"" said Florida House Speaker Rep. Will Weatherford, a Republican, on the attempts to change the state's stand your ground law. ""We stood our ground on Stand Your Ground.""

Across the country, at least 22 states have ""stand your ground"" laws, with varying degrees of requirements for when citizens may use deadly force to protect themselves. Before these new laws were put in place beginning in 2005, people who felt threatened outside their home were required to flee from an attacker before they were allowed to use force to defend themselves.

The new laws make clear, however, that if someone feels threatened either inside or outside their home, they do not have to run away and are legally justified in using force to protect themselves.

""If (my family and I) are walking through the mall and someone attacks us, I should not have to retreat. I should be able to defend myself in any place or forum that I need to,"" said Florida Rep. Carlos Trujillo, a Republican, on Sunday in an interview with CBS Miami.

Some states just allow people to defend themselves in their homes or businesses, while others extend the law to cars or any place someone ""has a right to be."" Florida's law falls into this second category. (See chart)

The Zimmerman case drew national attention to the ""stand you ground"" laws, which were promoted by the National Rifle Association and the American Legislative Exchange Council through model legislation and advocacy.

In a study of ""stand your ground"" laws commissioned by the National Bureau of Economic Research, researchers found that in states with ""stand your ground"" laws, the number of homicides had significantly increased from the years before the law was enacted. They found that the provision that allows self-defense ""in any place a person has a legal right to be"" is the driver of the increase in homicides. The increase in homicides, they argue, negates the claim that these laws reduce crime.

Bloomberg the billionaire or Michael R. Bloomberg the boogeyman.

With signs that momentum for stiffer gun laws has begun to flag on Capitol Hill, the White House and gun control proponents are increasingly turning to the mogul mayor of New York to carry the fight into key congressional districts. He has bankrolled a high-profile campaign to counter the political might of the National Rifle Assn. His latest volley: a blitz of TV ads in 13 states urging lawmakers to approve expanded background check requirements.

But as the emerging voice for gun restrictions, it’s not clear whether Bloomberg will help or hurt. Many gun rights advocates believe he may be their perfect foil. They have ridiculed his effort as the latest excess from a “nanny in chief” who has forced chain restaurants in New York to post calorie counts, and who has waged fierce crusades against smoking, trans fats, salt and sugary beverages.

The White House has no qualms about Bloomberg’s role. Vice President Joe Biden has met with him twice in the last month, and President Obama offered impassioned support at the White House on Thursday for a “national day of action” called by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition that Bloomberg co-chairs.

To mark the day, the group sponsored nearly 140 events in 29 states, from a petition drive in Pleasant Hill, Calif., to a candlelight vigil in Raleigh, N.C. It also launched a TV ad in Connecticut featuring grieving parents of some of the 20 first-graders who were shot to death Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.

The tragedy sparked the current push for gun control, but more than 100 days later no bill has passed either house in Congress. And changes considered possible are far less ambitious than advocates initially had hoped. Lawmakers almost certainly won’t approve new bans on assault weapons or high-capacity ammunition clips.

Bloomberg thus has focused on winning support for universal background checks and stricter gun trafficking laws.

But any new limits will require support from Democrats and Republicans in conservative states with mostly rural voters — constituencies that may be suspicious of Bloomberg’s vast fortune, ambiguous politics (he’s an independent), social liberalism and eat-your-vegetables style.

Early feedback suggests Bloomberg’s pitch doesn’t play well everywhere.

“I don’t take gun advice from the Mayor of NYC. I listen to Arkansans,” Sen. Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat facing a tough reelection fight in 2014, wrote this week on Twitter.

Advertisement

Another red-state Democrat, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, was equally dismissive. “Frankly, there are far better uses for Mayor Bloomberg’s [money] than buying ads attacking a way of life he clearly does not understand.”

“It’s not just about guns; it’s about government overreach, and Bloomberg epitomizes that,” said a Democratic strategist from a Western state, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.

The new TV ads call for background checks for nearly all gun buyers. The spots feature a flannel-clad man, a shotgun in his lap, praising responsible gun ownership from the back of a pickup truck.

The $12-million ad buy, which is running during the two-week congressional recess, targets lawmakers in Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Advertisement

“The public overwhelmingly in those states support background checks on all sales,” said Bloomberg spokesman Marc La Vorgna. “If anything, the ads are going to give cover to those who vote for it because the bill is so popular.”

The group claimed one quick success. Sen. Joe Donnelly, a first-term Democrat from Indiana, told a business round table in Fort Wayne on Tuesday that he was “supportive of background checks.”

Advertisement

Bloomberg, who will leave office next year, does not appear in the TV spot. Other ads produced by the mayor’s group have featured law enforcement officers, retired military officials, sports stars and victims of gun violence.

But Bloomberg has not been hiding. Last fall, his “super PAC” spent more than $3 million to help defeat Rep. Joe Baca, an eight-term pro-gun Democrat facing a primary challenge in a newly drawn San Bernardino district. It was more than Baca and the winner, Gloria Negrete McLeod, spent together.

Advertisement

Bloomberg’s super PAC, Independence USA, spent an additional $2.2 million for anti-gun ads in a special congressional primary in Chicago last month, vaulting that race to national prominence.

In response, the NRA has showcased Bloomberg as its opponent. He popped up in the NRA’s first post-Newtown ad, a pugnacious spot assailing public figures who rely on armed security while opposing posting armed guards in all schools.

Americans “don’t want him in their restaurants; they don’t want him in their homes,” NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “They don’t want him telling them what food to eat. They sure don’t want him telling them what self-defense firearms to own.”

“The mayor has made himself an issue,” said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. “There’s no way he can run away from that. He’s made himself the sole benefactor of this crusade against the 2nd Amendment. He has also made himself the primary intimidator of senators by launching this multimillion-dollar campaign.”

Advertisement

Former Rep. Earl Pomeroy, a North Dakota Democrat who tangled with the NRA when he voted for the now-expired 1994 assault weapons ban, said the group was following a familiar playbook.

“The LaPierre argument is a classic straw-man approach: Shift the topic, portray the other side in an unflattering light, and talk about them instead of talking about the issue,” said Pomeroy, who lost his seat in 2010.

Bloomberg’s allies say the benefit of his advocacy — and his deep pockets — outweighs any potential backlash.

“The risk would be allowing [the] NRA to have the field to themselves, because we’ve seen what the result of that is,” said La Vorgna, Bloomberg’s spokesman.

Shooting in a Tucson parking lot was two years ago today.

We must seek common-sense solutions so such horrors don't happen again.

The children of Sandy Hook deserve our efforts to stop gun violence.

In response to a horrific series of shootings that has sown terror in our communities, victimized tens of thousands of Americans, and left one of its own bleeding and near death in a Tucson parking lot, Congress has done something quite extraordinary — nothing at all.

I was shot in the head while meeting with constituents two years ago today. Since then, my extensive rehabilitation has brought excitement and gratitude to our family. But time and time again, our joy has been diminished by new, all too familiar images of death on television: the breaking news alert, stunned witnesses blinking away tears over unspeakable carnage, another community in mourning. America has seen an astounding 11 mass shootings since a madman used a semiautomatic pistol with an extended ammunition clip to shoot me and kill six others. Gun violence kills more than 30,000 Americans annually.

This country is known for using its determination and ingenuity to solve problems, big and small. Wise policy has conquered disease, protected us from dangerous products and substances, and made transportation safer. But when it comes to protecting our communities from gun violence, we're not even trying — and for the worst of reasons.

An ideological fringe

Special interests purporting to represent gun owners but really advancing the interests of an ideological fringe have used big money and influence to cow Congress into submission. Rather than working to find the balance between our rights and the regulation of a dangerous product, these groups have cast simple protections for our communities as existential threats to individual liberties. Rather than conducting a dialogue, they threaten those who divert from their orthodoxy with political extinction.

As a result, we are more vulnerable to gun violence. Weapons designed for the battlefield have a home in our streets. Criminals and the mentally ill can easily purchase guns by avoiding background checks. Firearm accessories designed for killing at a high rate are legal and widely available. And gun owners are less responsible for the misuse of their weapons than they are for their automobiles.

Forget the boogeyman of big, bad government coming to dispossess you of your firearms. As a Western woman and a Persian Gulf War combat veteran who have exercised our Second Amendment rights, we don't want to take away your guns any more than we want to give up the two guns we have locked in a safe at home. What we do want is what the majority of NRA members and other Americans want: responsible changes in our laws to require responsible gun ownership and reduce gun violence.

We saw from the NRA leadership's defiant and unsympathetic response to the Newtown, Conn., massacre that winning even the most common-sense reforms will require a fight. But whether it has been in campaigns or in Congress, in combat or in space, fighting for what we believe in has always been what we do.

Let's not be naive

We can't be naive about what it will take to achieve the most common-sense solutions. We can't just hope that the last shooting tragedy will prevent the next. Achieving reforms to reduce gun violence and prevent mass shootings will mean matching gun lobbyists in their reach and resources.

Americans for Responsible Solutions, which we are launching today, will invite people from around the country to join a national conversation about gun violence prevention, will raise the funds necessary to balance the influence of the gun lobby, and will line up squarely behind leaders who will stand up for what's right.

Until now, the gun lobby's political contributions, advertising and lobbying have dwarfed spending from anti-gun violence groups. No longer. With Americans for Responsible Solutions engaging millions of people about ways to reduce gun violence and funding political activity nationwide, legislators will no longer have reason to fear the gun lobby. Other efforts such as improving mental health care and opposing illegal guns are essential, but as gun owners and survivors of gun violence, we have a unique message for Americans.

We have experienced too much death and hurt to remain idle. Our response to the Newtown massacre must consist of more than regret, sorrow and condolence. The children of Sandy Hook Elementary School and all victims of gun violence deserve fellow citizens and leaders who have the will to prevent gun violence in the future.

The proposal would impose stiff penalties for both straw purchasers and those who sell to them. It would also explicitly define gun trafficking as a federal crime.

Law enforcement officials have said the absence of such laws has hampered their ability to stop illegal firearms trafficking. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the bill’s co-sponsor and chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the “common sense” proposal would address those gaps in the law.

“Our bill was drafted at the request of law enforcement,” Leahy said. “It will provide needed tools to fight against the drug cartels and other criminals who threaten our communities. It will not undermine the 2nd Amendment rights of lawful gun owners.”

The bill blends two existing anti-trafficking proposals: one introduced by Leahy and Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), and another from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Mark Steven Kirk (R-Ill.). All four senators co-sponsor this new proposal, as well as Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).

With two Republicans on board, the bill has the most bipartisan support of the major gun bills now winding through Congress. Its backers are continuing to reach out to other Republican senators, particularly Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee who has an A rating from the National Rifle Assn.

While groups like the NRA have ardently opposed other elements of Obama’s gun control package, such as an assault weapons ban and an expansion of background checks, gun rights supporters have been relatively quiet on anti-trafficking proposals. But there have been pockets of push-back: Last week, Gun Owners of America urged members to call their senators to block the earlier version of Leahy and Durbin’s bill. The group did not respond to calls for comment Monday on the new agreement.

The Senate Judiciary Committee will deliberate the trafficking bill and other gun measures Thursday. A separate group of senators, led by Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) have been working on a bipartisan universal background check bill, but negotiations have stalled over disagreements over record-keeping for private sales.

The Undetectable Firearms Act, which was first enacted in 1988 and reauthorized in 2003, makes it illegal to “manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer or receive” any firearm that’s undetectable by metal detectors and X-ray machines.

Three Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer of New York, Bill Nelson of Florida and Patrick Leahy of Vermont are pushing legislation that would extend the ban to all guns manufactured using so-called three-dimensional printing technology.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who objected along with other senators, blocked Schumer's request for unanimous consent for a one-year extension to the law before the Senate adjourned last week, according to The Hill.

“We will be glad to give it serious attention,” Sessions said Thursday, according to the report. “I know it is the kind of thing we probably can clear at some point, but I object.”

The National Rifle Association has not publicly stated where it stands on the proposed extension. Gun Owners of America, a smaller gun rights group, told The New York Times that the extension is unnecessary because 3-D printing technology is not widely available.

“They’re not going to be in Kinkos,” Larry Pratt, the group's executive director, told the newspaper. “And at the moment, they can’t fire that many rounds. It’s just not something that we’re going to be dealing with anytime soon.”

Schumer, however, has said the technology of 3-D printing has advanced to the point anyone with $1,000 and an Internet connection can access the plastic parts that can be fitted into a gun. Those firearms can't be detected by metal detectors or X-ray machines.

The senator says that means anyone can download a gun cheaply, then take the weapons anywhere, including high-security areas.

More than 100,000 copies of plans for the world's first 3D-printed handgun, The Liberator, were downloaded in May before the State Department told the Texas-based nonprofit behind the firearm to stop sharing the file.

The Philadelphia City Council voted unanimously last week to prohibit the use of 3-D printers to create any firearm or ""any piece thereof"" unless that person possesses a license to manufacture firearms, making Philly the first city in the U.S. to pass such a ban.

In May, Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., requested a plan of action from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on the new threat posed by guns made with 3-D printing technology. The senator said earlier this month he has yet to receive a response.

“We must not allow a 3-D printer cartridge to become as deadly as a gun cartridge,” Markey said. “These homemade 3-D printed-guns are no longer a figment of the imagination but are a real threat to the public. We need to immediately pass the Undetectable Firearms Act to ensure these stealth weapons don’t go undetected.""

http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-07-09/news/chi-illinois-concealed-carry_1_harrisburg-democrat-gun-bill-quinn,2013-07-09 00:00:00,"['Ray Long', 'Monique Garcia', 'Rick Pearson']",General Assembly overrides governor's veto of concealed carry bill,"SPRINGFIELD -- Lawmakers made Illinois the last state to allow concealed carry of firearms in two quick votes Tuesday that formalized the deepening rift between Gov. Pat Quinn and the legislature.

The House and Senate voted to override Quinn's amendatory veto of a legislative compromise aimed at satisfying a federal court deadline for legalizing some form of public possession of firearms. Illinois was the last state without some form of legal concealed carry, but the appeals court ruled late last year that the ban was unconstitutional.

While Tuesday's court deadline for passing a law was a major motivating factor, the 77-31 House vote and 41-17 Senate roll call were more than a rejection of Quinn's efforts to toughen the regulations — they were a repudiation of the Democratic governor's leadership style by a Democratic-led legislature.

Quinn, who has said he will seek a second elected term as governor next year, found Democrats assailing his lack of direct involvement in the legislative negotiations that led to the compromise bill that originally passed the General Assembly on May 31— the final day of the spring session.

""It was all grandstanding and he should be ashamed of himself,"" said Rep. Brandon Phelps, the Harrisburg Democrat who sponsored the override.

""He thumbed his nose at our compromise,"" said Phelps, who had accused Quinn of political pandering to voters supportive of tight gun control in Democratic-dominated Cook County. Phelps said the House and Senate votes send a ""pretty strong message to the governor that he was wrong the whole time.""

The complaints about Quinn's handling of the gun debate mirrored those from lawmakers on Illinois' most vexing issue — the state's massive unfunded liability for public employee pensions. Lawmakers also blew through Quinn's Tuesday deadline for a special bipartisan panel to come up with a pension fix — something that has been elusive for the past two years.

""Anyone who doesn't understand that we're going to run this bill over his objections doesn't understand government,"" Sen. Mike Jacobs, D-East Moline, said about the gun bill. He urged the governor not to make the same mistake on pensions: ""I want Gov. Quinn to get in the game.""

Quinn had issued a blanket criticism of lawmakers — including gun control allies who supported the bill — as ""genuflecting"" to the National Rifle Association. Following the vote, he defended his efforts to work with lawmakers but said the General Assembly had ""surrendered"" to the NRA.

""With respect to working and getting the job done, I think the people of Illinois know that I work every day for their common good. I believe in gun safety, and I'm going to always speak out about that. I don't think people should have their lives and property harmed by people with loaded concealed weapons who don't, under the law, deserve to have them,"" he said.

Quinn promised to continue seeking the changes he had proposed, including banning firearms from establishments that sell any alcohol, limiting a person to carrying one concealed firearm at a time, and restricting magazines for concealed weapons to no more than 10 rounds.

The governor was successful in peeling off some votes from gun control advocates. The measure originally got 89 House votes and 45 Senate votes. But faced with the prospect that the legislature's failure to enact a law could lead to unregulated concealed carry, even gun control supporters in the legislature urged an override of the governor.

Sen. Kwame Raoul, D-Chicago, who negotiated the measure on behalf of gun control advocates, said he felt conflicted by rejecting Quinn's changes because he originally sought to include many of them. He warned that voting with Quinn was a ""political vote"" but one that endangered public safety if no law was enacted.

""There's no more time,"" Raoul said. ""We are here on July 9th and if the members of this chamber have the interests of public safety at their heart, they would vote 'yes' to override.""

It will be several months before qualified gun owners can carry a concealed firearm outside their homes while the Illinois State Police puts together licensing procedures and applicant reviews.

But the legislature's decision to override Quinn and stick to its agreed-upon compromise may represent only a short-lived truce between gun rights advocates and gun control supporters in a state where there is a vast divergence over how firearms are viewed, dependent largely upon cultural and regional differences.

Even a late effort by lawmakers to amend another bill to reflect three mostly minor changes that the governor had proposed ended up falling short of the votes needed in the House after first passing the Senate.

Phelps acknowledged now that the law is in effect, ""you're going to see political posturing on both sides of this issue.""

Sen. Christine Radogno of Lemont, the Senate Republican leader, told colleagues that ""I don't think this is the last time we're going to be discussing this issue."" And Rep. Kelly Cassidy, D-Chicago, a gun control supporter, said ""it is a very safe bet that we will be back"" fighting over changes in the new law.

Cassidy noted the new law removes the ability of larger communities to set some of their own gun laws and said she feared gun rights supporters are ""going to be back here time after time after time chipping away at all the things that everyone has lauded as the great protections.""

Sen. Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, said lawmakers ""can and should add more protections to when and how people can carry guns in public places. I believe in give-and-take and compromise, but we can't bargain away the safety of our families."""

John Hickenlooper speaks at a news conference at the Capitol in Denver on Wednesday, March 20, 2013, about the shooting death of Tom Clements the Executive Director of the Department of Corrections. Clements was shot at his home in Monument, Colo., Tuesday night. (AP Photo/Ed Andrieski)

WASHINGTON -- Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) signed three major gun control measures into law on Wednesday morning, just hours after the state's Department of Corrections chief, Tom Clements, was shot and killed at home. The new legislation represents the culmination of a battle between Hickenlooper and national gun rights advocacy groups that began on a cordial note, but ended acrimoniously on both sides.

The three laws will ban gun magazines with a capacity of more than 15 rounds, require background checks for all firearms sales (with exceptions made for antique guns and ""bona fide"" gifts between immediate family members), and impose a fee on background checks that covers the cost to the state of performing them. The laws are scheduled to go into effect July 1.

Hickenlooper signed the bills in a solemn ceremony at the state Capitol in Denver a few hours after he held a news conference on the death of Clements, who had been appointed executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections in 2011.

""Corrections is a very different job. You make difficult decisions every time that affect different people,"" Hickenlooper said at the news conference. ""Tom Clements dedicated his life to being a public servant, to making our state a better place, and he is going to be deeply, deeply missed.""

Authorities have not apprehended a suspect in Clements' murder, which occurred Tuesday around 8:30 p.m. The killer allegedly knocked on Clements' front door and then shot him at close range when he opened it.

Hickenlooper said he would be visiting with Clements' family Wednesday after he signed the gun control bills.

In recent years, gun violence has become an increasingly divisive political issue in Colorado, in no small part because the state has been the scene of two mass shootings. The first was at Columbine High School in 1999, when two students murdered 12 people and injured 21 others before committing suicide. Then, in August 2012, a lone gunman opened fire in a movie theater in nearby Aurora, killing 12 and injuring 58 people.

""Colorado is in a unique position in that we have suffered these tragedies firsthand, so there is a drumbeat [for greater gun control] in Colorado,” said state Senate President John Morse (D) this month in an interview with NBC News.

But Colorado is also a state with a strong tradition of firearms ownership and a pioneer heritage that remains a source of pride for residents. As the state House of Representatives prepared to introduce the gun control legislation this winter in the wake of the tragic shooting in Newtown, Conn., gun rights advocates initially sought to capitalize on that goodwill by announcing that their goal was to find a reasonable compromise.

In February, the National Rifle Association's president, David Keene, traveled to Colorado to meet with Hickenlooper in person and said afterward that the NRA had always considered the governor ""a pretty reasonable and thoughtful guy."" In turn, Hickenlooper said that ""while [the NRA and I] might not agree on a number of things, there will certainly be places we can find common ground.""

As the sweeping gun control bills advanced through the Colorado House and Senate in late February and March largely unamended, however, the NRA and similar groups dropped the ""nice guy"" veneer. The NRA established a dedicated website, Defend Colorado, aimed at mobilizing opposition to the bills and took out print advertisements in Colorado newspapers attacking Hickenlooper.

The attacks continued right up to Tuesday afternoon, when the NRA put out a release warning Colorado residents that ""Governor Hickenlooper is likely to sign a series of draconian bills that attack on [sic] your Second Amendment rights.""

On Wednesday, after the news of Clements' death broke, the NRA was silent on both social media and its website. A spokesman for the group did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Editor’s Note: Jeffrey Bellin, an assistant professor of law at Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law, formerly served as a federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C.

(CNN) —

The tragic killing of Trayvon Martin and the initial decision by the police not to arrest George Zimmerman for that killing have focused public attention on Florida’s “stand your ground” law.

According to police, Zimmerman claims self-defense, but many observers can’t understand how a grown man with a gun can plausibly claim that he was forced to kill a teenager armed only with some candy.

If that’s the law of self-defense in Florida (and elsewhere), these observers argue, the law needs to change.

Courtesy Jeffrey Bellin Jeffrey Bellin

The law of self-defense is at its core about reasonableness. If a person reasonably perceives a serious threat of harm, and uses reasonable force to meet that threat, the law justifies even deadly force, and it does so even if it turns out that the perceived threat was illusory.

People have differing views of what’s reasonable and, as a consequence, self-defense laws (which vary by jurisdiction) have always attempted to further define the concept. Until very recently, Florida’s definition of reasonableness, as in many states, incorporated a longstanding principle, the “duty to retreat.”

This principle required that someone who found themselves in a violent confrontation had to try to defuse the situation and retreat “to the wall” before resorting to deadly force.

In other words, deadly force was only permitted as a last resort. The basic idea was simple: If more people backed down, retreated or stepped aside, fewer people would be killed.

The “duty to retreat” also made it easier for prosecutors to prove that a killing was not in self-defense. The facts that can be proven are often murky (particularly when of the two people who know what happened, one is the defendant and the other is dead) and prosecutors could often, by pointing to a defendant’s failure to retreat, obtain a conviction even without establishing the precise facts.

In American jurisdictions there has long been an exception to the duty to retreat called the “Castle Doctrine.” As then-Judge (and later U.S. Supreme Court Justice) Benjamin Cardozo explained in 1914: “It is not now and never has been the law that a man assailed in his own dwelling is bound to retreat. If assailed there, he may stand his ground and resist the attack. He is under no duty to take to the fields and the highways, a fugitive from his own home.”

In recent times, “stand your ground” laws extended this concept in many states beyond the home to any place where a person might lawfully be found, such as a bar or a public sidewalk. Florida’s version enacted in 2005 (over the objection of many in law enforcement) is one of the most far reaching.

The law states that a person “who is attacked” anywhere he is lawfully present has “no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm.”

Importantly, a person cannot invoke this provision if he is “engaged in unlawful activity” or “initially provokes the use of force against himself.” Finally, in Florida, once self-defense becomes an issue at trial, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense – a heavy burden.

This is the legal backdrop against which Florida’s prosecuting authorities must assess all claims of self-defense, including Zimmerman’s. In an ideal world, law enforcement would make this assessment by thoroughly investigating the case and, after determining the provable facts, comparing those facts to the law.

Critical to this determination will be evidence reflecting: how the confrontation began and how the suspect acted after the confrontation (prosecutors often look for actions such as flight or a cover-up that indicate a “consciousness of guilt”). Perhaps most critically, investigators will compare all the evidence (physical and otherwise) with the suspect’s statement (if any) about what happened.

If the investigation reveals sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Zimmerman was not acting in self-defense (as Florida law defines that concept), he can be prosecuted. If not, charges are unwarranted.

Depending on the facts that ultimately emerge, the “stand your ground” law may ultimately control the legal outcome of the Trayvon Martin case. If, as a result, Florida’s citizens and legislators (and those in other states) see that law in a new light, they can change the law, perhaps leading to fewer tragic outcomes in the future.

As the country searches its soul in the wake of the recent wave of questionable killings by police, Americans of all races are struggling with a distressing sense of deja vu. This is not the first time we have struggled with this anguish and it will not be the last. But there may be a new prospect for hope this time.

NEW YORK—New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the media need to improve their coverage of gun violence, arguing the press pays attention to gun-related deaths only after mass shootings.

In an interview with NBC’s Jimmy Fallon, Bloomberg called the Dec. 14 shooting that killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., “terribly tragic,” but said there is scant coverage of people who are killed by guns every day.

“This was a crazy person with an assault weapon,” Bloomberg said of the Sandy Hook shooting. “But there’s 33 people killed in America with guns every single day of the year. And nobody seems to care. It only catches the press’s attention when it’s young kids concentrated. And it was terribly tragic, but there are kids killed every day all across this country.”

Bloomberg has emerged as one of the most vocal advocates of new gun-control measures since the Sandy Hook shooting, urging President Barack Obama to make the issue a top priority in his second term. But the mayor insisted he’s not trying to ban guns, telling Fallon that “if you are responsible and you are adult and you don’t have a criminal record, there’s nothing wrong with you having a gun.”

The problem, Bloomberg said, is that Congress doesn’t “fund enforcement” of existing gun laws and “guns are getting into the hands of the wrong people.”

“There’s just too many guns in the world and certainly in this country,” Bloomberg said. “And we’ve just got to do something about it.”

The mayor discussed his meeting Wednesday with former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot at point-blank range and nearly killed during a constituent meeting two years ago. Giffords, who is set to visit Newtown today, resigned from Congress to focus on recovery.

“She's still recovering. She’s still doing therapy and yoga and struggling to learn to speak again. … And she’s lucky. She lived,” Bloomberg said."

In the early hours on Thursday, CT passed a new comprehensive bipartisan gun responsibility law.

Interesting read from AP:

How Conn. Gun Bill Compares to New NY, Colo. Laws Gun control measures proposed in Connecticut after the December massacre in Newtown and expected to win approval Wednesday would be among the strongest such laws in the country. Here is a look at how the proposals compare to laws passed this year in Colorado and New York:

Connecticut legislators are expected to pass sweeping gun-control legislation on Wednesday, becoming the third state since the Dec. 14 shooting in Newtown to do so. But until recently, it wasn’t clear whether any legislation would even come to a vote. Connecticut has several strict gun laws in place — it was one of the few to pass a state assault weapons ban in 1993. But in recent years, the state’s pro-gun groups, using grassroots and legislative pressure, have killed two major pieces of gun-control legislation in a coordinated offensive. They strongly opposed any new laws after Newtown. This time, though, something was different. Local residents in support of gun-control began turning up at hearings that were once largely attended by gun advocates.

Empty threats made by the gun lobby. They were ignored by CT legislators.

NY Times:

But from beginning to end, the victims were never far away. Around 12:40 a.m. Mitch Bolinsky, a freshman Republican who has been elected from Newtown a month before the tragedy, rose to speak. ""On Dec. 14, evil visited my town and everything changed,” he said. He cited the strength he’d seen in Newtown, the compassion shown for the town, the painful journey everyone had been through and read the names of those who died at the school. He said the legislation was not perfect, especially on mental health but said his constituents overwhelming supported the firearms provisions and as a result he would vote in favor of the bill. ""I dedicate my vote to the memory of those whose lives were lost at Sandy Hook Elementary School,” he said.

More politics and policy below the fold, including a new gun responsibility poll from Quinnipiac."

The stock prices for Smith & Wesson Holding Co. (SWHC) and Sturm, Ruger & Co. (RGR) rose about 4%. The stock for Sturm, Ruger has risen 13% in the month since the shooting at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school that left 20 children and six educators dead.

Retailers that specialize in guns have also done well. The stock price for Cabela's (CAB) surged 6% on Wednesday and has gained 20% over the last month. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) notched up slightly, and has gained 6% over the month.

Obama issued the call for the assault ban as part of a broad response to the Newtown shooting.

""Congress should restore the ban on military style assault weapons and a 10-round limit for magazines,"" the president said. Obama was referring to a 10-year ban that expired in 2004, which limited the capacity of magazines and restricted military-style features on semiautomatic rifles.

Related: Obama seeks assault weapons ban

But the specter of a potential ban in the wake of mass shootings around the country has prompted gun enthusiasts to stock up on the weapons that may some day be denied to them.

""Consumers are flocking to stores to purchase certain types of firearms, including assault rifles, in fears of some type of ban going forward,"" said Rommel Dionisio, gun industry analyst for Wedbush Securities. ""It's people rushing to buy them before they're banned.""

Dick's said last month that it has suspended sales of assault rifles.

Related: Assault rifles are selling out

Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger manufacture a wide variety of firearms, including the semiautomatic rifles that are known various as assault weapons or modern sporting rifles.

There are many other non-public companies that manufacture semiautomatic rifles, including Bushmaster Firearms International, which makes the rifle used at the Newtown shooting and also a recent shooting in Webster, N.Y., where a convict burned down houses and then ambushed and killed two volunteer firefighters.

Such a ban, if it passes, would also impact manufacturers of high-capacity magazines. They include the Beta Company, which makes 100-round drums, and SGM Tactical, which produces 30-round and 100-round magazines.

Related: A month after Newtown, a massive gun trade show

High-capacity magazines face a potential ban because they were used by Adam Lanza in the Newtown shooting and by James Holmes, suspect in a mass shooting last year at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.

Obama acknowledged that he faces serious opposition in trying to get an assault weapon bill passed by a Republican-controlled House.

Even as Obama spoke, thousands of gun industry members packed into the SHOT Show -- an annual trade show -- in Las Vegas. The show is owned and sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an organization based in Newtown, less than two miles from the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/opinion/gun-reform-for-a-generation.html,2013-01-17 00:00:00,[],President Obama’s Plan for Gun Reform - The New York Times,"•

Mr. Obama’s bills would require universal criminal background checks for all gun sales, doing away with the loopholes for gun shows, private sales and Internet sales that have exempted 40 percent of all gun sales from those checks. He called on Congress to reinstate and toughen the ban on assault weapons that was allowed to expire in 2004. He wants to restore a 10-round limit on ammunition magazines and to ban armor-piercing bullets that are used by criminals to kill police officers. The president asked Congress to pass a $4 billion measure intended to retain 15,000 police officers who are being laid off as states and localities react to the recent recession and to budget cuts from Washington.

Mr. Obama also issued executive orders to make the background checks system more comprehensive and strengthen enforcement of existing gun laws. He is ending a freeze on research into gun violence at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was imposed by lawmakers at the behest of a gun lobby that is terrified by the prospect that gun violence could be viewed, as it should be, as a public health issue. He also signed an order making it clear that doctors and other health care providers are not prohibited by any federal law from reporting their patients’ threats of violence and that the health care reform law “does not prevent doctors from talking to patients about gun safety.”

Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. acknowledged that getting any of the president’s proposals through Congress was going to be a herculean task. Mr. Biden said, “I also have never seen the nation’s conscience so shaken by what happened” in Newtown. We have hoped, too, that the murders last month would finally inspire action, especially if Americans pressured their representatives in Congress to do something about this crisis.

Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden will have to make good on Mr. Obama’s promise to do everything they can to fight for these proposals in Congress — and that will mean twisting arms and making threats to members of his own party as well as to Republicans.

The gun lobby is focused within the Republican Party, but Democratic lawmakers have also been to blame for failing to pass meaningful gun regulations. Already, some Democrats who should be strongest on gun controls are showing familiar signs of weakness.

Senator Pat Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, will be needed as a leader in this effort but has been mumbling about the need to hold extensive hearings. And Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, was making ominous, cowardly remarks over the weekend about tailoring whatever the Senate does to what he thinks could get through a House dominated by the far-right fringe of the Republican Party. He has started to wriggle away from the idea of an assault weapons ban, for example.

This is not a time for lawmakers to do the politically safe thing or the N.R.A.-approved thing, even if they know it is less than needed. It is time to reach for big ideas and strong laws on gun violence.

""We really need five votes,"" Manchin, a Democrat, said during an interview at the Atlantic's New York Ideas Festival. The original bill, which Manchin co-sponsored with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, failed in a 54-46 Senate vote last month.

A new bill, Manchin said, is in the works. ""Oh, it's coming back,"" he said.

Manchin said he needs to educate law-abiding gun owners who support the legislation but don't trust the government.

Other detractors said the bill might infringe on gun transfers between family members. ""It doesn't at all,"" Manchin said.

The Democratic senator also scoffed at talk of the ""culture war"" discussed at the National Rifle Association convention in Houston over the weekend as cage-rattling rhetoric.

""What you saw was the division that's going on across the country,"" Manchin, a gun owner and member of the NRA, said. ""I don't know why we can't sit and talk and work together as Americans.""

Manchin said the school shootings in Newtown, Conn., affected his views.

""If Newtown didn't change you, nothing will,"" Manchin said. ""It made you think, 'Can we do something a little better?'""

Twenty-six people, including 20 children, were killed in the Dec. 14, 2012, shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Manchin added: ""None of those families came to my office and asked to repeal the Second Amendment."" They asked him to make it harder for people who are bent on killing to get guns.

""That was a small ask,"" he said."

The stock prices for Smith & Wesson Holding Co. (SWHC) and Sturm, Ruger & Co. (RGR) rose about 4%. The stock for Sturm, Ruger has risen 13% in the month since the shooting at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school that left 20 children and six educators dead.

Retailers that specialize in guns have also done well. The stock price for Cabela's (CAB) surged 6% on Wednesday and has gained 20% over the last month. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) notched up slightly, and has gained 6% over the month.

Obama issued the call for the assault ban as part of a broad response to the Newtown shooting.

""Congress should restore the ban on military style assault weapons and a 10-round limit for magazines,"" the president said. Obama was referring to a 10-year ban that expired in 2004, which limited the capacity of magazines and restricted military-style features on semiautomatic rifles.

But the specter of a potential ban in the wake of mass shootings around the country has prompted gun enthusiasts to stock up on the weapons that may some day be denied to them.

""Consumers are flocking to stores to purchase certain types of firearms, including assault rifles, in fears of some type of ban going forward,"" said Rommel Dionisio, gun industry analyst for Wedbush Securities. ""It's people rushing to buy them before they're banned.""

Dick's said last month that it has suspended sales of assault rifles.

Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger manufacture a wide variety of firearms, including the semiautomatic rifles that are known various as assault weapons or modern sporting rifles.

There are many other non-public companies that manufacture semiautomatic rifles, including Bushmaster Firearms International, which makes the rifle used at the Newtown shooting and also a recent shooting in Webster, N.Y., where a convict burned down houses and then ambushed and killed two volunteer firefighters.

Such a ban, if it passes, would also impact manufacturers of high-capacity magazines. They include the Beta Company, which makes 100-round drums, and SGM Tactical, which produces 30-round and 100-round magazines.

High-capacity magazines face a potential ban because they were used by Adam Lanza in the Newtown shooting and by James Holmes, suspect in a mass shooting last year at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.

Obama acknowledged that he faces serious opposition in trying to get an assault weapon bill passed by a Republican-controlled House.

Even as Obama spoke, thousands of gun industry members packed into the SHOT Show -- an annual trade show -- in Las Vegas. The show is owned and sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an organization based in Newtown, less than two miles from the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting."

Speakers - including Education Secretary Arne Duncan, lawmakers and actors - urged the protesters carrying such signs as ""What Would Jesus Pack?"" to lobby Congress and state legislators to back gun control measures…

… ""…This is about gun responsibility. This is about gun safety. This is about fewer dead Americans, fewer dead children, fewer children living in fear,"" Duncan said. Organizers backed President Barack Obama's call for a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and background checks for all gun sales. They also urged safety training for all buyers of firearms. Marchers stretched for several blocks along Constitution Avenue as they approached the rally site in the shadow of the Washington Monument…

Elsewhere in Washington, less than 48 hours earlier, as fellow Kossack Meteor Blades informed us: “ Sen. Feinstein's assault weapons ban will face stiff resistance from some elected Democrats .”

As One Million Moms’ protestor Amy Journo, a Newtown, CT resident with two sons, five and seven years old, who attended Sandy Hook Elementary School, noted in the Reuters story (linked and excerpted above):



""It's difficult to get laws changed when politicians are bought out, but we have to start somewhere…I want to ensure that they (children) are safer, not just my children but all across the United States.""

And, this quote brings us (back) full-circle to Mike McIntire’s stunning feature story in Sunday’s NY Times.

As you’ll learn in the article--god forbid, if anyone was ever going to walk into an elementary school classroom with an assault weapon again—if the Newtown, CT-based National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) has their way, eight-year-olds throughout America will be fully proficient with firearms, up to and including semi-automatic assault weapons; and, they’ll have the knowledge and skills necessary to take the shooter out!

I mean, “seriously!” Why waste taxpayer money on training educators how to handle guns, when you may accomplish the same end result by encouraging the parents of students in the second grade to pay for their kids to learn how to handle AR-15s and semi-automatic pistols, instead?

Apparently, as we learn in today’s NYT, this is the logic behind the NSSF’s “First Shots” program. And then, as it’s explained in Mike McIntire’s piece, you’ll learn more about folks like, “Larry Potterfield, the founder of MidwayUSA, one of the nation’s largest sellers of shooting supplies… who said his own children started shooting ‘boys’ rifles’ at age 4, getting young people engaged with firearms — provided they have the maturity and the physical ability to handle them — strengthens an endangered American tradition.”

You’ll also read about “Junior Shooters, an industry-supported magazine that seeks to get children involved in the recreational use of firearms, once featured a smiling 15-year-old girl clutching a semiautomatic rifle. At the end of an accompanying article that extolled target shooting with a Bushmaster AR-15 — an advertisement elsewhere in the magazine directed readers to a coupon for buying one — the author encouraged youngsters to share the article with a parent.”



“Who knows?” it said. “Maybe you’ll find a Bushmaster AR-15 under your tree some frosty Christmas morning!”

… acknowledged in an editorial that some of his magazine’s content stirred controversy. “I have heard people say, even shooters that participate in some of the shotgun shooting sports, such things as, ‘Why do you need a semiautomatic gun for hunting?’ ” he wrote. But if the industry is to survive, he said, gun enthusiasts must embrace all youth shooting activities, including ones “using semiautomatic firearms with magazines holding 30-100 rounds.” In an interview, Mr. Fink elaborated. Semiautomatic firearms are actually not weapons, he said, unless someone chooses to hurt another person with them, and their image has been unfairly tainted by the news media. There is no legitimate reason children should not learn to safely use an AR-15 for recreation, he said.

And, then there’s this gem from Junior Shooters’ editor Andy Fink, who…

You really need to read McIntire’s entire article to get a sense of the truly savage, capitalistic nature of the matter.

http://news.yahoo.com/conn-reaches-deal-tough-gun-laws-newtown-221504941.html,,[],Conn. reaches deal on tough gun laws after Newtown,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut lawmakers announced a deal Monday on what they called some of the toughest gun laws in the country that were proposed after the December mass shooting in the state, including a ban on new high-capacity ammunition magazines like the ones used in the massacre that left 20 children and six educators dead.

The proposal includes new registration requirements for existing magazines that carry 10 or more bullets, something of a disappointment for some family members of Newtown victims who wanted an outright ban on the possession of all high-capacity magazines and traveled to the state Capitol on Monday to ask lawmakers for it.

The package also creates what lawmakers said is the nation's first statewide dangerous weapon offender registry, creates a new ""ammunition eligibility certificate,"" imposes immediate universal background checks for all firearms sales, and extends the state's assault weapons ban to 100 new types of firearms and requires that a weapon have only one of several features in order to be banned.

The newly banned weapons could no longer be bought or sold in Connecticut, and those legally owned already would have to be registered with the state, just like the high-capacity magazines.

""No gun owner will lose their gun,"" said House Minority Leader Lawrence Cafero Jr., a Norwalk Republican. ""No gun owner will lose their magazines.""

The bill also addresses mental health and school security measures.

The shooting Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School reignited the gun debate in the country and led to calls for increased gun control legislation on the federal and state levels. While some other states, including neighboring New York, have strengthened their gun laws, momentum has stalled in Congress, whose members were urged by President Barack Obama last week not to forget the shooting and to capitalize on the best chance in years to stem gun violence.

Connecticut should be seen as an example for lawmakers elsewhere, said Senate President Donald E. Williams Jr., a Brooklyn Democrat.

Story continues

""In Connecticut, we've broken the mold,"" he said. ""Democrats and Republicans were able to come to an agreement on a strong, comprehensive bill. That is a message that should resound in 49 other states and in Washington, D.C. And the message is: We can get it done here and they should get it done in their respective states and nationally in Congress.""

The proposal was revealed to rank-and-file lawmakers Monday after weeks of bipartisan, closed-door negotiations among legislative leaders. A vote was expected Wednesday in the General Assembly, where Democrats control both chambers, making passage all but assured. The bill would then be sent to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who has helped lead efforts to strengthen the state's gun laws but has not yet signed off on the proposed legislation.

Earlier in the day on Monday, Malloy voiced support for the Newtown families and their desire to ban the possession of large-capacity magazines.

Ron Pinciaro, executive director of Connecticut Against Gun Violence, said his group will live with the lawmakers' decision not to ban them as other states have done. He said the leaders made their decision based on what was politically feasible.

""We have to be satisfied. There are still other things that we want, we'll be back for in later sessions,"" he said. ""But for now, it's a good thing.""

Robert Crook, executive director of the Connecticut Coalition of Sportsmen, contended the bill would not have changed what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary School, where the gunman fired off 154 shots with a Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle within five minutes. He went through six 30-round magazines, though half were not completely empty, and police said he had three other 30-round magazines in addition to one in the rifle.

""They can register magazines and do all the rest of this stuff. It isn't going to do anything,"" he said.

Gun owners, who've packed public hearings at the state Capitol in recent months, voicing their opposition to various gun control measures, are concerned they've been showing up ""for virtually nothing"" after learning about the bill, Crook said.

""Clearly we've made our point,"" Crook said. ""But I don't know what anybody can do at this point in time.""

Six relatives of Newtown victims visited the Capitol on Monday, asking lawmakers to ban existing high-capacity magazines. Some handed out cards with photographs of their slain children.

Allowing magazines that carry 10 or more bullets to remain in the hands of gun owners would leave a gaping loophole in the law, said Mark Barden, whose 7-year-old son, Daniel, was killed in the shooting.

""It doesn't prevent someone from going out of the state to purchase them and then bring them back. There's no way to track when they were purchased, so they can say, 'I had this before,'"" Barden said. ""So it's a big loophole.""

Barden and other victims' family members who visited the statehouse earlier on Monday did not immediately respond to messages seeking their reactions to the agreement.

Jake McGuigan, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which is based in Newtown, said he wouldn't comment on the proposal until he saw it in the writing, but he questioned the mechanics of a registry for magazines.

""How will they register a magazine? It seems a little weird,"" he said.

However, both surveys found that support for stricter laws remains higher than it was before the Newtown shooting.

In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, 48 percent of Americans said they think gun laws should be made more strict, while 16 percent said they should be made less strict and 29 percent said they preferred no change. Support for stricter gun laws in the poll is down from a high of 60 percent in a YouGov/Economist poll conducted in January, weeks after the Newtown shooting.

Likewise, a Gallup poll released Friday found that support for stricter gun laws has fallen from a high of 58 percent after the Newtown shooting to 49 percent now. Both the Gallup poll and the HuffPost/YouGov poll were conducted Sept. 17 and 18, after the Monday deaths of 13 people in the shooting at Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.

Although support for stricter gun laws was down in both surveys from the rates seen just after the Newtown shooting, it has not fallen to levels seen before that shooting. The most recent Gallup and YouGov polls conducted before the Newtown shooting both found support for stricter gun laws below 45 percent.

Some policies supported by advocates of stricter gun laws still receive broad support -- most notably universal background checks. A HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in August found that 79 percent of Americans support universal background checks, including for gun shows and private sales. However, overall support for stricter laws has shown a marked decline over the past 25 years. Two major school shootings -- Columbine and Newtown -- have reversed that trend, but only temporarily.

In accordance with the longer-term trend against support for tightening gun laws, the post-Newtown bump in support never reached the same level that it did after Columbine.

Following other mass shootings, including the recent shooting in Washington, polls have found little evidence of anything more than fleeting changes in opinion on gun laws. A HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted a month ago, before the Navy Yard shooting, found that 49 percent of Americans said they support stricter gun laws -- almost identical to the 48 percent who said so in the most recent HuffPost/YouGov poll.

Both the latest HuffPost/YouGov poll and the Gallup poll were conducted before the shooting Thursday in Chicago in which 13 people were injured, including a 3-year-old boy who was shot in the head.

Fifty-nine percent of respondents to the HuffPost/YouGov poll said they had ""heard a lot"" about the Navy Yard shooting. In contrast, a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in the days after the Newtown school shooting found that 70 percent said they had heard a lot about that shooting.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll also found that many Americans don't think stricter gun laws will prevent future mass shootings. Forty percent said stricter laws would help, but 52 percent said changing things won't make a difference.

And when it comes to ways to reduce the likelihood of future violence, many people didn't look to gun laws. By a 57 percent to 29 percent margin, the HuffPost/YouGov poll found that most people think better mental health care is more likely to prevent future mass shootings than stricter gun laws. Similarly, the Gallup poll found that 48 percent of Americans place a ""great deal"" of blame for mass shootings on the ""failure of the mental health system to identify individuals who are a danger to others,"" compared to 40 percent who said the same of ""easy access to guns.""

On the other hand, the HuffPost/YouGov survey showed little sympathy for the argument frequently made by gun-rights advocates that people carrying guns would lead to lower gun violence. A plurality of respondents to the poll rejected that argument, saying by a 44 percent to 38 percent margin that stricter gun laws were more likely to prevent mass shootings than allowing more people to carry guns for protection. Just after the Newtown shooting, respondents said the same by a 46 percent to 34 percent margin.
