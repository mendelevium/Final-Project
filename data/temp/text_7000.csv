Cohen'],Group: Northeastern Illinois president retaliated against professor,"""To see that decision reversed at the president's level, in the way it occurred, with very little justification for her decision, was a serious departure from the AAUP guidelines,"" said Rebecca Williams, an English professor at the University of Central Arkansas and a member of the AAUP investigating committee. ""Not that reversals can't happen, but it must be for a compelling reason.""



Hahs' stated reasons for Boyle's rejection were that he did not meet a deadline for filing a plan regarding student advising and that he did not cooperate adequately with colleagues and students. For example, Boyle was accused of steering students to study linguistics instead of Teaching English as a Second Language in his role as a student adviser, according to the AAUP report.



The AAUP said neither reason was credible and instead concluded that the president was retaliating against Boyle for his role in a dispute between faculty in the departments of linguistics and TESL. The dispute, including the decision to split the disciplines into two distinct programs, preceded the no confidence vote against Hahs.



The linguistics faculty members were among those who voted against the president, though Boyle did not participate.



The NEIU administration, in a response to the report, said it would not detail reasons for Boyle's tenure denial because it was ""confidential personnel information."" It said the university ""strongly disagrees with virtually every aspect"" of the report. It also noted that the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board previously ruled that there was no retaliatory action against Boyle.



""The committee proved all-too-ready to interpret the University's commitment to preserving the confidentiality of its personnel decisions as an admission of retaliatory or bad motives on the part of the University or even the Board of Trustees,"" according to the university's response. ""The University takes the strongest possible exception to the committee's highly personalized, misguided attacks.""



Boyle's last day at the university was May 31. He taught courses on grammar, syntax and Native American languages. He lives in Oak Park and is looking for a university job.



""This report is really vindication that I did not do anything wrong,"" Boyle said. ""One of the problems, if you are denied tenure, there is always in the back of everyone's mind, this sliver of doubt that there must have been something. The AAUP report shows there is absolutely nothing that I did wrong.""

http://news.yahoo.com/colorado-halloween-costume-ban-125854491.html,,[],"CU-Boulder urges students not to wear 'offensive' Halloween costumes, including cowboys","The University of Colorado at Boulder is urging students not to wear Halloween costumes that fuel cultural stereotypes and could be deemed racist or offensive.



""If you are planning to celebrate Halloween by dressing up in a costume, consider the impact your costume decision may have on others in the CU community,"" Christian Gonzales, CU's dean of students, wrote in a letter. ""Making the choice to dress up as someone from another culture, either with the intention of being humorous or without the intention of being disrespectful, can lead to inaccurate and hurtful portrayals of other peoples' cultures.""



According to Gonzales, CU students have chosen costumes that ""included blackface or sombreros/serapes,"" overly sexualized ""geishas,"" ""squaws"" and stereotypes such as cowboys and Indians. They have also hosted ""offensively-themed parties,"" including ""ghetto,"" ""white trash/hillbilly"" and ""sex work.""



The parties, she wrote, ""reinforce negative representations of cultures as being associated with poverty.""



Last year, a Penn State sorority was put on probation after throwing a Mexican-themed party where guests dressed up in sombreros, mustaches and ponchos.



""How any constituent groups or individuals in the University could behave with such insensitivity or unawareness is a question we must both ask and answer,"" Penn State President Rodney Erickson wrote in an open letter to the Penn State community.



CU is hoping to avoid a similar situation.



""CU-Boulder values freedom of expression and creativity both in and outside of the classroom,"" Gonzales added. ""The CU community also values inclusiveness, respect and sensitivity. While everyone has the freedom to be expressive, we also encourage you to celebrate that you are a part of a vibrant, diverse CU community that strives toward respecting others.""



A university spokesman told Campus Reform the school supported the letter.



""When you dress up as a cowboy, and you have your sheriff badge on and a big cowboy hat, that's not a representation of a cowboy,"" Bronson Hilliard, the spokesman, said. ""That's kind of a crude stereotype.""



CU is not the first school to discourage ""offensive"" Halloween costumes.



Just last month, officials at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities sent students a similar letter.



""Please keep in mind that certain Halloween costumes inappropriately perpetuate racial, cultural, and gender stereotypes,"" the letter, signed by the dean of students, read. ""Although it may not be the intent, these costumes, and choosing to wear them, can depict identities in ways that are offensive or hurtful to others.""



The letter did not specify which costumes it deemed inappropriate. But Mike Schmit, the school's undergraduate student body president, said the message was clear: Use common sense.



“As a student, I think you’re better off erring on the side of not dressing like something that can be questionable,” Schmit told the Minnesota Star-Tribune. “Cowboys, for instance — totally fine. Indians — not totally fine.”"

http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-07-10/news/ct-oped-0710-page-20130710_1_racist-blacks-whites,2013-07-10 00:00:00,['Clarence Page'],Are blacks more racist than whites?,"A new poll suggests that Americans, including black Americans, tend to think blacks are more racist than whites or Hispanics. I don't think we are. We only sound like it sometimes.

The poll by the conservative-leaning Rasmussen Reports finds a larger minority of Americans, 37 percent, think most black Americans are racist compared with the 15 percent of the respondents who think most white Americans are racist and the 18 percent who think that about Hispanic-Americans.

I expected the numbers to fall heavily along racial and partisan lines, and they do. For example, 49 percent of conservatives consider most blacks to be racist compared with21 percent of liberals. Considering how many of today's conservatives tend to hear any racial grievance as ""playing the race card,"" I'm not surprised.

What defies the usual stereotypes is the sizable minority of blacks, 31 percent, who agreed with the 38 percent of whites in the poll who think most blacks are racist. That's higher than the 24 percent of blacks (and 10 percent of whites) who think most whites are racist.

That stereotype-shattering result might suggest that we black folks have some work to do in cleaning up our own prejudices. Understood. But what? The poll offers not a clue.

For starters, it doesn't define ""racist,"" even though there is hardly a more abused, misused and overused word in the English language than the R-word.

Two major misunderstandings make a mess of today's race debates. One, our racial attitudes are based on our personal experiences and all of our experiences are very different. Two, everybody carries different definitions in their heads of what racism is.

Merriam-Webster's online dictionary lists two definitions. One is ""a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race."" The other is simply ""racial prejudice or discrimination.""

But there's at least one other definition, widely believed among black folks, that touched off an uproar after filmmaker Spike Lee expressed it in a July 1991 Playboy magazine interview: ""Black people can't be racist, he said. ""Racism is an institution.""

Although ""black people can be prejudiced,"" Lee allowed, we ""don't have the power"" to enforce the sweeping institutional racism that perpetuates social, economic and political inequality. Maybe not, I say, but we're moving up.

Lee's argument was easier to make before African-Americans gained as much institutional power and influence as some of us are beginning to achieve, all the way up to the White House.

As we aspire to full equality, I believe we need to hold ourselves as accountable as we hold Paula Deen, Don Imus, Michael ""Kramer"" Richards and every other racial gaffe-maker.

But that's not always easy. What we say can be quite culturally different from what other people want to hear.

Remember, for example, the blowback last year after President Barack Obama framed the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in personal terms by saying, ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.""

""Disgraceful,"" fumed Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich. ""We should all be horrified no matter what the ethnic background."" Of course. Obviously the president didn't mean to say otherwise.

But, when even Obama gets slammed for an innocent tribute after all of his years of diligently playing by the rules of today's racial etiquette, it is no wonder so many people think black folks are racist.

Yet, as the poll results hint, it is no secret that the black community has to contend with its own internal racism too. I recall, for example, how one of my son's black high school classmates responded when I asked whether he detected any racism in today's youths. Yes, he said, ""The blacks girls get mad when they see you dancing with a white girl."" Ah, yes. Race, like sex, is complicated, children.

Considering today's tragic shortage of marriageable black males, I can't help but sympathize with those girls. They didn't create this world. They're probably just imitating us, their elders.

I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly ten years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit. After significant soul searching, I have decided to suspend operations. I wish that I could legally share with you the events that led to my decision. I cannot. I feel you deserve to know what’s going on--the first amendment is supposed to guarantee me the freedom to speak out in situations like this. Unfortunately, Congress has passed laws that say otherwise. As things currently stand, I cannot share my experiences over the last six weeks, even though I have twice made the appropriate requests.

What’s going to happen now? We’ve already started preparing the paperwork needed to continue to fight for the Constitution in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. A favorable decision would allow me resurrect Lavabit as an American company.

This experience has taught me one very important lesson: without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would _strongly_ recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States.

A bill that would criminalize ""revenge porn"" — nude or sexual photos, generally of former wives or girlfriends, posted online by an angry ex — could pave the way for other states to adopt similar laws, putting perpetrators in jail for six months if convicted a first time, and up to a year for repeat violations. The bill, already approved by the California Senate, is expected to go to the state Assembly as soon as this week, despite concerns from some lawmakers and experts who fear it could curtail First Amendment rights.

""It's traumatized real victims; it's a growing problem,"" California state Sen. Anthony Cannella, told NBC News. ""Technology moves much faster than our laws,"" said Cannella, a Republican, who authored the legislation. ""When we identify a problem, it's our responsibility to deal with it.""

If passed by the Assembly, SB 255 will go to Gov. Jerry Brown for approval. It's not clear whether Brown will support it. ""Generally, we do not comment on pending legislation,"" Brown press spokesman Evan Westrup told NBC News.

One supporter with whom Cannella has been working is Holly Jacobs, a Florida woman who founded End Revenge Porn after her own nightmare with the issue began more than four years ago.

Like many other couples, Jacobs and her boyfriend had private photos of intimate moments — photos not meant for public consumption. After their breakup, Jacobs saw her photos plastered everywhere on the Web, including on Facebook and several revenge porn sites. Her email address was part of what was shared, ""so I had harassing emails constantly coming in,"" she told TODAY's Matt Lauer in May. ""My work location was posted up and there, so I was terrified. I was so afraid that someone would physically stalk me.""

In the era of instant uploads, a slimy sub-industry of sites have emerged that are dedicated solely to such ""revenge porn"" shots and videos. It has become a money-making ""sport,"" of which one of the most notorious players is Hunter Moore, who was under FBI investigation for his controversial site, Is Anyone Up.

Though the sites often include personal information about the victims, including names, email addresses and even links to their Facebook profiles, the sites themselves are protected from liability because of Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which says that websites and Internet service providers cannot be treated as a publisher for ""any information provided by another information content provider."" With little legal recourse, these victims are left feeling helpless and humiliated.

Jacobs' fear turned to anger, and she decided she would no longer be a victim. She filed criminal and civil charges against her ex. The ex, through his attorney, has denied the charges against him, contending he is just as much a victim as Jacobs, and that the reason the photos and video were shared is that his computer was hacked.

Those who might think, ""Well, you shouldn't have taken those photos ... "" aren't living in the real world of what has become, especially for a younger generation, a cultural-technological phenomenon as normal as tweeting and texting.

""It’s absolutely just a new version of victim blaming,"" Jacobs said in May. ""What I would say to victims when they hear that is, just hold on to that little voice inside of you that says, 'This is not right.' What's happening to me is not OK, and there need to be laws in place against this.""

The California legislation, Jacobs told NBC News, ""is so important because it has the potential to set a precedent for other states considering to criminalize revenge porn.""

Precedents and objections

The state that comes closest to doing that now is New Jersey, which since 2003 has had an invasion-of-privacy law aimed at video voyeurs, people who secretly videotape others naked or having sex without their consent, according to a spokesman for the Office of the Attorney General in that state.



That law was one of those used to prosecute Rutgers University student Dharun Ravi, found guilty last year after setting up a webcam to spy on his gay roommate, Tyler Clementi, in 2010. Ravi livestreamed the video and tweeted about his roommates's activities. Clementi, 18, committed suicide after learning about the public humiliation.

""Legislators did not discuss the issue of 'revenge porn' in passing this law"" in 2003, Peter Aseltine, a spokesman for the New Jersey attorney general's office, told NBC News. ""Nonetheless, the language of the statute is quite broad and arguably applies to allow prosecution of an individual in a 'revenge porn' situation.""

Other revenge porn law efforts could soon be underway in Texas, Wisconsin and Georgia, Jacobs said.

While most everyone will agree that the revenge porn practice is reprehensible, crafting legislation that doesn't inadvertently restrict free speech is the challenge.

In Florida, where Jacobs lives, an attempt at a revenge porn law failed this year partly because of concerns the way the law was written could interfere with free speech. Jacobs cited another concern: a requirement that personal information, such as the victim's name and email address, also be posted as part of the photos or videos shared.

""I'm sure the revenge porn posters would have easily found a way around this,"" she told NBC News. ""Our personal information is already posted when our faces are in these pictures.""

Florida State Sen. David Simmons and state Rep. Tom Goodson, both Republicans, plan to try again with a new bill with different wording next spring when the legislature is back in session.

Jeff Hermes, director of the Digital Media Law Project at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, said a ""balance needs to be struck properly,"" and he is not sure the California law will do that.

""You need to be extraordinarily careful in criminalizing privacy law because of the risk you're going to deter legitimate speech,"" he told NBC News. ""With the California bill, I don't see an exemption here for material that's legitimately newsworthy.""

Take for example, he said, ""circumstances where photographs exist of a political candidate who has run their campaign on their squeaky-clean image,"" but there are photographs of that candidate in a compromising position. ""The distribution of these photos could indicate (to voters) that candidate might be lying about their past.""

The revenge porn bill, Hermes said, is ""responding to a significant concern, and I don't want to downplay that. It is a law in a field which is already heavily regulated — privacy — and where there are court remedies. But the question is whether the criminal penalties are necessary to achieve the aims already provided by existing law.""

Only one California state senator, Leland Yee, a Democrat, voted against SB 255 when it came before the senate last month. His reason: ""First Amendment protections are fundamental to our free society,"" he said in a statement to NBC News. ""While I appreciate the intent of this legislation, I feel it was too broadly drawn and could potentially be used inappropriately to censor free speech.""

Hillsdale College President Larry Arnn described minority students as ""dark ones"" during a state legislature subcommittee hearing regarding the adoption of Common Core State Standards.

While testifying against the Common Core, which have been adopted in more than 40 states in an effort to standardize education, Arnn said he took issue with the idea of government interfering with educational institutions and went on to describe a letter he had received from the Department of Education shortly after becoming president at Hillsdale. The letter, he told the committee, said his college ""violated the standards for diversity because we didn't have enough dark ones, I guess, is what they meant.""

According to Michigan-focused news site MLive, lawmakers at the meeting immediately criticized Arnn for using “offensive” language, but he did not apologize. Instead, Arnn went on to say: “The State of Michigan sent a group of people down to my campus, with clipboards ... to look at the colors of people’s faces and write down what they saw. We don’t keep records of that information. What were they looking for besides dark ones?""

A Michigan Department of Education spokesperson told the Detroit Free Press that officials visited Hillsdale in 1998 for a routine evaluation of the school’s teacher preparation program. During that visit, they noted the ethnicity of the students and faculty members in the program.

Several hours after Arnn made his initial statements, Hillsdale College issued an official apology. “No offense was intended by the use of that term except to the offending bureaucrats,"" read the statement, which was published by MLive. It further said that while Arnn was sorry if offense was taken, his greater concern “is the state-endorsed racism the story illustrates.""

Located in Hillsdale, Mich., the small liberal arts institution over which Arnn presides was founded in 1844. According to its website, the school ""was the first American college to prohibit in its charter any discrimination based on race, religion or sex, and became an early force for the abolition of slavery.” Hillsdale does not receive state or federal subsidies and avoids “federal mandates and control,” another page on its site says.

An alum told MLive he believes Arnn’s comments were misunderstood.

“I think this was Dr. Arnn’s way to indicate that he was offended with what they were doing in taking clipboards and walking around campus to record the color of students’ skin,” James Joseph, a 2010 graduate, told the outlet. “He’s a very magnanimous man with a generous and charitable spirit, but he doesn’t stand on public piety.”"

USA TODAY

Newly elected Republicans are %27conviction politicians%27 in the mold of Margaret Thatcher

Will he challenge Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor next year%3F Maybe.

%22We%27d have to know that we aren%27t encouraging the next wave of illegal immigration%2C%22 he says.

WASHINGTON — Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton isn't swayed by the bipartisan coalition that passed a comprehensive immigration bill in the Senate or the warnings by senior Republicans that the GOP needs to act on the issue to appeal to Latino voters.

And with that, the lanky freshman represents the significant hurdles facing efforts to craft immigration legislation that might possibly be able to pass both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

""The Senate approach is legalization first and enforcement later, maybe — but probably never,"" Cotton said in an interview with Capital Download, USA TODAY's weekly newsmaker video series. In views he says are widely shared among House Republicans, he opposes establishing a path to legal status for immigrants here illegally until U.S. borders are more secure and visa laws more strictly enforced.

""If they insist upon legalization before any of those steps, then it is not likely that we are going to pass real and valuable immigration reform this Congress,"" he says. He notes that Senate Democrats have said that establishing a path to citizenship for some of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally is essential to a bill.

His opposition to establishing a way to achieve legal status extends to the ""DREAMers,"" the young people who have grown up in the United States after being brought here by their parents.

""We'd have to know that we aren't encouraging the next wave of illegal immigration,"" he said. ""If you're a mom or dad and you see the opportunity that has been provided to someone else's child who took them to the United States illegally, to become a legal American and maybe a citizen, who wouldn't take that risk?""

Cotton, 36, has been in office for only six months, but he is part of a new breed of Republicans who haven't hesitated to challenge their own leadership, taking a harder line on some issues and being less willing to cut political deals.

""I do think that injection of new blood and kind of fresh thinking, as opposed to the old way of thinking, is good for Congress,"" he said. ""I saw that when I was in the Army. It's always good to get new privates and new lieutenants who are ready to go down-range and fight America's wars.""

The freshman and sophomore classes of Republican House members tend to be in the mold of former president Ronald Reagan and former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, Cotton said. Thatcher ""said she's not a consensus politician; she's a conviction politician. And you have a lot of people who were elected in 2010 and 2012 who truly are conviction politicians.""

Cotton is an Arkansas native, a graduate of Harvard University and Harvard Law School, and an Army veteran with tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. He's also a potential challenger next year to Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor. Republican hopes of regaining control of the Senate depend on winning Democratic-held seats in red states such as Arkansas.

""I do hear from a lot of Arkansans, frankly Democrats and Republicans alike, who encourage me to think about that race, and I'm grateful for that,"" Cotton said, ""but in the end, it will be prayerful consideration and deliberations with my family"" that determine his decision.

Gannett Washington Bureau

Proponents hope to attract 70 votes in the Senate to force the House to act

Opponents don%27t think the bill does enough to secure the border

Supporters aim to pass it before the July Fourth recess

WASHINGTON — As the Senate heads back into session Monday, it is poised to take up a sweeping immigration bill that would offer earned citizenship to many of the 11 million immigrants who entered the United States illegally before 2012.

Supporters of the bill crafted by the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" senators guided it to passage in the Senate Judiciary Committee last month while fending off amendments that would have broken apart their coalition of labor and business groups, Catholics and evangelical Christians, and law enforcement and civil rights' groups.

Now, proponents of the bill face an even tougher challenge: how to lure more Republicans to support the legislation without alienating Democrats and losing the support of key immigrant rights' groups.

""It's a balancing act,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration expert and professor of law at Cornell University Law School. ""The Gang of Eight has done a great job so far of walking that tightrope. Now we'll see whether they can continue to do so on the Senate floor.""

The Senate is expected to begin debating the bill by June 10. Supporters hope to pass it before the Fourth of July recess.

""The final bill won't be exactly what passed out of the committee,"" said Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who will manage the floor debate on the bill. ""The most important thing is to have a path to citizenship for the most people possible in a way that ultimately benefits and strengthens the United States of America.""

Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who is one of four Gang of Eight Republicans along with fellow Arizona Sen. John McCain, said he is worried about whether the bill can be amended to pick up enough Republican votes to create a show of force to House GOP leaders. Supporters of the bill are hoping to attract about 70 votes from the 100-member Senate.

""We can pass this out of the Senate,"" Flake said. ""The question is, can we get enough votes to convince the House to vote.""

Flake said he expects amendments from Republicans on border security and on government benefits and tax breaks for immigrants who gain legal status.

""There is a lot of dissatisfaction among Republicans that the border stuff is not tough enough, that there are no real triggers,"" said Tamar Jacoby, president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a coalition of business groups. ""There certainly are going to be people who are pushing for more teeth, different standards and meaningful triggers.""

The bill requires a 90% effectiveness rate for security along the entire Southwest border and prevents undocumented immigrants who are granted provisional legal status from receiving any federal means-tested public benefits such as welfare or Medicaid.

But conservative critics don't like the fact that undocumented immigrants would gain temporary legal status before all of the border requirements have to be met. And some want to deny the newly legalized immigrants any federal, state or local aid or tax breaks, even when they earn green cards and become permanent legal residents.

""This is a tricky period,"" said Frank Sharry, America's Voice, an immigrant rights group that supports the reform bill. ""If they (Gang of Eight senators) go too far in trying to placate Republicans and undermine the parts of the bill that brought the progressive coalition to the table, they could lose us.""

Specifically, immigrant rights leaders say they don't want border security requirements that are so rigid they are impossible to meet. If those requirements are tied to citizenship, then millions of people would remain here with no hope of ever becoming citizens or even legal permanent residents, immigrant rights leaders say.

""We already have a path to legality in this bill that is quite narrow, quite hard and quite long,"" said Clarissa Martinez, director of civic engagement and immigration at the National Council of La Raza. ""We are going to be vigilant about opposing any amendments that intend to make that path even harder because that might make citizenship unattainable.""

Cutting off all federal aid to newly legalized citizens could have unintended consequences, such as denying them disaster aid in the event of a powerful tornado or hurricane, Martinez said.

""We just went through this horrific tornado in Oklahoma,"" Martinez said. ""What happens if your house has been leveled, your job has been obliterated, one of your family members ends up in the hospital as the result of a tragic event? People need to be able to survive while they work and wait to become citizens.""

Groups that oppose increased immigration say there is no way to salvage the bill and that conservatives should work to defeat it rather than amend it.

""If the bill were to be essentially torn up and replaced with one that required E-Verify and border security and an entry-exit visa system before legalization, it would be less bad, but the Gang of Eight couldn't support that,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. The center opposes increased immigration and is a strong supporter of mandatory E-Verify, the electronic federal database that allows employers to check whether new hires are legally eligible to work in the United States. Arizona law already requires employers to use the system.

Krikorian said it's possible that liberals could end up killing the bill if they offer a controversial amendment to allow gay Americans to bring in their foreign partners on family reunification visas.

""I could see Republicans voting for it as a poison pill kind of thing,"" he said. ""But I doubt that (Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid will let it go that far. I think the Democrats have essentially told the gay rights groups that they need to hold off for now.""

Liberal Democrats also are expected to offer amendments that would continue to allow siblings and adult married children to immigrate to the U.S. on family reunification visas. Under the current bill, those family categories would be eliminated to allow for more employment-based visas sought by businesses and favored by many Republicans.

""What if your only family member is a sibling?"" Martinez said. ""We'd like to see more flexibility there before we do away with something that is tried and true and replace it with a new system.""

While many Democrats favor changes to help gay couples and reunite all family members, they are not expected to vote against the bill if those amendments fail.

""They see the larger goal of passing immigration reform as more important,"" Yale-Loehr said.

Jacoby said she doesn't think the bill will drastically change on the Senate floor, even though she and other business advocates would like to see an increase in the number of visas made available to lower-skilled workers. She cited the influence of the labor giant AFL-CIO, which seeks to protect American workers.

""There will be some drama, but I think a lot of it is locked in by the Gang of Eight,"" said Jacoby, whose organization is a national coalition of small- and medium-size-business owners that pushes for immigration reforms to benefit employers. ""They have a pretty protective approach, the Gang of Eight does, and they feel that if they change any of the labor stuff, the AFL will bolt, and that basically gives the AFL a trump card.""

The lobbyist for NumbersUSA, which opposes the bill, said she believes it will be defeated. The group is running TV ads nationwide saying the legislation would hurt U.S. citizens and legal residents at a time when 20 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed.

""I think the bill is in serious trouble,"" said Rosemary Jenks, government relations director for NumbersUSA, which opposes increased immigration. ""I don't think they have the 60 votes (needed to fend off a conservative filibuster). They are not going to get all 55 Democrats, especially the ones from red states. And I don't see them getting enough Republicans to make it to 60.""

But supporters of the bill say they don't see the strong anti-immigrant sentiment that they saw in 2007, when the last attempt at an immigration overhaul failed.

""This is totally different,"" said Jeff Hauser, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO, which is part of the coalition supporting the bill. ""It's not just that Latino and pro-immigration groups are stronger, there's just nothing going on on the other side. We're not seeing the big anti-immigration protests that we saw before.""

Leahy said both sides realize that Americans are fed up with the current system.

""The American people don't believe the status quo is working,"" he said. ""If senators are serious about fixing the problem, this bill will pass."""

Schmidt']",Judge Upholds N.S.A.’s Bulk Collection of Data on Calls,"Judge Pauley began his opinion with an anecdote. In the months before Sept. 11, he said, the N.S.A. intercepted seven calls made to a Qaeda safe house in Yemen from the United States. They were from Khalid al-Mihdhar, who was living in San Diego and would become one of the hijackers.

But the security agency “could not capture al-Mihdhar’s telephone number,” the judge wrote, and “N.S.A. analysts concluded mistakenly that al-Mihdhar was overseas and not in the United States.”

“Telephony metadata would have furnished the missing information and might have permitted the N.S.A. to notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the fact that al-Mihdhar was calling the Yemeni safe house from inside the United States,” Judge Pauley wrote.

Judge Leon, in Washington, took the opposite view, saying the government had failed to make the case that the program is needed to protect the nation. “The government does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the N.S.A.’s bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature,” he wrote.

The presidential review group took a middle ground, though it seemed to lean toward Judge Leon’s position. It said the security agency “believes that on at least a few occasions” the program “has contributed to its efforts to prevent possible terrorist attacks, either in the United States or somewhere else in the world.” But it added that its own review suggested that the program “was not essential to preventing attacks,” and that less intrusive measures would work.

The group recommended that bulk storage of telephone records by the government be halted in favor of “a system in which such metadata is held instead either by private providers or by a private third party.” Access to the data, it said, should require a court order.

The two judges did not limit their disagreements to how well the program worked. They also drew different conclusions about its constitutionality."

Peter Crane's slide captures the crowd in Washington on 28 August 1963

It is 50 years since the American civil rights leader Martin Luther King delivered his I Have a Dream speech [PDF format].

On 28 August 1963, more than 200,000 Americans joined a march on Washington demanding equal justice for all citizens under the law.

On that day, the inter-racial crowd heard Martin Luther King deliver his famous speech, predicting a time when freedom and equality for all would become a reality in the US.

Here people whose lives have been touched by that moment reflect and share their memories half a century on.

During the 50s and 60s black Americans in the South were born, lived, worked, socialised and died in communities that were separate and distinctly unequal from those of our white counterparts.

Although I was just a young girl at the time, I still have vivid memories of drinking out of Coloured Only fountains and going to a segregated school. Bus drivers instructed us to move to the back of the bus - even when there were no other passengers.

Despite this my parents were emphatic in their belief that, in America, if we worked hard and were good citizens anything and everything was possible. This conviction appeared to be in direct opposition to general expectations.

When Dr King came into our lives he expanded our horizons, fuelled our expectations, extended hope, and offered the nation a blueprint for enacting change.

In August of 1963, I joined the March on Washington with my parents. Having lived in the South and experienced all we had, we felt it was really important to be there and to show our support.

Jill was 17 when she joined the 1963 March on Washington

It was the most amazing experience because people there were so loving. We all felt as if we were one.

I can remember taking notes during King's stirring speech because even at the time it felt like a moment of history.

As far as the eye could see, well-meaning individuals, both black and white, linked arms and put their hearts into singing hopeful renditions of We Shall Overcome.

I remember thinking that surely everyone in the world would hear - and heed - Dr King's simple but powerful message of love, peace and social justice for all.

Sadly, on the evening of April 4 1968, when the shots rang out at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, it became apparent that there were those who had not.

For some time afterwards it felt as if those who love to hate had seized the day, and it was devastating. But that was now 50 years ago.

Looking back at that time, Dr King's legacy of personal sacrifice, unyielding courage and service to others, feels just as radical and empowering today as it did then.

I've been in a mixed-race marriage for 19 years and have two children, aged 13 and 10.

I am a product of the change that was set out in Martin Luther King's speech.

I am free to marry the man I love regardless of colour. I am free to raise my children to embrace who they are.

Denise says we are close to King's promise today

Every year on the anniversary of Dr King's famous speech, I watch a recording of it with my family. It brings tears to my eyes because it represents freedom.

It gives my children another perspective on their lives. It is a chance for them to see that there is something bigger than themselves.

The end of the speech sticks in my mind, when Dr King looks forward to a day when all God's children - of all races - will be free.

I grew up in Kentucky and the high school I went to was very conservative. I never interacted with anyone who was from another race.

But as I got older I met people from other cultures, races and backgrounds and it opened my eyes.

I feel I am able to live in a diverse community, attend a diverse church and send my children to a diverse school because a lot of people made sacrifices during those years.

When I watch Dr King's speech I feel he is making a promise about what will happen in the future. We've got a long way to go, but we are close to experiencing that promise today.

Many white residents of the city had hunkered down in their homes afraid it was going to be an occasion of violence and looting.

I wanted to be with the marchers, expressing solidarity with their aims - not hiding in my home.

Several things stand out in my mind about the march. One was the festival atmosphere, the overwhelming happiness of the crowd.

This was not an angry gathering, but a celebratory one.

What I remember above all is the warmth and friendliness around me. Maybe it was because it gladdened the hearts of some marchers to see young whites in solidarity with them.

Peter says people took a sense of moral power from King's speech.

Something enormously impressive was the seemingly endless procession of chartered buses, rolling down Pennsylvania Avenue past the Washington Monument, with signs proclaiming where they were from and where they were headed.

These people had taken their lives in their hands to drive through the South en route to Washington, with banners that made clear who they were and where they were going.

The cities named on the sides of the buses were a roll call of the places where the battle for civil rights was being fought out.

To anyone too young to remember it, it is hard to imagine just how segregated America was in those days, and what it meant on a day-to-day level.

I remember going to a birthday party when I was seven or eight years old. We were turned away from an amusement park because the birthday boy was an African-American child called Paul.

The thing that we took away from that day in 1963 was not one speech. It was a sense of moral power and political resolve - not just of leaders but of ordinary people - that was not going to be stopped.

The ""seemingly endless procession"" of chartered buses was impressive, says Peter.

I was 10 years old and living in Melbourne, Australia, when Martin Luther King intoned the words that electrified the thousands of marchers who had gathered in Washington.

I was too young to understand why my father - an Albanian-Kosovar intellectual - cried. I would have to wait several years to understand that King's dream was my father's dream, and that very soon, it would become mine.

My parents arrived in Australia after the Second World War. My father was exiled to a meat packing factory to feed his seven children.

We were not excluded because of colour but we were trapped by searing poverty. We lived in our own ""lonely island of poverty"" amid an ""ocean of material prosperity"".

Kimete's parents - pictured centre and right - moved to Australia in 1949

I have a very vivid memory of my first day of school.

When the teacher asked my name and my mother responded, the teacher shook her head and said, ""That's not going to do."" So my first experience of the world outside home was that even my name didn't fit.

My father, like King, had a dream for his children.

He had a dream that his children would one day live in a place where they would not be judged by the accents their parents could not lose or the distance that separated them from their ancestral home, but by the ""content of their character"".

My father realised the real limitations for us in Australia after my elder sister was unable to get a scholarship to university. In 1969 he took my family to Canada so we could have access to university education.

My father, like King, did not get to the mountaintop with his children - one a Harvard professor, another an award-winning reporter, another a pioneer in corporate social responsibility and yet another a director of an NGO devoted to bringing books to children.

But King's dream - my father's dream - continues to inspire us in all that we do.

We have come a long way from where we were when King made his speech.

But we still have some way to go before we get to the dream.

It depends where you are in the US. As a mixed-race person, I don't have any problems in New York City. When I lived in rural New Hampshire I would get funny looks from people.

Eden says all children should have the same opportunities

Some people would cross to the other side of the street when they saw me.

I had the opportunity to move away from racial stereotypes, to study to be a photographer and to travel.

That was partly because I was given the opportunity by an education foundation to go to a private boarding school.

In the neighbourhood I grew up in people were mainly black or from the West Indies. They were from poor backgrounds and they tended to stay poor.

At boarding school I was one of around eight students of colour. I remember when I grew my hair out people thought I was wearing a wig.

The other students made a lot of assumptions about us, imagining we all played basketball or liked certain types of music. Even the black students who had come from other countries were making these kind of assumptions about us.

So for me, the most important part of King's speech is where he says he wants his children to grow up in a country where they have the same opportunity as everyone else. We are not there yet.

The president, who has previous decried West as a “jackass” when the rapper famously upstaged Taylor Swift, was interviewed by David Blum for Kindle Singles.

In the interview, Obama spoke about the American Dream, which he opined used to include a good home, job, education and the possibility of higher education. However, he said that these days the likes of Kardashian and West had distorted the American Dream in a way that he believes negatively affects the younger generation.

“I do think what’s shifted is a notion that the wealthier you are, the more conspicuous consumption you engage in. The more successful you are, the more society should stay out of your way as you pursue the bigger house or the fancier jet or the bigger yacht,” Obama said.

“Were there things that all of us might have liked to have? Sure. But partly, I think, there also has been a shift in culture. We weren’t exposed to things we didn’t have in the same way kids these days are. There was not that window into the lifestyles of the rich and famous,” the president said. “Kids weren’t monitoring every day what Kim Kardashian was wearing, or where Kanye West was going on vacation, and thinking that somehow that was the mark of success.”

Jenner, for one, took what he said to heart.

On the Friday episode of her talk show “Kris,” the Kardashian momager, 57, addressed Obama’s quotes regarding her daughter and her daughter’s boyfriend’s affluence with co-host and E! personality Terrence Jenkins.

HOTOS: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West

That’s when Jenner put on her Oprah Winfrey hat.

“‘They’re influencing a generation of youngsters to be obsessed with wealth and celebrity,’” mama bear said, interpreting Obama’s statements.

Kardashian, 32, and West, 36, famously spent $11 million on a 10,000-square-foot home in Bel-Air in January while Kardashian was pregnant. But Kardashian and her daughter North, who was born June 15, is currently residing at her mother’s sprawling Hidden Hills home while she and West tear down and custom rebuild their mansion. They’re reportedly gutting it and taking the Italian-style villa to up to 14,000 square feet.

“It’s really great that people aspire to get a great job... but I wasn’t aware that you could only set the bar so high and that we could only dream so big,” Jenner said after reading the president’s quotes. “I was taught: Dream big, work hard and you could have whatever you wanted.”

The American Dream, ladies and gentleman, as told by the Kardashians.

“I bet the president has some friends with 10,000-square-foot houses and you probably wouldn’t mind going over there, Mr. President while you were asking them to have a party for you when you were campaigning for dollars to run for president,” Jenner said, referring to high-netting, star-studded fundraising parties thrown for him by the likes of A-listers George Clooney and Sarah Jessica Parker.

Jenner said that she thought that it was “kind of remarkable in and of itself” that the president even mentioned her overexposed kin in the first place, yet she still continued.

“I find it so odd that he’s picking on Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. Well, Kanye West, first of all, doesn’t go on vacation. Ever,” Jenner said. “And Kim Kardashian is the hardest-working young lady in the world. She never sleeps, she never stops, she never slows down and works so hard for what she’s got.”

PHOTOS: Kim Kardashian’s relationships and flings

Indeed, Kardashian, the daughter of late O.J. Simpson defense lawyer Robert Kardashian, rose to fame following the bombshell appearance of a homemade sex tape made with R&B singer Ray J. She and her family have worked to move away from that initial notoriety by building a media empire through fashion, cosmetics and their juggernaut reality TV series “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” and its many spinoffs. (Jenner also made the point that they were doing their part to keep the unemployment rate low, saying “KUWTK” alone employs “hundreds and hundreds of people.”)

The enormous family has remained a mainstay in the public eye (and on this particular blog) because of their glitzy lifestyle and accessibility on television and social media, constantly addressing fans and sharing big moments in their private lives. Cases in point, eldest sister Kourtney Kardashian televised part of the birth of her first child and Khloe Kardashian’s whirlwind wedding to ball player Lamar Odom and Kim Kardashian’s nuptials to ball player Kris Humphries were both documented and broadcast as E! special events.

The media maelstrom following Kim Kardashian’s 72-day marriage and extended divorce proceedings from Humphries somewhat tarnished the brand, but Kim’s candid take on the topic and perpetual projects swiftly brushed family scandals under a very luxurious rug. Kardashian’s subsequent romance with the vainglorious “I am a God” rapper was seen as a supernova in the pop culture zeitgeist.

Surely, young America (and E!'s target demographic) paid attention then as it continues to pay attention now. Which brings us back to Jenner talking about Obama.

“I started thinking about her 10,000-square-foot house,” Jenner said. “I thought, wow, her job affords her to live in a 10,000-square-foot house. And I think, if I’m not mistaken, that Mr. President’s job affords him to live in a 55,000-square-foot house. So basically my house would fit in his entry.”

“I just don’t think it’s such a bad thing to want to be our best and do our best and have nice things.”

Perhaps.

But the mainstream cachet this family yields should be questioned now and again. If Kardashian sticking out her tongue in a three-second video could make a flurry of headlines this past week, perhaps we’ve been grossly under-estimating the influence of this American dynasty.

In both films hints of excess in service to virtue are readily cheered and all opposition made to look corrupt and worse.

But this vision of heroism does not do full historical justice to either the Civil War or Lincoln. We may like our heroes unchained, prepared to transcend ordinary restrictions, but history is another matter. What were the ends sought? How were they pursued? And what effects did that have? The Library of Congress exhibition tries to see the conflict from different perspectives. Its displays of over 200 items, we are told, “attest to the valor, sacrifices, emotions and accomplishments of those in both the North and South whose lives were affected by the bitter conflict of 1861-65.”

The war, it explains, “unfolds between two opposing ideologies,” with the Union opposed by a “confederacy of slaveholding states true to their own interpretation of the U.S. Constitution.” It is as if this show, presented by a national institution in the nation’s capital (with Cheryl Regan as exhibition director), wants to avoid — even after 150 years — any hint of partisanship.

At first it seems as if the exhibition will try to seesaw between sides, creating a kind of symmetry. The American Civil War Center in Richmond, Va., does something like that, shading the conflict with hints of relativism. And there remain important differences between Northern narratives and those of many Southern museums. But at the Library of Congress the lineaments remain clear."

Thomas Perez would replace Hilda Solis

Perez heads the Justice Department%27s civil rights division

Perez says he will reach out to senators on both sides of the aisle

WASHINGTON -- President Obama has picked the Justice Department's top civil rights enforcer, Thomas Perez, to be his next Labor secretary.

Obama noted that under Perez, the civil rights division settled the three largest fair-lending cases for unfair mortgage lending practices. Perez also challenged voter identification laws in South Carolina and Texas and substantially increased enforcement of human trafficking laws.

Perez has a long career in public service. Before he was appointed to run the civil rights division at Justice in October 2009, Perez was chosen by Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley to head the state's Department of Labor. He also served on the Montgomery County (Md.) Council, spent time as an aide to Sen. Edward Kennedy, and spent nearly 12 years in federal government. Most of that time was spent as an attorney in the civil rights division.

""Tom's knowledge and experience will make him an outstanding secretary of Labor,"" Obama said. ""We are going to have to work very hard to make sure that folks find jobs with good wages and good benefits. We got to make sure that our veterans returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan have a chance to put their incredible skills and leadership to work at home. We need to build an immigration system that works for every employee and every family and every business. I am confident that Tom is going to be able to promote economic growth, but also make sure that that growth is broad-based.""

His nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, is expected to face tough scrutiny from Republicans following a Justice Department Inspector General report released last week that was sharply critical of Perez.

The report determined that Perez gave incomplete testimony to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in 2010 when he testified Justice's political leadership was not involved in the decision to dismiss three of the four defendants in a lawsuit the George W. Bush administration brought against the New Black Panther Party.

""We found that Perez's testimony did not reflect the entire story regarding the involvement of political appointees,"" the report said. ""We did not find that Perez intentionally misled the commission. Nevertheless, given he was testifying as a department witness before the commission, we believe that Perez should have sought more details.""

Following the release of the report last week, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, was sharply critical of Perez. On Monday, Grassley raised questions about Perez's role in persuading officials St. Paul, Minn. to drop a lawsuit seeking to limit fair housing claims there.

""Nominating somebody who is in the middle of a congressional investigations show the president isn't very serious about working together,"" Grassley said. ""I'm looking forward to hearing his testimony, because there are a lot of tough questions he should answer for the American people, including those regarding St. Paul.""

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala, on Monday called Perez ""the wrong man for this job.""

Sessions noted that Perez previously served as president of the board of Case de Maryland, an immigrant advocacy group that provides day labor centers and other services in the Washington, D.C., suburbs. Sessions charged the organization is ""a fringe advocacy group that has instructed illegal immigrants on how to escape detection, and also promoted illegal labor sites and driver's licenses for illegal immigrants.""

""This is an unfortunate and needlessly divisive nomination. The top priority of the secretary of Labor should be to create jobs and higher wages for American workers,"" Sessions said. ""But Mr. Perez has aggressively sought ways to allow the hiring of more illegal workers.""

A few of Obama's second-term Cabinet and agency appointees have already faced tough confirmations. Chuck Hagel was grilled about past comments he made about Israel during the hearings over his Defense nomination, and CIA Director John Brennan's confirmation was slowed over questions about the agency's drone program.

United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice, whom Obama was considering to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton at the State Department, removed herself from consideration after facing blistering criticism from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

The senators blasted Rice for inaccurate comments she made in the days after the Sept. 11, 2012, terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi that left Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans dead.

In brief remarks Monday, Perez struck a conciliatory tone and said he will reach out to senators on both sides of the aisle to talk about the Labor Department's ""key role in protecting and growing the middle class.""

""Over my career, I have found that true progress is possible if you keep an open mind, listen to all sides and focus on results,"" Perez said.

If confirmed, Perez, 51, will replace Hilda Solis, who announced her resignation from the post in January.

The pick could also ease pressure on Obama from Hispanic groups who have been urging the president to appoint a Latino to a Cabinet level position after the departures of Solis and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, who also recently announced he was stepping down.

""Thomas Perez is an eminently qualified public servant who has the professional experience and compelling personal story to serve at the highest levels of the administration,"" said Janet Murguía, president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights group. ""Mr. Perez's impeccable legal background in civil rights issues, particularly workers' rights, as well as his decades of service as an elected and appointed official make him uniquely prepared to address the policy complexities and management responsibilities at the Department of Labor.""

Democrats and labor leaders also praised the pick of Perez.

""At a time when our politics tilts so heavily toward corporations and the very wealthy, our country needs leaders like Tom Perez to champion the cause of ordinary working people,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.

Perez also has a remarkable personal biography. He is a Harvard educated lawyer and the son of immigrants from the Dominican Republic. His father died when he was 12, and he worked his way through undergraduate years at Brown University by working in a warehouse and as a garbage collector.



""His story reminds us of this country's promise,"" Obama said. ""If you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are, where you come from, what your last name is, you can make it if you try. Tom has made protecting that promise for everybody the cause of his life."""

But the swollen, chaotic state of California's 33 prisons -- 18 of which operate at more than 180 percent capacity -- may lead to another unconstitutional policy: race-based lockdowns. The California system is currently under fire for managing violence among the massive numbers of inmates by confining whole races of individuals to their cells for 24 hours a day during lockdowns that can last for years.

""It's incredible that this is happening in the 21st century,"" said Rebekah Evenson, the attorney for the Prison Law Office, which filed a class action lawsuit against the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation last month on behalf of inmates claiming they were victims of race-based lockdowns. ""The level of violence and level of lockdowns are very closely tied to overcrowding,"" said Evenson.

But the overcrowding does not justify controlling populations based on race, Evenson argued. California is the only state in the country to adopt this type of policy, and it imposes approximately one race-based lockdown each day in one of the system's 30 male prisons, the suit alleged.

During these types of lockdowns, usually the result of a fight between a gang of one race and a gang of another race, all members of each race are confined to their cells for 24 hours a day, regardless of whether they were involved in the incident. This means that many inmates can find themselves denied exercise, educational programs, family visits and even sunlight for months at a time for merely being the same race as an inmate involved in a fight.

The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation denies they have an institutional policy of race-based lockdowns. However, multiple documents from the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitations Appeals Branch ""note that the CDCR policy is that when there is an incident involving any race, all inmates of that race are locked up.""

""There is no policy,"" said Levance Quinn, public information officer for Sacramento State Prison, where currently about 500 inmates remain on 24-hour lockdown following a riot on Friday. ""But I understand from the outside looking in how someone could confuse that,"" he said.

Quinn explained that gang fights happen all the time and that multiple gangs exist within each racial or ethnic group. Those types of fights -- when one white gang fights another white gang, for example -- aren't big security issues. The problem occurs when members of two different racial groups fight, said Quinn, because prison culture dictates that inmates must stick up for their fellow brothers.

""If someone from a black gang fights someone from a white gang, then all the blacks and all the whites get involved. So then you have to lock everyone down to make sure it's safe,"" he said.

This type of situation occurred last year in Sacramento, leading to a 24-hour lockdown that ran from Jan. 19 to Dec. 11 for every black and southern Hispanic inmate in the prison section known as B Facility, a building that houses 500 inmates in all. (Northern and southern Hispanics are often in opposing gangs, and CDCR sometimes divides the ethnic group into these two categories.) This lockdown ran for so long, the prison arranged for the two groups to make alternate trips to the yard to get exercise.

Quinn said that even though black and southern Hispanic inmates who had nothing to do with the fight were on lockdown for nearly a year, it's not indicative of an institutional race-based policy.

""It's not based on their race; it's based on these two knuckleheads that got in a fight,"" said Quinn. ""It's really hard to explain to the outside world,"" he added.

A blue sign hangs outside the wall of one of Evenson's defendants, Hanif Abdullah, jailed at Solano. It denotes a black inmate, and Abdullah has been confined to his cell for 24-hour lockdowns that applied to all black inmates five times in the last two years, Evenson's suit alleges.

Abdullah's cell, which he shares with one other inmate and is so small the two can barely stand up at the same time, has one window that looks into the interior of the dormitory. Each day during his confinement, which lasted a total of approximately six months over the course of two years, Abdullah watched the rest of the prison world go about their business just by virtue of not being black.

""He could hear staff announcing the privileges available to other races, 'School release for everyone except those [blacks] on lockdown,' 'Yard release for everyone except those [blacks] on lockdown,'"" the suit reads. ""Mr. Abdullah suffered from the indignity, humiliation, and inhumanity, of the stark race discrimination.""

(Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Tuesday accused two major companies of indirectly discriminating against African Americans by using criminal background checks to screen out workers.

The commission said BMW effectively fired 70 black employees with criminal histories from a facility in South Carolina, even though many had been there for years. One woman with 14 years under her belt was let go after a misdemeanor conviction surfaced that was more than 20 years old and carried a $137 fine, according to the EEOC’s lawsuit.

The agency also alleged that retailer Dollar General revoked job offers to two black women after conducting criminal background checks. In one case, the EEOC said that the records were inaccurate but that Dollar General declined to reconsider the woman’s application. The other involved a six-year-old drug conviction.

“It is a fairness issue,” said David Lopez, the commission’s general counsel. “Litigation is really, truly the last resort.”

The growing use of criminal background checks in hiring decisions has become a flash point in the broader debate over high unemployment rates among African Americans. Not only did blacks lose more jobs and more wealth than other racial groups during the recession, they also have struggled to gain a foothold in the recovery — an issue some community leaders have called the next front in the civil rights movement. A criminal record, advocates say, is an economic scarlet letter that can send otherwise qualified applicants to the bottom of the pile.

The EEOC lawsuits were brought under the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination against job applicants on the basis of race. Both BMW and Dollar General denied the allegations and said they complied with all laws.

Although the commission said employers are allowed to conduct background checks, it charged that the companies’ blanket policies of not hiring candidates with criminal records amounted to discrimination against African Americans. Justice Department statistics show that blacks accounted for 37 percent of those behind bars last year, even though they make up only 13 percent of the U.S. population.

The EEOC is not alone in focusing on the role of criminal background checks in black employment. Since the recession, seven states — including Maryland — have adopted laws that prohibit employers from including questions about criminal history on job applications.

The movement has been nicknamed “ban the box,” after the box that offenders often are required to mark. Bills are pending in four other states, and at least a dozen local governments have enacted versions of the ban. Business groups have not mounted organized opposition to the measures.

Del. Aisha N. Braveboy (D-Prince George’s), the leader of Maryland’s Legislative Black Caucus, helped spearhead the legislation, which applies only to state government jobs. She said the tight employment market is the top concern in her community, and she connects the problem to the county’s high rates of foreclosure and crime. Helping people find jobs is the first step to addressing broader issues, she said.

“They should pay . . . but should they pay for it for the rest of their lives?” Braveboy said. “We have a responsibility as a society to provide people with opportunities to be gainfully employed and to make better choices.”

The link between race and crime has long been a highly charged and difficult debate rooted in factors such as discrimination and socioeconomic status. The EEOC emphasized that companies have a right to consider criminal history in hiring. Guidelines updated last year say that when evaluating job candidates, employers should weigh the nature of a crime, how long ago it occurred and its relation to the position. Offenders are generally prohibited from working in day-care facilities or prisons, for example.

But the EEOC said it is wary of the way hiring policies can disproportionately hurt minorities.

A landmark study by Princeton sociologist Devah Pager found that white offenders were only half as likely to get a callback from a potential employer and that the effect was even greater for blacks. A separate study by the Pew Center on the States found that even when offenders do land jobs, men with criminal histories earn about 40 percent less than those in similar circumstances without records.

A survey last year by the Society for Human Resource Management, an industry group, found that more than two-thirds of companies conduct criminal background checks. About a quarter of them said nonviolent misdemeanors, such as drug convictions, could influence their hiring decisions, and 60 percent reported that violent crimes could disqualify a candidate. Almost all indicated reluctance to hire someone who had been convicted of a violent felony such as murder. A majority said they allow candidates to explain their records.

In a statement Tuesday, BMW said it has “complied with the letter and spirit of the law” and touted its diverse workforce.

According to the lawsuit, the automaker banned those convicted of crimes ranging from murder to drug use to “theft, dishonesty and moral turpitude.” In 2008, when BMW switched contractors that were handling logistics at its facility in Spartanburg, S.C., it asked employees to reapply for their jobs under BMW’s criminal-background policy. The EEOC suit said 88 people were not rehired. Eighty percent of them were African American.

In its case against Dollar General, the EEOC said the low-price retailer does not adequately evaluate criminal records when hiring. The result was that 10 percent of offers made to black candidates were rescinded after a background check, compared with 7 percent of offers to whites.

In a statement, Dollar General said it seeks to foster “a safe and healthy environment” through its background checks.

But Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, said too many minorities are running into roadblocks.

“It’s such a tough economy that there’s a lot of concern about the barriers that people are facing to employment beyond the fact that there’s just not enough jobs,” she said.

Ryan Moragneel of Baltimore was 18 when he received a felony conviction for distributing marijuana. A few years later, he was put on probation after robbing a pawnshop with some friends. In 2011, he received a misdemeanor charge and spent several months in jail. He said employers take one look at his history and toss his application aside.

“I never really got a chance to be an adult without a record,” Moragneel said. “I’ve never been hired off a computer.”

Now 30 with two kids, Moragneel is set to graduate this month from a skills training program in Baltimore that he hopes will open the door to a job in electrical engineering. If he could talk to an employer, he said, he would say that he has learned from his mistakes and wants to move ahead.

But that can happen only if he lands an interview.

“So far,” Moragneel said, “it’s no calls back.”"

A bill that would criminalize ""revenge porn"" — nude or sexual photos, generally of former wives or girlfriends, posted online by an angry ex — could pave the way for other states to adopt similar laws, putting perpetrators in jail for six months if convicted a first time, and up to a year for repeat violations. The bill, already approved by the California Senate, is expected to go to the state Assembly as soon as this week, despite concerns from some lawmakers and experts who fear it could curtail First Amendment rights.

""It's traumatized real victims; it's a growing problem,"" California state Sen. Anthony Cannella, told NBC News. ""Technology moves much faster than our laws,"" said Cannella, a Republican, who authored the legislation. ""When we identify a problem, it's our responsibility to deal with it.""

If passed by the Assembly, SB 255 will go to Gov. Jerry Brown for approval. It's not clear whether Brown will support it. ""Generally, we do not comment on pending legislation,"" Brown press spokesman Evan Westrup told NBC News.

One supporter with whom Cannella has been working is Holly Jacobs, a Florida woman who founded End Revenge Porn after her own nightmare with the issue began more than four years ago.

Like many other couples, Jacobs and her boyfriend had private photos of intimate moments — photos not meant for public consumption. After their breakup, Jacobs saw her photos plastered everywhere on the Web, including on Facebook and several revenge porn sites. Her email address was part of what was shared, ""so I had harassing emails constantly coming in,"" she told TODAY's Matt Lauer in May. ""My work location was posted up and there, so I was terrified. I was so afraid that someone would physically stalk me.""

In the era of instant uploads, a slimy sub-industry of sites have emerged that are dedicated solely to such ""revenge porn"" shots and videos. It has become a money-making ""sport,"" of which one of the most notorious players is Hunter Moore, who was under FBI investigation for his controversial site, Is Anyone Up.

Though the sites often include personal information about the victims, including names, email addresses and even links to their Facebook profiles, the sites themselves are protected from liability because of Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which says that websites and Internet service providers cannot be treated as a publisher for ""any information provided by another information content provider."" With little legal recourse, these victims are left feeling helpless and humiliated.

Jacobs' fear turned to anger, and she decided she would no longer be a victim. She filed criminal and civil charges against her ex. The ex, through his attorney, has denied the charges against him, contending he is just as much a victim as Jacobs, and that the reason the photos and video were shared is that his computer was hacked.

Those who might think, ""Well, you shouldn't have taken those photos ... "" aren't living in the real world of what has become, especially for a younger generation, a cultural-technological phenomenon as normal as tweeting and texting.

""It’s absolutely just a new version of victim blaming,"" Jacobs said in May. ""What I would say to victims when they hear that is, just hold on to that little voice inside of you that says, 'This is not right.' What's happening to me is not OK, and there need to be laws in place against this.""

The California legislation, Jacobs told NBC News, ""is so important because it has the potential to set a precedent for other states considering to criminalize revenge porn.""

Precedents and objections

The state that comes closest to doing that now is New Jersey, which since 2003 has had an invasion-of-privacy law aimed at video voyeurs, people who secretly videotape others naked or having sex without their consent, according to a spokesman for the Office of the Attorney General in that state.



That law was one of those used to prosecute Rutgers University student Dharun Ravi, found guilty last year after setting up a webcam to spy on his gay roommate, Tyler Clementi, in 2010. Ravi livestreamed the video and tweeted about his roommates's activities. Clementi, 18, committed suicide after learning about the public humiliation.

""Legislators did not discuss the issue of 'revenge porn' in passing this law"" in 2003, Peter Aseltine, a spokesman for the New Jersey attorney general's office, told NBC News. ""Nonetheless, the language of the statute is quite broad and arguably applies to allow prosecution of an individual in a 'revenge porn' situation.""

Other revenge porn law efforts could soon be underway in Texas, Wisconsin and Georgia, Jacobs said.

While most everyone will agree that the revenge porn practice is reprehensible, crafting legislation that doesn't inadvertently restrict free speech is the challenge.

In Florida, where Jacobs lives, an attempt at a revenge porn law failed this year partly because of concerns the way the law was written could interfere with free speech. Jacobs cited another concern: a requirement that personal information, such as the victim's name and email address, also be posted as part of the photos or videos shared.

""I'm sure the revenge porn posters would have easily found a way around this,"" she told NBC News. ""Our personal information is already posted when our faces are in these pictures.""

Florida State Sen. David Simmons and state Rep. Tom Goodson, both Republicans, plan to try again with a new bill with different wording next spring when the legislature is back in session.

Jeff Hermes, director of the Digital Media Law Project at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, said a ""balance needs to be struck properly,"" and he is not sure the California law will do that.

""You need to be extraordinarily careful in criminalizing privacy law because of the risk you're going to deter legitimate speech,"" he told NBC News. ""With the California bill, I don't see an exemption here for material that's legitimately newsworthy.""

Take for example, he said, ""circumstances where photographs exist of a political candidate who has run their campaign on their squeaky-clean image,"" but there are photographs of that candidate in a compromising position. ""The distribution of these photos could indicate (to voters) that candidate might be lying about their past.""

The revenge porn bill, Hermes said, is ""responding to a significant concern, and I don't want to downplay that. It is a law in a field which is already heavily regulated — privacy — and where there are court remedies. But the question is whether the criminal penalties are necessary to achieve the aims already provided by existing law.""

Only one California state senator, Leland Yee, a Democrat, voted against SB 255 when it came before the senate last month. His reason: ""First Amendment protections are fundamental to our free society,"" he said in a statement to NBC News. ""While I appreciate the intent of this legislation, I feel it was too broadly drawn and could potentially be used inappropriately to censor free speech.""

(JONATHAN ERNST/REUTERS)

College campuses are supposed to be marketplaces of ideas. But some ideas, and some people, are less welcome than others these days. Just ask Robert Zoellick and Ben Carson.

Zoellick, the former World Bank president, and Carson, the world-renowned Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon, have withdrawn as college commencement speakers in the past week following protests from students and professors. Zoellick accepted and then turned down an invitation from Swarthmore College — his alma mater — after students objected to his support of the Iraq war and his record at the World Bank; Carson this week reconsidered his invitation from Johns Hopkins after a furor over his remarks lumping together homosexuality, pedophilia and bestiality.

Commencement speaker controversies have become so common that they’re practically a springtime ritual, like the opening of the baseball season or the blossoming of daffodils. Figures as diverse as President Obama and actor James Franco, whom some UCLA students knocked as lacking gravitas, have all been the object of graduation brouhahas in recent years.

“Overall, there seems to be an increased sensitivity to things that in the past we might have let it roll off our backs,” says Josh Wheeler, director of the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression, a First Amendment legal policy group at the University of Virginia. “Nowadays, people aren’t afraid to express their objections, which isn’t a bad thing, but people are more willing to censor [speech] to remove the offending speech or language.”

Wheeler refers to this phenomenon as “ the heckler’s veto,” the ability of a small but vocal group to limit the choices of a much larger majority.

She also said everybody, no matter how high, needs reassurance and validation. Winfrey urged the students to reach out to those they disagree with, “have more face-to-face conversations” with them. Read more. Elise Amendola/AP Wait 1 second to continue.

“We shouldn’t ignore [protest] but at the same time to allow a minority to determine what we see or hear is very concerning from a free-speech point of view,” Wheeler said. “Too often, it’s easier to eliminate the problem than deal with the controversy.”

Such issues have risen and fallen on college campuses for decades, leading to familiar complaints that the nation’s institutions of higher learning are dens of “political correctness.” The charge is often leveled by conservatives against what they perceive as the liberal orthodoxy of college campuses.

In fact, conservative writer Ann Coulter was forced to cancel an appearance at the University of Ottawa in Canada in 2010 after about 2,000 students crowded the entrance to the hall at which she was scheduled to speak and protested her views. Former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin faced protests from students and controversy over her fees when she was invited to speak at California State University-Stanislaus in 2010, but she went ahead with her appearance.

The recent furors over Carson and Zoellick fit this pattern, too. Carson, a self-described Christian conservative, apologized for remarks he made in a Fox News interview in March in which he said “no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality” had the right to change the traditional definition of marriage.

Students at Hopkins protested his remarks and took up a petition for a new speaker. Despite another apology, Carson decided to withdraw on Wednesday. “My presence is likely to distract from the true celebratory nature of the day,” Carson wrote in an e-mail to the dean of the university’s medical school, Paul Rothman. “Commencement is about the students and their successes, and it is not about me,”

Zoellick, a former George W. Bush administration official, was to have received an honorary degree at Swarthmore, but he also pulled out this week after students mounted a campaign on Facebook calling him an “architect of the Iraq war” and a “war criminal” for his support of the 2003 invasion. Although Zoellick did support the war, he did not plan it; he was Bush’s U.S. trade representative and later worked to resolve the conflict in Darfur as a State Department official. He ran the World Bank from 2007 until last year.

As the attacks on Zoellick mounted last month, Swarthmore’s student newspaper, the Daily Gazette, exercised its own free speech by mocking the controversy. In an April Fool’s Day edition, it wrote that the school “would not be offering degrees to any member of the Class of 2013 who does not intend to found a vegan coffee shop after graduation, calling other professional choices ‘antithetical to Swarthmore values.’ ”

But figures on the left have received similar treatment as well. Weeks of protest by anti-abortion advocates, for example, preceded President Obama’s commencement address at Notre Dame University in 2010. Also that year, the University of Wyoming canceled a speech by former 1960s radical William Ayers after hundreds objected.

Meanwhile, protests flared this week at Yeshiva University’s Cardozo School of Law in New York after it gave its “International Advocate for Peace Award” to former president Jimmy Carter on Wednesday. A group of Cardozo alumni set up a Web site calling on the school’s graduates to withdraw their financial support to protest Carter’s criticism of Israel.

At the least, the current climate of protest strikes former university president Robert O’Neil as reasonably civilized. When O’Neil headed the University of Wisconsin in the early 1980s, a student group invited former Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver to speak. His first appearance was canceled because of security concerns; a second appearance led to violence between rival student groups and eight arrests for disorderly conduct. Cleaver cut his speech short.

“What people see as evidence of political correctness [today] is not what’s going on,” says O’Neil, who also ran Indiana University and the University of Virginia during his academic career. “The harshest thing I see is that we engage more in self-censorship, but that’s a long way from succumbing to political correctness. It’s not P.C. to make a special effort to respect people’s beliefs and to try to accommodate them.”

Rather than viewing the campus climate as evidence of growing censorship, O’Neil sees it as more hospitable to open debate. “The discourse is more orderly,” he says. “There’s more willingness to reason. People don’t always agree, and they can disagree aggressively, but that’s how the marketplace of ideas works.”"

It is a very peaceful group. Sometimes they sing outside when events are going on in the capitol rotunda, and inside most other times. There are some people who come more often, but the singing group varies in size as people come and go. My friend and I came two times over the last two years.

It's a complicated situation that most people coming to Daily Kos know about, but in the last few weeks, the Capitol Police have begun arresting people for singing....and often for simply observing.

We hemmed and hawed about going to the Capitol. We knew in our heads that we could be arrested, but didn't believe it would really happen.....

We found parking, walked around the beautiful building and went in the State Street doors. People were outside singing and they said as we walked by: ""Are they still arresting people in there?"" We went in and of course stopped at the bathroom...because that's what we do. Then on we went to get closer to the singing. We stood by one of the pillars near the outer edge of the crowd, and there was a song I kind of knew...I sang a bit (four or five words) but I didn't really know the words. I turned to my friend and there were three officers behind me. Yikes!

It's a bit fuzzy already (that is what age does to us!), but one of the officers said we had to leave or risk being arrested. Then he asked me if I would leave because I risked being arrested. I said that I was staying. The young woman officer was reluctant to arrest me, but the older officer seemed to be in charge. They put handcuffs (real ones, not the plastic ties) on me with my hands behind my back after taking my purse off my shoulder. It's a very full and colorful purse, and I was worried about it the whole time! It's funny what we worry about at times.

People were taking pictures and videos and calling out, ""Hero!"" It felt good and very odd all at the same time.

They walked me to the elevator and we rode down to the former cafeteria in the basement...now used as a place to fill out citations. I asked about my purse a few times, but otherwise there was no talk. I did make eye contact with the young woman officer a few times. She seemed to be embarrassed....at least I thought so.

First she asked me if I had anything on me that would hurt her! I said no. Then I was patted down. Other than the airport, this was my first pat-down. She then asked if I had my ID in my purse. I think she asked for permission to look, but I can't remember that either! She found my wallet, and I started telling her where my ID was. Then I decided she should find it herself. It was a small thing, but felt big to me. I was still in handcuffs, by the way.

She filled out the citation form, gave my ID to a young woman who took it to make a copy (I assume) and check for outstanding warrants, I guess, and we sat and waited. Nothing was said. I think I was in a bit of shock. Oh, I did ask where the $200.50 would be going, and I commented that it would be nice if the cafeteria was used for lunches instead of arrests.

When the young woman came back, they took off the cuffs, and I was free to go. As I was leaving, the officers were behind me and I held the door for them. They said thank you. Nothing beats remembering courtesy. How weird this all is/was!!

They also told me if I went back to the Rotunda, I risked arrest again. I was trying to figure out how to find my friend and walked outside the same doors I came in. I texted her and then called her. She came out, and we hugged a few times. My feelings were so complicated: a bit embarrassed, a bit proud, a bit surreal, and more! I have never been arrested before.

We sat on a wall near the sidewalk, and a lady walked by on her phone. My friend overheard her say she had been arrested, too. So we followed her and talked awhile. She said not to pay the fine and to contest it at the court date. (It's interesting.....my first thought was to pay and move on...years of conditioning, I think.) So, I am going to court this Friday to plead not guilty....for singing! More strangeness!!

I texted my adult kids and told them I am now a perp. I was an adult education teacher at the county jail for 10 years, and I am sure they never thought they would hear me say I was arrested.

They actually are proud of my civil disobedience. I am, too."

One could spur reform. Can Obama give up control and do it?

Editor’s Note: Tamar Jacoby, a fellow at the New America Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, is president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a national federation of small-business owners in favor of immigration reform.

(CNN) —

Members of Congress working to pass immigration reform are divided on many issues, but there’s one they agree on. Democrat and Republican, virtually all have been adamant since the debate began that President Obama should stay out of it– that pressure from the White House would only spur resistance on Capitol Hill.

Still, there’s an exception to every rule. The president has the power to transform the immigration debate by one simple action: nominating a tough, law-enforcement Republican to replace Janet Napolitano as secretary of Homeland Security.

The prospects of passing reform hang uneasily in the balance this month as members of Congress spend time at home in their districts. Back in Washington, an all but unbreakable House rule mandates that passage of any law as momentous as immigration reform requires a “majority of the majority” – in today’s House, 118 GOP votes. And many Republicans—a majority, I believe–are still up for grabs.

Tamar Jacoby

In the past, many House Republicans have opposed immigration reform, but attitudes have changed dramatically in recent months, thanks largely to a new understanding of the Latino vote’s power. A dwindling minority still oppose reform at all cost. A growing but still small minority is generally favorable to an overhaul. And the rest – the majority in the middle – are wrestling to come to terms with an issue they’re suddenly seeing in a new light. They are reexamining the facts, questioning old assumptions, trying on new policy ideas and asking themselves how far they can stretch. The ferment is palpable –as are the possibilities.

Opinion: Key to immigration reform – worker visas

The biggest obstacle: House Republicans don’t trust that Obama will enforce the law.

This mistrust has deep roots, and Obama has only inflamed it in recent years. The last time Congress passed an immigration overhaul, in 1986, it was cast as a grand bargain: amnesty for the millions of immigrants then living in the country illegally in exchange for tough enforcement on the border and in the workplace.

By the early 1990s, 3 million formerly unauthorized immigrants had earned legal status and were on their way to citizenship. But the border was more porous than ever, and workplace enforcement had all but ground to a halt, as a new cottage industry in forged identity documents erased all hope of meaningful control and a frustrated immigration service threw up its hands.

Enter President Obama, who from day one has shown what House Republicans consider a decidedly selective approach to the law. Whatever you think of Obamacare or the Defense of Marriage Act, they are the law of the land – but the president has enforced them only when he felt like it, if he felt like it at all–putting a hold, for example, on the Obamacare employer mandate. On other issues, he has thumbed his nose at the Constitution’s federal balance of power, bypassing Congress to appoint members of the National Labor Relations Board and grant legal status to young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.

As for immigration enforcement, there has been some progress in the Obama years on the border and in the workplace, but two huge congressional directives remain just that, unfulfilled directives. One is completing the 700 miles of fence mandated in 2006, the other building an electronic “exit” system to track that foreigners visiting the United States on visas leave the country when they say they will – a mandate that dates to 1996.

There’s nothing Obama can do to restore Republicans’ faith in him – that horse left the barn years ago. And not any Republican appointment to the top immigration enforcement job will reassure the GOP.

A Republican seen as a dove on immigration will change nothing – might as well go with a Democrat. So, too, a Republican popular in the mainstream media or among sophisticated elites, and that rules out even accomplished law enforcement officials like, say, Bill Bratton, former police commissioner in New York and Los Angeles, or Raymond Kelly, now the top cop in New York City.

Opinion: Crunch time for immigration, budget fights

What’s needed is someone so reliably tough and so committed to enforcing the law that even diehard immigration hawks do a double-take when the name surfaces. Part of the point, after all, is neutralizing criticism from immigration restrictionists. And of course, such a choice will make many Democrats gasp. That, too, is part of the point. Without it, skeptical Republicans will not be convinced.

The other indispensable requirement is that a nominee should be someone with enough national stature – a household name, if possible – to push back against the president if need be. House Republicans need to know that this person will hold the line, no matter what the president tries, will take his or her case to the media if necessary, and will have enough popular support to make a national appeal effective.

Who fits this bill? It’s not a long list. Would Rudy Giuliani take the job? Condoleezza Rice? A respected general? Someone who proved his law and order bona fides in the last Bush administration – former Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example? Or former Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, a committed immigration enforcement hawk and among the Republican lawmakers, sitting or retired, most knowledgeable about the issue?

Coming up with the right name won’t be easy, but ultimately this is a question about Barack Obama. Is he strong enough – and self-confident enough – to take this step? Can he brook the dissent and give up control? If he means what he says when he talks about enforcing the law, he should put his money where his mouth is. Nothing would do more to improve the chances of passing immigration reform on his watch.

Human trafficking issue is gaining political steam

Activism on the rise to combat problem

Modern-day slavery is being battled in several states

A wave of efforts to stop human trafficking has spread across the country as lawmakers and others look to combat the problem through law, policy, and grass-roots activism.

Although approaches vary, advocates say more must be done to stop the crime, dubbed ""modern-day slavery"" and defined by the State Department as the recruitment, transportation or harboring of people by means of deception or coercion. Victims, often mentally and physically abused, can be forced into prostitution, unfair working conditions, or other exploitative situations.

""Consciousness and outrage have reached a different level because of the perverseness but also the impact of human trafficking,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. ""People understand that everyone has a responsibility to fight human trafficking and every individual can have an impact.""

Cases of traffickers recruiting students at U.S. schools, selling sex online and in hotels, and operating slave enterprises alongside everyday life has led to increased awareness.

Two lawmakers in Maryland this month announced plans to toughen state laws on trafficking this year. In doing so, they joined a long list of people around the country working to make the crime in the United States a central topic of 2013.

Blumenthal and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, launched the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking in November and sponsored a bill that later became law to prevent federal contracts from going to companies that benefit from forms of trafficking. The law aims to hold contractors responsible by requiring them to notify the Inspector General if they receive ""credible evidence"" that a subcontractor has engaged in trafficking.

This week, Blumenthal and Portman also led a successful Senate vote to allow child victims of sex trafficking to receive help under the Violence Against Women Act. The House will now need to agree to that amendment.

Meanwhile, the bipartisan caucus will hold its first meeting this month. Blumenthal hopes the group will lead to more legislation, tougher enforcement of existing laws, and additional supportive services for victims.

The federal government hopes to become a model for change following announcements by President Obama last year about several new initiatives aimed at ending trafficking nationwide, Blumenthal said. The efforts include the first-ever assessment of the problem in this country and a $6 million grant to build solutions.

In Maryland, state Delegate Kathleen Dumais introduced a bill this month that would allow authorities to seize the assets of suspected traffickers and confiscate them if they are convicted. Delegate Susan Lee plans to introduce a bill that would increase the penalty for abducting someone under 16 for sexual exploitation from a misdemeanor to a felony.

Detective Thomas Stack of the Montgomery County police department says criminals are moving girls from states like California, Pennsylvania and New York into Maryland's massage parlors, brothels and hotels near Interstate 95, the Eastern Seaboard's busiest north-south corridor.

""Traffickers are no different than criminal enterprises and organized crime,"" he said, adding that last year, authorities rescued 36 juveniles involved in prostitution. ""They (traffickers) are making tremendous amounts of money, and they get to keep it, even if we catch them and they are convicted.""

Other initiatives aim to combat the problem.

The American Bar Association is training lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals to recognize signs that a defendant may be a trafficking victim and plans to encourage states to adopt uniform laws against the crime, said Laurel Bellows, the organization's president.

The group held a training session in Chicago last year and will host training in San Diego and Washington this year. Several schools, including Georgetown University, the University of Kansas and the University of Southern California, hosted conferences last month on the subject, inviting experts and victims to speak.

Everyday citizens such as Erin Giles, editor of End Sex Trafficking, have helped publish books on the topic, while celebrities such as Jada Pinkett Smith, head of Don't Sell Bodies, have started organizations.

Longtime activists such as Andrea Powell, executive director of Fair Girls, a non-profit group based in Washington, have redoubled their efforts by expanding operations and seeking more funding. For Powell, this year's focus will be on starting an office in Baltimore and getting specialized victim housing as well as passing laws that prohibit minors from being charged with prostitution, she said."

Why is there more anger, vituperation, and political polarization now than even during Joe McCarthy's anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s, the tempestuous struggle for civil rights in the 1960s, the divisive Vietnam war, or the Watergate scandal?

If anything, you'd think this would be an era of relative calm. The Soviet Union has disappeared and the Cold War is over. The Civil Rights struggle continues, but at least we now have a black middle class and even a black president. While the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been controversial, the all-volunteer army means young Americans aren't being dragged off to war against their will. And although politicians continue to generate scandals, the transgressions don't threaten the integrity of our government as did Watergate.

And yet, by almost every measure, Americans are angrier today. They're more contemptuous of almost every major institution -- government, business, the media. They're more convinced the nation is on the wrong track. And they are far more polarized.

Political scientists say the gap between the median Republican voter and the median Democrat is wider today on a whole host of issues than it's been since the 1920s.

Undoubedly, social media play a part -- allowing people to pop off without bearing much responsibility for what they say. And most of us can cocoon within virtual or real communities whose members confirm all our biases and assumptions.

Meanwhile, cable news and yell radio compete for viewers and listeners by being ever more strident. Not long ago I debated a Republican economic advisor on a cable TV program. During the brief station-break, the show's producer told me to ""be angrier."" I told her I didn't want to be angrier. ""You have to,"" she said. ""Viewers are surfing through hundreds of channels and will stop for a gladiator contest.""

Within this cacophony, we've lost trusted arbiters of truth -- the Edward Murrows and Walter Cronkites who could explain what was happening in ways most Americans found convincing.

We've also lost most living memory of an era in which we were all in it together -- the Great Depression and World War II -- when we succeeded or failed together. In those years we were palpably dependent on one another, and understood how much we owed each other as members of the same society.

But I think the deeper explanation for what has happened has economic roots. From the end of World War II through the late 1970s, the economy doubled in size -- as did almost everyone's income. Almost all Americans grew together. In fact, those in the bottom fifth of the income ladder saw their incomes more than double. Americans experienced upward mobility on a grand scale.

Yet for the last three and a half decades, the middle class has been losing ground. The median wage of male workers is now lower than it was in 1980, adjusted for inflation.

In addition, all the mechanisms we've used over the last three decades to minimize the effects of this descent -- young mothers streaming into paid work in the late 1970s and 1980s, everyone working longer hours in the 1990s, and then borrowing against the rising values of our homes -- are now exhausted. And wages are still dropping -- the median is now 4 percent below what it was at the start of the so-called recovery.

Meanwhile, income, wealth, and power have become more concentrated at the top than they've been in ninety years.

As a result, many have come to believe that the deck is stacked against them. Importantly, both the Tea Party and the Occupier movements began with the bailouts of Wall Street -- when both groups concluded that big government and big finance had plotted against the rest of us. The former blamed government; the latter blamed Wall Street.

Political scientists have also discovered a high correlationbetween inequality and political divisiveness.

The last time America was this bitterly divided was in the 1920s, which was the last time income, wealth, and power were this concentrated.

When average people feel the game is rigged, they get angry. And that anger can easily find its way into deep resentments -- of the poor, of blacks, of immigrants, of unions, of the well-educated, of government.

This shouldn't be surprising. Demagogues throughout history have used anger to target scapegoats -- thereby dividing and conquering, and distracting people from the real sources of their frustrations.

Make no mistake: The savage inequality America is experiencing today is deeply dangerous.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/06/federal-judge-rules-idaho-fetal-pain-abortion-law-is-unconstitutional/,2013-03-06 00:00:00,[],Federal judge strikes down Idaho 'fetal pain' abortion law,"A federal judge has struck down Idaho's law banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy based on beliefs held by physicians and others that the fetus is able to feel pain at that point.

U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill ruled late Wednesday in favor of Jennie Linn McCormack, who was 33 at the time she decided to challenge the state's so-called fetal pain law and other abortion laws.

Idaho was one of seven states to adopt fetal pain laws in 2011, following in the footsteps of Nebraska's approval of the law in 2010. But those laws are no longer the most restrictive. This week, lawmakers in Arkansas overrode a veto of a near-ban on the abortion procedure starting from the 12th week of pregnancy.

In his 42-page decision, Winmill sided with McCormack and her attorney, Richard Hearn, declaring Idaho's fetal pain law places an undue burden on a woman's right to have an abortion. The judge also took the Legislature -- dominated by Republicans in both chambers -- to task for the motives driving adoption of the law, finding that efforts to protect a fetus don't outweigh a women's right to choose.

The judge found ""compelling evidence of the legislature's `improper purpose' in enacting it,"" Winmill wrote. ""The state may not rely on its interest in the potential life of the fetus to place a substantial obstacle to abortion before viability in women's paths,"" he said.

The ruling also finds unconstitutional at least two other Idaho laws dealing with abortion that Hearn and McCormack also challenged.

One is Idaho's requirement that first-trimester abortions be performed by a physician in a staffed office or clinic, a law that makes most drug-induced abortions, such as RU-486, illegal. The ruling also targets a law requiring that second-trimester abortions be performed in a hospital and a statute that criminalizes the woman in some cases for undergoing the procedure.

""Historically, abortion statutes sought to protect pregnant females from third parties providing dangerous abortions,"" Winmill wrote. ""As a result, most states' abortion laws traditionally criminalized the behavior of third parties to protect the health of pregnant women -- they did not punish women for obtaining an abortion. By punishing women, Idaho's abortion statute is therefore unusual.""

McCormack originally filed her lawsuit in federal court against Bannock County's prosecuting attorney on grounds the new fetal pain law was unconstitutional. She initially sought class-action status against prosecutor Mark Hiedeman, who filed criminal charges against her alleging she had an illegal abortion.

McCormack was charged after police began investigating after finding a fetus in a box in January 2011. An autopsy determined it was between five and six months gestation. Police said McCormack told them she didn't have enough money to go to a licensed medical professional, so her sister helped her access abortion-inducing drugs online.

A judge later dismissed the criminal case without prejudice for lack of evidence, but left open the possibility for prosecutors to refile.

In her lawsuit, McCormack challenged the lack of access to abortions for women in her region, as well as the ban on abortions after 20 weeks.

She noted there are no elective-abortion providers in southeastern Idaho, forcing women seeking the procedure to travel elsewhere.

McCormack was unmarried and unemployed at the time of her pregnancy -- with an income of $200 to $250 a month -- and already had three children. She couldn't afford the time or money it would take to travel to Salt Lake City to get an abortion, the lawsuit says."
http://news.yahoo.com/5-secrets-march-washington-061706458.html,,[],5 Secrets of the March on Washington,"The March on Washington, which took place 50 years ago this month, is bathed in a warm glow for good reason. But the story of that day, beyond Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, is surprising, funny, poignant.

Here are a few secrets—or little-remarked-upon aspects—of the day worth keeping in mind as the 50th-anniversary commemorations approach.

King's Speech Was Improvised—and Edgy.

All schoolkids are taught the ""content of their character"" part of King's address. After the march, when John F. Kennedy welcomed King and other civil-rights leaders to the White House, he said to the reverend: ""I have a dream."" ""That was like Kennedy saying 'You nailed it,'"" says Taylor Branch, the Pulitzer prize-winning King biographer.

King knew he had hit his mark, Branch told National Journal Daily. But while the ""dream"" section of the speech is best-remembered, the first part of King's speech had been an angry lament about the condition of blacks in America, which he likened to a check returned for insufficient funds.

The ""dream"" portion of the speech was semi-improvised. King had used the dream idea before, in speeches earlier in 1963, including one to black insurance agents. King owes a debt to the Bible's Book of Isaiah, from which he borrowed. But much of the speech that day was original. King also left out some of the angrier and clunkier lines from his prepared speech. For example: ""And so today, let us go back to our communities as members of the international association for the advancement of creative dissatisfaction.""

For what it's worth, The New York Times gave King top billing the next day. The Washington Post devoted its front page to other leaders of the march.

D.C. Was Ready for Riots.

The prospect of all of those protesters coming to Washington scared the crap out of the District of Columbia. As Branch has noted, there were not only 4,000 federal troops poised in D.C. and 15,000 paratroopers on standby, but the city's liquor stores were closed for the first time since Prohibition.

Story continues

Most D.C. businesses shut down for the day. Of course, the day turned out to be incredibly peaceful. Newspapers favored the word ""orderly."" And it was, which helped give the civil-rights movement even more moral force. The organizers of the march even offered to help clean up afterwards, but the National Park Service, which controls the monument, turned them down.

A Gay Man Led the Way.

The organizing genius behind the March on Washington was civil-rights veteran Bayard Rustin. What is less-known now, or then, is that he was gay. That might have not been known at all had Rustin not been arrested on what were then called morals charges (he was arrested in 1953 along with two other men in a parked car in Pasadena, Calif.)

King had kept Rustin at a distance under pressure from other black leaders. The late Rep. Adam Clayton Powell Jr. of Harlem had forced Rustin off of the board of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Roy Wilkins, head of the NAACP, didn't want Rustin running the 1963 march.

But Rustin's mentor, A. Philip Randolph, head of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, insisted. It was Randolph's idea to have a March on Washington in 1941 to protest segregation—and it was called off only when President Roosevelt desegregated the defense industry. So when the idea surfaced of a March on Washington in 1963, to demand justice on the 100th anniversary of the end of slavery, Randolph's word counted above all others. And it was Rustin who did much of the speaking that August day.

Sen. Strom Thurmond denounced Rustin as a communist and homosexual in a floor statement, but the press didn't pick it up. Rustin died in 1987 and President Obama will present him, posthumously, with the Medal of Freedom.

Automation and Labor Were a Factor.

It's often forgotten that the March on Washington was a march for freedom and jobs. The unemployment rate that August was 5.4 percent, low by today's standards but higher than it had been earlier in the '60s; then, as now, black unemployment remained much higher than the national index.

Many of the speakers at the March on Washington inveighed against ""automation"" displacing workers—a harbinger of today's outsourcing. But despite the jobs focus, organized labor was divided. Walter Reuther, the head of the United Auto Workers, was one of the official leaders of the march, and he led his own rally in Michigan earlier that summer.

But despite UAW enthusiasm—and Randolph was, of course, also a union leader—the AFL-CIO was AWOL. George Meany, the head of the AFL-CIO, didn't support the march, and the AFL-CIO's offices were shuttered that day. The marchers called for nondiscrimination not only in public facilities like restaurants but also in unions, and many of those represented by the AFL-CIO, especially the building trades, shut out blacks.

Women Had a Separate March.

There was just one official woman speaker at the March on Washington. There were women singers, including Marian Anderson, who had been famously blocked from speaking before the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1939 and was invited to speak at the Lincoln Memorial by Eleanor Roosevelt.

But only one woman was invited to speak at the march, and that was Medgar Evers' widow, Myrlie. She wasn't able to come, so another movement organizer,Daisy Lee Bates, spoke 142 words.

There was a separate march on Independence Avenue for women in the movement that included Dorothy Height, the late leader of the Council of Negro Women.

John Lewis Rewrote His Speech.

Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, the civil-rights veteran, will be everywhere during the anniversary, an elder statesman of the movement.

In August 1963, Lewis was head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and one of the leaders of the march scheduled to speak that day. But the night before the rally, other leaders caught a glimpse of his remarks. The first version of his speech incensed many of the other leaders of the march, including UAW's Reuther, who thought it would backfire on the movement by alienating allies and giving enemies a lot to work with.

Lewis, in his original text, said that President Kennedy's civil-rights plan was ""too little, too late"" and it called for the civil- rights workers to march through Dixie ""like Sherman."" Would Lewis's unspoken words have changed the day? Would King's?

We'll never know."
http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/16/politics/nsa-privacy-rules/index.html,2013-08-16 00:00:00,"['Ed Payne', 'Dan Merica']",NSA admits 'mistakes' amid criticism over breaking of privacy rules,"Story highlights NEW: White House: Audit shows NSA's efforts to find, address privacy violations NEW: NSA admits ""mistakes"" do occur, insists most are quickly addressed Washington Post counts 2,776 incidents -- violations of rules of court orders on surveillance Congressional leaders express concern about mistakes, call for more oversight

(CNN) —

The National Security Agency spent Friday on the defensive, after details got out about an internal audit that found the agency had broken privacy rules “thousands of times each year” since 2008.

The audit was first reported by the Washington Post on Thursday, setting off another round of heated discussion – and criticism – in Washington over how the NSA had wrongly impinged on Americans’ privacy.

“I … will continue to demand honest and forthright answers from the intelligence community,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, noting the Senate Judiciary Committee he chairs will hold a hearing on the Post’s revelations. “I remain concerned that we are still not getting straightforward answers from the NSA.”

In a call with reporters Friday, John DeLong – the NSA’s director of compliance – acknowledged “mistakes occur,” even as he insisted only a “tiny” amount of such problems were intentional.

“No one at NSA thinks a mistake is OK,” DeLong said several times in the call, which a spokesman said was conducted to “address inaccuracies.”

Material was provided to the newspaper this summer by National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.

The audit found 2,776 incidents of “unauthorized collection, storage, access to or distribution of legally protected communications,” the Post reported in its story.

“Most were unintended. Many involved failures of due diligence or violations of standard operating procedure. The most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 Americans and green-card holders,” it said.

Leahy was not the only lawmaker, nor the only member of President Barack Obama’s Democratic party, to call for more oversight and hearings.

“Press reports that the National Security Agency broke privacy rules thousands of times per year and reportedly sought to shield required disclosure of privacy violations are extremely disturbing,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

Pelosi called for “rigorous oversight” by Congress on the “incidents of non-compliance.”

Another Democrat from California, Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein, told the Post in a statement late Thursday night that her committee “can and should do more to independently verify that NSA’s operations are appropriate, and its reports of compliance incidents are accurate.”

The paper said most incidents involved unauthorized surveillance of Americans or foreign intelligence targets in the country.

In 2008, a “large number” of calls placed from Washington were intercepted due to a programming error that confused the capitol’s 202 area code for 20, the international dialing code for Egypt. The information came from a “quality assurance” review that wasn’t distributed to the NSA overnight staff, according to the Post.

Separately, an NSA new collection method went undiscovered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for months. The court, which has authority over some of the agency’s operations, ruled it unconstitutional.

The NSA responded to the Post’s story, saying “a variety of factors can cause the numbers of incidents to trend up or down from one quarter to the next.”

Factors can include implementation of new procedures, technology or software changes and expanded access.

“The one constant across all of the quarters is a persistent, dedicated effort to identify incidents or risks of incidents at the earliest possible moment, implement mitigation measures wherever possible, and drive the numbers down,” the agency said.

The agency released a statement Thursday night defending its programs.

“NSA’s foreign intelligence collection activities are continually audited and overseen internally and externally,” it said. “When NSA makes a mistake in carrying out its foreign intelligence mission, the agency reports the issue internally and to federal overseers – and aggressively gets to the bottom of it.”

On Friday, DeLong said his agency “detects and corrects mistakes” as these occur and are identified, which stops them from being “propagated.”

“The NSA has zero tolerance for misconduct,” he said, noting that those who make repeated mistakes lose access to key databases.

Overall, DeLong insisted, the NSA carefully adheres to privacy protections.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest offered a similar statement Friday, saying the NSA compliance office’s review reflects its commitment to abiding by the law and protecting people’s privacy.

“The documents demonstrate that the NSA is monitoring, detecting, addressing and reporting compliance incidents,” Earnest said.

Snowden stepped forward publicly in June to claim responsibility for leaking to the media that the NSA had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the United States. The agency also collected information from U.S. companies on the Internet activity of overseas residents, he said.

He fled first to Hong Kong and then to Russia before Moscow granted him temporary asylum despite pressure from the Obama administration to return him to the United States to face charges.

He has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, for the leaks.

NSA: We read .00004% of Web traffic

Although polling shows Americans harbor skepticism of the domestic surveillance programs Snowden revealed, a majority of Americans don’t approve of the actions he took and they think he, as an American citizen, should be brought to justice.

A CNN/ORC International survey released last month indicated that 52% of the public disapproved of Snowden’s actions, while 44% said they approved of the leaks. Fifty-four percent of those questioned in the poll said the government should attempt to bring Snowden back to the United States and prosecute him for his leaks.

As for the program Snowden revealed, there is a noticeable generational divide on the surveillance tactics, with younger Americans more likely to support Snowden than older Americans.

I usually went at night, because it was less busy and more convenient.

One evening I went to the Safeway to pick up a few items. I grabbed a cart before entering the store, and started my journey through the many aisles. Somewhere near the tea aisle, I noticed two people having what appeared to be a rather one-sided conversation. The only thing I heard as I walked by them was the woman, who looked to be on the verge of tears, saying something like ""...but my husband is black."" Puzzled, I continued to make my way down the aisle.

My memory of that night is not perfect, but here's what I do remember...I remember the aforementioned man approaching me, and as he did, saying something like ""here's another white girl..."" He had one or both earphones in his ears, and spoke fairly loudly. He walked right up next to me and accused me of being a government informer (supposedly for some sort of white, conspiratorial government). I asked him to move out of the way, as he was between me and the items I was looking at on the shelf. He got louder and said that I must not like black people, as well as a few other things I don't quite remember. I told him that he was harassing me, and asked him to stop. He responded that he wasn't harassing me but confronting me, and my assumed racism. At this point I was pretty freaked out - the man was bigger than me and kept getting in my face - so I took my cart and walked quickly to another section of the store. The man threatened to kick me, and, according to witnesses, attempted to do so as I walked away from him. I approached a Safeway employee and asked for assistance in dealing with the harassment, but before either of us could do anything the man was chased out of the store by another customer.

I was pretty shaken up, and stopped briefly to talk with anther employee (store manager, I think) and the other woman who had been harassed on my way to the checkout lane. She was in tears, and I believe, had called the police shortly before the man had been chased out of the store. I said I was fine when asked, but was wary as I went to check out and put my groceries in the car (I was very glad that I had driven to the store that day instead of walking).

I believe the man who harassed me in the store had mental health issues, but it did not make what happened any less scary in the moment. Up to that point I had never been called out or stereotyped by anyone (at least not to my face) because of my race. It was shocking and humiliating, particularly for someone who has tried hard to work to understand and dismantle the unconscious racism and classism that I know exists in myself. I am not perfect, but I am trying to make the world a better place by confronting my own problematic beliefs, thoughts, and actions, and by talking about them with others.

It is not my intent to pretend that I know what it's like to be profiled, avoided, or treated in a negative way because of my race or class on a regular basis - I will never know what that feels like. I recognize that I have a certain amount of privilege as a middle class white person that others do not, and that this impacts how others think about and treat me. I do believe that this experience provided a tiny glimpse into what it's like to have someone judge and treat an individual a certain way because of the color of their skin. And it was scary, and uncomfortable, and I don't wish it on anyone.

This week, we once again publicly witnessed this type of thinking on a larger scale, in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings. Some members of the public and media went crazy after the bombings, jumping to conclusions about the identity of those responsible (Muslim, Arab, person of color), claiming folks were suspects when they weren't and attacking innocent Muslims and sites associated with Islam, among other things. It was infuriating to watch it all happen, and somewhat ironic when the suspects were identified and did not fit the profile of the imaginary bomber.

I encourage folks to read this piece about white privilege and the Boston Marathon bombings, as it does a better job than I can describing how I feel about the whole thing."

The depth of the Republican deficit in the Electoral College was laid out in stark detail by independent analyst Rhodes Cook in his recent newsletter. Cook charts two eras in the modern history of presidential politics, one Republican and the other Democratic. Republicans dominated the period from 1968 until 1992.

You can't fix that problem by ""rebranding"" the same platform or finding younger, less-white candidates to promote it. You definitely can't fix it by leaning into your failed policies and becoming more extreme.

The good news is that the court affirmed major precedents going back 35 years. It asserted that a more diverse student body — and an admission policy that helps produce one — serves a compelling interest of government by achieving educational and social benefits. Diversity, in turn, helps realize what the court has called “the dream of one nation, indivisible.”

At the same time, the court sent the case at hand — Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin — back for review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which had upheld the university’s use of race in its admissions policy. The court did not say that race could not be used to achieve diversity. It did say, however, that the appeals court must closely reconsider the university’s admissions process to determine whether a race-neutral approach could achieve the level of diversity it seeks.

Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said, “Strict scrutiny must not be strict in theory but feeble in fact.” By this, he meant the court must do a better job of determining that the university needs to rely on race in admissions to achieve greater diversity, including why it wants to admit more minorities in the first place.

In its brief, the university explained that it was not able to admit “an adequate representation of minority students to assure educational benefits deriving from diversity” despite many years “of good-faith efforts to achieve racial diversity through facially race-neutral means.” That included, most prominently, the state’s Top Ten Percent program, which uses geography as a proxy for race by assuring every Texas student who graduates in the top tenth of a high school class admission to a state university."

As Zimmerman's attorney cautioned that his client's safety is at risk, the Justice Department responded to appeals from NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous and several lawmakers to keep investigating the defendant.

The department may find itself in a vulnerable spot. Last week, a conservative watchdog accused an obscure agency within the DOJ of helping support the ""pressure campaign"" against Zimmerman in the wake of the shooting last year. Judicial Watch claimed documents and public accounts showed ""extraordinary intervention"" by the department in the campaign that eventually led to Zimmerman's prosecution.

The department, however, claims that it dispatched agency representatives to reduce tensions in the community – not to take sides.

President Obama himself caused a stir last year by remarking in the days after the shooting that if he had a son, he would “look like Trayvon.” On Sunday, however, Obama urged calm and declared, “the jury has spoken.”

The Justice Department, in announcing it would examine possible civil rights violations, said it has already been reviewing the handling of the criminal case in which Zimmerman, a Hispanic, fatally shot Martin, a black teen, in February 2012, raising concerns about such issues as racial profiling.

""The Department of Justice's Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation continue to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation, as well as the evidence and testimony from the state trial,"" the Justice Department said in a statement Sunday. ""Experienced federal prosecutors will [now] determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the Department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial.""

Jealous started the drive to pressure the DOJ to continue its probe by posting a petition Sunday morning on the website MoveOn.org that was addressed to Attorney General Eric Holder.

""The most fundamental of civil rights -- the right to life -- was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,"" Jealous wrote in the petition.

An all-female six-member jury announced late Saturday that it found Zimmerman ‘not guilty’ of all counts against him, which included charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter.

Jealous told CNN’s “State of the Union on Sunday morning, “There is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why (Zimmerman) targeted young Trayvon.”

He also said he has not spoken directly with Holder but has spoken to his senior people.

“We are glad that what they began months back continues, which is a serious reviewing of everything that came out in this case, everything that was known before this case,” Jealous said.

Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid urged the Justice Department to review federal charges against Zimmerman.

“I think the Justice Department is going to take a look at this,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “This isn’t over with and I think that’s good.”

The Rev. Al Sharpton on the same show condemned the “stand your ground” law under which Zimmerman won acquittal, adding of his plans, ""I will convene an emergency call with preachers tonight to discuss next steps and I intend to head to Florida in the next few days.""

Meanwhile, Mark O'Mara, who defended Zimmerman at trial, suggested his client’s safety was at risk. ""There still is a fringe element that wants revenge,"" O'Mara said. ""They won't listen to a verdict of not guilty.""

In August 2012, O'Mara said Zimmerman and his wife, Shellie, had been living like hermits and weren't working because they feared for their safety.

After Saturday's verdict, police, officials and civil rights leaders urged peace and told protesters not to resort to violence.

Demonstrators across America rallied against Zimmerman on Sunday. Most of the protests were peaceful, but in cities like Oakland, Calif., there were reports of vandalism.

""I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son,"" Obama said in a statement Sunday.

http://news.yahoo.com/advocates-criticize-senate-immigration-bill-171005921.html,,[],Advocates criticize Senate immigration bill,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A sweeping immigration bill in the Senate ran into criticism Tuesday from advocates who complained it puts up undue barriers to citizenship for millions here illegally.

Officials from several immigrant rights' groups and the Catholic church held a conference call to highlight their concerns about the bill, including a cutoff date that excludes people who arrived here after 2011, and provisions disqualifying anyone with a felony conviction or more than two misdemeanors. President Barack Obama praised the Senate bill generally, though he said he would prefer to see some changes.

Immigrants would also have to pay $2,000 in fines and hundreds more in fees along the bill's 13-year path to citizenship, and meet income and employment requirements designed to ensure they have resources above 125 percent of the federal poverty line and won't need to draw on public welfare programs.

Advocates said the policies taken together could exclude hundreds of thousands or even a million or more of the 11 million immigrants here illegally. The Senate Judiciary Committee is to begin voting on the legislation next week.

""If you're going to leave several hundred thousand behind and leave them in the shadows you're not solving the problem,"" said Kevin Appleby, director of migration and refugee policy for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.

""We're very concerned that what the bill does is it punishes people for being poor,"" Appleby said.

Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, said that after reading the 844-page bill, advocates have concluded it needs ""major improvements.""

Advocates are also concerned that the bill requires certain goals on border security to be met before anyone can get a green card qualifying them for legal permanent residence and ultimately citizenship, and some say that the path to citizenship takes too long.

Despite their concerns, advocates said they continued to support the overall goals of the bill and promised to fight for its passage even as they try to make it better. And it's not clear that they have much hope of getting a more favorable agreement.

Story continues

The bill written by four Republican and four Democratic senators is a delicately crafted compromise meant to balance liberal with conservative goals, and the authors have promised to stick together to oppose any amendments that significantly alter the legislation. And the legislation already is seen as too permissive by many in the conservative-controlled House, which also will have its say.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who helped write the bill, told radio host Mike Gallagher on Tuesday: ""The bill that's in place right now probably can't pass the House. It will have to be adjusted.""

Several of the bill's authors have said the American public only is willing to accept citizenship, still derided by some as amnesty, if it comes with tough conditions. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., defended the bill's approach.

""Becoming a United States citizen should not be easy, it's never been easy for anyone who came here from another country,"" McCain said Tuesday at a forum at the University of Southern California Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy. Republicans such as Rubio have indicated they won't be able to support the bill if border security and enforcement provisions are weakened.

Obama, who's embraced immigration legislation as a top second-term priority, also praised the Senate bill Tuesday even though it is stricter in some areas than his own approach on immigration. For example, Obama has not supported making the citizenship pathway contingent on border security.

""The bill that they produced is not the bill that I would have written, there are elements of it that I would change, but I do think that it meets the basic criteria that I laid out from the start,"" Obama said at a news conference Tuesday. Those criteria are more effective border security, cracking down on employers who would hire immigrants here illegally, enacting improvements to the legal immigration system, and creating a pathway to citizenship, Obama said.

Obama said he was open to different solutions that might be proposed by the House, but only if his basic criteria still are met.

""And if they meet those criteria but they're slightly different than the Senate bill, then I think that we should be able to come up with an appropriate compromise,"" Obama said. ""If it doesn't meet those criteria, then I will not support such a bill. So we'll have to wait and see.""

Oneida Indian Nation representative Ray Halbritter, the public face of a campaign against the Washington pro football club's team name, thanked President Barack Obama for speaking out on the issue during a meeting at the White House Tuesday.

Halbritter's comments were met with applause from leaders of a dozen tribes who spoke with the president about a range of economic development issues important to Indian Country, from job creation to increased access to capital to jurisdictional challenges.

Obama said last month in an interview with The Associated Press that if he owned the Washington NFL team he'd think about changing the name.

""I don't know whether our attachment to a particular name should override the real, legitimate concerns that people have about these things,"" Obama said then.

Team owner Daniel Snyder has previously said he will never change the team's name. After Obama's comments, Snyder wrote a letter in which he defended the mascot as part of the team's heritage.

Halbritter, who at Tuesday's meeting sat next to the president in the Roosevelt Room, thanked Obama for lending his voice of support, which brought even more attention to the long-simmering issue of Indian team names in sports.

""It was a wonderful opportunity to express our gratitude, which is what I did,"" Halbritter told USA TODAY Sports. ""The president acknowledged it, he nodded, and applause spontaneously broke out around the table.""

Tuesday's meeting was the first of a series of events this week hosted by the White House Council on Native American Affairs to strengthen government-to-government relationships between tribal nations and the U.S. The president is scheduled to host tribal leaders from 566 federally recognized tribes today at the White House Tribal Nations Conference.

Halbritter gave White House staff a jersey for the president from Cooperstown (N.Y.) High School, which last year changed its name from Redskins to Hawkeyes. The Oneida Nation gave the school district $10,000 toward the purchase of new uniforms.

County Department of Children and Family Services social workers and two supervisors the county intends to fire over the death of an 8-year-old Palmdale boy can appeal their dismissals.

DCFS head Philip Browning said letters had gone out Tuesday to the four employees most involved in the case, notifying them of the department’s intent to fire them. Other employees who were “peripherally involved” received warning or reprimand letters.

The four to be fired have the right to appeal, Browning said.

Paramedics were summoned to the home of Gabriel Fernandez on the evening of May 22 and found the boy barely breathing with numerous injuries, including a fractured skull, broken ribs and burns.

He died in the hospital two days later. His mother and her boyfriend were arrested and charged with murder and torture.

Browning said the quick move to fire the employees marked a departure from past processes. In the past, the department would have looked through the entire history of Gabriel’s involvement with DCFS before taking action.

In this case, the initial investigation focused on the last two years or so to come to a swifter resolution on the fate of the four employees, who were put on desk duty soon after Fernandez’s death.

In the wake of Gabriel’s death, the county also convened a blue-ribbon commission on child protection, which is slated to begin meeting this week.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, whose district includes Palmdale, announced the firing of the workers Tuesday during a board meeting in response to public comments from child advocates, some of whom said they were related to Gabriel.

Advocates cheered at the announcement, but also called out, “What are their names?”

Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who is playing a major role in the chamber's consideration of immigration policy, on Sunday addressed what is perhaps at the heart of the impasse.

He said the House, which is drafting its own plan, cannot agree to a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Rather, he wants a ""pathway to legalization"" -- in other words, allow some illegal immigrants a shot at a green card, but not full-fledged citizenship.

The pathway to citizenship, though, is a cornerstone of the Senate-passed bill, and any Democrat-backed plan. Increased border security, better enforcement of businesses and an expansion of the legal immigration system make up the rest of the bill.

Putting the issue in stark terms, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told ""Fox News Sunday"" that if Republicans strip the pathway to citizenship, ""no Democrat"" would support it.

The confrontation over the pathway to citizenship and other planks of the bill could continue to frustrate lawmakers on both sides, and in both chambers, as they try to sustain the momentum from this past week's Senate vote.

The bill passed Thursday with a strong majority of 68 senators voting in favor. Schumer cited the bipartisan support for the bill, as well as the motive of political survival, in claiming that House Speaker John Boehner would ultimately be compelled to pass it.

""I believe that by the end of this year, the House will pass the Senate bill,"" Schumer said.

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, speaking on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" also suggested that Republicans' desire to ""win a presidential race"" would guide them toward supporting some version of the legislation.

But what's in store for the bill might not be so clear. And there is no easy resolution to the stand-off over the proposed pathway to citizenship.

House Republicans, in the near-term, are approaching the immigration overhaul in a piecemeal fashion, tackling a series of smaller-scale bills meant to address what the Senate covered in one massive piece of legislation.

Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., also speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" rejected Schumer's prediction.

""I was moved almost to the point of tears by Senator Schumer's concern for the future prospects of the Republican Party,"" Gowdy said, sarcastically. ""But we're going to not take his advice.""

He added: ""The Senate bill is not going to pass in the House. It's not going to pass for myriad reasons.""

He, like other House Republicans, questioned Senate promises that their bill would offer legalization to illegal immigrants in the near-term while eventually building border security and immigration enforcement for employers.

Boehner spokesman Michael Steel also told FoxNews.com that the speaker and his caucus have been ""perfectly clear"" on their intentions.

""The House will not simply take up and pass the Senate bill,"" he said in an email. ""Our legislation will reflect our principles, particularly on border security. Wishful thinking, frankly, is not a strategy for getting a bill to the president's desk.""

Schumer methodically made his case Sunday for why he thinks Boehner will, in the end, bring the Senate bill to the floor.

Aside from citing the various political pressures weighing on the speaker, Schumer said the strategy of passing smaller-scale bills would not work. He said, for instance, that Democrats would not support an enforcement bill without the promise of a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Factor in Republicans who refuse to support any immigration bill, Schumer said, and those bills cannot pass.

He claimed Boehner would ultimately be left with a choice between doing nothing and bringing the Senate bill to a vote, relying largely on Democrats to pass it.

Goodlatte, though, insisted that Republicans would take a ""step-by-step"" approach.

Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" he said ""we want to see enforcement improved and actually enforced, and we want to find the appropriate legal status for people who are not here lawfully.""

Asked about his opposition to the pathway to citizenship, he explained he didn't want a ""special pathway to citizenship, where people who are here unlawfully get something that people who have worked for decades to immigrate lawfully do not have."""

No one is arguing that the entire Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional. Section 2 is the most important part of the act. It gives people the right to challenge discriminatory laws in court. It applies to the entire nation. It is constitutional, and it will continue to protect all Americans.

What is unconstitutional is a different part of the act, Section 5. Section 5 applies only in a few states. Unlike any other law, Section 5 requires states to get permission from federal bureaucrats before making changes to their voting laws. This is costly, and Section 5 requires it even when the change is obviously lawful. For example, when parts of Alabama were evacuated recently because of a hurricane, local officials had to divert attention away from making people safe so they could get federal permission to postpone elections scheduled for that day.

Section 5 was supposed to be a short-term, emergency measure. It was constitutional when it prevented Southern officials from openly defying the Constitution in 1965. But the question before the Supreme Court is whether Congress had power, in 2006, to extend this measure for 25 more years. The answer is no. Congress could not conclude that a generation of people with no connection to the tragic events of the 1960s would be untrustworthy until 2031.

Alabama is not perfect on race relations, but we have seen great progress. Minority voter registration is better here than in states that don't have to comply with Section 5. The federal government hasn't rejected a statewide law in Alabama under Section 5 in 16 years. And the challenge from Alabama's Shelby County, which is before the Supreme Court today, has shown why unreliable data about Section 2 cases are no basis for treating states unequally. The problems Alabama faces today are not different than those faced by every other state in our Union.

Bull Connor, the Birmingham official who turned fire hoses on children in the 1960s, has been dead 40 years. The children of today's Alabama are not racist, and neither is their government. It is time for states covered by Section 5 to become equal parts of these United States.

Luther Strange is Alabama attorney general."

Meanwhile, if the bill were generous at all toward immigrants it would almost certainly lose those Republican members who oppose immigration reform of any kind; if it was harsh toward immigrants it would presumably lose moderates and those conservatives who believe that support for immigration is the proper conservative position.

Inmates in two-thirds of the state’s 33 prisons, and at all four out-of-state private prisons, refused both breakfast and lunch on Monday, said corrections spokeswoman Terry Thornton. In addition, 2,300 prisoners failed to go to work or attend their prison classes, either refusing or in some cases saying they were sick.

The corrections department will not acknowledge a hunger strike until inmates have missed nine consecutive meals. Even so, Thornton said, Monday’s numbers are far larger than those California saw two years earlier during a series of hunger strikes that drew international attention.

Despite the widespread work stoppages and meal refusals, Thornton said state prisons operated as usual through the day. “Everything has been running smoothly,” she said. “It was normal. There were no incidents.”

The protest, announced for months, is organized by a small group of inmates held in segregation at Pelican Bay State Prison near the Oregon border. Their list of demands, reiterated Monday, center on state policies that allow inmates to be held in isolation indefinitely, in some cases for decades, for ties to prison gangs.

Though prison officials contend those gang ties are validated, the state last year began releasing inmates from segregation who had no evidence of gang-related behavior. Nearly half of those reviewed have been returned to the general population.

The protest involves the same issues and many of the same inmates who led a series of protests in California prisons two years ago. At the height of those 2011 hunger strikes, more than 11,600 inmates at one point refused meals. The correction department’s official tally, which counts only those inmates on any given day who have skipped nine consecutive meals, never rose above 6,600.

http://news.yahoo.com/rubio-warns-obama-could-act-legalize-immigrants-195638391.html,,[],Rubio warns Obama could act to legalize immigrants,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio warned Tuesday that if Congress doesn't pass immigration overhaul legislation, President Barack Obama may act on his own to legalize the 11 million immigrants already in the U.S. illegally.

Rubio, a potential presidential candidate and an author of the sweeping immigration bill that passed the Senate in June but stalled in the House, noted that the Obama administration took action a year ago to give legal status to many immigrants brought here illegally as children. He said without congressional action, the president might well be tempted to do the same for everyone else here illegally, too.

""I believe that this president will be tempted, if nothing happens in Congress, he will be tempted to issue an executive order like he did for the DREAM Act kids a year ago where he basically legalizes 11 million people by the sign of a pen,"" Rubio said on ""The Morning Show with Preston Scott"" on Tallahassee radio station WFLA.

Rubio said the possibility highlighted the need for congressional action because the alternative would be legalization without benefits like border security and an E-Verify system to require employers to check their workers' legal status.

""We can't leave it, in my mind, the way it is because I think a year from now we could find ourselves with all 11 million people here legally under an executive order from the president, but no E-Verify, no more border security, no more border agents — none of the other reforms that we desperately need,"" Rubio said.

The White House disputed Rubio's comments.

Asked whether Obama would be ""tempted"" to issue executive orders as Rubio suggested, White House spokesman Bobby Whithorne said, ""No. The only solution to this problem is for Congress to fix the broken immigration system by passing comprehensive reform.""

Rubio's comments came with lawmakers back home in their districts for Congress' five-week summer recess, which activists on both sides of the immigration issue are trying to use to make their case for or against action in the GOP-controlled House.

Story continues

Under pressure from advocates for reform, several House Republicans have already indicated qualified support for a path to citizenship for the immigrants already here illegally, something that's part of the Senate bill but opposed by many conservatives. Meanwhile those opposed to reform struggled to draw a crowd to a ""Stop Amnesty Tour"" event in Richmond, Va., Monday night.

But it remains unclear whether one side will clearly prevail come time for lawmakers to return to Washington in September, or what will happen then. GOP House leaders have said they plan to proceed with the immigration issue with single-issue bills, beginning with border security, so it remains to be seen whether they'll get to the point of entering negotiations with the Senate on a package that could reach Obama's desk.

Rubio's comments Tuesday tracked with speculation sometimes heard from immigration activists on the left about how to move forward if Congress never sends Obama a bill. The possibility of pressuring Obama to take additional executive actions has been discussed, though most advocates with ties to the White House say it's premature to focus on that idea.

Good morning!” black conservative activist and media personality Wayne Dupree, known online as “News Ninja 2012,” said as he fired up the crowd at Freedom Plaza in downtown Washington, D.C. “I still can’t hear you! Good morning, America!”

Dupree walked through how he served in the U.S. military and how he “can say, proudly say, that I have great personal interest in what goes on in my country.”

“We fight for this country because we believe in its greatness,” Dupree said. “We believe in this Democracy. And we believe in freedom for all citizens. And we will continue to fight and defend and preserve those freedoms for our citizens.”

Dupree went on to argue that “the real reason why we’re here today, July 15, here on Freedom Plaza, is because we hear the battle cries, and Washington calling for us Americans to stand up and fight.”

Dupree then railed on the “Gang of Eight” Senate immigration bill. “This legislation is nothing but a wish list written by corporate lobbyists and checked off by career politicians in order to exploit cheap labor and fill campaign coffers for the next election,” he said. “This legislation robs us of the American dream and it undermines our Democratic process. We the People have been called upon to protect our freedom, and we do this with a smile on our faces and patriotism in our hearts.”

“This is not racist,” Dupree added later in the speech. “Let me say that again: This is not racist! This is an American thing. It’s not because we’re ‘hate-mongers who discriminate against those that want a better life.’ We cannot allow people who defy our laws, threaten our national security, and threaten our economy to redefine what America stands for. No way. Not without a fight.”

Dr. King, a dedicated Baptist minister with brilliant oratory skills, the academic prowess of a scholar, and the wisdom of an ancient sage, faithfully and courageously challenged America to embrace his dream of a better, stronger and united America.

King dreamed of a day that black children and white children would live in a nation where they would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

He made an earnest appeal to all men and women from all faiths, nationalities and ethnicity to embrace freedom and justice for all.

[pullquote]

If Dr. King were alive today, he would be 84. What kind of America would he see?

How would he respond to the heated racial debate in the land stemming from the death of Trayvon Martin and the not guilty verdict in the George Zimmerman trial?

What would he do to address the black on black crime in our cities?

What would King say about the racial disparities in health, education, employment and incarceration?

What would King say about the role of the Church in all of this?

Based on the speeches, essays, letters and books that Dr. King has written, I believe today he would take note of the various extreme points of view being discussed in today's public square

He would listen to people agitate, bloviate, instigate and aggravate. Then he would seek to elevate, motivate and demonstrate God's view for healing the painful wounds of the past and bridge the deep divide with the bonds of reconciliation.

In 1963, as he sat in a Birmingham jail, he wrote about becoming an extremist to deal with the extreme issues of hate and division.

He advised Americans to become more like Jesus as an extremist in love -- ""Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, pray for them who despitefully use you.""

King posed a question to all Americans; should we become extremists of hate or extremists of love?

In terms of education, Dr. King would continue to strongly encourage African-Americans to view education as the gateway out of poverty.

King applauded the constant streams of African-mericans who were completing college. But today, he would be concerned about the rising trend towards illiteracy in the black community.

Dr. Howard Fuller, co-founder of the faith-based Black Alliance for Educational Options poignantly put it this way: ""On February 6, 1960, four black students from North Carolina A&T College go to a segregated lunch counter at Woolworths in Greensboro and demand to be served. Today in 2013, four black students who are now welcome at the lunch counter sit down and can't read the menu. How does that happen?""

Fuller, who drew inspiration from his parents and Dr. King to seek an education and rise from the housing projects of Milwaukee, Wisconsin to eventually become the city's first Black Superintendent of Schools believes King would be disappointed by the state of education in the black community.

Indeed, in his address to the Golden Anniversary Conference of the National Urban League in 1960, King sighted the steady decline of crippling illiteracy as a major factor in the rapid educational advances among blacks.

He believed education, along with faith in God, and a non-violent struggle against oppression would broaden the thinking of black Americans, provide a larger view of the world, but also a larger view of themselves. Sadly, some of us have taken our eyes off the prize.

Dr. King would be troubled by the current and disturbing trends of violence in the black community.

He would be heartbroken to see the alarming rate of black on black violence in Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and other urban areas. He would likely conduct peace marches through the heart of these killing fields.

He would challenge all Americans; but particularly blacks to do something about the violence; to increase the peace on the streets in urban America.

In an article he wrote for Ebony magazine in 1966 titled ""Nonviolence: The Only Road to Freedom in 1966, King sounded the alarm that it is a moral imperative to be non-violent: ""Only a refusal to hate or kill can put an end to the chains of violence in the world and lead us toward a community where men can live together without fear. Our goal is to create a beloved community.""



As King addressed the issues of his time and promoted a society of brotherhood, he wanted to avoid being looked upon as a super and unrealistic optimist in an age of cynicism and pessimism.

He wrote on page 64 of his book, ""Struggle to Love"": As we struggle to defeat the forces of evil, the God of the universe struggles with us. Evil dies on the seashore, not merely because of man's endless struggle against it, but because of God's power to defeat it.""

Dr. King did, and still does, encourage all of us to come to the table of brotherhood, to discuss our differences openly and honestly, to work and pray for a peace that surpasses all understanding.

Dr. King would remind us that in everything we do, we must act in love. Not in some sort of sentimental love.

He explained it would be difficult for men to love their enemies or oppressors in an affectionate sense. Because of that, he pushed the concept of Agape love. He explained that Agape love is not sentimental or affectionate, but is a reciprocal love.

A person will love out of a redeeming good will for mankind. It is the kind of sacrificial love that seeks nothing in return.

King wrote in ""Facing The Challenge of A New Age,"" ...on the Agape level we love men not because we like them, not because their attitudes and ways appeal to us, but because God loves us. Here we rise to the position of loving the person who does the evil deed while hating the deed that the person does...we will be able to stand...with dignity and discipline.""

As a child, I recall being excited to hear Dr. King speak. His words resonated with the same hopeful message that I received from June, my single parent mother.

Their words spoke promise into my soul. They made me feel that if I maintained my faith in God, gained knowledge of the world through a good education, plus worked hard in my career, and then I could accomplish anything.

My mother fervently believed that. She frequently used the words of Dr. King, the Bible, and her own wisdom to help me along my rocky journey to manhood.

One quote from Dr. King that my mother often shared with me is something we should all consider living by, ""If I can help somebody as I travel on, if I can help somebody with a word or a song, If I can help somebody who is traveling wrong, then my living will not be in vain.""

Now is the time to help somebody. Now is the time to follow in King’s footsteps and become drum majors for peace. Now is the time for us to “live together as brothers or perish together as fools.”"

Raul Labrador (R-ID) has officially left the House version of the “Gang of Eight” after Democrats–led by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a House aide familiar with the discussions told Breitbart News–went back on a prior agreement-in-principle during the talks.

Originally, according to Labrador, the House group had agreed hat illegal immigrants would be required to cover their own health care costs and not have access to Obamacare. When the talks moved along, though, the Democrats went back on their promise and began insisting that illegal immigrants get access to government healthcare.

That prompted Labrador to abandon the group on Wednesday evening, as the left was not negotiating in good faith, he said. A House aide confirmed to Breitbart News that Pelosi–who was not a member of the House immigration group–was the leader of the charge in pushing health care for illegal immigrants, even though the Democrats in the group had originally agreed to the compromise.

“I have tremendous respect for the members of the bipartisan group who have been working with me to fix our broken immigration system,” Labrador said in a statement. “But after today’s meeting, the framework of the bill has changed in a way that I can no longer support. Like most Americans, I believe that health care is first and foremost a personal responsibility. While I will no longer be part of the bipartisan ‘Group of Eight’ House negotiators, I will not abandon my efforts to modernize our broken immigration system by securing our borders and creating a workable guest worker program. I remain hopeful that the House can pass a bill around these principles and I will keep fighting to make it happen.”

Pelosi’s office has not returned a request for comment from Breitbart News for this story.

Labrador had been working with Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL), John Carter (R-TX), Sam Johnson (R-TX), Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), Xavier Becerra (D-CA), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) and John Yarmuth (D-KY).

Labrador’s move comes on the heels of a report from Breitbart News that a high-ranking Senate aide said Rubio is searching for a way out of the Senate Gang of Eight.

“Rubio and his staff are trying to get out of the Gang of Eight,” the aide said. “They’re looking to use other Republican members as their parachute to get out.”"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/opinion/immigration-reform-and-workers-rights.html,2013-02-21 00:00:00,[],Immigration Reform and Workers’ Rights - The New York Times,"Members of Congress and President Obama have been working in earnest to deliver on their promise to overhaul immigration this year. Mr. Obama would clearly prefer a bipartisan bill, and last week the Senate Judiciary Committee held its first hearing on possible changes in immigration law. News reports last weekend suggested that the White House would fashion its own bill should negotiations between Republican and Democratic supporters of reform collapse.

Yet, in all the talk of providing a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented workers while tightening border security, one important issue has, so far, received only passing mention: stronger protections for immigrant workers against exploitation and abuse. Such protections, essential to any reform plan, would help rid the system of bottom-feeding employers who hire and underpay and otherwise exploit cheap immigrant labor, dragging down wages and workplace standards for everyone.

Such abuses are easily visited on immigrant workers by unscrupulous employers who use the threat of deportation to force their victims into silence. This imbalance of power harms workers who toil in the shadows. But the system that recruits legal temporary workers is also a mess. In the event that an immigration overhaul greatly expands the number of guest workers — even hard-line Republicans have been talking about adding temporary visas in agriculture and in high-tech industries — it is crucial to avoid making the mess even bigger.

A new report by a coalition of labor, immigrant and human-rights groups has identified and examined “disturbingly common patterns” of abuse in America’s guest-worker programs. They are an alphabet-soup of visas with names like H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, J-1 and A-3, all having their own rules and little in common except, the report said, workers who are frequently victimized by “fraud, discrimination, severe economic coercion, retaliation, blacklisting and, in some cases, forced labor, indentured servitude, debt bondage and human trafficking.”"

http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/12/24/army-dont-say-christmas/,2013-12-24 00:00:00,['Todd Starnes'],Army: Don’t say Christmas,"Don’t say Christmas.

That’s the message that was conveyed to a group of soldiers at Camp Shelby by an equal opportunity officer from the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute, according to a soldier who attended a recent briefing.

“It’s unbelievable that the Army would ban ‘Christmas’ like it’s a bad word,” said Michael Berry, an attorney with the Liberty Institute, a legal firm representing the unidentified soldier.

Two weeks ago, a routine meeting was held at the Mississippi base with various leaders of the 158th Infantry Brigade. During the meeting, they discussed an upcoming Christmas football tournament. The equal opportunity officer immediately objected to the usage of the word “Christmas.”

“Our equal opportunity representative stopped the briefing and told us that we can’t say Christmas,” the soldier told me. “Almost the entire room blew up. Everybody was frustrated. The equal opportunity rep told our commander that not everyone celebrates Christmas and we couldn’t say Christmas celebration. It had to be holiday celebration.”

The soldier said there was a brief, but heated discussion about political correctness. At one point, the equal opportunity representative tried to deflect the criticism by pointing out it was the Army’s rules – not hers.

“She said an individual can say Christmas, but as an organization in the Army you can’t say Christmas,” the soldier told me.

So what does the Army have to say about the DEOMI officer’s edict?

“There is no policy at the 158th Infantry Brigade, First Army Division East or First Army that forbids using the word ‘Christmas’,” Public Affairs Chief Amanda Glenn told me.

She confirmed that there was a discussion in the meeting about the football tournament. She said it was meant to be a team building event and it had no tie to a specific religious event or holiday celebration.

“The Equal Opportunity advisor simply stated that it would be more appropriate to call it a holiday football event,” she said.

But Attorney Berry tells me that it was made very clear to the soldiers in the room that the name change was not merely a suggestion.

“She stated that the word Christmas had to be replaced with the word holiday,” Berry said.

The soldier who contacted me said it was just another instance of the military trying to curtail public expressions of the Christian faith.

“Between the Air Force and the Army – it’s like they don’t like Christian values, they don’t like the word Christ or Christmas,” the soldier said. “They don’t like you talking about it.”

Berry said it’s a shame that the Army has implemented word police.

“Are they going to have the ‘Merry Christmas’ police going around issuing citations to an soldier who slips and says the word?” he wondered. “They’re treating Christmas like it’s pornography. As a matter of fact, the Army actually treats pornography better than it does Christmas.”

It’s not the first time Equal Opportunity officers have caused trouble at Camp Shelby. Earlier this year, I reported exclusively about a briefing at Camp Shelby that labeled the American Family Association as a domestic hate group.

After my story was published, the Secretary of the Army ordered military leaders to halt all briefings on extremist organizations that labeled Evangelical Christian ministries as domestic hate groups."

Jan Brewer has lost again.

Gov. Jan Brewer has lost again.

In a 7-2 decision announced Monday morning , the Supreme Court of the United States has rejected the state of Arizona's efforts to add a proof of citizenship requirement to voter registration forms. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (a/k/a ""The Motor Voter Law"") requires States to “accept and use” a uniform federal form to register voters for federal elections, and the Court now holds that states cannot graft additional requirements onto that form, which only requires that voters affirm that they are citizens.

Justice Scalia—yes, him—wrote the decision of the court, a majority consisting of everyone other than Justices Thomas and Alito. It relies on the Elections Clause of the Constitution (Art. I, §4, cl. 1), which provides that while states have preliminary control over federal elections, Congress can supersede the states' choices:

The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the places of chusing Senators.

When Congress legislates with respect to the “Times, Places and Manner” of holding congressional elections, it necessarily displaces some element of a pre-existing legal regime erected by the States. Because the power the Elections Clause confers is none other than the power to preempt, the reasonable assumption is that the statutory text accurately communicates the scope of Congress’s preemptive intent. Moreover, the federalism concerns underlying the presumption in the Supremacy Clause context are somewhat weaker here. Unlike the States’ “historic police powers,” the States’ role in regulating congressional elections—while weighty and worthy of respect—has always existed subject to the express qualification that it “terminates according to federal law.” In sum, there is no compelling reason not to read Elections Clause legislation simply to mean what it says. We conclude that the fairest reading of the statute is that a state-imposed requirement of evidence of citizenship not required by the Federal Form is “inconsistent with” the NVRA’s mandate that States “accept and use” the Federal Form. If this reading prevails, the Elections Clause requires that Arizona’s rule give way.

And, basically, the Court holds that when the NVRA says the states must ""accept and use"" the federal form, it must accept and use them as sufficient to register voters:The majority notes that the state may use information in its possession to refuse to register a voter, but it cannot require the voter to show her papers first. At most, Arizona can ask the federal Elections Assistance Commission (EAC) for permission to amend its form, as Louisiana did in 2012 to require applicants who lack a Louisiana driver’s license, ID card, or Social Security number to attach additional documentation (such as a utility bill) to the completed Federal Form.

Arizona loses. Voters win. What else? How about a solo Thomas dissent!

http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/the-family-unfriendly-act/,2013-05-10 00:00:00,['Teresa Tritch'],The Family Unfriendly Act,"There are two good things to say about the Working Families Flexibility Act, which passed the House this week with 220 Republican and three Democratic votes.

One, the bill is bound to go nowhere in the Senate and, two, even if it did advance, the White House has threatened to veto it.

The bill, in brief, is worse than meritless; it is a fraud. According to its Republican backers, it’s an expression in legislative form of how much they care for families, work-life balance and, in particular, working women. If this is caring, I would hate to see what contempt looks like.



The bill would amend long-standing labor law by allowing private-sector employers to offer compensatory time off in lieu of time-and-a-half pay for overtime. Employers and workers are supposed to agree on the arrangement, but there is nothing to stop an employer from discriminating against those who prefer payment by cutting back on their overtime hours. Nor would employers face any real deterrent against forcing unpaid overtime on workers who fear losing their jobs if they object. The recourse for coerced workers would be to sue, a far-fetched and unaffordable option for most people.

For employers, then, the bill is a way to impose extra work at no additional cost, effectively shifting what would otherwise be worker pay into corporate profits.

For employees who won’t work overtime without extra compensation, the likely result would be fewer hours and overall less pay. For those who will, the likely result would be greater unpredictability in scheduling, which only creates more work stress, as well as higher costs for work related expenses like child care, but with no additional money to meet those expenses.

Now, what about having more time off? Under the bill, employees can use their comp time only at the employer’s convenience. If employees are unable to get timely approval for using the comp time, or decide not to use it, they can ask to cash it in, at which point the employer has 30 days to pay up.

The bill’s Republican supporters have stressed that government workers can accrue comp time in place of overtime pay, implying that private sector workers are missing out on a perk enjoyed by cossetted public sector workers. Wrong. Government employers don’t need to turn a profit, and thus do not have the same incentive as private sector employers to push workers into unpaid overtime. Government employees, who tend to be in unions — as well as private sector unionized workers — also have contracts with safeguards around alternative work and pay arrangements.

For the record, there are many ways for Congress to improve both worker pay and work life balance, including raising the minimum wage, instituting paid sick leave, ending discriminatory pay practices, easing the formation of unions and promoting advance notice for worker scheduling. The House bill ignores what is helpful and embraces what is harmful."

Convicted killer Todd Ashker and three other inmates — representing the Mexican Mafia, Nuestra Familia and the Black Guerrilla Family — called for a mass hunger strike July 8, largely to protest indefinite incarceration in solitary confinement.

Though segregated from others, the leaders, who dub themselves the Short Corridor Collective, have kept the protest going, with more than 600 inmates still refusing food.

Among the four, Ashker is the most outspoken of the collective and the legal brains behind the strike.

Some prisoner-rights advocates describe the intense and sometimes volatile man as a brilliant champion for California’s 130,000 prisoners.

Armed with a prison law library and a paralegal degree earned behind bars, Ashker, 50, has filed or been party to 55 federal lawsuits against the California prison system since 1987, winning the right for inmates to order books and collect interest on prison savings accounts.

“There’s an element within [the Department of Corrections] who would celebrate some of our deaths with a party,” Ashker wrote to The Times in March after prison officials denied access to him.

But others say Ashker is a danger, accusing him of being an Aryan Brotherhood member bent on freeing gang leaders from solitary confinement so they can regain their grip on the prison system.

“We’re talking about somebody who is very, very dangerous … who has killed somebody in a pre-meditated way,” said Philip Cozens, Ashker’s court-appointed defense lawyer in a 1990 murder trial.

Terri McDonald, who ran California’s 33 prisons until a few months ago and now runs the Los Angeles County jail system, said Ashker and his compatriots in the Short Corridor Collective are not fighting for rights, but power.

“From my perspective, they are terrorists,” she said.

Ashker has spent nearly all his adult life in California’s prison system — and much of that time, he has been in solitary confinement.

Born outside Denver, he wound up in Northern California after his father ran afoul of the law. Lewis Ashker is serving a life sentence in South Dakota for the 1985 murder of a retired police officer during a botched attempt to steal the man’s gun collection.

Advertisement

Ashker’s mother remarried and moved away in the late 1970s, leaving her son with a friend in Contra Costa County, according to his parole transcripts.

Ashker was 13 when he threatened another student to get his lunch money. It was the first of a long series of transgressions — among them truancy, DUI and burglary — that put him in juvenile halls and boys ranches for most of his youth.

Advertisement

Ashker ascended to state prison in 1982 at age 19 after being convicted of burglary. Five years later, housed at New Folsom State Prison near Sacramento for a second burglary, he stabbed another inmate 17 times.

According to testimony at his murder trial and a subsequent parole hearing, Ashker attacked the Aryan Brotherhood gang member while another inmate held a mattress over the door to block the guards’ view. Prosecutors said the killing was a hit ordered by the white supremacist gang. Ashker contended he was acting in self-defense.

During the trial, a defense witness — another prisoner and member of the Aryan Brotherhood — pulled an 8-inch shank and stabbed Ashker’s attorney four times.

Cozens, the attorney, believes the attack was an attempt to provoke a mistrial. The judge ordered the wounded lawyer to finish the case. Ashker drew a 21-years-to-life sentence for second-degree murder.

In the 1980s, the Department of Corrections started building high-security prisons with isolation blocks called “security housing units” — known by inmates as the SHU, pronounced “shoe.” California now has four SHU prisons, holding more than 4,500 men whom the state calls “the worst of the worst.”

The toughest facility was built at Pelican Bay State Prison near the Oregon border. Ashker arrived there in 1990.

Advertisement

The Pelican Bay SHU is divided into pods of eight cells stacked four-wide and two-high, facing a blank wall. There are no bars. Each steel door is perforated to let in air and light.

Once a day, that door slides open. The prisoner can enter an empty concrete “dog run” for 90 minutes to exercise.

Advertisement

Kept indoors for years, men in the SHU take on a ghostly pallor, as if dusted with flour. They get less canteen food than do other inmates, less clothing, and are allowed limited belongings, fewer visits and no phone calls. Every privilege, from mail to medical care, is rationed.

For those accused of gang involvement, the SHU is an indefinite sentence. More than 400 have been inside Pelican Bay’s SHU for more than a decade; 78, including Ashker, have been held there for more than two decades.

Advertisement

They have common complaints of anger, anxiety, depression, insomnia, inability to concentrate and loss of a sense of time, according to report by a psychiatrist retained by civil rights lawyers challenging the use of long-term solitary confinement.

“Conditions in the SHU may well hover on the edge of what is humanly tolerable,” U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson wrote in1995.

Advertisement

An air of brutality hangs over the SHU. Present on a recent visit was a drawing on guard lockers of a large and bloody Homer Simpson clad in the uniform of an officer. The grinning figure held a dripping knife in his meaty fist.

Some of those working with Ashker say that within this harsh environment he has changed, leaving behind violence to become an activist for inmate rights.

Prison officials “are so stuck in the gang business they can’t think people have evolved,” said Anne Weills, a former Black Panther activist who represents Ashker and other Pelican Bay inmates in a federal lawsuit tied to the hunger strike, alleging that long-term isolation is torture.

Prison officials reject the idea of Ashker’s change.

The top prison gang leaders of California are held together in one wing of Pelican Bay, called the Short Corridor, on the theory that it is easier to control them in one place, corrections officials said.

As a result, the leaders of the strike have shared adjacent cells.

In addition to Ashker, the collective includes Antonio “Chuco” Guillen, described in court papers last week as a top general of Nuestra Familia, and Arturo “Tablas” Castellanos, a Mexican Mafia leader. California corrections officials say the fourth is Ron Dewberry, a member of the militant Black Guerrilla Family who calls himself Sitawa Nantambu Jamaa.

Ashker, in a message to The Times, described the group as “a collective effort initiated by a multiracial group of long-term, similarly situated (SHU) prisoners who decided enough is enough.”

Advertisement

In August 2012, the collective issued a two-page “agreement to end hostilities” between racial groups in the prisons, focusing inmates against a common enemy — the Corrections Department — and “informers, snitches, rats and obstructionists.”

“We can no longer allow CDCR to use us against each other for their benefit!!” the agreement said.

Advertisement

The isolation of Pelican Bay helps break down racial and ethnic barriers, said Denis O’Hearn, a sociology professor at Binghamton University in New York who had Ashker and other Pelican Bay inmates correspond with students in his classes.

“It created some idea where [the prison system] is ‘them,’ and we as prisoners are ‘us,’ ” he said.

Advertisement

In 2009, O’Hearn sent Ashker a copy of his book on the prison hunger strike of Irish Republican Army member Bobby Sands, who died after 66 days of his fast. The book made the rounds of the Short Corridor.

After a group of Ohio inmates staged their own hunger strike in early 2011, Ashker said, the idea of a California protest was launched and “spread via the grapevine.”

Advertisement

Inside the SHU, the grapevine typically means communicating cell-to-cell by “fishing,” slinging a note to the cell next door with thread or shouting into the drain pipes that run beneath the prison and connect the pods.

The hunger strikers also relied on prison activists and lawyers who could carry messages to the outside.

Advertisement

For months leading up to the hunger strike, prisoner-rights organizations reprinted strike leaders’ writings in newsletters and mailed the publications to inmates across California.

Two hunger strikes staged by the Short Corridor Collective in 2011 ended after three weeks. Ashker vowed that this one would be different.

Advertisement

“We’re at war,” he wrote in a 2012 letter published by a prisoner advocacy group, “and the people in power are scared to death, and they should be.”

Since the protests began, Ashker and the other leaders have been put into even deeper isolation at Pelican Bay.

Sure, it would take a little chutzpah for Mr. Obama to nominate three D.C. Circuit judges at once. The move dares Republicans to filibuster confirmation of the appointments or to turn tail. It would also cheer liberals who want to flip the conservative tilt of the D.C. Circuit, not merely to see well-qualified judges serve. But it would take gall for Republicans to filibuster qualified nominees to bona fide openings on the D.C. Circuit on the grounds that Mr. Obama is trying to pack the court. That logic could be used to criticize any nomination that might upset the ideological disposition of an appeals bench. The president doesn’t just get to appoint judges to vacancies when the stakes are low.

The authors met in occupied Baghdad in 2009, when the book was conceived. Strolling among the ruins, the two became excited that consumer technology was transforming a society flattened by United States military occupation. They decided the tech industry could be a powerful agent of American foreign policy. ... “The New Digital Age” is, beyond anything else, an attempt by Google to position itself as America’s geopolitical visionary — the one company that can answer the question “Where should America go?” It is not surprising that a respectable cast of the world’s most famous warmongers has been trotted out to give its stamp of approval to this enticement to Western soft power. The acknowledgments give pride of place to Henry Kissinger, who along with Tony Blair and the former C.I.A. director Michael Hayden provided advance praise for the book.

Julian Assange , the editor in chief of WikiLeaks, looks at a new book by Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen and opines on how Google's cheery motto masks a desire to become the techno-cultural might behind America's actions abroad.I don't necessarily agree with Assange's assumption of evil in this government plus tech pairing, but in light of the Araújo and Cardenal article, is this the fight we're really facing for world domination: Google against China? Is state-allied technology the answer to state-managed capitalism? (And hey, boys and girls, for 100 points, state-managed capitalism is not fascism because...?)

The New York Times highlights the very real effects of Republican grandstanding in the Senate.

A United Nations report, “The State of the World’s Children,” underscores the moral bankruptcy of Senate Republicans who blocked ratification of a treaty to help disabled people around the world. ... A United Nations convention would ban discrimination against persons with disabilities and accord them the same rights as those without disabilities. It has been ratified by 127 countries and the European Union. President Obama has signed it, but, in December, the Senate, though supporting the convention by a hefty 61 to 38, fell five votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for ratification. This was mostly because Senate Republicans caved in to far-right ideologues who contended, erroneously, that the convention would infringe on American sovereignty, usher in socialism, and allow United Nations bureaucrats to prohibit home-schooling or wrench disabled children from their parents’ arms.

According to the Tea Party, anything the United Nations does, anything other nations do, hell, anything our nation does, is intrinsically evil, and necessarily the first step in an Vast Evil Conspiracy. Never forget that the real threat isn't disease or discrimination; what's really hurting these kids is government gun grabbers taking away their right to buy bulk quantities of assault rifles without a background check.

James Marsh wants a little less jingoism with his baseball, please.

I am a Methodist minister and a Washington Nationals fan. I was there on Opening Day in 2005 at old RFK Stadium, and I try my best to plan my summer around Nats home games. I have only one issue with the ballpark experience, and it’s not with the beer prices. It’s with “God Bless America.” ... One hot Sunday afternoon last season, I did not rise for “God Bless America.” In a beer-soaked tone of voice that wasn’t pleasant, a gentleman several rows behind me told me to stand up. I reminded him that I don’t have to. This incident made me think more about the question: I love this country and don’t want to live anywhere else. But being pressured to stand up at a baseball game for a song that’s essentially a prayer seems, well, un-American. It feels like being pushed into the river for a baptism I didn’t choose. It’s an empty ritual, and one that I think doesn’t hold much theological water.

I'd like to argue that we drop the song for another reason: it's a crappy song. How about singing a verse or two of ""This land is your land"" or maybe just ""America the beautiful."" I can never get pastwithout actually tearing up.

Leonard Pitts looks at arguments that start ""I know this may seem racist, but...""

It seems Bill has an idea. Given that “all of the radical terrorists have been Muslims,” he wants the government to mount a program to surveil every follower of Islam who immigrates to these shores. We are, claims reader Bill, “faced with a population who swears an oath to God to kill Americans — not Canadians, not Mexicans, but Americans.” It is, he says, “time we protect ourselves.” ... Bill’s point is clear enough. And his anger is understandable, coming as it does after the Boston Marathon bombing and the savage butchering of a British soldier by Islamic extremists. Predictably, the UK has suffered a rash of right-wing demonstrations and attacks on mosques ever since Lee Rigby’s death. One suspects there’d be no shortage of sympathy for Bill’s suggestion — and for measures even more draconian — both there and here. But I find myself thinking about white boys. Consider: This nation’s recent history is stained by repeated acts of school violence. From Newtown, Conn., to West Paducah, Ky., to Santee, Calif., to Eugene, Ore., to Conyers, Ga., to Pearl, Miss., to Jonesboro, Ark. to DeKalb, Ill., to Littleton, Colo., we have seen scores of people killed and injured. The violence has been random, large scale and indiscriminate, identical to terrorism except that it has no political motive. And the profile of the assailants is virtually always the same: white boys and young men from suburban, small town or rural communities.

The ""tea party"" is back and is brewing trouble for the Republican establishment. After the GOP debacle in the 2012 election, when Republicans not only failed to win the presidency but blew a chance to take over the Senate, party leaders paused to consider what had gone wrong. The Republican National Committee issued a scathing report warning that the party was in ""an ideological cul-de-sac"" and resolved to act friendlier toward women, minorities and low-income voters. Strategist Karl Rove said the lesson was to nominate more moderate candidates and set about raising money to do just that. But tea party and other conservative leaders, undaunted, drew the opposite conclusion."

USA TODAY

Two decisions on race illustrate court%27s methodical move to right

Business interests won big in recent term%2C as did libertarians

It%27s the Roberts Court%2C but Anthony Kennedy holds the key

WASHINGTON — Same-sex marriage won the biggest headlines on the last day of the Supreme Court's term, but the two days that preceded it provided the story line.

First came the court's seemingly minimalist decision on college affirmative action programs. After more than eight months of incubation, the ruling kicked the case back to lower federal courts with instructions to scrutinize more closely the University of Texas' system of racial preferences.

Both sides claimed victory, but perhaps only those opposed to affirmative action should have been happy. For the very next day, the court followed a similarly minimalist decision on voting rights issued in 2009 with its successor: a ruling that drove a stake through the heart of the nation's most cherished civil rights legislation.

Taken together, the two race-based cases illustrate the increasingly clear pattern of the court under Chief Justice John Roberts. Its tenuous conservative majority doesn't always act quickly, but it does act eventually — and it doesn't mind uprooting a few precedents or statutes along the way. What happened to the Voting Rights Act this term could happen to affirmative action programs in the future.

""Roberts recognizes that sometimes the best strategy for moving the law is 3 yards and a cloud of dust, rather than a touchdown bomb,"" says Doug Kendall, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. ""In a lot of the cases this term, you see the court moving slowly but surely to the right.""

Not always: The court's 5-4 decision striking down the key section of the Defense of Marriage Act was in many ways the ideological opposite of the voting rights ruling.

What tied the two together was a deference to states' rights — but not to Congress, which passed DOMA in 1996 and reauthorized the Voting Rights Act a decade later, both with overwhelming majorities.

""This continues to be a very confident court,"" says Paul Clement, a former U.S. solicitor general under President George W. Bush who has argued 69 cases before the justices, including seven during the term that concluded Wednesday. ""They're not particularly inclined to be overly deferential.""

With one exception, apparently: In most of the business cases that came before the court this term, corporations won and consumers lost. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious in 14 of 17 cases in which it took a position — a testament to the court's conservative tilt since Associate Justice Samuel Alito replaced Sandra Day O'Connor in 2006.

That pattern can be seen in cases involving class action litigation, which the court frowns upon, and mandatory arbitration, which it tends to like.

""The statistics bear out that this term and every term of the Roberts court has been more pro-business than the average Supreme Court over the last 50 years,"" says Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general in the Obama administration who appears frequently at the lectern.

The court also displayed a libertarian streak and a willingness to clamp down on what it sees as the government's expansive use of federal power, says Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank that emerged with a winning percentage similar to the Chamber of Commerce's.

By contrast, the Department of Justice, which represents the Obama administration before the court, was on the winning side less than 40% of the time.

The court is dominated by Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote, who takes a skeptical view of government power and is sympathetic to individual rights. He alone among the nine justices was in the majority on the Defense of Marriage Act, the Voting Rights Act and the affirmative action case.

""Anthony Kennedy is a swing justice who swings against legislation,"" says Akhil Reed Amar, a constitutional scholar at Yale University. ""He basically trusts judges and is skeptical of legislators, including Congress.""

Kennedy's vote proved critical in nearly all the cases decided by 5-4 majorities, and there were plenty — nearly 30% of the court's 77 cases. Among them were rulings that police can collect DNA from people arrested but not convicted of serious crimes, as well as two workplace discrimination cases won by employers over employees.

On the other hand, nearly 50% were decided unanimously, including some of the term's most important cases. The justices ruled 9-0 that human genes cannot be patented and corporations cannot be held liable for international human rights violations with no direct link to the United States.

Perhaps it was the bevy of controversial cases, but the justices spent most of the term trying to get a word in edgewise, much to the chagrin of the attorneys standing before them. They asked an average of about 117 questions, or nearly two per minute, during oral arguments, according to meticulous statistics kept by Scotusblog.com — a cacophony that Roberts said has forced him at times to ""act like an umpire.""

Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the most frequent questioner, while Justice Clarence Thomas, by custom, asked none at all. Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the angriest conservative dissents, while Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did so for the court's liberals. Alito and Justice Elena Kagan asked perhaps the most incisive questions of the term.

The bravest justice was Stephen Breyer, who broke his shoulder in a biking accident in late April but didn't miss a beat on the bench.

It was Roberts who kept the court on its even keel, inching it to the right without appearing to do so — at least not to the general public. Polls continue to show that liberals are slightly more satisfied with the court's actions than conservatives.

""He understands public relations,"" says Caroline Fredrickson, executive director of the liberal American Constitution Society. ""The idea that the public is left with a court that's maybe not as conservative as it might be portrayed by the liberal media is probably exactly what he wants.""

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/28/california-tax-exempt-boy-scouts/,2013-08-28 00:00:00,['Joshua Rhett Miller'],"California pols could target tax status of Boy Scouts, youth groups over 'discrimination'","California lawmakers are cruising toward a final vote on a bill that could threaten the tax-exempt status of American-as-apple-pie groups — ranging from the Boy Scouts to Little League — if their membership policies are found to be discriminatory.

If passed, the bill, SB 323, would remove an exemption from state taxes for any nonprofit youth group that discriminates on the basis of “gender identity, race, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or religious affiliation.” Well-known organizations like Girl Scouts of the USA, Boy Scouts of America, and Little League International Baseball and Softball were cited in the bill, which was introduced in February by Democratic state Sen. Ricardo Lara.

Lawmakers are not accusing groups like Little League and the Girl Scouts of having discriminatory policies. The bill appears to be aimed more at the Boy Scouts, as Lara pushed the legislation on the heels of the controversy surrounding the Boy Scouts' policy to exclude gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people as scouts or adult leaders. The national organization later voted to allow gay youth membership, but maintained its ban on openly gay adult leaders.

Lara told reporters earlier this month that the Boy Scouts' decision was not good enough for him, and continued to push the bill.

Youth groups say they hope they won't be affected. Brian McClintock, a Little League International spokesman, told FoxNews.com on Wednesday that the group already does not discriminate against any person on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, marital status, gender, sexual orientation or disability.

“In order to be an officially chartered Little League, any local organization must adhere to this policy for all players and volunteers,” McClintock wrote in an email.

Joshua Ackley, a Girl Scouts spokesman, echoed McClintock, saying the group values “diversity and inclusiveness” among its 3.2 million youth and adult members.

“While Girl Scouts of the USA does not comment on legislation, we value diversity and inclusiveness, and our membership is representative of our diverse communities,” Ackley wrote. “Girl Scout membership does not discriminate on any basis, including race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity.”

The bill cites more than 20 groups, including the Boy Scouts of America and Little League International Baseball and Softball, as examples of organizations that could be affected by the legislation if passed.

Lara could not be reached for comment early Wednesday.

“Our state values the important role that youth groups play in the empowerment of our next generation; this is demonstrated by rewarding organizations with tax exemptions supported financially by all Californians,” Lara said in a February statement. “SB 323 seeks to end the unfortunate discriminatory and outdated practices by certain youth groups by revoking their tax exemption privilege should they not comply with non-discrimination laws.”

The bill, which passed both the Assembly Tax and Revenue and Judiciary committees earlier this month, could see a final vote as early as this week. In June, the bill received a two-thirds vote in the Senate, the first time an LGBT-themed bill reached such a threshold in the state’s history, according to Equality California.

“California does not tolerate discrimination and we certainly shouldn’t pay for it,” Equality California Executive Director John O’Connor said in a statement. “Organizations that discriminate against a young person or leader because of who they are or who they love should be sent a clear message – discrimination has a real cost!”

Deron Smith, a spokesman for the Boy Scouts of America, declined to specifically address the legislation in a statement to FoxNews.com.

""The focus of our 23 local Boy Scouts councils across the state of California is to deliver the Scouting program to more than 180,000 youth, many of whom are disadvantaged and at risk,"" the statement read. ""Scouting gives young people the opportunity to develop skills and take responsibility while inspiring a lifetime of character and service."""

(CNN) —

I’m a big fan of Michelle Obama’s, but if she’s going to be hitting the circuit to raise money for Democrats, she has to be prepared for heckling. Especially heckling from gay rights activists like the one who interrupted her speech Tuesday night.

“Lesbian looking for federal equality before I die.” That’s how Ellen Sturtz, the woman identified as the heckler, identified herself.

Apparently the first lady’s husband said something about signing an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

ESPN LZ Granderson

Sturtz had the nerve to ask the president to keep his word.

And it’s not like signing an order will rock Washington’s world – as The Washington Post pointed out, of the “employees of federal contractors that are in the Fortune 1000, 92% are already protected by a company-wide sexual orientation nondiscrimination policy, and 58% are already protected by a gender identity nondiscrimination policy.”

Still President Barack Obama made a promise: It’s not unreasonable to expect him to keep it.

Especially when one out of every 16 of his “bundlers” – those who organize super fund-raisers – during the 2012 election was openly gay. The Washington Post says of his top 2012 bundlers, one in six was gay. And that more than 75% of voters who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender voted for him. And yet the changes Obama has wrought since he was first elected often feel as if they’re being handed out like doggie treats, and not championed with the same urgency that Democrats showed on the campaign trail.

Heckling the first lady wasn’t fair because she isn’t responsible for policy. But the incident sent a message to those who are responsible: We are people, not pawns.

But this is what happens when a bloc of voters – be it the LGBT community, Latinos, women – surrenders its voting power to a political party as opposed to a principle. Not all Republicans are anti-gay, not all Democrats are pro, and it’s the rare politician who will do something “bold” that isn’t politically expedient.

In Illinois, the House of Representatives, controlled 71-47 by Democrats, chose not to vote on same-sex marriage legislation, with some members saying they needed to talk it over with their constituents. A rationale that doesn’t hold much water because the Senate passed the bill 34-21 in February. State Sen. Jason Barickman, a Republican, voted in support of same-sex marriage after adding a religious liberty amendment to the bill.

Many activists are pointing fingers at the Illinois House Legislative Black Caucus for not playing ball. This seems ironic, considering the first item under the subject line “What Are They Fighting for?” is civil equality.

State Rep. Ken Dunkin, chairman of the Black Caucus, did not return my calls. But he did tell the Windy City Times that it was unfair to pin the bill’s failure on the caucus, adding, “This is not the Black Caucus’ burden.”

Because lord knows black folks have nothing to do with gay folks, right Ken?

Gregory Angelo, the Log Cabin Republicans’ national executive director, told me that “if there’s any lesson to learn from this is that Democrats can’t pass marriage equality on their own. They need Republican support.”

And the LGBT community would be wise to remember that. The Republican Party may house the most vocal, and sometimes offensive, opponents – but that doesn’t mean that all Democrats are proponents or courageous enough to fight. The Senate Republicans in Rhode Island became the first legislative caucus in the country, of either party, to vote unanimously for same-sex marriage.

The truth is the Illinois Democrats promised to bring the bill to a vote and they didn’t. It’s likely they are stalling to see what the U.S. Supreme Court decides in the two same-sex marriage cases it heard this spring. Decisions are expected later this month. The Illinois House has until August 31 to vote.

This is a little political cover that may be smart but flies in the face of the party’s national platform: “We oppose discriminatory federal and state constitutional amendments and other attempts to deny equal protection of the laws to committed same-sex couples who seek the same respect and responsibilities as other married couples.”

But Democrats have trampled on that promise before, and fairly recently.

In 2009, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said he supported marriage for same-sex couples. But he recently opposed an amendment to the immigration reform bill that would have included same-sex couples because he thought it would make Republicans kill the bill. The Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee didn’t even want to vote on it. Basically Schumer wants same-sex couples to get married in his home state – but if you’re binational, he’ll let the government deport your spouse.

So the LGBT community gets tossed under the bus – again – as if our families are not worth voting for. As if we don’t deserve a public record of which Democrat is for us and which is against us.

Heckling Mrs. Obama wasn’t fair to her.

But taking the LGBT community for granted isn’t fair to us either.

Some see a source of tax revenue,"WASHINGTON — As America’s road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car.

The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America’s major roads.

The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances. Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them — then use the information to draw up a tax bill.

The tea party is aghast. The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issues.

And while Congress can’t agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting. They are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over. Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive.

“This really is a must for our nation. It is not a matter of something we might choose to do,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025. “There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes. The technology is there to do it.”

The push comes as the country’s Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke. Americans don’t buy as much gas as they used to. Cars get many more miles to the gallon. The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn’t gone up in 20 years. Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high.

“The gas tax is just not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota. His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system. “This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term,” he said.

Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee. It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example. California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state’s ambitious global warming laws. But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has said he, too, sees it as the most viable long-term alternative. The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile.

“This is not just a tax going into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason. “People are paying more directly into what they are getting.”

The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction.

The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars. But the House leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town.

Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own. The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country’s biggest experiment. Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state. Nevada has already completed a pilot. New York City is looking into one. Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks. And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change.

The concept is not a universal hit.

In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers’ cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move.

“Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation. “It was not something people wanted.”

As the trial got underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices.... There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals’ everyday comings and goings.”

Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, but not exactly where and at what time. If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable.

The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage. The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers. It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage. But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don’t use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.

“People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage. “There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs. There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.”

In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices. They can choose a device with or without GPS. Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents.

Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more, not less. In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide “pay-as-you-drive” insurance, and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.

“Motorists would be attracted to participate … because of the value of the benefits it offers to them,” says a city planning document.

Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction. At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes. An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don’t use much gas, so they pay their fair share.

“There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, the commission’s director of legislation and public affairs. “If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things.”

But we can’t do that because the media would be on me about that.”

Scholars and students of film often use the phrase “breaking the fourth wall.”

This is the moment when suspension of disbelief is removed, and the film “winks” at the audience in a moment where the latter are made to realize that what they are seeing is not real, and its creators (and actors) are choosing to obey—or break—genre conventions.

Scholars who study race and racial ideologies often talk about how in the post civil rights United States racism has moved from what they call “the front stage” (the public and the readily seen) to the “backstage” (what is more hidden and private).

Consequently, being called a “racist” is the impetus for public shaming and exile. In response, white racism has moved to private spaces, uses humor and comedy as a shield, and takes refuge online.

Food celebrity Paula Deen’s admission in a recent anti-discrimination lawsuit that she routinely uses racial slurs such as “nigger”, and how she yearns for a return to Jim and Jane Crow America, is an almost perfect moment where she broke the metaphorical fourth wall of racism in the Age of Obama.

In her deposition she explained how:

[W]hen asked if she wanted black men to play the role of slaves at a wedding she explained she got the idea from a restaurant her husband and her had dined at saying, “The whole entire waiter staff was middle-aged black men, and they had on beautiful white jackets with a black bow tie.

“I mean, it was really impressive. That restaurant represented a certain era in America…after the Civil War, during the Civil War, before the Civil War…It was not only black men, it was black women…I would say they were slaves.”

Such images remain potent in American popular culture. And for some white folks of a certain age, as well as those possessed of a conservative, Right-wing political orientation, such images embody “real America”, and a ""simpler"" time before black and brown folks ""forgot their place"", the gays and lesbians came out of the closet, and women embraced feminism.

Paula Deen also embodies the moment of “race and reunion” that occurred after America’s Civil War. In the aftermath of a conflict which took at least 750,000 lives, whites in the North and former Confederacy had to find a way to come together as a whole and intact political community.

The solution: reimagining the Confederacy’s illegal acts of treason and secession as a noble lost cause.

North and South were both invested in White Supremacy and creating a society wherein African-Americans were a subordinated and dominated class of people.

Race and reunion involved a rewriting of American history such that slavery was remade into a benign and civilizing institution: the plantation was an idyllic and wonderful place. In this twisted vision, African-Americans, especially men, would descend into idleness, rapine behavior, and be a threat to white civilization unless they were controlled by violence and lynch law.

This lie of a noble and idyllic South, with its happy loyal slaves, continues to cast a shadow over post civil rights America.

For example, movies such as Gone with the Wind remain popular. Civil War reenactors march off as members of the Confederacy; they see themselves as good men involved in a futile struggle—not as agents defending white supremacy and racial terrorism. Award winning music groups such as Lady Antebellum channel a nostalgic view of the pre-Civil War South through the white racial frame in order to depict a historical milieu of white supremacy that ought to be yearned and pined for by their audiences.

Ultimately, Paula Deen’s desires are White yearnings for black subordination and submission.

As the Jim Crow Museum details, the black mammy maid figure is a lie which does the social and political work of convincing white people that black women (and other people of color) live to serve them. The black butler or Tom figure does similar work. They are both two-dimensional characters who are asexual, robbed of their full humanity, and eager to serve white people.

Such figures remain iconic. See the caricatures Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima in almost every American supermarket.

Stories of resistance to these White fantasies are also removed from the dreams of Paula Deen and the White conservatives who yearn for a return to “real America.”

Those happy smiling black maids were also peeing in food and taking their monies to help support the nascent Civil Rights movement. Nameless black butlers and Pullman Car porters—those men named “George”—were freedom fighters readying to resist and mobilize against White Supremacy.

The election of the country’s first black president is symbolically potent. Paula Deen’s desire for a return to Jim and Jane Crow is a reflection of a broader anxiety among the White American body politic and collective subconscious.

There, black and brown folks should be maids and butlers. A black family is in the White House. America’s demographics are changing because of immigration. Therefore, a particular type of Whiteness feels particularly imperiled in this social and political moment. Whatever one thinks of Obama's policies, for a good portion of Red State America, it is the fact of his personhood and blackness that is the real affront and crime.

What is the result? Movies and TV shows that emphasize the destruction of America and the White House since the election of Barack Obama. There are also forthcoming historical biopics such as The Butler about a noble black servant who served a series of presidents in the White House across several decades. TV shows such as Devious Maids fulfill the type-casting and stereotype of Hispanics and Latinas as natural servants.

Paula Deen’s fantasy of black and brown compliance, surrender, and subordination has connections to some of the country’s most ugly moments since the election of Barack Obama.

Birtherism, and Republican Joe Wilson's heckling of President Barack Obama during his State of the Union Address in 2009 is a parallel to Paula Deen’s fantasy.

Conspiranoid fantasies of Secession and a second Civil War are also part of this national derangement on the part of the White Right and Tea Party GOP. The murder of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, and how Republicans have rallied to Zimmerman's defense, is a reflection of a foundational assumption that black people must always be subservient, and surrender to White authority--as well as those overly identified and enamored with it--in any circumstance.

Projecting forward, at the end of her saga Paula Deen will be forced to publicly apologize for her racism. In that moment, and keeping with script, she will also channel some tears in order to get back into the good graces of her fans.

I believe that Paula Deen should be given an award for being so real and transparent about her racial attitudes. She exposed the backstage of white racism in post civil rights America.

Paula Deen is not alone in her feelings; Paula Deen's biggest sin is that she was just too honest and forthright for her own good."

Rick Perry, who has said he hopes to make abortion “a thing of the past,” signed the legislation in July. It had been temporarily derailed when Wendy Davis, a Democratic state senator, mounted an 11-hour filibuster in the Republican-controlled Legislature. Ms. Davis is now running for governor, with abortion rights as one of her planks.

Texas officials quickly said they would appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, and Judge Yeakel said that “at the end of the day, these issues are going to be decided definitively not by this court, but by either the Circuit or the Supreme Court of the United States.”

Courts in Alabama, Mississippi, North Dakota and Wisconsin have blocked similar admitting-privilege requirements as part of the continuing battles over how much states may restrict the right to abortion granted by Roe v. Wade in 1973.

Monday’s ruling was hailed by the chief executive of Whole Woman’s Health, a private group that had warned that it could be forced to close its clinics in McAllen, Fort Worth and San Antonio because those clinics use visiting doctors who cannot obtain admitting privileges locally. “We are very relieved,” said the chief, Amy Hagstrom Miller.

In bringing the suit against two parts of the sweeping anti-abortion law adopted in July, abortion rights groups said that the provisions would have “dramatic and draconian” effects on women’s access to the procedure. But lawyers for the state argued that these predictions were exaggerated and that the measures served the state’s interest in “protecting fetal life.”"

U.S. District Judge Kurt Engelhardt's temporary restraining order says the city can only enforce the limits in an area near the Superdome, where the game will be played Feb. 3. The city had also planned to enforce the rules in the French Quarter and surrounding neighborhoods.

The judge's ruling comes after the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of an activist and a street preacher. They claimed a new city ordinance and a code enforcement guide trample on their free speech rights and limit their activities leading up to the title game between the Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers.

The ACLU claims New Orleans adopted the new policies at the behest of the National Football League.

""The NFL asked them to do a whole bunch of things, including this,"" said ACLU of Louisiana executive director Marjorie Esman.

Esman said other Super Bowl host cities have enforced similar rules in recent years, but they have never been challenged in court before.

Engelhardt's order says the plaintiffs showed a ""likelihood of success"" in arguing that enforcing a broader ""clean zone"" is impermissible under the First Amendment. He scheduled a meeting Monday with lawyers for the city and ACLU to discuss the latter's request for a preliminary injunction.

""It's wonderful that the judge recognizes the city doesn't have a right to curtail speech throughout a large chunk of the city,"" Esman said.

The city, Mayor Mitch Landrieu and Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas are named as defendants in the suit. A spokesman for the city didn't immediately respond to a call and email seeking comment.

The judge didn't immediately act on the group's request for a court order barring the city from enforcing the ""clean zone"" limits, which are scheduled to take effect on the morning of Jan. 28 and end on the evening of Feb. 5.

The ordinance, passed last month, says banners, flags and signs aren't prohibited in the ""clean zone"" without the OK of the city or the NFL. The content of any temporary signs approved by the city must consist of at least 60 percent Super Bowl or NFL branding. The guide, meanwhile, says no signs will be permitted unless the applicant is an NFL sponsor, the suit says.

The plaintiffs are Tara Jill Ciccarone, an Occupy NOLA member, and Troy Bohn, pastor of a religious congregation that regularly preaches on Bourbon Street."

USA TODAY

White student%27s case against University of Texas took eight months to decide

First major ruling on racial preferences at universities in 10 years

Case was one of the biggest on high court%27s docket for 2012-13

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court drew new limits on colleges' use of affirmative action Monday, saying that although racial preferences remain constitutional, they are permissible only if schools can first show that there are ""no workable race-neutral alternatives.""

The court's 7-1 decision, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, suggests that public schools can use affirmative action only as a last resort for creating a diverse student body, and raises the prospect that colleges will face a tougher burden of justifying them in the future.

But the justices stopped short of issuing a broader decision either fully cementing or eliminating schools' ability to take account of an applicant's race.

Kennedy wrote that public universities could adopt affirmative action plans only if they can demonstrate that ""no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the benefits of educational diversity.""

The decision came in a closely watched challenge to the University of Texas at Austin's admissions policy that is based, in part, on applicants' race. But the justices declined to decide whether the university's program met that tough new standard.

Instead, they said that a lower federal court had acted too deferentially by, in essence, taking the university's word for the fact that such preferences were necessary. They instructed the lower court to hear the case again, and this time to require the university to prove that it had no other way to assemble a diverse student body.

""Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a school's assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without a court giving close analysis to the evidence of how the process works in practice,"" Kennedy wrote. ""The university must prove that the means chosen by the university to attain diversity are narrowly tailored to that goal.""

Kennedy was joined by the court's conservative justice and two of its liberals, Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the case.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a four-page dissent, saying the lower court already had enough evidence. Even the university's purportedly race-neutral method of accepting the top 10% of students from all high schools uses race as a factor, she said, because of segregated neighborhoods.

""Only an ostrich could regard the supposedly neutral alternatives as race-unconscious,"" she said. ""It is race consciousness, not blindness to race, that drives such plans.""

Why it took more than eight months to issue what was a fairly short, 13-page decision remained a mystery Monday, raising images of the justices pushing and pulling Kennedy, the court's perennial swing vote. In the end, the ruling was unremarkable in its likely effect, keeping the court in between proponents and opponents of racial preferences.

NEXT STEP UP TO LOWER COURTS, SCHOOLS

How the decision will play out remains to be seen, and could depend on how well colleges are able to justify their policies to lower courts. The decision left in place -- at least for now -- the University of Texas' affirmative action plan.

Advocates on both sides of the often-fraught debate over the use of race in higher education said they saw reasons for optimism, even if none of them got precisely what they wanted from the court.

""It's extremely disappointing that the Supreme Court did not affirm the constitutionality of the University of Texas affirmative action plan,"" said Barbara Arnwine, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. ""But it's not a total loss because for the time being, the University of Texas plan is still in place.""

Edward Blum, who was instrumental in bringing the case to the high court as head of the Project on Fair Representation, said the decision almost certainly spells the end of affirmative action at the University of Texas at Austin and other schools.

""The Supreme Court has established exceptionally high hurdles for the University of Texas and other universities and colleges to overcome if they intend to continue using race preferences in their admissions policies,"" he said. ""It is unlikely that most institutions will be able to overcome these hurdles.""

Abigail Fisher, the woman who challenged Texas' plan, said in a statement, ""I am grateful to the justices for moving the nation closer to the day when a student's race isn't used at all in college admissions.""

A decision calling into question the continued use of race in college admissions had been widely anticipated in light of the court's ruling in 2003 narrowly upholding the University of Michigan's use of racial preferences. At that time, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said such programs should be obsolete within 25 years; O'Connor, who has since left the court, was on hand when Kennedy announced Monday's decision.

Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, said they were prepared to declare affirmative action unconstitutional. Thomas, the court's lone African American, wrote in a separate opinion that in his view, ""use of race in higher education admissions decisions is categorically prohibited."" He said admissions policies that help blacks can work against them by placing them at universities where they cannot succeed, so that ""the university's racial tinkering harms the very people it claims to be helping.""

But none of the other justices seemed ready to adopt that view.

ABBY FISHER'S DENIAL TRIGGERED LAWSUIT

Denied admission to the University of Texas in 2008, Fisher claimed her only fault was being white. ""I didn't take this sitting down,"" she said before oral arguments last October.

""There were people in my class with lower grades who weren't in all the activities I was in who were being accepted into UT, and the only other difference between us was the color of our skin,"" she said in a video posted by the Project on Fair Representation, a conservative group that solicited her case. ""For an institution of higher learning to act this way makes no sense to me.""

The university's policy was to accept the top 10% of students from each Texas high school, which because of housing patterns produced a relatively diverse class. It then filled out its freshman class by assessing a number of factors including race – a system it said was devoid of quotas or numerical targets but was designed to achieve what it called ""critical mass.""

The school — backed by others that use affirmative action programs to increase the percentage of minorities gaining admission — argued that a diverse student body contributes to a well-rounded educational experience for all.

It was supported by 73 ""friend of the court"" briefs filed by a broad array of universities, student groups and athletics coaches, as well as federal, state and local government officials, business executives and retired military leaders. They argued that diversity in education is needed to assure a steady stream of qualified minority applicants for public service, private enterprise and the armed forces.

Though the court upheld the University of Michigan law school's affirmative action program in 2003, it struck down the undergraduate school's program and cautioned that the days of racial preferences should be numbered. It has since accepted for its next term the state of Michigan's defense of its constitutional amendment barring racial preferences in education, employment and contracting.

Since the 2003 decision, the court has taken a turn to the right, thanks to Justice Samuel Alito replacing O'Connor. By the time the Texas case was argued in October, five justices were on record opposing racial preferences.

For that reason, college administrators and civil rights groups feared that the court could issue a sweeping declaration against such preferences affecting not only public universities but possibly private schools, such as Harvard and Yale, that receive federal funds.

Still, Monday's decision reaffirmed that educational diversity remains a compelling government interest, freeing public schools to use otherwise impermissible racial classifications.

""While the decision requires the university to jump through additional hoops to demonstrate that their methods for creating diversity are appropriate, it does reaffirm diversity as a compelling interest,"" said Neera Tanden, president of the liberal Center for American Progress.

ROOTS IN 1950 INTEGRATION CASE

The case hearkened back to 1950, when Heman Sweatt sued the university after being denied admission because he was black. As his attorney, Sweatt chose Thurgood Marshall, who would go on to become the high court's first black justice. He won the case, marking the first time the court had ordered a black student admitted to an all-white institution.

Since then, colleges and universities have become more integrated. In Grutter v. Bollinger, the court's 5-4 decision upholding the Michigan law school's limited use of affirmative action, O'Connor predicted, ""The court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.""

That case wasn't a slam dunk for the civil rights movement. At the same time, the court ruled 6-3 against the undergraduate school's more numerical system of racial preferences. And O'Connor's decision upholding the law school's racial preferences included a dissent from Kennedy, now the swing vote on the court.

""Preferment by race, when resorted to by the state, can be the most divisive of all policies, containing within it the potential to destroy confidence in the Constitution and in the idea of equality,"" Kennedy said then.

Four years later, in a decision that barred voluntary integration programs in the Seattle and Louisville public schools, Chief Justice John Roberts issued one of his most oft-quoted lines: ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.""

Two members of the court were being watched closely in this case: Justice Thomas, the lone black justice, who has written that his Yale Law School degree was devalued by racial preferences; and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the lone Hispanic, whose recent book, My Beloved World, credits affirmative action for giving her access to Princeton and Yale.

In the end, the ruling was so narrow that both Thomas and Sotomayor signed on.

Kagan recused herself from the case, presumably because she was involved with it during her tenure as solicitor general at the Justice Department in 2009-10.

Republicans might not give a damn about women , but at least they give a damn about winning in 2014. Via The Hill:This is really starting to look pathetic. House Republicans allowed VAWA to expire last year because they considered it unacceptable that ""women"" should include lesbians, immigrants and Native American women. So once again, the Senate overwhelmingly—and yes, with bipartisan support—passed it. And once again, House Republicans just aren't sure if they can bring themselves to even hold a vote on it.

But at least, according to The Hill, some Republicans are starting to think about how opposing this heretofore uncontroversial legislation might have some negative side effects. Like, say, on Election Day in 2014. West Virginia Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, for example, said, ""It is far, far past due to reauthorize VAWA."" Gee, ya think?

Capito and a handful of other House Republicans are suggesting that maybe they should get over themselves and their weak-tea objections to the Senate's bill, but it's not as if they've had a change of heart and suddenly want to embrace those very women they've been saying do not deserve protection from rape and abuse. Republicans aren't about to have a change of heart on non-white non-straight women. But this just might be reason enough for them to have a change of heart on the bill:



The 2012 election cycle saw Republicans up and down the ballot face accusations that they were “out of touch” on women’s issues — a Democratic argument that gained traction with voters following inopportune comments about rape and pregnancy by Republican Senate candidates in Missouri and Indiana. National exit polling showed 55 percent of women voted for House Democratic candidates, compared to 45 percent who supported House Republicans. The presidential race saw an identical gender gap in favor of President Obama.

Yeah. Turns out the Republicans' War on Women did not bode well for Republicans in the last election, and if they don't do something to change the perception that, you know, they're bad for women, they just might be looking at another gaping gender gap in next year's election.

That's the ugly reality House Republicans are starting to accept—especially those blue state Republicans who will be particularly vulnerable in 2014—which is why they sent a letter this week calling on their party leadership to hold a vote and pass the damn bill already. So will they?





@jbendery via web Boehner on VAWA: ""No decision"" yet on whether the House will take up the Senate bill or move our own version.

Yeah. Don't hold your breath. Instead, sign the petition from Daily Kos and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee urging House Republicans to protect all women by passing the Senate version of the expanded, bipartisan Violence Against Women Act."

Eventually, she’ll probably take the plunge — just not yet. In the meantime, though, she can execute an impressive maneuver from lower heights.

In other words, the justices seemed tempted to put off deciding the question of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. But they appear, at least reading the oral-argument tea leaves, prepared to take the significant step of overturning the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and granting full federal benefits to same-sex couples in states that recognize their marriages.

Indeed, the juxtaposition of the two cases may have the beneficial effect, from the perspective of those supporting same-sex marriage, of making the DOMA case look like a relatively easy and modest move.

Ultimately, will a majority of the court find that the Constitution protects the right of gay and lesbian couples to marry? Maybe it’s wishful thinking, but the comments in Tuesday’s arguments on California’s Proposition 8 suggested the possibility of a skittish, tenuous majority inclined toward finding a right.

1 of 41 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Historic moment for gay marriage at Supreme Court View Photos Oral arguments in the legal battle to extend the right of marriage to same-sex couples — and to grant federal recognition of such unions — was difficult to imagine even a decade ago. Caption Oral arguments in the legal battle to extend the right of marriage to same-sex couples — and to grant federal recognition of such unions — was difficult to imagine even a decade ago. March 27, 2013 College student Adam Sulier, brandishing a sign supporting same-sex marriage rights, rides on the shoulders of classmate Cam Tucker while waiting in front of the Supreme Court. Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the likely swing vote, worried openly about the court being asked “to go into uncharted waters.” But, he told Charles Cooper, who was defending the ban, “there are some 40,000 children in California” who “want their parents to have full recognition and full status. The voice of those children is important in this case, don’t you think?”

Actually, what Cooper thinks doesn’t matter. But if Kennedy is hearing those voices, that signals where in those uncharted waters the court may end up.

The two days of oral argument underscored how difficult it is for opponents of marriage equality to concoct a convincing case for limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples. Cooper was reduced to citing the state’s supposed interest in “responsible procreation,” within the context of marriage.

Yet as Justice Elena Kagan pointed out, this rationale explains why same-sex couples might not be included in the definition of marriage — it doesn’t provide a basis for excluding them, any more than couples too old to have children could be barred from marrying.

The next day, the argument from Paul Clement, supporting DOMA on behalf of Republicans in the House of Representatives, boiled down to the alleged federal need for “uniformity” in administering benefits.

Again, Kagan: “Historically, the only uniformity that the federal government has pursued is that it’s uniformly recognized the marriages that are recognized by the state.”

Indeed, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out, discriminating against same-sex couples is hardly uniform. “You are treating the married couples differently,” she said. “You are saying that New York’s married couples are different than Nebraska’s.”

Ann Telnaes animation: Another reason for diversity on the Supreme Court. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

The arguments also illustrated how far the legal and political debate on gay rights has come. Just 27 years ago, the court ruled, in a case since overturned, that states could, consistent with the Constitution, criminalize homosexual conduct. At the Proposition 8 arguments, Cooper — the lawyer for the anti-gay rights side — took pains to make clear how much his argument for treating gays differently was limited to matters of marriage.

Sotomayor: “Outside of the marriage context, can you think of any other rational basis . . . for a state using sexual orientation as a factor in denying homosexuals benefits or imposing burdens on them? . . . Denying them a job, not granting them benefits of some sort, any other decision?”

Cooper: “Your honor, I cannot.”

Likewise, in the DOMA case, Chief Justice John Roberts, seeking to head off the claim that laws discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation should be subject to heightened scrutiny by courts, cited the increasing political power of gays and lesbians.

“As far as I can tell, political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your side of the case,” he told Roberta Kaplan, representing Edith Windsor, a New York woman who had to pay an extra $300,000 in extra estate taxes after her spouse died.

As Justice Samuel Alito noted in the Prop 8 case, the court is being asked to render judgment “based on an assessment of the effects of this institution, which is newer than cellphones or the Internet.” That explains the court’s understandable edginess about wading into the issue right away. But, like cellphones and the Internet, same-sex marriage is here to stay — and destined to be back before the high court.

Singh was pulled over in January for a flat tire, and was harassed by the state's Department of Transportation officers who wrongly assumed that his kirpan, a small spiritual sword that is a religious article for Sikhs, was illegal. They taunted him as a ""terrorist"" and arrested him for refusing to obey ""an officer's lawful command,"" reports the ACLU.

On his March 26th court date, Judge Aubrey Rimes of the Pike County Justice Court ejected him from the courtroom stating that Singh would not be allowed to re-enter unless he removed ""that rag"" from his head.

Singh's attorney confirmed that Rimes expelled him due to his turban. However, Singh's faith mandates the covering and he believes that to unwrap it in public would be both sacrilegious and shameful.

A subsequent Department of Justice investigation prompted the Pike County Board of Supervisors to revise the County's non-discrimination policy to say that religious discrimination includes, ""requiring an individual to remove a head covering or denying that individual access to a County office, building, program or activity because they are wearing a head covering, if that head covering is worn for religious reasons.""

American Sikhs often encounter misunderstandings about their faith, and a Stanford University survey published earlier this month revealed that though almost all turban-wearers in America are Sikh, about 70% of Americans misidentify turban-wearers as Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, or members of the Shinto faith. The survey also discovered that nearly half of Americans think that Sikhism is a sect of Islam, and more associate the turban with Osama bin Laden rather than with the Muslim and Sikh alternative.

The letter comes on the heels of yet another incident of Sikh harassment, as Columbia professor Dr. Prabhjot Singh was brutally attacked in Harlem on Saturday night, beaten by a hate mob who called him ""terrorist,"" and ""Osama."""
http://news.yahoo.com/march-focus-continued-fight-civil-rights-074203940.html,,[],March to focus on continued fight for civil rights,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Alice Long planned months ago to use vacation time to travel from Huntsville, Ala., to the 50th anniversary events for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

Long, a NASA administrative assistant, brought along her grandchildren to give them a close-up view of African-American and civil rights history that she said isn't being taught in schools.

""I'm here supporting this march because there are so many injustices in this country,"" Long, 59, said on the eve of Saturday's march from the Lincoln Memorial to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. ""I'm very concerned about it because I have a 5-year-old grandson and a 13-year-old granddaughter.""

Marchers began arriving early Saturday to gather on the National Mall, many staking out their spots as the sun rose in a clear sky over the Capitol. By midday, tens of thousands had gathered on the National Mall.

Eric Holder, the nation's first black attorney general, thanked those who marched a half century earlier. He said he would not be in office, nor would Barack Obama be president, without them.

""They marched in spite of animosity, oppression and brutality because they believed in the greatness of what this nation could become and despaired of the founding promises not kept,"" Holder said.

Holder said the spirit of the 1963 march now demands equality for gays, Latinos, women, the disabled and others. Keeping with that theme, those in attendance represented a grab-bag of causes advocating gay rights, organized labor, voting rights and access to local post offices.

Organizers have planned for about 100,000 people to participate in the event, which is the precursor to the actual anniversary of the Aug. 28, 1963, march. It will be led by the Rev. Al Sharpton and King's son Martin Luther King III. After several speeches, participants will walk the half-mile from the Lincoln Memorial to the 2-year-old memorial.

Those in attendance arrived in a very different, post-9/11 Washington.

Story continues

In 1963, people crowded the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and could get close to King to hear his speech. On Saturday, metal barriers kept people away from the reflecting pool.

Only a small group of attendees was allowed near the memorial. Everyone else has been pushed back and was watching and listening to the speeches on big-screen televisions. Police were stationed atop the Lincoln Memorial. There was a media area and VIP seating.

On the day of the anniversary, President Barack Obama will speak from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, the same place King stood when he delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Obama will be joined by former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. Churches and groups have been asked to ring bells at 3 p.m. Wednesday, marking the exact time King spoke.

On Friday, a coalition of black leaders issued what they said is the 21st century agenda for the nation as it marks the watershed civil rights event that helped bring about the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The 1963 march drew some 250,000 to the National Mall and ushered in the idea of massive, nonviolent demonstrations.

The leaders named economic parity, equity in education, voting rights, health care access and criminal justice reform as national policy priorities.

National Urban League President Marc Morial said the agenda was ""by no means a complete agenda"" but one that can strengthen the unity among the coalition's members and a way to go forward in a new civil rights movement.

Throughout the buildup to the anniversary march, leaders have been acknowledging and honoring civil rights progress spurred by the 1963 march. But they also have bemoaned what they see as an attack on that progress since King delivered his stirring speech.

They cite the Supreme Court ruling that effectively erased a key anti-discrimination provision of the Voting Rights Act; persistent unemployment among African-Americans, which is about double that of white Americans; and the shooting death of unarmed black teenage Trayvon Martin and the acquittal of George Zimmerman.

Organizers of Saturday's march hoped this year's event would serve to inspire people again to educate themselves about issues they see as making up the modern civil rights struggle.

""It's very difficult to stomach the fact that Trayvon wasn't committing any crime. He was on his way home from the store,"" Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon's mother, said Friday as she prepared to participate in the march. ""Don't wait until it's at your front door. Don't wait until something happens to your child. ... This is the time to act now. This is the time to get involved.""

Logan, the founder of Decoration Day, later to be known as Memorial Day, is the fascinating tale of a man who was once a racist Democrat and later became one of the favorite generals of Ulysses S. Grant, an ardent Republican.

General Logan, who later became a senator from Illinois and was the Republican vice-presidential nominee on the ticket with James Blaine in 1884, was a member of the House of Representatives in the Legislature of Illinois in 1853.

Logan originally introduced a bill prohibiting “the immigration of free persons of color to the State of Illinois, or the setting free of slaves within the limits thereof.” It was passed in 1855, and the bill, with its supplementary enactments, became known as “The Black Laws.”

Elected as a Democratic Congressman in 1858 and 1860, during his second term Logan denounced “Black Republicans and Know-Nothings.” He later blamed radical abolitionists for John Brown’s attack on Harper’s Ferry in front of Congress:

Every fugitive slave that has been arrested in Illinois, or in any of the western States – and I call Illinois a western State, for I [am] ashamed longer to call it a northern State – has been made by Democrats. In Illinois the Democrats have all that work to do. You call it the dirty work of the Democratic Party to catch fugitive slaves for the southern people. We are willing to perform that dirty work. I do not consider it disgraceful to perform any work, dirty or not dirty, which is in accordance with the laws of the land and the Constitution of the country.

Yet this same man respected the Union and despised extremists on both sides. He said to those Southerners wanting to secede, “The election of Mr. Lincoln, deplorable as it may be, affords no justification or excuse for overthrowing the republic… We cannot stand silently by while the joint action of extremists are dragging us to ruin.”

At the start of the Civil War, Logan fought at Bull Run in a Michigan regiment, then resigned his congressional seat to become colonel of the 31st Illinois Volunteers. He would later serving under General Grant at the Battle of Belmont (where his horse was killed under him), was wounded at Fort Donelson, and then promoted to brigadier-general in March, 1862.

When Grant attacked Vicksburg, Logan was the commander of XVII Corps, the first to enter the city; when Vicksburg fell, he became the military governor.

Logan took over from General Sherman when Sherman left XV Corps and initially commanded the Army of the Tennessee at the battle of Atlanta in 1864. By the end of the war, Logan had become a radical Republican and was elected as a GOP congressman 1867. He would serve in the House until 1871, and then served as a Senator from 1871 until 1877 and again from 1879 to 1886.

While General Logan, who was known as Black Jack, was in Congress in 1868, he was still the Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic from 1868, (a position he held until 1871); on May 5, 1868, he sponsored General Order #11, which designated May 30, 1868, as a day of remembrance:

The 30th day of May, 1868, is designated for the purpose of strewing with flowers or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion, and whose bodies now lie in almost every city, village, and hamlet church-yard in the land. In this observance no form of ceremony is prescribed, but posts and comrades will in their own way arrange such fitting services and testimonials of respect as circumstances may permit. We are organized, comrades, as our regulations tell us, for the purpose among other things, “of preserving and strengthening those kind and fraternal feelings which have bound together the soldiers, sailors, and marines who united to suppress the late rebellion.” What can aid more to assure this result than cherishing tenderly the memory of our heroic dead, who made their breasts a barricade between our country and its foes? Their soldier lives were the reveille of freedom to a race in chains, and their deaths the tattoo of rebellious tyranny in arms. We should guard their graves with sacred vigilance. All that the consecrated wealth and taste of the nation can add to their adornment and security is but a fitting tribute to the memory of her slain defenders. Let no wanton foot tread rudely on such hallowed grounds. Let pleasant paths invite the coming and going of reverent visitors and fond mourners. Let no vandalism of avarice or neglect, no ravages of time testify to the present or to the coming generations that we have forgotten as a people the cost of a free and undivided republic. If our eyes grow dull, other hands slack, and other hearts cold in the solemn trust, ours shall keep it well as long as the light and warmth of life remain to us. Let us, then, at the time appointed gather around their sacred remains and garland the passionless mounds above them with the choicest flowers of spring-time; let us raise above them the dear old flag they saved from dishonor; let us in this solemn presence renew our pledges to aid and assist those whom they have left among us a sacred charge upon a nation’s gratitude, the soldier’s and sailor’s widow and orphan. It is the purpose of the Commander-in-Chief to inaugurate this observance with the hope that it will be kept up from year to year, while a survivor of the war remains to honor the memory of his departed comrades. He earnestly desires the public press to lend its friendly aid in bringing to the notice of comrades in all parts of the country in time for simultaneous compliance therewith. Department commanders will use efforts to make this order effective. By order of JOHN A. LOGAN, Commander-in-Chief N.P. CHIPMAN, Adjutant General Official: WM. T. COLLINS, A.A.G.

Logan is one of three men mentioned in the Illinois State Song, along with Grant and Abraham Lincoln.

USA TODAY

President Obama on Friday made his most extensive comments on race since entering the White House, and they are generating extensive commentary.

Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who lost the 2008 presidential race to Obama, called the president's remarks ""very impressive,"" and said they should help all Americans think about how to improve race relations in the wake of Trayvon Martin's death.

""I think we continue to make progress,"" McCain told CNN's State of the Union, but recent events show ""we still have a long way to go.""

McCain also said he wouldn't ""second guess"" the Florida jury's decision this month to acquit George Zimmerman for the death of the 17-year-old Trayvon.

During a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room Friday, Obama said all Americans should respect the Zimmerman verdict. Speaking personally and emotionally, the president also said white Americans should understand the pain that African Americans feel over Trayvon's death, and the deep suspicions they harbor about the American justice system.

""Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,"" said the nation's first African-American president, adding that ""it's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away.""

Obama's remarks dominated discussions on Sunday news shows, winning many compliments, but also some criticism.

Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., also on CNN, said he appreciates how Obama reflected the frustrations of black men who are regarded with suspicion simply walking down the street.

""That's me on a daily basis ... especially when I'm home in New Orleans and I'm dressed down,"" Richmond said, adding that only African-American males ""can really sense the anger and frustration when it happens, especially when you're doing what you should be doing.""

Journalist Tavis Smiley told NBC's Meet the Press that Obama -- who has often avoided public discussions of race during his presidency -- had to be ""pushed to that podium"" after nearly a week of protests over the Zimmerman verdict. Smiley and others said Obama needs to address the economic challenges of African-American communities, as well as problems in the justice system.

""On this issue, you cannot lead from behind,"" said Smiley, an African American.

Charles Ogletree, a law professor of Obama's at Harvard, defended his former student's efforts on race. He told NBC that Obama should not be seen as ""the black president,"" but the leader of the nation as a whole.

""He's the president who happens to be black,"" Ogletree said.

During his White House remarks, Obama called for new and better law enforcement training to help defuse tensions with minorities, and he criticized racial profiling and Florida's ""stand your ground"" law. (On CNN, McCain said he hopes his state of Arizona will review its own ""stand your ground"" law.)

The president called on Americans to do ""soul searching"" in the wake of the Zimmerman case.

""We have to be vigilant and we have to work on these issues,"" Obama said. ""And those of us in authority should be doing everything we can to encourage the better angels of our nature, as opposed to using these episodes to heighten divisions."""

A federal judge Wednesday approved a plan to place an independent monitor inside the Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff’s Office to ensure the department is not racial profiling.

Maricopa County deputies - once described by a Justice Department expert as conducting “the most egregious racial profiling in the United States” - will have every traffic stop monitored statistically and with video cameras, with strict orders to ignore suspects’ race.

U.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow’s ruling caps a class-action anti-discrimination lawsuit against Arpaio and the sheriff’s office. In May, Snow ruled that Arpaio’s office was using unconstitutional racial profiling to target and detain Latinos suspected to have entered the U.S. illegally.

The latest ruling orders the sheriff’s office to promote an internal policy “that unauthorized presence in the United States is not a crime and does not itself constitute reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that a person has committed or is committing any crime.”

Deputies making stops will have to make a radio call specifying what the stop is about. They are barred from asking someone about immigration status unless the person is suspected of a crime.

Snow ruled that the court would maintain the monitorship until the sheriff’s office had achieved “full and effective compliance” for at least three years. The sheriff’s office and the plaintiffs - Latinos who said they were profiled by deputies - were expected to agree on the monitor, who will be appointed by the judge to oversee the department.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, which filed suit against the sheriff’s office, will have access to department data and materials and will receive reports about the department’s progress on implementing new training and anti-discrimination policies.

“Every person in Maricopa County deserves better than a sheriff’s department that commits pervasive civil rights violations at the expense of public safety,” Cecillia Wang, director of the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement. “The court’s order will make sure the agency actually enforces the law and will no longer go on wild goose chases based on racial stereotypes.”

The sheriff’s office’s attorney, Tim Casey, told the Arizona Republic that the department expected to appeal Snow’s decision but would abide by the order.

“The sheriff still remains in exclusive charge of the [sheriff’s office], he still sets the policy, still sets the programs and makes the sole decision on discretionary items,” Casey told the Republic. “The monitor has absolutely no veto power whatsoever on any law enforcement decision.”

He Has Contributed To Three Pulitzer Prizes For The Washington Post', 'Most Recently The Pulitzer Prize For Public Service.', 'Aaron Blake Is Senior Political Reporter']",Edward Snowden comes forward as source of NSA leaks,"A 29-year-old man who says he is a former undercover CIA employee said Sunday that he was the principal source of recent disclosures about ­top-secret National Security Agency programs, exposing himself to possible prosecution in an acknowledgment that had little if any precedent in the long history of U.S. intelligence leaks.

Edward Snowden, a tech specialist who has contracted for the NSA and works for the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, unmasked himself as a source after a string of stories in The Washington Post and the Guardian that detailed previously unknown U.S. surveillance programs. He said he disclosed secret documents in response to what he described as the systematic surveillance of innocent citizens.

In an interview Sunday, Snowden said he is willing to face the consequences of exposure.

“I’m not going to hide,” Snowden told The Post from Hong Kong, where he has been staying. “Allowing the U.S. government to intimidate its people with threats of retaliation for revealing wrongdoing is contrary to the public interest.”

Asked whether he believes that his disclosures will change anything, he said: “I think they already have. Everyone everywhere now understands how bad things have gotten — and they’re talking about it. They have the power to decide for themselves whether they are willing to sacrifice their privacy to the surveillance state.”

Snowden said nobody had been aware of his actions, including those closest to him. He said there was no single event that spurred his decision to leak the information, but he said President Obama has failed to live up to his pledges of transparency.

“My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,” he said in a note that accompanied the first document he leaked to The Post.

The Guardian was the first to publicly identify Snowden, at his request.

The White House said late Sunday that it would not have any comment on the matter.

In a brief statement, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the intelligence community is “reviewing the damage” the leaks have done. “Any person who has a security clearance knows that he or she has an obligation to protect classified information and abide by the law,” said the spokesman, Shawn Turner.

Snowden said he is seeking “asylum from any countries that believe in free speech and oppose the victimization of global privacy,” but the law appears to provide for his extradition from Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory of China, to the United States.

Although any extradition proceeding could take months or even years, experts said Snowden has not put himself in a favorable position.

“The fact that he outed himself and basically said, from what I understand he has said, ‘I feel very comfortable with what I have done’ . . . that’s not going to help him in his extradition contest,” said Douglas McNabb, a lawyer and extradition expert.

The Justice Department said it is in the “initial stages of an investigation” into the unauthorized disclosure of classified information but declined to comment further.



A stunning revelation

Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said the revelation of Snowden’s role in the leaks will lead to a sweeping reexamination of security measures at the CIA and the NSA, and they described his decision to come forward as a stunning conclusion to a week of disclosures that rattled the intelligence community.

“This is significant on a number of fronts: the scope, the range. It’s major, it’s major,” said John Rizzo, a former general counsel of the CIA who worked at the agency for decades. “And then to have him out himself . . . I can’t think of any previous leak case involving a CIA officer where the officer raised his hand and said, ‘I’m the guy.’ ”

A half-dozen former intelligence officials, including one who now works at Booz Allen Hamilton, said they did not know Snowden or anything about his background. Several former officials said he easily could have been part of a surge in computer experts and technical hires brought in by the CIA in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as its budget and mission swelled.

“Like a lot of things after 9/11, they just went on a hiring binge, and in the technical arena young, smart nerds were in high demand,” a former U.S. intelligence official said. “There were battalions of them.”

Officials said the CIA and other spy agencies did not relax their screening measures as the workforce expanded. Still, several officials said the CIA will now undoubtedly begin reviewing the process by which Snowden may have been hired, seeking to determine whether there were any missed signs that he might one day betray national secrets.

More broadly, the CIA and the NSA may be forced to reexamine their relationships with contractors, who were employed in roles ranging from technical support to paramilitary operations before concerns about the outsourcing of such sensitive assignments prompted a backlash in Congress and pledges from the agencies to begin thinning their contracting ranks.

Some former CIA officials said they were troubled by aspects of Snowden’s background, at least as he described it to The Post and the Guardian.

For instance, Snowden said he did not have a high school diploma. One former CIA official said that it was extremely unusual for the agency to have hired someone with such thin academic credentials, particularly for a technical job, and that the terms Snowden used to describe his agency positions did not match internal job descriptions.

Snowden’s claim to have been placed under diplomatic cover for a position in Switzerland after an apparently brief stint at the CIA as a systems administrator also raised suspicion. “I just have never heard of anyone being hired with so little academic credentials,” the former CIA official said. The agency does employ technical specialists in overseas stations, the former official said, “but their breadth of experience is huge, and they tend not to start out as systems administrators.”

A former senior U.S. intelligence official cited other puzzling aspects of Snowden’s account, questioning why a contractor for Booz Allen at an NSA facility in Hawaii would have access to something as sensitive as a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

“I don’t know why he would have had access to those . . . orders out in Hawaii,” the former official said.

The Guardian initially reported the existence of a program that collects data on all phone calls made on the Verizon network. Later in the week, the Guardian and The Post reported the existence of a separate program, code-named PRISM, that collects the Internet data of foreigners from major Internet companies.

Snowden expressed hope that the NSA surveillance programs will now be open to legal challenge for the first time. This year, in Amnesty International v. Clapper, the Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit against the mass collection of phone records because the plaintiffs could not prove exactly what the program did or that they were personally subject to surveillance.

“The government can’t reasonably assert the state-secrets privilege for a program it has acknowledged,” Snowden said.

Journalists criticized

Snowden’s name surfaced as top intelligence officials in the Obama administration and Congress pushed back against the journalists responsible for revealing the existence of sensitive surveillance programs and called for an investigation into the leaks.

Clapper, in an interview with NBC that aired Saturday night, condemned the leaker’s actions but also sought to spotlight the journalists who first reported the programs, calling their disclosures irresponsible and full of “hyperbole.” Earlier Saturday, he issued a statement accusing the media of a “rush to publish.”

“For me, it is literally — not figuratively — literally gut-wrenching to see this happen because of the huge, grave damage it does to our intelligence capabilities,” Clapper said.

On Sunday morning, before Snowden’s unmasking, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) had harsh words for the leaker and for the journalist who first reported the NSA’s collection of phone records, the Guardian’s Glenn Greenwald.

Greenwald “doesn’t have a clue how this thing works; neither did the person who released just enough information to literally be dangerous,” Rogers said on ABC’s “This Week,” adding: “I absolutely think [the leaker] should be prosecuted.”

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) agreed that whoever leaked the information should be prosecuted, and she sought to beat back media reports suggesting that the Obama administration overplayed the impact of the programs.

After opponents of the programs questioned their value last week, anonymous administration officials pointed to the thwarting of a bomb plot targeting the New York City subway system in 2009. Soon after, though, reporters noted that public documents suggested that regular police work was responsible for thwarting the attack, rather than a secret government intelligence program.

Feinstein said the programs were valuable in both the New York case and in another involving an American plotting to bomb a hotel in India in 2008. She noted that she could talk about those two cases because they have been declassified, but she suggested that the surveillance programs also assisted in other terrorism-related cases.

A chief critic of the efforts, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), said he is considering filing a lawsuit against the government and called on 10 million Americans to join in.

“I’m going to be asking all the Internet providers and all of the phone companies, ask your customers to join me in a class-action lawsuit,” Paul said on “Fox News Sunday.”

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/opinion/brooks-beyond-the-fence.html,2013-05-07 00:00:00,['David Brooks'],Beyond the Fence - The New York Times,"Some intelligent skeptics say that mobility is fine through the second generation but stalls by the third. It is indeed harder to rise in a more chaotic and fragmented society. But one of the country’s leading immigration researchers, Richard Alba of the City University of New York, calls the third generation stall “a statistical illusion.”

Much of the research that shows the effect compares today’s third-generation immigrants with today’s second-generation group. But the third-generation families originally came to the U.S. decades ago, at a time when segregation was prevalent, discrimination was high and immigrants were harshly treated. You’d expect those families to progress more slowly than families that came to more welcoming conditions a generation later.

Fifth, immigration opponents are trying to restrict skills. Current reform proposals would increase high-skill immigration. Opponents of reform are trying to restrict an infusion of people most likely to start businesses and invent things.

Alba points out that, over the next decades, the retirement of the baby-boomer generation will open up a large number of positions, especially atop the labor force. He points out that the fastest-growing ethnic groups are already rising to fill these slots. Whites occupy 80 percent of the top-paying jobs among older workers. But, among younger workers, whites occupy only 67 percent of the top jobs. The work force is already more diverse the younger you go.

Finally, opponents of reform are trying to hold back the inevitable. Whether immigration reform passes or not, the United States is going to become a much more cosmopolitan country than it is now. The country will look more like the faces you see at college commencement exercises and less like the faces you see in senior citizen homes.

One crucial question is whether America will be better off in that future with today’s dysfunctional immigration laws or something else? Another interesting question is whether a major political party is going to consign itself to permanent irrelevance. If conservatives defeat immigration reform, the Republicans will definitely lose control of one thing for years to come: political power."

@SCOTUSblog Sec 4 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional. 5-4. Per CJ Roberts.

The Supreme Court has struck down part of the Voting Rights Act. According to analysis from NBC's Pete Williams, the court upheld the Section 5 notion of preclearance—requiring locales with history of racial discrimination to preclear any changes of their voting laws with the Department of Justice—but struck down the map identifying which areas must be subject to preclearance. According to Williams, this means Congress could, in theory, pass a law creating a new map of locales subject to preclearance. Assuming the Court approved the map, it would go into effect. On a practical level, however, it essentially means the end of preclearance because there's virtually no chance of Congress agreeing on a new map. Therefore, given the current Congress, the effect of the ruling is to render Section 5 moot, although in theory at some point in the future it's conceivable that a new map could be drawn that would revive Section 5.

Here's the ruling.

@jeffzeleny ""What the Supreme Court did was to put a dagger in the heart of the Voting Rights Act,"" John Lewis tells me.

President Obama issues this statement:



I am deeply disappointed with the Supreme Court’s decision today. For nearly 50 years, the Voting Rights Act – enacted and repeatedly renewed by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress – has helped secure the right to vote for millions of Americans. Today’s decision invalidating one of its core provisions upsets decades of well-established practices that help make sure voting is fair, especially in places where voting discrimination has been historically prevalent.

As a nation, we’ve made a great deal of progress towards guaranteeing every American the right to vote. But, as the Supreme Court recognized, voting discrimination still exists. And while today’s decision is a setback, it doesn’t represent the end of our efforts to end voting discrimination. I am calling on Congress to pass legislation to ensure every American has equal access to the polls. My Administration will continue to do everything in its power to ensure a fair and equal voting process.

It’s a little known fact that the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee the right to vote for everyone, but we are fighting to change this. Please sign the petition to join Daily Kos, Color of Change, and a growing movement to pass a constitutional amendment guaranteeing and protecting the freedom to vote for all."
http://news.yahoo.com/nyc-mayor-lambastes-stop-frisk-ruling-061719911.html,,[],NYC mayor lambastes stop-and-frisk ruling,"NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge's stinging rebuke of the police department's stop-and-frisk policy as discriminatory could usher in a return to the days of high violent crime rates and end New York's tenure as ""America's safest big city,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg warned.

The ruling strikes at the heart of the legacy Bloomberg aims to leave when his third and final term ends this year. He said he would appeal but likely won't be around long enough to deal with the repercussions.

""This is a dangerous decision made by a judge who I think does not understand how policing works and what is compliant with the U.S. Constitution as determined by the Supreme Court,"" Bloomberg said. ""I worry for my kids, and I worry for your kids. I worry for you and I worry for me. Crime can come back any time the criminals think they can get away with things. We just cannot let that happen.""

U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin declared Monday that police have intentionally and systematically violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men.

She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes to the tactic, including reforms in policies, training and supervision. And she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in the some of the precincts where most stops occurred.

""The city's highest officials have turned a blind eye to the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially discriminatory manner,"" she wrote. ""In their zeal to defend a policy that they believe to be effective, they have willfully ignored overwhelming proof that the policy of targeting 'the right people' is racially discriminatory.""

But Bloomberg said police have done exactly what the courts and constitution allow to keep the city safe, reiterating the tactic was one tool that has helped drive down crime to record lows. The ruling could result, he said, in a return to the days of crime and mayhem, when murders hit an all-time high of 2,245 in 1990. Killings hit an all-time low of 418 in 2012.

Story continues

Scheindlin refused to hear testimony on crime rates, and her ruling skewered the city's defense of the practice and argument that it effectively polices itself.

Stop and frisk has been around for decades in some form, but recorded stops increased dramatically under the Bloomberg administration to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men. The lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class-action case.

About half the people who are stopped are subject only to questioning. Others have their bag or backpack searched, and sometimes police conduct a full pat-down. Only 10 percent of all stops result in arrest, and a weapon is recovered a small fraction of the time.

Scheindlin noted she was not putting an end to the practice, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops.

The judge presided over a 10-week bench trial this year that included testimony from NYPD brass and a dozen people — 11 men and one woman — who said they were wrongly stopped because of their race. She found that nine of the 19 stops discussed in court were unconstitutional, and that an additional five stops included wrongful frisking.

In her long ruling, she determined at least 200,000 stops were made without reasonable suspicion, the necessary legal benchmark, lower than the standard of probable cause needed to justify an arrest. She said that rank-and-file officers were pressured by superiors to make stops — and that police brass ignored mounting evidence that bad stops were being made.

Witness Nicholas Peart, who wept on the stand during the trial as he described a frightening encounter with police, said Monday that he hoped the ruling would mean ""tremendous steps forward.""

""I felt that it restores a sense of trust,"" said the 24-year-old Peart, who is black. ""Our voices do count, and count towards something greater.""

Pat Quinn signed a bill into law Sunday allowing illegal immigrants to get special driver's licenses, but it will be at least another 10 months before they'll start being issued.

The Illinois secretary of state's office estimates it'll need that much time to finalize rules and train employees about who qualifies and what paperwork can be accepted.

The lag time did little to dampen the mood of hundreds who braved icy weather to watch the ceremonial bill signing on Chicago's Southwest Side. The fanfare at Instituto del Progreso Latino included performances by a mariachi band and a roster of speakers 15 dignitaries deep. Supporters said the measure will make it easier for undocumented immigrants to get insurance.

""This bill is not just about driver's licenses, it's about equality for all,"" said sponsoring Rep. Edward Acevedo, D-Chicago.

Called temporary visitor driver's licenses, the permits will vary from traditional licenses several ways. Most noticeably, they will be visually different, with a blue background as opposed to red one.

The cards will be marked ""not valid for identification"" and cannot be used for things like boarding airplanes, voting or purchasing a gun. The licenses will only be valid for three years instead of four years, like traditional licenses. After three years, the individual would have to go through the process again.

To qualify for a license, an applicant must prove they have lived in Illinois for a least a year and show that they are ineligible for a Social Security card. Documents that will be accepted include a copy of a lease, utility bills and a valid passport or consular identification card.

Drivers must also pass vision, written and road tests and pay a $30 fee. In order for the license to remain valid, a driver also will be required to get insurance. If a person with a temporary visitor's license is caught driving without insurance, they will be ticketed for both driving without insurance as well as driving without a license.

People who want to apply for the licenses must first make an appointment at one of eight designated facilities across the state. Licenses will not be issued on the spot but only after the state can verify application information and perform a facial recognition search against other databases.

Critics have said they fear fraud and abuse, with some lawmakers saying illegal immigrants should be fingerprinted in order to qualify. Immigrant rights organizations said that would deter participation among a population that is often distrustful of law enforcement and other government agencies.

Despite some opposition, Quinn and others praised the way in which Democrats and Republicans alike helped get the measure passed, saying people came before politics. ""It was everybody in, and nobody left out,"" Quinn said, using one of his favorite lines.

Supporters say the next goal is winning comprehensive immigration reform at the national level.

""So goes Illinois, so goes the country,"" Mayor Rahm Emanuel said at Sunday's event. ""Let's take this day and build a better future by passing immigration reform.""

We have a self-imposed “Reverse Mallard” problem. If you’ve looked at the ducks for any period of time, you notice that the males are awash in color and the females all sport a conservative dun. In public fashion life, the opposite is true. Men’s attire looks, broadly speaking, the same. Women’s attire is colorful and tailored and has all kinds of bells and whistles on it that make for much more colorful commentary. Even efforts to evade this natural discrepancy by wearing the blandest thing possible don’t always get you out of the weeds. Hillary’s pantsuits became a discussion all their own. (“I thought this was what you wore to indicate you didn’t want people to discuss what you wore,” the staid ensembles grumbled.) But that doesn’t make it right. My usual answer is that men need to start wearing colorful, pointed shoes and knee-breeches again, in the simple interest of equity of color commentary. Dress everyone as 18th-century pirates! Bring back broadcloth and brocade! I think they would look very fetching on Senator McCain."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/11/04/FCC-Laying-Grounds-for-New-Fairness-Doctrine,2013-11-04 00:00:00,['Warner Todd Huston'],FCC Laying Grounds for New Fairness Doctrine?,"In 2012, the FCC contracted with the left-leaning Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism to study “entry barriers” to the media and see whether or not minority groups had enough access to the media. This year the FCC is launching a wide-ranging study that will require news agencies to inform the government on what stories they cover.

What may follow that is a push for a new “fairness doctrine” as the FCC makes recommendations intended to force the media to air stories which the government wants reported.

The 2012 study was carried out by University of Southern California’s Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism–a school operated by the same group that employed a pre-President Barack Obama and domestic terrorist William Ayers in Chicago in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The study, as part of the Federal Communication Commission’s 2012 Report to Congress about the barriers to participation in the communications industry (also known as the Section 257 Report), was intended to “identify market entry barriers and whether such barriers impact the public’s critical information needs.” A second goal was to help the FCC make “proposals to eliminate statutory barriers to market entry by those entities, consistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity.” The FCC intended to begin the process of laying down in the regulations definitions of what constitutes “critical information” and what doesn’t.

In 2013, the second leg of that project was announced as a “Multi-Market Study of Critical Information Needs.”

A study, titled “Research Design for the Multi-Market Study of Critical Information Needs,” was released in April. The study was produced by a company called Social Solutions International, Inc.. SSI has been awarded hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars in federal contracts.

One of the goals of this new project is to conduct a “media census” on just what is being broadcast in the electronic media and published in magazines, newspapers, and on the Internet.

“Researchers will analyze the content of broadcasts, newspaper articles, and website postings to determine the extent to which eight defined ‘Critical Information Needs’ (CINs) are being covered,” reported Eve Reed.

In a May 24 announcement of the project, Acting FCC Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn said that the FCC has a “duty” to find out what news is being broadcast.

The FCC has a duty to make sure that the industries it regulates serve the needs of the American public no matter where they live or what financial resources they have. The research design we announce today is an important next step in understanding what those needs are, how Americans obtain the information critical to their daily lives in a dynamic technological environment, and what barriers exist in our media ecologies to providing and accessing this information.

The FCC also issued the following comment: “The commission needs to conduct or commission research that illuminates the diversity of views available to local communities, the diversity of sources in local markets and the diversity of critical information needs of the American public, including women and minorities.”

Some of the eight CINs are telling as to what sort of criteria the FCC is using to quantify what is supposed to be useful information for a community. Two of the categories being assessed are whether or not a media outlet is properly informing customers about “the environment” and what “economic opportunity” news is reported–the latter as opposed to plain economics or news on the economy.

To determine if the media is fulfilling these CINs, media outlets will be required to fill out a very long survey to report to the government about what stories they are airing or publishing in the several categories being assessed.

Among other criteria, the study will ascertain: what “news philosophy” is pursued by the media outlet (i.e. it’s ideological direction); how the media outlet defines “critical information”; see if the media includes “community input” into its stories; and review the “decision making process” to find out how the media outlet determines what stories to cover.

Critics of this study, however, worry that with this government-enforced, intrusive survey into what stories the media is covering and how they are covering them, some freedoms will be lost.

Chuck Sweeny, for instance, wrapped up his recent report on the FCC’s study saying, “When ‘Big Brother is watching’ over reporters’ and editors’ shoulders, freedom of the press will be gone, and our liberty with it.”

For her part, Eve Reed also raised concerns. “But the questions that the researchers will be asking suggest a renewed interest on the part of the FCC in the inner workings of station and newspaper editorial decision-making, which may itself raise concerns,” she said.

All this raises worries that the FCC is looking for a backdoor way of re-instituting the Fairness Doctrine–the repeal of which gave us radio programs like the Rush Limbaugh show and paved the way for Fox News–in a new effort to control what goes on the air and who can own what media."

It sounds like a bizarre notion. But in the case of migrants, there may be something to it.

In 1990, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which stipulated a comprehensive set of civil, political, economic and social rights for migrants, including those living or working abroad illegally. But 23 years later, there is no denying the failure of the convention to protect those rights.

News of the mistreatment of migrants seems to arrive every few months. In September, an investigation by the British newspaper The Guardian exposed numerous deaths among Nepalese workers on World Cup construction sites in Qatar. Earlier this month, more than 400 migrants rioted after a bus hit and killed an Indian worker in Singapore, where large numbers of low-skilled migrants are employed under deplorable working and living conditions.

There is a wide gap between the rights of migrant workers in theory and practice, especially in the case of those employed in lower-wage jobs. Under most existing temporary migration programs in North America and Europe, for example, migrants do not enjoy the degree of access to welfare benefits demanded by the convention. In the Persian Gulf nations, more alarmingly, it is common practice for employers to retain migrant employees’ passports to make sure they cannot “escape.”"

Other critics have said the problem is that MSNBC has become too tame and too cerebral by adding shows like ""All In"" with Chris Hayes to its prime time line-up and moving its firebrand hosts like Ed Schultz to Saturday obscurity.

I'm sure those reasons, and probably some others I can't think of have contributed to MSNBC's precipitous decline, but they are not why I've stopped watching the cable news channel on a regular basis. The fact is that as a liberal Democrat, I can't keep walking around in a constant state of impotent rage, it's literally killing me. Watching MSNBC every night only reinforces the fact that the Republican led House, Republican led state governments and the Republican-centric Supreme Court are sending this country to hell in a handbasket and there doesn't seem to be a bleepin' thing any of us, particularly elected Democrats, can do to stop it.

As much as I admire Rachel Maddow, and next to Jon Stewart, I think she's the best thing on television, I can no longer bear to hear her excellent and thorough analysis each night of how the ""red"" states are dismantling women's rights, shredding civil rights, denying voting rights and imposing their own brand of Sharia law in legislatures that have more in common with banana republics than the constitutional democracies they are supposed to represent. It turns out that ignorance is bliss, or at least it's not the gut-wrenching, stress-filled sense of hopelessness and dispair you get from having your attention riveted nightly on inequities that you are powerless to fix.

I mean really, how many protest marches do we join, petitions do we sign, or phone calls do we make before we accept the fact that our actions have less of an impact on the laws being passed to govern our lives than a gnat landing on the back of an elephant. It turns out that watching the destruction of our democracy with charts and graphs and color commentary on television every night is a soul killing experience and it's better for my health if I avoid it.

This, of course is what separates us from right-wing conservatives. Unlike us wussy progressives, they thrive on their anger, losing an argument only fuels their hatred and whets their appetite. FOX News stays at number one in the ratings whether their candidates lose an election, or a court decision goes against them, or their majority in the house fails to derail Obamacare. In fact, watching their set-backs and disappointments paraded on TV and explained as unjust results of a liberal conspiracy only makes them grow stronger and more irrational in their sense of purpose.

Not so for me. I simply can't continue to spend my days and evenings consumed with ineffectual fury. Tuning into a nightly, technicolor recap of the decimation of social and civil rights issues that were already argued and settled a half a century ago isn't illuminating my perspective, it's breaking my heart."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/29/confederate-flag-at-old-north-carolina-capitol-coming-down/,2013-03-29 00:00:00,[],Confederate flag at old North Carolina Capitol coming down,"A Confederate battle flag hung inside the old North Carolina State Capitol last week to mark the sesquicentennial of the Civil War is being taken down after civil rights leaders raised concerns.

The decision was announced Friday evening, hours after the Associated Press published a story about the flag, which officials said was part of an historical display intended to replicate how the antebellum building appeared in 1863. The flag had been planned to hang in the House chamber until April 2015, the 150th anniversary of the arrival of federal troops in Raleigh.

""This is a temporary exhibit in an historic site, but I've learned the governor's administration is going to use the old House chamber as working space,"" Cultural Resources Secretary Susan Kluttz said Friday night. ""Given that information, this display will end this weekend rather than April of 2015.""

Kim Genardo, the spokeswoman for Gov. Pat McCrory, said the exhibit that includes the Confederate battle flag will be relocated, possibly across the street to the N.C. Museum of History.

The decision was a quick about-face for the McCrory administration, which initially defended the decision. Many people see the flag as a potent reminder of racial discrimination and bigotry.

State Historic Sites Director Keith Hardison had said Thursday the flag should be viewed in what he called the proper historical context.

""Our goal is not to create issues,"" said Hardison, a Civil War re-enactor and history buff. ""Our goal is to help people understand issues of the past. ... If you refuse to put something that someone might object to or have a concern with in the exhibit, then you are basically censoring history.""

North Carolina NAACP president Rev. William Barber was shocked Friday when he was shown a photo of the flag by the AP.

""He is right that it has a historical context,"" Barber said. ""But what is that history? The history of racism. The history of lynchings. The history of death. The history of slavery. If you say that shouldn't be offensive, then either you don't know the history, or you are denying the history.""

Barber couldn't immediately be reached Friday night, after the decision to take down the flag.

Sessions of the General Assembly moved to a newer building a half-century ago, but the old Capitol building is still routinely used as a venue for official state government events. McCrory's office is on the first floor, as are the offices of his chief of staff and communications staff.

The Republican governor was in the House chamber where the Confederate flag hangs as recently as Thursday, when he presided over the swearing-in ceremony of his new Highway Patrol commander.

The presentation of the Confederate battle flag at state government buildings has long been an issue of debate throughout the South. For more than a decade, the NAACP has urged its members to boycott South Carolina because of that state's display of the flag on the State House grounds.

Prior to taking his current job in North Carolina in 2006, Hardison worked as director at the Mississippi home of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, which is operated as a museum and library owned by the Sons of Confederate Veterans. The group has led the fight in the South for the proud display of the Confederate flag, which it contends is a symbol of heritage, not hate.

Hardison said the battle flag was displayed with other flags described in the diary of a North Carolina woman who visited the Capitol in 1863. A large U.S. flag displayed in the Senate chamber is reminiscent of a trophy of war captured from Union troops at the Battle of Plymouth.

""I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful to recreate this?"" Hardison said. ""I think we were all thinking along the same vein. ... The Capitol is both a working seat of government, in that the governor and his staff has his office there. But it is also a museum.""

Hardison also pointed out that the national flag used by the Confederate government, with its circle of white stars and red and white stripes, is still flown over the State Capitol dome each year on Confederate Memorial Day. The more familiar blood-red battle flag, featuring a blue ""X"" studded with white stars, was used by the rebel military.

David Goldfield, a history professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and author of the book ""Still Fighting the Civil War,"" said the battle flag can hold starkly different meanings depending on a person's social perspective.

""The history of the Confederate battle flag, how it was designed and formulated, how it has been used through the years, clearly states that it is a flag of white supremacy,"" Goldfield said. ""I know current Sons of Confederate Veterans would dispute that, saying `Hey, I'm not a racist.' But the fact remains that the battle flag was used by a country that had as its foundation the protection and extension of human bondage."""
http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/01/supreme-court-to-review-church-state-dispute-over-public-prayers/,2013-11-01 00:00:00,"['The Editors', 'Midwest Rail', 'Cnn Belief Blog Editor']",Atheist gets her day at the Supreme Court,"By Bill Mears, CNN Supreme Court Producer

(CNN)– Linda Stephens has lived in her upstate New York community for more than three decades and has long been active in civic affairs.

But as an atheist, those views have put her at the center of a personal, political, and legal fight that has reached the U.S. Supreme Court.

The issue is public prayer at her local town board meetings, another contentious case over the intersection of faith and the civic arena.

The justices on Wednesday will hear arguments over whether Greece, New York, may continue sponsoring what it calls ""inclusive"" prayers at its open sessions, on government property.

Stephens and co-plaintiff Susan Galloway have challenged the policy, saying virtually all of those invited to offer legislative prayers over the years were Christians.

""It's very divisive when you bring government into religion,"" Stephens told CNN from her home.

""I don't believe in God, and Susan is Jewish, so to hear these ministers talk about Jesus and even have some of them who personally question our motives, it's just not appropriate.""

The town of about 94,000 residents counters that after concerns from the two women and others, it sought diverse voices, including a Wiccan priestess, to offer invocations. Officials say they do not review the content of the remarks, nor censor any language.

""The faith of the prayer giver does not matter at all,"" said John Auberger, Greece's board supervisor, who began the practice shortly after taking office 1998. ""We accept anyone who wants to come in and volunteer to give the prayer to open up our town meetings.""

A federal appeals court in New York found the board's policy to be an unconstitutional violation of the Constitution's Establishment Clause, which forbids any government ""endorsement"" of religion.

Those judges said it had the effect of ""affiliating the town with Christianity.""

""To the extent that the state cannot make demands regarding the content of legislative prayers,"" said Judge Guido Calabresi, ""municipalities have few means to forestall the prayer-giver who cannot resist the urge to proselytize. These difficulties may well prompt municipalities to pause and think carefully before adopting legislative prayer, but they are not grounds on which to preclude its practice.""

Some legal experts say while the high court has allowed public prayers in general, it has not set boundaries on when they might become too sectarian in nature.

""The case involves a test between two different kinds of legal rules,"" said Thomas Goldstein, SCOTUSblog.com publisher and a leading Washington attorney.

""The Supreme Court has broadly approved legislative prayer without asking too many questions. But in other cases where the government is involved with religion, it has looked at lots of different circumstances. So we just don't know whether this court will be completely approving of legislative prayers in this instance.""

The justices are now being asked to offer more firm guidelines over when and if such public prayers are constitutionally acceptable.

Felt marginalized

Galloway and Stephens say the elected board of the community outside Rochester almost always invited Christian clergy to open the meetings, usually with sectarian prayers. And they say they felt ""marginalized"" by the practice.

""When we tried to speak with the town, we were told basically if we didn't like the prayers, we didn't have to listen,"" said Stephens, ""or could stand out in the hallway while they were going on.""

Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the Washington-based group that is representing the two women, cited records showing that between 1999 and 2010, approximately two-thirds of the invocations contained the words ""Jesus Christ,"" Jesus,"" Holy Spirit,"" or ""Your Son.""

And the lawsuit claims that from 1999 through 2007, every meeting had a Christian-only invocation. Following the complaints from the plaintiffs, four other faiths were invited in 2008, including a Baha'i leader and a Jewish lay person.

The plaintiffs say the Christian-only invocations resumed from January 2009 through June 2010. They claim those invited to the monthly meetings were selected by a city employee from a local guide that had no non-Christian faiths listed.

""Politics and religion simply don't mix, and they certainly don't mix in the local context of the Greece town council,"" said the Rev. Barry Lynn, AUSCS executive director.

""The town seems to take the position that because once or twice over a decade, it hears from someone of a different religion, that somehow is inclusive. It trivializes what's going here - a local government that should be willing and interested in participation of all its citizens, it wants those citizens to participate in an almost inevitably Christian prayer, in order to begin doing their business.""

Different rulings

While the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New York last year unanimously ruled against Greece's policy, other courts around the country have found such invocations - if inclusive and limited in scope - to be permissible.

Congress regularly opens its sessions with a prayer. Wednesday's invocation by House Chaplain the Rev. Patrick Conroy began: ""Eternal God, we give you thanks for giving us another day. Once again, we come to ask wisdom, patience, peace, and understanding for the members of this people's House.""

Nearly 120 members of Congress, mostly Republicans, along with several state attorneys general have filed supporting legal briefs backing the city. So has the Obama administration.

""The history of prayers offered in connection with legislative deliberation in this country makes clear that a legislative body need not affirmatively solicit a court-mandated variety of different religious faiths– from inside and outside the borders governed by the legislative body– in order to avoid running afoul of the Establishment Clause,"" said Justice Department lawyers' in their amicus brief.

The Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal ministry based in Scottsdale, Arizona, filed the lawsuit on behalf of the Greece Town Board, saying the Supreme Court has upheld the practice of government bodies ""to acknowledge America's religious heritage and invoke divine guidance and blessings upon their work.""

""A few people should not be able to extinguish the traditions of our nation merely because they heard something they didn't like,"" said Brett Harvey, an attorney for the group. ""Because the authors of the Constitution invoked God's blessing on public proceedings, this tradition shouldn't suddenly be deemed unconstitutional.""

Stephens realizes the stakes are high for her community and for the law as a whole. But on a personal level, this legal fight has been tough.

""I've received something of a backlash, both Susan and me,"" the retired librarian said. ""Threatening letters, some vandalism to my property, things like that. The prayers, and all the controversy, it makes you feel like an outcast, like we don't count in our town.""

The case is Town of Greece, N.Y. v. Galloway (12-696). A ruling is expected by early summer."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/us/carwash-managers-held-in-immigration-raids.html,2013-08-20 00:00:00,['Fernanda Santos'],Carwash Managers Held in Immigration Raids,"PHOENIX — Federal agents arrested 11 managers and supervisors of a local car-washing chain on immigration fraud and other charges in weekend raids that brought in more than 200 people, setting off fear among immigrants already on edge by years of relentless enforcement in a state at the core of the debate over illegal immigration.

The scene on Saturday resembled the workplace raids by Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County and operations by federal authorities here and elsewhere: heavily armed agents in bulletproof vests and ski masks surrounded the businesses, and then escorted workers outside single file with hands bound behind their backs.

In all, the agents rounded up 223 people, most of them in the United States illegally. Of those, 179 were released after questioning, under a policy that gives priority to the deportation of people with criminal records or a repeated history of immigration violations. Thirty immigrants fit this profile and were placed on a path to deportation, according to federal officials.

But officials said workers on the carwash floor were never the investigators’ target. From the investigation’s start two years ago, they said, they had their eyes trained on the people in charge, whom they accused of running a scheme that also included identity theft and financial improprieties, in part for evading taxes on wages paid to the unauthorized workers."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/09/Whip-Team-s-Schock-Majority-of-House-Republicans-support-Cantor-s-DREAM-Act,2013-08-09 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],GOP Rep. Schock Claims Majority of House GOP support Cantor's DREAM Act,"In response to a question at a town hall event this week, Rep. Aaron Schock (R-IL) suggested that a majority of House Republicans support granting amnesty through a GOP version of the DREAM Act to young illegal aliens who were brought to America as minors by their parents.

Schock, a member of the whip team led by House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, was laying out for constituents his stances on immigration and the House GOP leadership’s plan to deal with the issue later this year.

“They’re going to move one bill after another dealing with all the various issues that were contained in the Senate bill,” Schock said to the town hall, as seen in video posted on YouTube. “So first, the border security bill should be the first bill that moves in the House. I think that’s going to be an easy bill to pass. It passed out of the Homeland Security Committee with almost unanimous support. Almost every Republican and Democrat on Homeland Security voted for the House border security bill. I think that will pass the House and I think that’s a done deal and that’s done with. Then, you’re going to deal with your high-tech visas and your ag visa worker programs. I think, again, you’re going to get overwhelming bipartisan support on those provisions. I don’t know what the final language is going to look like.”

Schock’s outline of the preliminary plan matches what other member of GOP leadership have said. When he got to the third part of the plan, a DREAM Act which is currently being drafted by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and will eventually be introduced as the KIDS Act, Schock promised there would be a vote on the DREAM Act in the House and promised it would pass with bipartisan support.

“Then you’re going to have a third bill which is going to deal with your DREAM Act kids, those who were brought here illegally by their parents,” Schock said. “I think, again, you’re going to get a bipartisan vote on a House version of the DREAM Act.”

For any immigration bill to be brought to the floor for a vote in the House, Speaker John Boehner has mandated that it must have the support of the majority of House Republicans–known as abiding by the “Hastert Rule,” meaning no bill will come to the floor for a vote without the support of the majority of the majority. For Schock to not only promise it would pass, but that there would even be a vote on the bill, says that, he–a member of the House GOP leadership’s whip team–knows or believes that a majority of House Republicans support the DREAM Act.

Schock’s office has not responded to Breitbart News’ request for comment in response to this declaration and has not publicly provided a whip list of which Republicans he and the rest of McCarthy’s whip team expect to support the amnesty for young illegal aliens.

At the town hall this week, Schock also said he supports a comprehensive immigration bill of the sort opposed by House conservatives. He also promised some kind of amnesty, although not necessarily citizenship, for all illegal aliens would come up for a vote in the House.

“The final bill, which will be the most difficult bill, will be dealing with people who are here currently illegally and the path – what is the solution for that,” Schock said. “There are people in the House who think we should find a way to grant them legal status, but not a path to citizenship. There are other people who say no, it has to be a path to citizenship. My mindset is people should come forward, have to pay a penalty and a fine, there should be a probationary period. I am not in the camp that believes people should have to leave the country in order to get in line. I just happen to believe that’s an unrealistic expectation that 11 million people are going to leave. I think it would be destructive to our economy, number one, and number two, many of them do not have a place to go back to even if they wanted to. And number three, I think it adversely affects the self-identification – if self-identifies and knows now they have to leave. I want whatever we pass to work. I want it to be a real reform bill. And I want it to be constructive to the overall process of having more legal immigration down the road.”

In response to a follow-up question from the town hall audience member who prompted Schock’s immigration remarks, Schock added that he thinks “there should be a pathway to citizenship for anybody who wants to come to America.”

“I think they ought to self-identify, I think they should pay back taxes and I think they should be on a legal probationary program,” Schock said. “So, if you break a law, if you break a law, if you do something wrong, you’re thrown out. But, I don’t think there should be anything stopping anyone who self-identifies, pays their back taxes and continues to pay taxes in our country to get in the back of the line with everyone else who wants to become an American citizen. What I don’t support is giving any kind of preferential treatment to people who are here illegally above those people who are outside our borders currently that are waiting in line.”

John Fleming (R-LA) passed an amendment in the House Armed Services Committee protecting religious speech of service members in the military. President Barack Obama has now threatened to veto the bill if it passes the full House and Senate.

The White House released a Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) on H.R. 1960, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2014. Among other items, the SAP includes as an objection to the bill:

Expansion and Implementation of Protection of Rights of Conscience of Members of the Armed Forces and Chaplains of Such Members: The Administration strongly objects to section 530, which would require the Armed Forces to accommodate, except in cases of military necessity, “actions and speech” reflecting the “conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs of the member.” By limiting the discretion of commanders to address potentially problematic speech and actions within their units, this provision would have a significant adverse effect on good order, discipline, morale, and mission accomplishment.

The SAP includes a veto threat: “…if the bill is presented to the President for approval in its current form, the President’s senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill.”

In other words, Obama says he will veto any bill that forbids his appointees or officers from telling a soldier that he cannot mention Jesus during prayer or have a Bible on his desk, or that keeps those appointees from telling a chaplain (who is an ordained clergyman) what religious teachings he is allowed to give in worship services, or what spiritual counseling he can give to another soldier.

Ambassador Ken Blackwell, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, tells Breitbart News:

President Obama is waging a war on religion. He and Chuck Hagel are denying the most basic rights to those who put their lives on the line to protect all of our rights. It is shameful and appalling. I am confident that congressional leadership will show courage to stand up for our troops against this radical assault on religious liberty in the military.

This is the most compelling expression yet of the aggressive approach of the Obama-Hagel Defense Department to soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who are observant Christians or devout members of other peaceful faiths, as seen in Breitbart News’ previous reports regarding the unconstitutional infringements of one of America’s most treasured, fundamental rights.

All eyes are on House and Senate leadership to see if they stand firm on the bill for those in the military who are facing this new form of pressure.

But we can’t do that because the media would be on me about that.”

Scholars and students of film often use the phrase “breaking the fourth wall.”

This is the moment when suspension of disbelief is removed, and the film “winks” at the audience in a moment where the latter are made to realize that what they are seeing is not real, and its creators (and actors) are choosing to obey—or break—genre conventions.

Scholars who study race and racial ideologies often talk about how in the post civil rights United States racism has moved from what they call “the front stage” (the public and the readily seen) to the “backstage” (what is more hidden and private).

Consequently, being called a “racist” is the impetus for public shaming and exile. In response, white racism has moved to private spaces, uses humor and comedy as a shield, and takes refuge online.

Food celebrity Paula Deen’s admission in a recent anti-discrimination lawsuit that she routinely uses racial slurs such as “nigger”, and how she yearns for a return to Jim and Jane Crow America, is an almost perfect moment where she broke the metaphorical fourth wall of racism in the Age of Obama.

In her deposition she explained how:

[W]hen asked if she wanted black men to play the role of slaves at a wedding she explained she got the idea from a restaurant her husband and her had dined at saying, “The whole entire waiter staff was middle-aged black men, and they had on beautiful white jackets with a black bow tie.

“I mean, it was really impressive. That restaurant represented a certain era in America…after the Civil War, during the Civil War, before the Civil War…It was not only black men, it was black women…I would say they were slaves.”

Such images remain potent in American popular culture. And for some white folks of a certain age, as well as those possessed of a conservative, Right-wing political orientation, such images embody “real America”, and a ""simpler"" time before black and brown folks ""forgot their place"", the gays and lesbians came out of the closet, and women embraced feminism.

Paula Deen also embodies the moment of “race and reunion” that occurred after America’s Civil War. In the aftermath of a conflict which took at least 750,000 lives, whites in the North and former Confederacy had to find a way to come together as a whole and intact political community.

The solution: reimagining the Confederacy’s illegal acts of treason and secession as a noble lost cause.

North and South were both invested in White Supremacy and creating a society wherein African-Americans were a subordinated and dominated class of people.

Race and reunion involved a rewriting of American history such that slavery was remade into a benign and civilizing institution: the plantation was an idyllic and wonderful place. In this twisted vision, African-Americans, especially men, would descend into idleness, rapine behavior, and be a threat to white civilization unless they were controlled by violence and lynch law.

This lie of a noble and idyllic South, with its happy loyal slaves, continues to cast a shadow over post civil rights America.

For example, movies such as Gone with the Wind remain popular. Civil War reenactors march off as members of the Confederacy; they see themselves as good men involved in a futile struggle—not as agents defending white supremacy and racial terrorism. Award winning music groups such as Lady Antebellum channel a nostalgic view of the pre-Civil War South through the white racial frame in order to depict a historical milieu of white supremacy that ought to be yearned and pined for by their audiences.

Ultimately, Paula Deen’s desires are White yearnings for black subordination and submission.

As the Jim Crow Museum details, the black mammy maid figure is a lie which does the social and political work of convincing white people that black women (and other people of color) live to serve them. The black butler or Tom figure does similar work. They are both two-dimensional characters who are asexual, robbed of their full humanity, and eager to serve white people.

Such figures remain iconic. See the caricatures Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima in almost every American supermarket.

Stories of resistance to these White fantasies are also removed from the dreams of Paula Deen and the White conservatives who yearn for a return to “real America.”

Those happy smiling black maids were also peeing in food and taking their monies to help support the nascent Civil Rights movement. Nameless black butlers and Pullman Car porters—those men named “George”—were freedom fighters readying to resist and mobilize against White Supremacy.

The election of the country’s first black president is symbolically potent. Paula Deen’s desire for a return to Jim and Jane Crow is a reflection of a broader anxiety among the White American body politic and collective subconscious.

There, black and brown folks should be maids and butlers. A black family is in the White House. America’s demographics are changing because of immigration. Therefore, a particular type of Whiteness feels particularly imperiled in this social and political moment. Whatever one thinks of Obama's policies, for a good portion of Red State America, it is the fact of his personhood and blackness that is the real affront and crime.

What is the result? Movies and TV shows that emphasize the destruction of America and the White House since the election of Barack Obama. There are also forthcoming historical biopics such as The Butler about a noble black servant who served a series of presidents in the White House across several decades. TV shows such as Devious Maids fulfill the type-casting and stereotype of Hispanics and Latinas as natural servants.

Paula Deen’s fantasy of black and brown compliance, surrender, and subordination has connections to some of the country’s most ugly moments since the election of Barack Obama.

Birtherism, and Republican Joe Wilson's heckling of President Barack Obama during his State of the Union Address in 2009 is a parallel to Paula Deen’s fantasy.

Conspiranoid fantasies of Secession and a second Civil War are also part of this national derangement on the part of the White Right and Tea Party GOP. The murder of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, and how Republicans have rallied to Zimmerman's defense, is a reflection of a foundational assumption that black people must always be subservient, and surrender to White authority--as well as those overly identified and enamored with it--in any circumstance.

Projecting forward, at the end of her saga Paula Deen will be forced to publicly apologize for her racism. In that moment, and keeping with script, she will also channel some tears in order to get back into the good graces of her fans.

I believe that Paula Deen should be given an award for being so real and transparent about her racial attitudes. She exposed the backstage of white racism in post civil rights America.

Paula Deen is not alone in her feelings; Paula Deen's biggest sin is that she was just too honest and forthright for her own good."

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-embodies-kings-dream-struggle-070620427.html,,[],Obama embodies King's dream and his struggle,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama will lead the civil rights pioneers of today and two of his presidential predecessors Wednesday in a celebrative but solemn commemoration of Dr. Martin Luther King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech of yesteryear, saluting his fight for equal opportunity.

Large crowds thronged to the National Mall and the Lincoln Memorial where King, with a soaring, rhythmic oratory and a steely countenance, pleaded with Americans to come together to stomp out racism and create a land of opportunity for all.

Slate-gray skies and a light drizzle greeted the earliest arrivals for an observance that seemed likely to take on a more formal, serious tone, than a commemorative rally last Saturday. People eager to get a close-up view of Obama and former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton clustered at a security checkpoint. And National Guard troops were arrayed along fence lines encircling the Mall from the World War II Memorial to the Lincoln Memorial.

The scheduled appearance later Wednesday of Obama, the first African-American president, was certain to embody the fulfilled dreams of hundreds of thousands who rallied there in 1963. Obama has not often talked publicly about racial issues in the time he has been president. He did, however, talk at some length about the challenges he faced as a young black male as he discussed the case of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teen-ager killed in a confrontation with neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman.

When Obama took office in January 2009, he had broken through barriers that many before him could only approach. But his presidency has been marred by racist backlash and his administration has found itself still taking on battles thought won, such as ensuring equal access to the voting booth.

Obama's speech was set to follow an organized ringing of church bells at mid-afternoon, about the same time of day that King, his jaw squared and his turning, delivered his clarion call for equal rights. Obama was being joined at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial by Carter and Clinton. Other luminaries include Lynda Bird Johnson Robb, daughter of President Lyndon Johnson, who signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a longtime leader in the civil rights battles.

Story continues

At an interfaith service, the Rev. Bernice King opened the celebration. King said that her father is often remembered as a freedom fighter for equal rights and human rights. But she said he was most importantly a man of faith.

""He was a pastor, he was a prophet, he was a faith leader,"" she said. ""It was that faith and the spirit of God that infused that movement.""

King's eldest son, Martin Luther King III, said blacks can rightfully celebrate his father's life and work but much more work lies ahead.

He bemoaned ""staggering unemployment"" among black males age 18 to 30 and said he fears too many blacks still ""are first judged by t heir color and then the content of their character.""

Preceding the speeches was a march featuring a replica of a transit bus that civil rights leader Rosa Parks rode when she refused to give up her seat to a white man in 1955.

Obama considers the 1963 march a ""seminal event"" and part of his generation's ""formative memory."" A half-century after the march, he said, is a good time to reflect on how far the country has come and how far it still has to go.

In an interview Tuesday on Tom Joyner's radio show, Obama said he imagines that King ""would be amazed in many ways about the progress that we've made."" He listed advances such as equal rights before the law, an accessible judicial system, thousands of African-American elected officials, African-American CEOs and the doors that the civil rights movement opened for Latinos, women and gays.

""I think he would say it was a glorious thing,"" he said.

But Obama noted that King's speech was also about jobs and justice.

""When it comes to the economy, when it comes to inequality, when it comes to wealth, when it comes to the challenges that inner cities experience, he would say that we have not made as much progress as the civil and social progress that we've made, and that it's not enough just to have a black president, it's not enough just to have a black syndicated radio show host,"" the president said.

King's son was interviewed on NBC's ""Today"" show.

Lerner used to oversee the IRS division that targeted groups for additional scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status. At a May 22 hearing, she invoked her right not to answer lawmakers' questions after declaring in an opening statement that she had done nothing wrong.

Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted along party lines Friday morning, with 22 Republicans saying she waived the Fifth and 17 Democrats arguing she did not. Lerner remains under subpoena, and the committee believes it could bring the long-time IRS official back and compel her to testify.

Late Friday, her attorney, William Taylor, issued a statement saying, ""It is too bad that an issue like this gets put to a vote in a highly polarized forum. A party line vote does ‎not affect anyone's constitutional rights and this one does not affect Ms. Lerner's.

""Her rights under the constitution are no different now than they were when she asserted them.""

More On This...

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the committee, said at the opening of Friday's meeting that ""I believe Lois Lerner waived her Fifth Amendment privileges.""

""She did so when she delivered an opening statement,"" Issa said.

Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., reiterated Issa's argument, delivering a fiery speech about Lerner's attempt to protect herself under the Fifth.

Gowdy said Lerner made nine separate assertions, with the advice of counsel, and then authenticated a document.

""That's not how the Fifth Amendment works,"" Gowdy said. ""You're not allowed to just say your side of the story ... She could have sat there and said nothing.""

Democrats, meanwhile, like Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., challenged Gowdy's argument, calling attempts to block Lerner's invoking of the Fifth Amendment ""an egregious abuse of power that tramples the Constitution and serves no valid legislative purpose.""

Connolly said that ""the majority has brought us to a point where we risk allowing this committee to be transformed into a Star Chamber proceeding that establishes future Legislative Branch precedent where any chairman -- whether a Democrat or a Republican -- is free to compel an American invoking their constitutional right against self-incrimination to physically appear before the Committee for no other reason than to be pilloried, delayed, embarrassed, and burdened into unknowingly, unintentionally, and ironically, forfeiting the very sacred constitutional right that is intended to protect every American against forced self-incrimination by the government.""

""You may make a small-term political gain,"" Connolly warned Republicans, but ""at a long-term political cost.""

The committee is scheduled to vote Friday on whether Lerner waived her Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions by making an opening statement.

Legal scholars have differed in their views on the committee's case against Lerner, who the IRS has placed on administrative leave.

Lerner's lawyer, William Taylor, said he disagreed with the committee's claim.

""There was nothing voluntary about her statement,"" he said in a statement. ""She had informed (the) committee that she would invoke and requested to be excused and (the) committee ordered her to appear and invoke her rights in public.

""It went so far as to serve a subpoena on her to assure that she would be compelled to attend, unlike other witnesses who appeared voluntarily. In any event, protesting your innocence and invoking the right not to answer questions, which is what she did, is not a waiver.""

The lawsuit filed last week in federal court says New Rochelle's action, in addition to being unconstitutional, was ""unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious"" and betrayed a lack of appreciation of history.

The City Council had ordered the flag down in March, citing complaints that the yellow banner with a coiled rattlesnake was making a political statement. The flag has been used as an unofficial symbol of the tea party since at least 2008 and is often seen at party rallies, tax protests and gun rights rallies.

But the lawsuit, filed by the United Veterans Memorial and Patriotic Association, offers a long history of the flag, which has been used by the U.S. military since 1776. And it says none of the veterans who raised the flag in March are tea party members.

It says that ""contrary to defendants' unfounded, subjective (and incorrect) belief,"" hoisting the Gadsden flag was not meant to support the tea party. It was meant ""to honor the veterans who have served and died for our country under the rattlesnake image and the words 'Don't Tread on Me' since the American Revolution,"" the lawsuit says.

City officials did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment. The city manager said in April it is up to the city to determine which flags fly on city-owned property.

The lawsuit names the mayor, city manager and four City Council members. It requests an injunction and ""nominal and compensatory damages.""

Ron Tocci, a former New York assemblyman and a retired Veterans Affairs commissioner told The Journal News it was incorrect for city officials to associate the flag with tea party groups.

“It’s a slap in the face, an insult to any veteran that they would try to identify that flag with anything other than what it should be -- honoring the service of our people,” Tocci told the newspaper.

Peter Parente, president of the veterans group, referred calls to attorney William Baaki of the Thomas More Law Center, a conservative legal defense group in Ann Arbor, Mich. Baaki did not immediately return a call.

WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court declared California prison overcrowding unconstitutional and upheld an order by a 5-4 vote that could force the transfer or release of more than 30,000 convicted felons over the next two years.

California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation officials insisted Monday that a new state law, allowing some offenders to serve sentences under local county supervision, could significantly cut the need to release inmates.

""It's our hope that, overall, we will see a pretty significant reduction in the prison population due to"" the new law, said Matthew Cate, secretary of the corrections department. Cate and other officials in a teleconference with reporters deflected questions about convicts who could be freed because of the ruling.

State legislators are still considering how to finance the shift to local incarceration. On Monday, it was unclear how quickly the court's decision might impact prisoners and public safety in California. Under a lower court's order, officials have two years to reduce the inmate population.

Prisoners' advocates said the high court's decision should force the state to reconsider harsh sentences that filled its prisons beyond capacity. ""The massive prison buildup in California in recent decades is the result of overly punitive policies such as 'three strikes and you're out' along with ineffective parole revocation polices,"" Marc Mauer, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Sentencing Project said in a statement.

In the ruling, Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by the court's four liberals, declared that inmates' medical care and mental health had been severely compromised. Their decision upheld an order from a special three-judge panel in lawsuits brought on behalf of inmates who alleged prison conditions amounted to a violation of the Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment.

In a decision that affects only California, Kennedy, often a swing vote, emphasized that the state's prison ills had been well-documented and that officials had faced court orders to fix the problems for more than 10 years.

""For years the medical and mental health care provided by California's prisons has fallen short of minimum constitutional requirements and has failed to meet prisoners' basic health needs,"" Kennedy said, noting that as many as 200 prisoners had lived in a gym and as many as 54 prisoners had shared a single toilet.

The four more conservative justices dissented. Justice Antonin Scalia took the rare step of reading portions of his statement from the bench. He described the lower court's order requiring release of tens of thousands of felons as ""perhaps the most radical injunction issued by a court in our nation's history. Scalia said the order allowed judges to go ""wildly beyond their institutional capacity.""

He and the other dissenters predicted the decision would affect public safety in California. Scalia said ""terrible things (were) sure to happen as a consequence of this outrageous order.""

In earlier decades, federal courts were more involved in helping correct societal problems and ensure civil rights, whether in prison overcrowding, school segregation or environmental concerns. That era faded in part because the increasingly conservative high court believed judges were treading on the domain of legislators.

Monday's case, Kennedy stressed, grew out of especially dire conditions. He noted that the prison population at one point was 156,000, nearly double the number that buildings were designed to hold. The special panel that heard the prisoners' challenge ordered the state to reduce prison population to 137.5% of design capacity.

The current population is 143,435, prison officials said, and under the judges' order it would have to get down to about 109,805 in two years.

Lawsuits at the heart of Monday's case were filed in 1990 and 2001. Among the claims from prisoners' lawyers were that ""mentally ill prisoners have been found hanged to death in holding tanks where observation windows are obscured with smeared feces, and discovered catatonic in pools of their own urine after spending nights in locked cages.""

Kennedy appended pictures to his opinion, including of ""dry cages"" used for inmates awaiting beds in a mental health unit.

""As a consequence of their own actions, prisoners may be deprived of rights that are fundamental to liberty,"" Kennedy said. ""Yet the law and the Constitution demand recognition of certain other rights."" Kennedy noted that most of the prisoners who would be released would not be the ones with medical problems, rather those who would be eligible for good-time credits and early parole.

Kennedy was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.

Kennedy said the lower court would have to continue to monitor the situation. He said that the state may be able to show that progress in lowering the population makes the overall situation ""less urgent.""

California officials had urged the high court to reverse the order, saying violations of prisoner rights could be addressed through new construction, some prisoner transfers out of state and the hiring of more medical personnel. The three-judge panel said earlier such vows had failed to sufficiently improve the system.

Scalia's dissent in Brown v. Plata was signed by Justice Clarence Thomas. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel A`lito dissented separately. Alito, joined by Roberts, said the lower court's decree violates federal law.

""The Constitution does not give federal judges the authority to run state penal systems,"" Alito wrote. ""Decisions regarding state prisons have profound public safety and financial implications, and states are generally free to make these decisions as they choose."""

An Orlando Sentinel article detailing how the Department of Justice’s secretive Community Relations Service worked to bring about Sheriff Lee’s ouster raises troubling questions about the Obama administration’s involvement, especially when coupled with the cozy relationship that Attorney General Eric Holder has with one of the lead Trayvon Martin agitators, the Rev. Al Sharpton.

What is the DOJ’s Community Relations Service? The Sentinel article, entitled “DOJ ‘peacemakers’ helped Sanford stay cool amid rising tension,” paints a generally rosy, if slightly creepy, picture of the organization and its role during the Trayvon Martin shooting and the aftermath:

In their Navy blue windbreakers, polo shirts and dark sunglasses, they look like federal agents. Their caps are embroidered with the Justice Department’s seal. They watch and listen silently. But they say little publicly. When reporters try to chat them up, they remain stoic, saying simply they cannot talk to the media. The peacekeepers have a specific mandate outlined in the 1964 Civil Rights Act to go into conflict zones within American communities that perceive discrimination or feel wronged because of their particular race, color or national origin.

However, the original mandate of the CRS was expanded with the passage of recent hate crime legislation. A 2010 article by liberal journalist Ryan Reilly on Main Justice quotes former Community Relations Service director Ondray T. Harris as saying the CRS had become more ‘preventative’.

Others give a less positive view of the CRS. One source familiar with the division describes them as “federal spies, federal muscle, all in the guise of mediation.”

The Sentinel quotes a number of people saying positive things about the CRS and their role in Sanford, but all of them appear to be people or organizations who were calling for George Zimmerman’s arrest, such as the Seminole County NAACP.

Despite claiming to be unbiased, DOJ head Eric Holder recently spoke in praise of Al Sharpton, one of the main agitators in the Trayvon Martin story, at an event hosted by Sharpton’s Nation Action Network–at the same time Sharpton was calling for increased civil disobedience.

According to the Sentinel, the Department of Justice and CRS had a hand in bolstering Rev. Al Sharpton’s claim of Police Department bias by helping to facilitate the temporary resignation of Sheriff Bill Lee Jr. from the Stanford Florida Police Department, just two days before President Obama’s Rose Garden statement about Trayvon Martin.

As the Orlando Sentinel reported:

They helped set up a meeting between the local NAACP and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of police Chief Bill Lee, said Turner Clayton, Seminole County chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. “People are more relaxed and satisfied when they know they have someone from the outside, like the DOJ who have no ties to the community to try and relax the emotions,” Clayton said

We have previously reported that in 2006, then Senator Barack Obama was involved in a Florida case with Martin’s attorney Benjamin Crump and Rev. Sharpton that acted as the publicity blueprint for the Martin case.

That connection has still not been reported in the mainstream media, and itself raises serious questions about the level of coordination between the Obama administration, Mr. Crump and Rev. Sharpton."

Chuck Schumer (D-NY) coordinating which way members of the “Gang of Eight” who serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee would vote on immigration bill amendments, Breitbart News has learned.

“Do our Republicans have a pass on this one if they want?” the microphone caught Schumer saying.

The hot mic remarks came during the Judiciary Committee markup on Monday, when Schumer was talking to his staff while senators were voting on an amendment that would prevent illegal immigrants from gaining access to public benefits, specifically the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).

The amendment, offered by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), would have barred illegal immigrants from accessing tax credits like the EITC under the bill until they received green cards or citizenship years from now.

The amendment failed along party lines. For one of the first times ever, though, Gang of Eight members Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Jeff Flake (R-AZ) joined their Republican colleagues in voting for the amendment. All the Democrats voted against it.

The National Journal recently reported that the Gang of Eight members have coordinated in secret to keep amendments that would strengthen the bill from passing. Sessions expressed outrage at that report, saying that “[o]ne of the things that most upsets the American people about Washington is drafting a bill with special interests in secret and jamming it across the finish line in a way that minimizes public involvement and input. Despite touting their legislation as ‘the toughest border enforcement in history,’ the Gang of Eight bill failed to live up to every major promise of its sponsors–including the promise of enforcement first–resulting in a bill that is even weaker than the rejected 2007 plan. This legislation needs improvement and openness.”

The case began when Dr James Knight sacked dental hygienist Melissa Nelson after more than 10 years' service because he found her too attractive and his wife saw her as a threat.

In December, the all-male the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that Dr Knight did not discriminate against Ms Nelson.

She had argued she would not have been fired if she were a man, and her lawyer, Paige Fiedler, argued in seeking a second hearing that their decision was a setback for gender equality in the workplace.

In late June, the justices decided to reconsider the case.

""We ultimately conclude the conduct does not amount to unlawful sex discrimination in violation of the Iowa Civil Rights Act,"" Justice Edward Mansfield wrote.

Dr Knight had hired Nelson in 1999 and on several occasions in the 18 months before he fired her in early 2010, he complained that her clothing was too tight, revealing and distracting, the decision said.

She denied wearing anything inappropriate.

Ms Nelson and Dr Knight began texting each other in 2009, the opinion said.

Most messages were work-related or otherwise innocuous, but some were more suggestive, including one in which the dentist asked his hygienist how often she had an orgasm, the opinion said.

Ms Nelson did not answer that text.

""The fact of the matter is Nelson was terminated because of the activities of her consensual personal relationship with her employer, not because of her gender,"" Chief Justice Mark Cady wrote in a separate 'special concurrence'.

In late 2009, Dr Knight's wife, Jeanne Knight, learned that her husband had been exchanging texts with Ms Nelson while he was on an out-of-state vacation with their children.

She insisted that he dismiss her, saying ""she was a big threat to our marriage"", the opinion said.

Dr Knight read Ms Nelson a statement when he fired her that said in part that their relationship had become a detriment to both of their families.

Ms Nelson's lawyer said on Friday she was ""beyond distressed at the lack of awareness and understanding this decision demonstrates"".

Ms Fiedler said in a statement: ""Women already have to balance on the very fine line of being respected, professional and well-liked in the workplace without having their perceived charm or attractiveness garner unwanted sexual advances, harassment and discrimination."""

A registered nurse had sued the Northeast Philly nursing home where she worked because she was being docked pay for lunchtime hours during which she was in fact working, and the Court has barred her claim on behalf of herself and her coworkers because she refused to accept a settlement offer from her employer for the full extent of her personal claim (including attorney's fees) because it only covered her, and not others similarly situated.

There's a lot of procedural mumbo-jumbo involved in today's Supreme Court decision in Genesis HealthCare Corp. v. Symczyk, so I'll try to make things as simple (and easy to pronounce: it's sim-chick) as possible so we can leap ahead to an absolutely badass dissent by Justice Kagan.

Justice Thomas' decision for the majority (the five you'd expect) relies on the fact that while Laurie Symczyk pleaded on behalf of herself and others similarly situated, no such person had formally entered parallel FLSA claims in this case, such that once Symczyk received an official offer covering the entirety of her claims it mooted any ""case or controversy"" which had existed:

In the absence of any claimant’s opting in, respondent’s suit became moot when her individual claim became moot, because she lacked any personal interest in representing others in this action. While the FLSA authorizes an aggrieved employee to bring an action on behalf of himself and “other employees similarly situated,” the mere presence of collective-action allegations in the complaint cannot save the suit from mootness once the individual claim is satisfied.

The Court today resolves an imaginary question, based on a mistake the courts below made about this case and others like it. The issue here, the majority tells us, is whether a “collective action” brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) “is justiciable when the lone plaintiff’s individual claim becomes moot.” Embedded within that question is a crucial premise: that the individual claim has become moot, as the lower courts held and the majority assumes without deciding. But what if that premise is bogus? What if the plaintiff’s individual claim here never became moot? And what if, in addition, no similar claim for damages will ever become moot? In that event, the majority’s decision—founded as it is on an unfounded assumption—would have no real-world meaning or application. The decision would turn out to be the most one-off of one-offs, explaining only what (the majority thinks) should happen to a proposed collective FLSA action when something that in fact never happens to an individual FLSA claim is errantly thought to have done so. That is the case here, for reasons I’ll describe. Feel free to relegate the majority’s decision to the furthest reaches of your mind: The situation it addresses should never again arise.

Yeah, yeah, whatever. Now read the Justice Kagan dissent. There's something rhetorically here which reminded one friend from law school of Judge Richard Posner, or Prof. Richard Epstein, in terms of possessing and sustaining a tone of this is easy, and you people are idiots for thinking otherwise. Shame on you. From the top, then:Let's continue, shall we?"
http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/08/03/veterans-sue-city-in-new-york-that-ordered-flag-down/,2013-08-03 00:00:00,[],Veterans sue city in New York that ordered 'Don't Tread on Me' down,"A veterans group alleges in a federal lawsuit that officials violated its free-speech rights when they banned a ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag from a city-owned armory.

The lawsuit filed last week in federal court says New Rochelle's action, in addition to being unconstitutional, was ""unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious"" and betrayed a lack of appreciation of history.

The City Council had ordered the flag down in March, citing complaints that the yellow banner with a coiled rattlesnake was making a political statement. The flag has been used as an unofficial symbol of the tea party since at least 2008 and is often seen at party rallies, tax protests and gun rights rallies.

But the lawsuit, filed by the United Veterans Memorial and Patriotic Association, offers a long history of the flag, which has been used by the U.S. military since 1776. And it says none of the veterans who raised the flag in March are tea party members.

It says that ""contrary to defendants' unfounded, subjective (and incorrect) belief,"" hoisting the Gadsden flag was not meant to support the tea party. It was meant ""to honor the veterans who have served and died for our country under the rattlesnake image and the words 'Don't Tread on Me' since the American Revolution,"" the lawsuit says.

City officials did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment. The city manager said in April it is up to the city to determine which flags fly on city-owned property.

The lawsuit names the mayor, city manager and four City Council members. It requests an injunction and ""nominal and compensatory damages.""

Ron Tocci, a former New York assemblyman and a retired Veterans Affairs commissioner told The Journal News it was incorrect for city officials to associate the flag with tea party groups.

“It’s a slap in the face, an insult to any veteran that they would try to identify that flag with anything other than what it should be -- honoring the service of our people,” Tocci told the newspaper.

Peter Parente, president of the veterans group, referred calls to attorney William Baaki of the Thomas More Law Center, a conservative legal defense group in Ann Arbor, Mich. Baaki did not immediately return a call.

It was wrong for the announcer, a local school superintendent, to rile up the crowd by saying, “We’re gonna stomp Obama now.”

And wrong for him to say, “As soon as their bull comes out, Obama don’t you move. He’s gonna getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha!”

It was wrong for the crowd to go wild.

Perry Beam, a 48-year-old musician who describes himself as an “old country boy,” was appalled by what he saw and blew the lid off this embarrassment by posting about it on Facebook. “One of the clowns ran up and started bobbling the lips on the mask and the crowd went crazy,” Beam wrote, according to his friend, Bob Yates, who reposted the item on a politically liberal Missouri website called Show Me Progress.

“Everybody screamed” and “just went wild” when the rodeo announcer talked about stomping the clown, Beam told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

“It was at that point I began to feel a sense of fear,” Beam told the Dispatch. “It was that level of enthusiasm. ... It was cruel. It was disturbing. I am still sick to my stomach over it. ... I’ve never seen anything so blatantly racist in my life.”

Later, in an interview with Missouri TV station KSDK, Beam said the scene was “like an effigy at a Klan rally.”

The condemnations were harsh and swift.

The Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Assn. apologized. The state’s Democratic governor and Republican lieutenant governor condemned the prank. Noting that the state fair is a family event funded by taxpayer dollars, Missouri’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill said young people should not be taught that “it’s ever acceptable to, in a public event, disrespect, taunt and joke about harming the president of our great nation.”

So why did it happen?

Probably for the same reason that some idiot threw a banana on Sunday at Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones at the Giants’ AT&T Park.

Probably for the same reason that a rodeo announcer near San Luis Obispo made a grotesquely racist joke about First Lady Michelle Obama last year.

And probably for the same reason that a medical resident at UCLA thought it would be funny to photoshop the face of a black surgeon onto a gorilla and show the gorilla being sodomized by a white department head. (That antic, by the way, cost UCLA $4.5 million.)

We may have a black president for the first time in our history, but racism in the guise of humor continues to be an undiminished flaw of the American personality.

It would be nice to report that no prominent person defended the blatantly racist disrespect on parade in Missouri over the weekend.

Dream on.

On Monday, the man you might call the head clown for racist humor in America put the blame for the Missouri embarrassment squarely at the president’s feet because the president had the audacity to discuss serious issues of foreign policy when he appeared with Jay Leno on “The Tonight Show” last week.

“When the president of the United States more often than not connects with the American people on late-night comedy shows,” opined Rush Limbaugh on Monday morning, “what else can happen other than the diminishing of the office?”

Oh please. For decades, American politicians (John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, Sarah Palin, John McCain) have appeared on comedy shows. Far from diminishing the offices they hold or to which they aspire, they demonstrate -- or try to anyway -- that they are normal human beings, that humor can co-exist with the serious business of governing.

Presidents diminish their offices in many ways (see some of the names above). But appearing on television is not one of them.

And to link the disgusting spectacle at the Missouri State Fair to an innocuous Obama appearance on “The Tonight Show” is clownish at best.

[For the Record, 2:59 p.m. PDT Aug. 12: An earlier version of this online post incorrectly stated that Missouri’s governor is a Republican. He is a Democrat.]

U.S. District Judge Kurt Engelhardt's temporary restraining order says the city can only enforce the limits in an area near the Superdome, where the game will be played Feb. 3. The city had also planned to enforce the rules in the French Quarter and surrounding neighborhoods.

The judge's ruling comes after the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of an activist and a street preacher. They claimed a new city ordinance and a code enforcement guide trample on their free speech rights and limit their activities leading up to the title game between the Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers.

The ACLU claims New Orleans adopted the new policies at the behest of the National Football League.

""The NFL asked them to do a whole bunch of things, including this,"" said ACLU of Louisiana executive director Marjorie Esman.

Esman said other Super Bowl host cities have enforced similar rules in recent years, but they have never been challenged in court before.

Engelhardt's order says the plaintiffs showed a ""likelihood of success"" in arguing that enforcing a broader ""clean zone"" is impermissible under the First Amendment. He scheduled a meeting Monday with lawyers for the city and ACLU to discuss the latter's request for a preliminary injunction.

""It's wonderful that the judge recognizes the city doesn't have a right to curtail speech throughout a large chunk of the city,"" Esman said.

The city, Mayor Mitch Landrieu and Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas are named as defendants in the suit. A spokesman for the city didn't immediately respond to a call and email seeking comment.

The judge didn't immediately act on the group's request for a court order barring the city from enforcing the ""clean zone"" limits, which are scheduled to take effect on the morning of Jan. 28 and end on the evening of Feb. 5.

The ordinance, passed last month, says banners, flags and signs aren't prohibited in the ""clean zone"" without the OK of the city or the NFL. The content of any temporary signs approved by the city must consist of at least 60 percent Super Bowl or NFL branding. The guide, meanwhile, says no signs will be permitted unless the applicant is an NFL sponsor, the suit says.

The plaintiffs are Tara Jill Ciccarone, an Occupy NOLA member, and Troy Bohn, pastor of a religious congregation that regularly preaches on Bourbon Street."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/03/washington-state-considers-gender-neutral-language-bill/,2013-02-03 00:00:00,[],Washington state considers final gender-neutral language bill,"In Washington state, dairymen, freshmen and even penmanship could soon be things of the past.

Over the past six years, state officials have engaged in the onerous task of changing the language used in the state's copious laws, including thousands of words and phrases, many written more than a century ago when the idea of women working on police forces or on fishing boats wasn't a consideration.

That process is slated to draw to a close this year. So while the state has already welcomed ""firefighters,"" ""clergy"" and ""police officers"" into its lexicon, ""ombuds"" (in place of ombudsman) and ""security guards"" (previously ""watchmen,"") appear to be next, along with ""dairy farmers,"" ""first-year students"" and ""handwriting.""

""Some people would say `oh, it's not a big thing, do you really have to go through the process of changing the language,""' said Seattle Councilmember Sally Clark who was one of the catalysts for the change. ""But language matters. It's how we signal a level of respect for each other.""

About half of all U.S. states have moved toward such gender-neutral language at varying levels, from drafting bills to changing state constitutions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Florida and Minnesota have already completely revised their laws as Washington state is doing.

The final installment of Washington state's bill already has sailed through the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee with unanimous approval. The nearly 500-page bill has one more committee stop scheduled before full Senate debate.

Crispin Thurlow, a sociolinguist and associate professor of language and communication at the University of Washington-Bothell, said the project was admirable.

He said that as language evolves, such efforts are more than symbolic.

""Changing words can change what we think about the world around us,"" he said. ""These tiny moments accrue and become big movements.""

Clark and former councilmember Jan Drago -- the Seattle City Council has long eschewed the terms councilwoman or councilman -- brought the issue to Sen. Jeannie Kohl-Welles in 2006 after they came across references to firemen and policemen in the mayor's proposed budget, as well as in state law dealing with local-government pensions.

Clark and Drago's findings sparked the initial gender-neutral language law that was passed in 2007, immediately changing those terms and directing the state code reviser's office to do a full revision of the rest of the code. A 1983 Washington state law had already required all new statutes to be written in gender-neutral terms, so state officials were tasked with going through the rest of state statutes dating back to 1854 to revise the rest.

As in past bills on the issue that have tackled sections of the state code, some revisions were as simple as adding ""or her"" after ""his."" Others required a little more scrutiny. Phrases like ""man's past"" changes to ""humankind's past"" and a ""prudent man or woman"" is simply a ""prudent person.""

Kyle Thiessen, the state's code reviser who has been working on the project along with two attorneys since 2008, said that the work was not without obstacles.

Words like ""manhole"" and ""manlock"" aren't so easily replaced, he said. Substitutes have been suggested -- ""utility hole"" and ""air lock serving as a decompression chamber for workers."" But Thiessen said those references will be left alone to avoid confusion.

Republican state Rep. Shelly Short, of Addy, has voted against earlier gender-neutral language bills and said she plans to do the same this year.

""I don't see the need to do gender neutrality,"" she said, adding that her constituents want her to focus on jobs and the economy. ""We're women and we're men.""

Kohl-Welles, who has sponsored each of the gender-neutral language bills, said that while this project hasn't been her top legislation every year, ""overall, it has important significance.""

""I believe,"" she said, ""that the culture has changed."""

The landmark civil rights protest on Aug. 28, 1963, drew more than 200,000 people to the District and is remembered most for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech.

William P. Jones is a history professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and the author of “The March on Washington: Jobs, Freedom, and the Forgotten History of Civil Rights.” On Aug. 28, 1963, the March on Washington, featuring Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech, became the touchstone of the American civil rights movement. But our focus on one man and one speech has obscured some of the history and meaning of the event. As we mark this milestone, let’s take a closer look at popular misconceptions about what brought hundreds of thousands of people to Washington 50 years ago.

1. Martin Luther King Jr. organized the march.

The March on Washington was initiated and directed by A. Philip Randolph, a 74-year-old black labor leader who first called for a march on the Capitol to protest employment discrimination in 1941. Though that event never happened, Randolph’s organization, the Negro American Labor Council, initiated another protest in January 1963, then reached out to King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and other civil rights and labor groups.

This iconic protest had many fathers. In addition to Randolph and King, the 10 official chairmen of the event included John Lewis of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Roy Wilkins of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, as well as another labor leader and three religious leaders. The National Council of Negro Women also supported the march, but Randolph and other male leaders refused to include its president, Dorothy Height, in the official leadership. Despite vigorous protest from black women, they insisted that women could be represented by men.

2. The main goal of the march was to eliminate Jim Crow laws.

Marchers demanded equal access to public accommodations, housing, education and voting rights, but in an official list of demands, they also called on federal authorities to create “meaningful and dignified jobs at decent wages” for unemployed workers and raise the minimum wage to a level that would “give all Americans a decent standard of living.”

For many participants, the most important demand was a federal Fair Employment Practices Act banning government agencies, private employers, unions and contractors from discriminating against workers. The act had been a central aim of the civil rights movement since Randolph first envisioned a march — and it was realized with the creation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

3. The rhetoric of the march was manipulated and softened by white liberals and the Kennedy administration.

This charge was first made by Malcolm X, who famously dismissed the demonstration as a “Farce on Washington,” and taken up by Black Power and New Left activists in the late 1960s and early 1970s. While the March on Washington gained support from liberals — both black and white — and reluctant acceptance from the Kennedy administration, Randolph, King and other activists retained control over its goals and tactics.

MYTH: Lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables is responsible for the obesity epidemic. “The Obama administration’s Healthy Food Financing Initiative is meant to help low-income communities that lack access to fresh food,” writes Deborah Cohen in “ Five myths about obesity .” “Although the U.S Department of Agriculture estimates that fewer than 5 percent of Americans live in these ‘food deserts,’ about 65 percent of the nation’s population is overweight or obese.” Here, a meal at a Shake Shack restaurant in Moscow. Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg Wait 1 second to continue.

When some liberals objected to Lewis’s use of the words “revolution” and “masses,” Randolph dismissed them, saying, “I’ve used them many times myself.” Lewis did agree to add a mild endorsement of President John F. Kennedy’s civil rights bill to his speech and to drop a plea to “burn Jim Crow to the ground.” Objections to such charged language, however, came from Randolph, King and other black leaders who saw it as a departure from the legislative goals and nonviolent principles at the core of the civil rights movement.

4. Media coverage of the “I Have a Dream” speech focused on interracial harmony, overlooking demands for economic justice and full employment.

King’s speech won widespread praise for its power and eloquence, but it was not seen at the time as the most important expression of the demonstration’s objectives. There were many other players on the stage at the Lincoln Memorial that August day, and they were well covered by the media.

The three major television networks broadcast the entire event live, and it was one of the first events transmitted by satellite to Europe. Newspapers and magazines covered the march extensively, giving particular attention to Randolph and detailing the list of demands. Only after King’s assassination in 1968 did “I Have a Dream” come to be seen as the singular expression of the demonstration’s goals and objectives, overshadowing its economic aims.

5. The march awakened white Americans to the injustices faced by African Americans but had little direct impact on law or policy.

While political leaders and the media praised the march for presenting a peaceful, respectable side of the civil rights movement, the march had little measurable impact on public opinion toward segregation and racial equality. White Americans had grown more tolerant of African Americans and racial integration in the two decades before the March on Washington, and while the demonstration reinforced that trend, it also hardened the opinions of those who remained committed to segregation and white supremacy.

On the other hand, the march did have a direct impact on policy. It solidified a political coalition behind the effort to strengthen and pass the civil rights bill that Kennedy had introduced to Congress in June 1963. In addition to bolstering the enforcement provisions of the law, this coalition added the employment discrimination measures that Kennedy had rejected. Now considered the most important feature of the Civil Rights Act, Title VII was not likely to have been created without the influence of what was officially the “March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.” Even the abbreviated name by which we remember the march obscures its true meaning.

The protest movements that broke out across the western world in 1968 had captured the imagination of many people in Northern Ireland, leading to the creation of a local civil rights movement that began a series of marches and protests calling for greater equality for the Catholic/nationalist minority.

The civil rights movement formed in Belfast in January 1967 drew inspiration from the campaign for equal rights in the United States led by Martin Luther King. Since the creation of Northern Ireland in 1921, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) had held power. The UUP drew its support from the predominantly Protestant unionist/loyalist community and many of the policies it enacted marginalised and discriminated against the Catholic/nationalist minority.

The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) called for wide-ranging reforms: it demanded equal voting rights in local government elections; a fairer system for the allocation of public housing; an end to 'gerrymandering' (the manipulation of electoral boundaries to give one community an electoral advantage); an end to discrimination in employment; the disbandment of the 'B-Specials' (an all-Protestant auxiliary police force); and the repeal of the Special Powers Act (which allowed for internment of suspects without trial).

By 1968, the civil rights movement was beginning to gather support from local politicians as well as some prominent MPs in the British Parliament at Westminster. The Ulster Unionist government in Northern Ireland, led by Prime Minister Terence O'Neill, was under pressure from all sides for its hesitant approach to social reform. The reforms that were made were considered too much by many in the unionist/loyalist community and too little by many of those in the nationalist/republican community. Those on both sides of the debate agreed on one thing - opposition to O'Neill's regime.

Showdown on 5 October

After their first march on 24 August 1968 in County Tyrone, NICRA were invited by the Derry Housing Action Committee (DHAC) to hold a march in County Londonderry on 5 October. The Apprentice Boys of Derry, a Protestant fraternal society, announced plans to march the same route, on the same day. Northern Ireland's Minister of Home Affairs William Craig responded by issuing a banning order on all marches within the boundaries of the planned route.

On the day of the march, a few hundred civil rights protesters planned to walk from Duke Street, in the predominantly Protestant Waterside area of Derry, to the Diamond in the centre of the city. Duke Street had been declared out of bounds by Craig's order and marchers were confronted by rows of police officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).

The police used batons and water cannon in an attempt to disperse the marchers and violent skirmishes broke out. Among those injured in the clash were Gerry Fitt, a Republican and Labour MP, and three Labour MPs (Russell Kerr, Anne Kerr and John Ryan). Dramatic images were captured on camera by the media and broadcast around the world.

Fallout and reaction

Television news coverage of these events brought the situation in Northern Ireland to international attention and serious rioting broke out locally. More civil rights demonstrations and counter demonstrations followed in the weeks and months ahead, with many ending in clashes as the security situation slipped out of control. The next major civil rights march (organised by the People's Democracy) in January 1969 was ambushed just outside Derry by loyalists, with some of the attackers later identified as members of the security forces - in this case B-Specials. Serious rioting followed in Derry that evening and over subsequent days.

Tensions were not confined to the streets. Prime Minister O'Neill was under pressure both inside and outside his own government to take decisive action. O'Neill set up the Cameron Commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding the disturbances in Derry on 5 October 1968. He then called a snap election in an attempt to sideline his critics.

The move backfired. The Ulster Unionist Party retained power but suffered serious splits into pro- and anti-O'Neill factions. O'Neill himself even struggled to retain his own seat, only narrowly holding off the challenge of his political bête noire, Ian Paisley. On 28 April 1969, O'Neill resigned as prime minister of Northern Ireland.

The Troubles escalate

Rioting continued to be commonplace in Derry and Belfast through the summer of 1969, a period which also saw the first deaths of the conflict.

When an Apprentice Boys march in Derry on 12 August sparked rioting in the Catholic 'Bogside' area, two days of serious violence broke out across Northern Ireland. With the police unable to cope with the scope and scale of the disturbances, Northern Ireland's government at Stormont requested that the British Army be sent in to restore order. Initially envisaged as a brief intervention, 'Operation Banner' was to become the longest continuous campaign in the history of the British Army, only coming to an end in July 2007.

By the end of 1969, various 'no-go' areas had been established and 'peace walls' set up in Belfast and Derry. A large population movement began that saw once mixed areas become exclusively Protestant or Catholic, polarising not only people, but also opinions and attitudes. Paramilitary groups on both sides began to re-emerge, gaining in strength and status as widespread civil disorder quickly escalated into a bloody conflict that would last for nearly 30 years.

The Cameron Report, published in September 1969, concluded that there had been ""use of unnecessary and ill-controlled force in the dispersal of the demonstrators"" in Derry on 5 October 1968. Eamonn McCann, one of the organisers of the march, said that the thing he recalled most in the aftermath of the day was ""the number of people who came up to me and said, using the exact phrase: 'Things will never be the same again'. And they were right."""

(AP) — As Congress debates the first national immigration overhaul in decades, a state-level push advancing rights for people in the U.S. illegally has picked up momentum across the country.

Among the patchwork changes to state law taking effect from Maryland to Oregon are provisions that lower tuition rates, advance employment opportunities and repeal hard-line regulations approved within the last decade.

Crowds at May Day rallies across the nation cheered the developments and urged federal progress. Legislative action in several states, meanwhile, coincided with speeches and marches.

""I have a message for Congress and the president,"" said Jeff Stone, representing Oregon's nursery industry at a rally of about 2,000 in Salem.

""Stop talking, and start acting,"" he said.

Stone spoke shortly after Oregon's Democratic governor, John Kitzhaber, signed a bill that will grant immigrants the ability to drive legally in the state.

Many such state-level proposals go beyond what is being discussed on Capitol Hill, and the significant, if piecemeal, shift shows lawmakers reacting to a pendulum swing in public opinion that helped usher many of them into office. But experts also say state legislators have been spurred ahead by halting progress in Washington, D.C.

""The vacuum created by inactivity at the federal level is certainly a major factor, if not the major factor, in states' action on this issue,"" said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the New York division of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.

At least 15 states are in various stages of considering bills that would further integrate immigrants, and several others already have passed such legislation this year. This group is larger than the handful of states moving the other direction, though there are exceptions.

Matt Mayer, a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he doesn't think this year has been significantly different at the state-level than previous years because such immigration proposals have been around for more than a decade.

Story continues

""It's just states trying to deal with what they perceive to be the problem,"" Mayer said.

Georgia lawmakers, for example, expanded a law passed in 2011 to crack down on illegal immigration. And Arizona and Nebraska officials have refused to grant driver's licenses to young immigrants who are authorized to be in the country under the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals directive.

But this is nothing compared with the political climate of recent years where anti-illegal immigration attitudes dominated the national debate.

""This is an interesting evolution,"" Chishti said.

As recently as few years ago, lawmakers around the nation were passing strict regulations that made immigrants in the U.S. without legal permission the subject of police crackdowns and raids.

""The last few years were so harsh at the state level,"" said Wendy Feliz, a spokeswoman for the American Immigration Council.

Colorado legislators have been on both sides. In 2006, Democrats and Republicans came together and passed a law requiring local police to notify federal authorities when they arrested someone suspected of living illegally in the U.S. Last month, behind a push from newly elected Democrats, the law was repealed. Activists praised the move as especially symbolic, saying the law was precursor to more high-profile, hard-line regulations in Arizona and Alabama.

Feliz and other immigrants' rights activists are content to support the state-by-state changes, since they can have a more immediate effect on the 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally.

Federal legislation moves at a far slower pace in both approval and implementation. Also, proposals in the nation's capital affect policy, such as how a person becomes a citizen. The state-level changes deal more in daily concerns, such as the cost of education.

Under laws approved recently in Colorado and Oregon, immigrant students will qualify for resident tuition rates, reducing how much they pay for school by more than two-thirds in some cases. Such DREAM Act proposals have failed repeatedly in both states in recent years.

In Minnesota, such a tuition plan easily passed the state Senate on Wednesday, hours ahead of an immigrants' rights rally that attracted hundreds to the Capitol. The measure faces several legislative hurdles, and it has been rejected twice since 2007. But for the first time the proposal has support from the state's governor, a Democrat who took office in 2011 following a two-term Republican who opposed the plan.

Another immigrants' rights provision advancing in at least a dozen states allows people in the U.S. without legal permission to obtain a driver's card. Besides Oregon, lawmakers in Illinois and Maryland passed such legislation this year, and experts predict that other states also will pass plans.

In Colorado, lawmakers on Wednesday advanced such a proposal. The legislation is likely to become law, and the House committee vote came as a May Day immigration rally drew hundreds of people to its Capitol in support of such measures despite a spring snow storm.

Notably, Texas lawmakers introduced a version of the policy just two years after passing a slate of bills tightening immigration regulations.

""This driver's license stuff is remarkable because it was such a political issue just a few years ago,"" said Jonathan Blazer of the national American Civil Liberties Union.

The business community — including Stone's Oregon Association of Nurseries — has been a strong force behind the state's new driving law. They say it's an economic issue and that the proposal creates job opportunities that will boost the state.

But the changes are also politically motivated, Blazer said. To his point, voters in Colorado, Oregon and Minnesota all supported President Barack Obama in November and handed control of their statehouses to Democrats.

""If Republicans would change their stance on immigration, we would probably vote Republican,"" said Victor Mena, an Oregon resident. Mena supports immigrants' rights in part because he has family members who live in the U.S. without legal permission.

His attitude is indicative of a national trend, as more than 7 in 10 Hispanic voters supported Obama for re-election.

""Every level and stripe of every party has gotten the memo that Latinos are an important voting bloc,"" said Feliz, of the American Immigration Council.

The GOP has softened its stance on the issue, evidenced by the federal immigration overhaul negotiations and the bipartisan support some state-level proposals are receiving.

Still, there are those who disagree.

""We seem to be reaching out and inviting them to stay through policies like this, rather than discouraging illegal behavior,"" said Oregon Republican Rep. Kim Thatcher.

She says her state, and to a degree, her party, is moving the wrong direction on immigration.

""It's not about appealing to voters,"" Thatcher said. ""I believe it's about doing the right thing.""

(Photo by D Dipasupil/Getty Images for Extra)

""Duck Dynasty"" star Phil Robertson made headlines this week for his anti-gay sentiments in a GQ interview. Now another statement from the interview -- this time about the black community during the pre-civil rights era -- is stirring more controversy.

GQ's Drew Magary sat down with the ""Duck Dynasty"" patriarch for a candid interview about his road to fame. The 67-year-old journeyed from substance abuse to devotion to God to small-screen celebrity, all in the backwoods of Louisiana. According to Robertson, growing up in those Louisiana backwoods in the pre-civil rights era was not bad for black people.

“I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person,"" Robertson is quoted in GQ. ""Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I’m with the blacks, because we’re white trash. We’re going across the field.... They’re singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, ‘I tell you what: These doggone white people’—not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.”

Before the civil rights movement of the 1950s, Jim Crow laws enforced a system of subjugating African-Americans in the South by upholding racial barriers for years after the Emancipation Proclamation. The cultural climate in the Southern states was one of ""disenfranchisement, segregation and various forms of oppression, including race-inspired violence,"" History.com notes.

The Human Rights Campaign and the NAACP wrote a joint letter to the president of A&E, expressing deep concern over Robertson's remarks:

We want to be clear why Phil Robertson’s remarks are not just dangerous but also inaccurate. Mr. Robertson claims that, from what he saw, African Americans were happier under Jim Crow. What he didn’t see were lynching and beatings of black men and women for attempting to vote or simply walking down the street. And his offensive claims about gay people fly in the face of science. In fact, it’s important to note that every single leading medical organization in the country has said that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being [lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender] -- it’s not a choice, and to suggest otherwise is dangerous.

Robertson called homosexuality a sin and juxtaposed it with bestiality. After his homophobia made news, A&E released a statement announcing Robertson's indefinite suspension from ""Duck Dynasty."" The network emphasized that his beliefs are in contrast to those of the network.

Serrano Was A Federal Law Enforcement', 'Terrorism Reporter In The Los Angeles Times', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Bureau. He Left The Times In']",Senators disagree on how close they are to a deal on immigration,"WASHINGTON — Key senators trying to negotiate an agreement on immigration reform were divided Sunday on how close they are to reaching a consensus on the legislation.

Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), touting a compromise on work visas brokered Friday by union officials and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, predicted that a bipartisan plan could be announced as soon as next week, when the Senate returns from a two-week recess.

But Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), whose support is seen as critical to attract the votes of conservative GOP senators to a comprehensive effort, said that talk of an agreement was “premature.”

RELATED: Is the border secure?

“We have made substantial progress and I believe we will be able to agree on a legislative proposal,” he said in a terse statement released Sunday. “However, that legislation will only be a starting point.”

Rubio strongly cautioned that the bill would still require extensive public debate in committee hearings and on the Senate floor. “In order to succeed, this process cannot be rushed or done in secret,” he said.

Despite Rubio’s caution, other senators in the so-called Gang of Eight that is working on immigration appeared optimistic that Congress is near a historic breakthrough on reform.

“With the agreement between business and labor, every major policy issue has been resolved,” Schumer said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “I am very, very optimistic that we will have an agreement among the eight of us next week.”

Graham, speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union” show, said: “I think we’ve got a deal. We’ve got to write the legislation, but 2013, I hope, will be the year that we pass bipartisan immigration reform.”

The senators were encouraged by the deal that the AFL-CIO and the chamber reached on a new visa program that would allow low-income laborers into the country. Negotiators had been hung up on how to set the wages for those immigrant workers, but they resolved the issue late Friday.

Schumer acknowledged the caution expressed by Rubio, noting that the legislative language for the bill has not been drafted, but he was optimistic that the group has passed the biggest hurdles. “There’ll be little kerfuffles. But I don’t think any of us expect there to be problems,” he said.

The eight senators, as well as a group in the House, are drafting the bill to solve one of the nation’s most perplexing issues. President Obama also hopes to settle the issue. He has largely left the legislation-writing to Capitol Hill, while continuing to call for a solution at public events.

David Axelrod, who has worked as a top political advisor to the president, said on NBC that Obama was equally hopeful because he views immigration reform as a “legacy item” for his presidency.

“He wants this accomplishment,” Axelrod said. “There’s no doubt in my mind that he wants to pass comprehensive immigration reform.”

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Black Republicans try to appropriate Martin Luther King,"Now it can be told: All the prominent black Republicans in America really can fit into one room.

In fairness, it was a pretty big room.

Republicans, who got just 6 percent of the African American vote in 2012, saw this week’s 50th anniversary celebration of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr’s March on Washington passing them by. So they held their own commemoration. They sent an invitation “far and wide,” as one party official put it, asking black conservatives to lunch at party headquarters. About 150 accepted the invitation for chicken, cheesecake and cheeky suggestions that the late civil rights leader would have supported the causes of today’s conservatives.

Unfortunately, the Party of Lincoln discovered that its technical capability was still rather 19th century. The wireless sound system failed, and the microphone picked up only every few words. The national anthem became: “O’er the rampar . . . ah . . . ah . . . nn . . . oof . . . nigh . . . that . . . ill . . . of the . . . ay.” The hymn “Lift Every Voice and Sing” came out, in part, like this: “Skies . . . ow . . . ow . . . ing see . . . aw . . . ah . . . sing a song . . . rah . . . nah.” Its final verse went something like, “Lest our hearts . . . drunk . . . vil . . . eh . . . ub . . . eh . . . eeh . . . shadow . . . meeeeee.”

As the speakers fired staccato fragments of the speeches at the participants, techs scurried to repair the system, an RNC official sighed and the droning of a power drill on a nearby floor added to the mayhem.

“You know, Republicans can’t turn on a microphone,” quipped Ada Fisher, RNC committeewoman from North Carolina, when she came onstage to say the Pledge of Allegiance.

After a pause, the audio troubles were fixed for the rest of the event. But there remained a good deal of static in the message that came out over the next two hours. Those speaking to the group agreed on the desirability of appropriating King and the anniversary, but they proposed different and contradictory ways.

Alveda King, niece of the great man and champion of conservative causes, sang “Oh, Freedom” but gave the old spiritual evangelical lyrics:

“Oh, freedom, oh, freedom/Oh, freedom over me/I no longer am a slave/Christ is risen from the grave/Christ is Lord, I am saved and I’m free.”

She said, “For me, it’s not as much anymore about politics and affiliations,” adding, “I am a Republican and I’m glad to be a Republican.”

Robert Brown, who worked in the Nixon White House, suggested that Martin Luther King’s spirit might inform leaders in Congress and the White House that “this nation was built on compromise and if we don’t get it all together, we’re going to sink this ship and we can’t afford to do that.” This received scattered applause.

A similar response greeted Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), who criticized the Supreme Court decision that invalidated part of the Voting Rights Act and vowed to repair the law so that it is “impervious to another challenge that will be filed by the usual suspects. I’m with you on that.” The light applause suggested that most of those in attendance were not with him.

But Bob Woodson, a conservative activist, got a standing ovation after he said “We should not wait for evil to wear a white face before we get outraged” and urged his listeners to condemn “corrupt” black politicians. “I think if Dr. King were alive today, he would step on some of these sacred issues.”

It’s anybody’s guess what King would do, but it seems a bit of a stretch to think he would do what T.W. Shannon, speaker of the Oklahoma House, told the audience.

“The key to fulfilling the dream” of King’s, he said, included “quality education for all our children whether in public or private schools,” a “limited government” and curbing a “ferocious appetite for bigger government.” The dream, he went on, must be protected from “contaminants of government dependence, class warfare, socialism and any other pollutant that would muzzle the ring of freedom.”

Shannon proceeded to cite the case of an Alaska woman who beat a moose with a shovel to save her husband — evidence, he said, of “the raw heroic nature of our nation.”

RNC officials who spoke took no position on the moose, and they were less creative in attempting to turn King into a conservative Republican. Sharon Day, RNC co-chairman, noted that it was a Republican Congress that passed the women’s suffrage amendment — in 1919. Reince Priebus, RNC chairman, made the requisite references to the party’s birth and the Great Emancipator.

“We’ve lost the history of this party because we don’t tell it,” he said, “but we’re going to.”

Just as soon as he can get the microphone working.

Pollak'],Ten Facts Conservatives Must Know on Immigration Reform,"Border security is the only basis for Republican unity. Republicans are divided on all other particulars–path to citizenship, guest worker program, deportation, anchor babies, etc. As I’ve argued before, Republican strategy in the House should be to say “no” on issues where there is consensus, and “no, unless” on issues where there is not. In this case, the House should reject any reform unless it puts border security first.

Law enforcement is the only true bipartisan policy. Conservative Republicans have something in common with unions: a common enthusiasm for enforcing immigration law against employers, particularly through the use of e-verify databases for new hires. In addition, working-class voters are less than enthusiastic about legalizing immigrants who would create instant competition in non-farm sectors of the low-skills labor market.

We have tried amnesty before, and it failed. The reason we have some 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States is that a 1986 amnesty enacted by the Reagan administration failed to improve law enforcement (thanks in part to liberal interest groups) and merely created new incentives for illegal immigration. Enforcement is to amnesty as spending cuts are to tax hikes; unless they come first, they do not happen.

Democrats do not want to “resolve” illegal immigration. If they did, it would have been done already. They do want to pass big legislation: back in 2006-7, Democrat strategist (and ex-con) Robert Creamer prescribed immigration reform as the second step in a series of radical changes (after health care). Yet as Daniel Horowitz writes at RedState, Democrats need new immigration-related grievances to fuel their outrage.

Barack Obama began his community organizing career with a radical immigrants’ group. One of Obama’s first organizing assignments in Chicago was with an Alinkyite group called UNO, the “Mexican-American ACORN.” As Stanley Kurtz has exposed, “Obama personally helped plan” some of the group’s most thuggish activities. He has used this issue his entire career to divide Americans and intimidate political opponents.

Regardless of what passes, Obama will take–and receive–credit. Voters will not remember that Obama blocked immigration reform in the Senate, or that he failed to introduce new legislation in his first term, breaking a solemn campaign promise. They will simply remember that they voted for him in 2012 and he signed immigration reform afterwards. Republicans will continue to average 30% of the Hispanic vote regardless.

Regardless of what passes, Republicans will still be labeled bigots. The president has already attempted to delegitimize opposition to immigration reform as motivated by racism; he will likely do so again. He will do so more often, not less, if Republicans give up their insistence on border security first, because then there will seem to be no other basis for opposition to immigration reform. The media will support him enthusiastically.

Immigration is neither the sole Hispanic issue, nor solely a Hispanic issue. Issues such as education and economic opportunity also top the agenda for Hispanic voters. In addition, as Tony Lee has pointed out, Asian immigrants are the fastest-growing group, even outpacing Hispanics in California. Republicans perform equally poorly among Asian-American voters–not because of immigration but likely because of other issues.

The Obama administration has little interest in law enforcement. Last year, the president used executive action to create a “Dream Act” by fiat, circumventing Congress and creating new incentives for illegal immigration. The administration has also done little over the past four years to patrol the borders beyond perfunctory gestures, and strenuously opposed efforts by the state of Arizona to take matters into its own hands.

Immigration does need to be reformed–for skilled immigrants. The area in which U.S. immigration policy is most lacking concerns skilled immigrants, who are choosing other destinations. The Obama administration has not made it easier for skilled students to stay in the country when finished their degree, nor has it removed the cap on H1-B visas. The Democrats’ primary concern is not the economy, nor justice, but new votes."

Now, intensifying a long and furious debate over their place in this society, the nation’s top court has declared that the children of undocumented Haitian migrants — even those born on Dominican soil decades ago — are no longer entitled to citizenship, throwing into doubt the status of tens of thousands of people here who have never known any other national identity.

“I am Dominican,” said Ana María Belique, 27, who was born in the Dominican Republic and has never lived anywhere else, but has been unable to register for college or renew her passport because her birth certificate was no longer accepted. “I don’t know Haiti. I don’t have family or friends there. This is my home.”

In a broad order that has reverberated across the hemisphere, the court has instructed the authorities here to audit all of the nation’s birth records back to June 1929 to determine who no longer qualifies for citizenship, setting off international alarm."

Coming from a half white man... Barry, STFU.

barry's preferred target is the Constitution, and the Constitution is incapable of self-defense. At least Trayvon attacked something capable of fighting back. That puts Trayvon one step above barry in my book.

Seriously? A more ""perfect"" union? This country is getting more divided by the day thanks to BO. All I see now are blacks running rampant looking for an excuse to loot and terrorize. GG BO for setting blacks back a couple more decades.

He isn't going to be happy until we have a full-blown race war. What an idiot. Congratulations Amerika. You elected this clown TWICE!

He wants a race war, and when Whitey finally fights back that's when DHS gets to use their shiny new toys.

Darn right he is divisive!

But a majority of the Black population is too.

Tell you what Mr. President, if you don't like our legal system, why not move to another country, and take your Racist supporters with you!

Whites aren't racist, they are tired of African Americans being slothful, violent, criminal, and milking the system because they squandered their free public education, and refused to learn to read, write, do arithmetic, and speak English.

Blacks are their own worst enemy!

John Derbyshire was fired when He warned Whites to stay away from Blacks.For those too stupid to follow his advice will find out what it is like to try and carry a cat home by his tail.

Aw what'sa matter, Obama? You didn't get all the mobs and deaths you wanted out of this verdict? Not enough looting and plundering and blood for you? It was bad enough when you tacitly called on the black community to take revenge on Zimmerman by declaring that he had murdered 'your son'. Now you're saying that Zimmerman murdered YOU - and you're silently calling on all your political lovers to go out and get even on everyone else because of your 'unjust death'. Obama - you really are a cad. I would say shame on you, but you've proven already with your greedy and wicked life that you have no shame. The sooner you are cast out of office, the better.

Repeatedly, in his own words in his own books and speeches, Obama (and most of the 96% of blacks who are Democrats) are irrational, racist, socialists who commit the majority of all crime in America in and out of government.

What do you get when a Community Organizer raised in Indonesian madrassas, tutored by Frank Marshall Davis, and mentored by Jeremiah Wright for 20 years gets reelected President? CIVIL RACE WARS 2013

Well it’s a Fact Obama is a racist no more hiding it Barry, to

all you guilt feeling libs and to all the Hispanics that voted for him enjoy

your President you are now consider White Hispanic so you get to bend over and hold your ankles like the white folks, hope and change more like racist and violence, only in a America a violent thug is honored like a hero, but only if you’re a black thug White /

Hispanics have to answer for their crimes, Race War coming soon thanks to Obama,

and the libs are so happy but the truth is you will be the first ones taken out,

Blacks don’t really like you and hardworking Whites and Hispanics hate you also Vote Racist Vote Black.

Trayvon got what he deserved. More thugs need the get the same. Obama, you're full of $hit as a Christmas turkey.

You need to resign and go back to Indonesia and, while you're at it, take that chimpanzee of a wife with you. IMPEACH Obama...REMOVE and IMPRISON the entire cabinet and all political appointees

I'm so sick of this jacka** inserting race and himself into every situation that involves an african American-yet he's silent, you can even hear crickets chirping, if the incident involves a Caucasian.

His very statement about the outcome and aftermath being different had it been a white male is a moot point.

Had it been a white male it would have never even been covered by the national media and that's because there are no white counterparts to the tag team duo of obama and sharpton to bring up the race issue which they are so masterfully skilled at.

Like Clint Eastwood said to Spike Lee-""HE NEEDS TO SHUT HIS FACE.""

How long did it take Obama to speak out ON BEHALF of the four American heroes killed in Benghazi? What did he do to impact their deaths? Dis he have holder change nay of our laws? Did he support any protests? Short Answer: NO!

Is this country going to survive the race and socioeconomic wars this administration seems intent upon bringing on all of us? The President has clearly drawn lines in the sand with these comments, setting us up for a black against white race war. How can we have a ""more perfect union"" when the President has done this kind of race-baiting?

Let me count the times I threw up a little in my mouth when I watched that SOB give that speech. Nothing like watching a dictator try to humble himself knowing that his little plan for Zimmerman didn't work out.

Obama should have edumacated the black masses instead of blowing smoke up their bungholios... trayvon profiled Zimmerman... assaulted him... because he thought he was gay... that is testimony from Jeantel on the witness stand and in interviews on CNN and msnbs...

No surprise the black community has to ignore the facts to justify their childish and uneducated reaction to the truth.

Obamacare and the auto bailout are imploding and we have to listen to this CRAP! What a POS ideologue!! What an absolute embarrassment! Undeserving of the office of the presidency, posturing to representing not the country but his particular race (or at least the one he identifies with)!! If I had a petty dictator of a president he would be Barrack Obama.

This is only a diversion so you won't think about the real problems such as the IRS and Benghazi. As long as we are bickering about Trayvon, we tend to forget about the important things

The president has pledged to make comprehensive immigration reform a priority during the next few months, and Republicans and Democrats in Congress have been meeting toward a possible deal.

But that's not enough for activists in Chicago who want the administration to slow the number of deportations, which reached 410,000 for the year ending last October.

""President Obama cannot talk about human rights if he doesn't stop the deportation of human beings whose families are being torn apart,"" the Rev. Jose Landaverde, a Little Village pastor, said during a news conference last week outside the downtown offices of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Monday's march is set to begin at 11 a.m. at the Daley Center and end with a rally at Federal Plaza.

As they call for a moratorium on deportations, organizers plan to highlight a case in which 34 workers at an Elk Grove Village pallet company were arrested by federal immigration agents in November. Those workers are now in proceedings that could lead to deportation.

The arrests sparked a series of small protests in recent weeks, leading to a meeting last week among ICE officials, U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Chicago, and immigration activists.

ICE spokeswoman Gail Montenegro said federal agents executing a search warrant in an unrelated criminal investigation learned that the workers at Chicago Pallet Service Inc. were in the country illegally. She declined to discuss the nature of the initial investigation. Gutierrez said the probe involved money laundering.

Gutierrez and immigration activists met with ICE officials in the hope of persuading them to suspend the arrested workers' cases under what is known as prosecutorial discretion.

Montenegro said ICE officials agreed to consider the request ""on a case-by-case basis."" She added that the agency is focused on ""sensible, effective enforcement"" that prioritizes deporting hardened criminals and repeat offenders over less urgent cases.

“A bipartisan group of senators plans to introduce its long-awaited immigration bill on Tuesday, Senate sources confirmed to ABC News,” Jim Avila and Jordan Fabian wrote on Friday. “Four Democrats and four Republicans, known as the ‘Gang of Eight,’ wrapped up months of hard-fought negotiations this week and will put forth a bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.”

If the Senators actually do wait until Tuesday to roll out their lengthy proposed overhaul of the U.S. immigration system, that will give members of the Senate Judiciary Committee less than a full day to read it before the only Senate hearing on the topic. Despite ardent pleas from Senate conservatives, including ranking Senate Judiciary Committee member Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committee’s chairman, Sen. Pat Leahy, has only agreed to one hearing on the legislation.

Leahy scheduled that single hearing for Wednesday at 2:30 PM, and the hearing’s sole scheduled witness is Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. Napolitano would have less than a full day to read the bill she is scheduled to testify about.

“Gang of Eight” member Marco Rubio (R-FL) has said he supports multiple hearings and an open and transparent immigration reform process, but his actions do not necessarily back his words. He has not pushed Leahy to force multiple hearings; he appears content with the single hearing Leahy has scheduled on the issue and now appears to be backing down from his demand for multiple hearings.

In a Friday morning report, Politico’s Manu Raju notes that after Rubio was “rebuffed” in his request for multiple hearings, “the senator wants to launch his own public hearing process of sorts to allow Republican senators to question expert witnesses about the plan, a move aimed at alleviating conservative fears that the plan will be jammed through Congress with little public airing.”

Rubio is clearly worried about the perception that this bill will be rushed through, just like Obamacare was a few years ago. On Saturday morning, Rubio’s office issued a press release containing a single quote from Fox News Channel’s Chris Wallace:

The one thing that’s clear is that this isn’t going to be health care reform. It’s not going to be rushed through. It’s going to go through the committee process. There’s going to be hearings. There will be lots of amendments. And I think the only way to get buy in from some of those other 92 senators is going to be regular order, that is a very gradual slow way.

Despite Wallace’s claim, there is only one hearing that is scheduled to happen. At the same time, there are multiple reports that keep surfacing indicating that the Gang of Eight will band together to block amendments to their bill."

http://uk.news.yahoo.com/firing-attractive-woman-legal-court-rules-150422461.html,,[],"Firing Attractive Woman Legal, Court Rules","A court has decided that an Iowa dentist did not discriminate against a female assistant when he fired her for being ""too attractive"".

The case began when Dr James Knight sacked dental hygienist Melissa Nelson after more than 10 years' service because he found her too attractive and his wife saw her as a threat.

In December, the all-male the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that Dr Knight did not discriminate against Ms Nelson.

She had argued she would not have been fired if she were a man, and her lawyer, Paige Fiedler, argued in seeking a second hearing that their decision was a setback for gender equality in the workplace.

In late June, the justices decided to reconsider the case.

""We ultimately conclude the conduct does not amount to unlawful sex discrimination in violation of the Iowa Civil Rights Act,"" Justice Edward Mansfield wrote.

Dr Knight had hired Nelson in 1999 and on several occasions in the 18 months before he fired her in early 2010, he complained that her clothing was too tight, revealing and distracting, the decision said.

She denied wearing anything inappropriate.

Ms Nelson and Dr Knight began texting each other in 2009, the opinion said.

Most messages were work-related or otherwise innocuous, but some were more suggestive, including one in which the dentist asked his hygienist how often she had an orgasm, the opinion said.

Ms Nelson did not answer that text.

""The fact of the matter is Nelson was terminated because of the activities of her consensual personal relationship with her employer, not because of her gender,"" Chief Justice Mark Cady wrote in a separate 'special concurrence'.

In late 2009, Dr Knight's wife, Jeanne Knight, learned that her husband had been exchanging texts with Ms Nelson while he was on an out-of-state vacation with their children.

She insisted that he dismiss her, saying ""she was a big threat to our marriage"", the opinion said.

Dr Knight read Ms Nelson a statement when he fired her that said in part that their relationship had become a detriment to both of their families.

Ms Nelson's lawyer said on Friday she was ""beyond distressed at the lack of awareness and understanding this decision demonstrates"".

Ms Fiedler said in a statement: ""Women already have to balance on the very fine line of being respected, professional and well-liked in the workplace without having their perceived charm or attractiveness garner unwanted sexual advances, harassment and discrimination."""

But after the difficulty he had this weekend getting a proper ID card, Wright, 90, expressed concern that such problems could deter others from voting and stifle turnout. After spending much of his life fighting to make it easier to vote, the Democratic Party icon said he is troubled by what he’s seeing happen under the state’s new voter ID law. “I earnestly hope these unduly stringent requirements on voters won’t dramatically reduce the number of people who vote,” Wright told the Star-Telegram. “I think they will reduce the number to some extent.” Wright and his assistant, Norma Ritchson, went to the DPS office on Woodway Drive to get a State of Texas Election Identification Certificate. Wright said he realized earlier in the week that the photo identifications he had — a Texas driver’s license that expired in 2010 and a TCU faculty ID — do not satisfy requirements of the voter ID law, enacted in 2011 by the Legislature. DPS officials concurred.

We want to make sure that every eligible Texan who wants to cast a ballot can,” Pierce said. “We want to help any Texan who needs additional information."" Wright, who said he has voted in every election since 1944, lamented that such help is called for. “From my youth I have tried to expand the elections,” Wright said. “I pushed to abolish the poll tax. I was the first to come out for lowering the voting age to 18.”

Not everyone will have the resources, or knowledge, that Wright has to overcome these obstacles. And Wright puts it very well:The state put up these obstacles in the first place- now they are 'concerned' to make sure everyone can overcome them. They have 'solved' non-existent voter fraud problems by creating actual problems.

For help with getting Voter ID the linked article suggests:

For more information, voters may call the Texas secretary of state's office at 800-252-VOTE (8683) or the Tarrant County Elections Office at 817-831-VOTE (8683). Go online for more information at www.tarrantcounty.com/evote or votexas.org.

Will: DOMA infringes on states’ rights,"“[U]nder the Constitution, the regulation and control of marital and family relationships are reserved to the States.”

— U.S. Supreme Court,

Sherrer v. Sherrer (1948)

The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is an exception to the rule that a law’s title is as uninformative about the law’s purpose as the titles of Marx Brothers movies (“Duck Soup,” “Horse Feathers,” “Animal Crackers”) are about those movies’ contents. DOMA’s purpose is precisely what its title says. Which is why many conservatives and liberals should be uneasy Wednesday when the Supreme Court hears arguments about its constitutionality.

Conservatives who supported DOMA should, after 17years’ reflection, want the act overturned because its purpose is constitutionally improper. Liberals who want the act struck down should be discomfited by the reason the court should give when doing this.

DOMA, which in 1996 passed the House 342 to 67 and the Senate 85 to 14, defines marriage for the purpose of federal law as a legal union between one man and one woman. Because approximately 1,100 federal laws pertain to marriage, DOMA’s defenders argue that Congress merely exercised its power to define a term used in many statutes. But before 1996, federal statutes functioned without this definition, which obviously was adopted for the “defense” of marriage against state policies involving a different definition. “Before DOMA,” an amicus brief submitted by a group of federalism scholars notes, “federal law took state law as it found it.”

The question now is whether DOMA is “necessary and proper” for the exercise of a constitutionally enumerated congressional power. There is no such power pertaining to marriage. This subject is a state responsibility, a tradition established and validated by what can be called constitutional silence: The 10th Amendment says, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”

The amicus brief takes no position on same-sex marriage as social policy. Rather, it addresses a question that should obviate the need to address whether DOMA violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws. The threshold question is: Does the federal government have the power that DOMA’s preamble proclaims, the power “to define and protect the institution of marriage”?

DOMA’s obvious purpose is, as the scholars’ brief says, “to reject state governments’ policy judgments.” Its purpose is to endorse, and to some extent enforce, the traditional understanding of marriage. The scholars’ brief says:

“Congress may regulate in this area to the extent necessary to further its enumerated powers. But it may not simply reject the states’ policy judgments as if it had the same authority to make domestic-relations law as they do. That is the difference between a government with a general police power and a government of limited and enumerated powers.”

Ernest A. Young of the Duke Law School, the principal author of the federalism brief, says the operation of DOMA cannot help but burden states because “federal and state law are pervasively intertwined.” To understand the harm that could be done by an unlimited federal power to define the terms of domestic-relations law, Young recalls when a few states, venturing beyond the national consensus, began experimenting with no-fault divorce. Suppose, Young says, Congress passed a statute refusing recognition, for purposes of federal law, of any divorce where neither party made a showing of fault:

“The couple would continue to be treated as married for purposes of federal income tax, health care programs and veterans’ benefits. Imagine the chaos this would wreak in the administration of state programs, and the pressure it would impose on states not to experiment with divorce law.”

As the scholars’ brief says, DOMA “shatters two centuries of federal practice” by creating “a blanket federal marital status that exists independent of states’ family-status determinations.” Federalism, properly respected, enables diversity as an alternative to a congressionally imposed, continent-wide moral uniformity. Allowing Washington to impose such conformity would ratify unprecedented federal supremacy regarding domestic relations, a power without judicially administrable limits. By striking down DOMA — by refusing to defer to Congress’s usurpation of states’ powers — the court would defer to 50 state governments, including the 38 that today prohibit same-sex marriage.

Liberals praise diversity but generally urge courts to permissively construe the Constitution in order to validate federal power to impose continental uniformities. DOMA is such an imposition. Liberals may be rescued from it by jurisprudence true to conservative principles, properly understood.

The comment sparked criticism from activists and politicians

Police Commissioner Kelly said separately that 90%25 of New Yorkers killed or shot are minorities

A federal lawsuit is ongoing over %27stop and frisk%27 procedures

NEW YORK (AP) — Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Friday that police ""disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little"" as compared to murder suspects' descriptions, sparking criticism from activists and some politicians in a city that has been immersed in a debate about law enforcement and discrimination.

Speaking on his weekly WOR-AM radio appearance, Bloomberg echoed an argument he has made before: that the stops' demographics should be assessed against suspect descriptions, not the population as a whole. But coming a day after city lawmakers voted to create a police inspector general and new legal avenues for racial profiling claims, the mayor's remarks drew immediate pushback.

The measures' advocates accused the mayor of using ""irresponsible rhetoric,"" some mayoral hopefuls chastised him and some City Council members said his remarks only emphasized the need for change.

""Our mayor's comments prove he just doesn't get it,"" said Councilman Robert Jackson, who co-chairs the council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus.

Bloomberg spokesman Marc LaVorgna said the critics were ""fabricating outrage over an absolutely accurate comment.""

""What they should be outraged by is the number of minorities who are being killed and that successful police efforts to save minority lives are being hampered,"" he added.

Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly noted separately Friday that more than 90% of people killed or shot in the city are black or Hispanic.

The police tactic known as stop and frisk has become a high-profile political issue in the city, where stops have soared during Bloomberg's three terms. He and Kelly say the stops are an invaluable policing aid and have helped cut crime rates dramatically, while critics say the street stops humiliate many innocent people and are unfairly focused on minorities.

Those complaints have prompted a federal lawsuit over the stop and frisk practice and were part of the impetus for the City Council's vote Thursday. Bloomberg reiterated Friday that he'll veto the legislation, which he says will impede policing. They passed with enough votes to override a veto, but the mayor has noted that he plans to keep pressing his case with lawmakers.

About 5 million stops have been made during the past decade. Eighty-seven% of those stopped in the last two years were black or Hispanic. Those groups comprise 54% of the city population.

Bloomberg says that comparison isn't appropriate.

The racial breakdown of those stopped is ""not a disproportionate percentage of those who witnesses and victims describe as committing the murder. In that case, incidentally, I think we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little,"" he said Friday on ""The John Gambling Show.""

More than 90% of suspects in killings in the last two years were described as black or Hispanic, according to city officials.

""The cops' job is to stop (people in) the groups fitting the description. It's society's job to make sure that no one group is disproportionately represented as potential perpetrators,"" Bloomberg said earlier in the show.

The group Communities United for Police Reform called Bloomberg's view misinformation, noting that most stops aren't spurred by suspect descriptions. Police department records of the stops also list such reasons as ""furtive movements"" or suspicious bulges in clothing.

""Mayor Bloomberg should cease with the irresponsible rhetoric and seek to work with the council on a constructive path forward,"" said Communities United for Police Reform spokeswoman Joo-Hyun Kang.

Public Advocate and mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio sent supporters an email rapping Bloomberg's remarks, while fellow contender and City Comptroller John Liu issued a statement calling them ""insensitive, outrageous, and just plain weird."" Rival and former City Comptroller Bill Thompson, who is black, termed Bloomberg's comments insulting and called on him to apologize.

""What he seems to indicate to the hundreds of thousands of people who have been unnecessarily stopped and frisked is, 'We're sorry we didn't stop more people,'"" Thompson said."

The sensitivity training sessions taped here were held on USDA premises, and is part of what Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack termed the department’s “new era of Civil Rights” and “broader effort towards cultural transformation at USDA.” The training sessions were created by diversity awareness trainer Samuel Betances at a cost of approximately $200,000.

The video highlights include:

Betances explaining to USDA employees that “If you take a look at all of you here and you think about your salaries and your benefits and what you have left undone – plus my fee – plus the expense of the team that putting the video together, this is a huge expense.”

Betances urging to repeat the leftist version of American history: “I want you to say that America was founded by outsiders – say that – who are today’s insiders, who are very nervous about today’s outsiders. I want you to say, ‘The pilgrims were illegal aliens.’ Say, ‘The pilgrims never gave their passports to the Indians.”

Betances stating, “By the way, I don’t like the word ‘minorities.’ How about ’emerging majorities’?”

The complete video is available through the Judicial Watch website.

Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, told Breitbart News, “This was a pretty straightforward attempt at psychological reconditioning. Underlying the whole program is the theory that white males especially are inherently racist, sexist, or homophobic. It’s a huge waste of taxpayer dollars.

“This is as objectionable or as significant as the GSA Las Vegas scandal. This is a program blessed at the highest levels of the USDA. We found out about it because of a whistleblower who was forced to undergo this type of training. They’ve obviously selling this left-wing diversity cult,” said Fitton.

When Clara Foltz began studying to become a lawyer in the late 1860s, she was trying to feed her five children. Foltz’s husband had run off, and she’d turned in succession to teaching, sewing and taking in boarders, but none of it brought in much income. Hoping for better, she studied law with the help of her father, who was an attorney in San Jose. Foltz needed his aid because the top lawyer in town refused to take her on, calling her ambition a “foolish pursuit” that would bring “ridicule if not contempt.”

California in those days had no rules about what aspiring lawyers had to study or for how long — the state merely required residency for six months. Plus male anatomy. Lacking that, Foltz had to beg. “I coaxed, I entreated,” she said of her lobbying of the California legislature. “I almost went down on my knees before them asking for the pitiful privilege of an equal chance to earn an honest living in a noble profession.”

A bill to admit women to the state bar squeaked through the legislature in 1878, by a vote of 37 to 35. As Jill Norgren tells it in “Rebels at the Bar,” her conscientious history of the country’s first female lawyers, Foltz then “virtually flung herself at the governor, called out the number of the bill, and held her breath until he signed it into law.” California joined only Wisconsin and the District of Columbia in allowing qualified women to practice law.

In one sense, Foltz and her fellow pioneers were asking to take the essentially conservative step of joining a middlebrow profession that primarily offered the prospect of financial gain. But the simple fact of their sex meant, of course, that they could not become lawyers without provoking broader change. It’s a lesson that also applies to the drive today to legalize same-sex marriage. Gay couples who want to get married are claiming the conventional mantle of the institution — they want the same rights as straight couples — while at the same time, of course, remaking marriage in their own image. Female lawyers once did the same. Sometimes, it takes a social revolution to change the box to be checked on a form from “male” to “female” (or vice versa).

Foltz, who is also the subject of an excellent biography by Stanford law professor Barbara Babcock, went on to petition for curtailing husbands’ power over property acquired during marriage and for granting women the right to vote. She also argued for the first parole board, created in California in 1893, and for a constitutional right to counsel for criminal defendants — “an entirely new and original solution,” as Norgren writes, which the Supreme Court adopted many decades later in Gideon v. Wainwright (which turned 50 years old this spring).

Foltz is one of eight barrier-breaking women Norgren profiles. The collection allows her to showcase the women’s variety; they followed no common script in terms of upbringing or marriage. While Foltz had a deadbeat husband and supportive parents, Belva Lockwood’s father refused her request to go back to school at 18, after she spent four years as a rural teacher. It was her second husband who stood by her while she waged a long struggle for a legal education, culminating in a sharp letter to President Ulysses S. Grant, the nominal president of her university, demanding the diploma she was denied after completing her courses. Later, as a widow, Lockwood fought another years-long battle, this time with Congress, to become the first woman admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court bar. (She was also the first woman to ride a bicycle around the capital, a bit of daring that prompted President Grover Cleveland to instruct the wives of his Cabinet officers not to follow her example.)

Once Lockwood won her battles for recognition as a lawyer, she “felt free to link her support for equality of professional opportunity and woman suffrage,” Norgren writes. “If women are allowed to be physicians, clergymen, and last, but not least, lawyers . . . why should they not be allowed to vote?” Lockwood asked.

It was a good question. When the 14th and 15th Amendments passed after the Civil War, forbidding states to abridge “the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States” and to deny the vote to black men, suffragists were crushed because women had been left out. As Norgren points out, the early female lawyers argued that the 14th Amendment implicitly granted women the full privileges of citizenship.

Myra Bradwell tried this idea on the U.S. Supreme Court in 1873, six years before Lockwood’s victory in Congress. Locked out of the Illinois bar by the state courts, Bradwell appealed to the Supreme Court, where her lawyer — a man, of course — urged the justices to find that denying membership in the state bar on the basis of sex violated the privileges of citizenship guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Bradwell lost, 8 to 1. In an infamous concurring opinion, Justice Joseph P. Bradley wrote that women did not have the freedom to work that men did, because “the natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of civil life.”

Bradley’s words drew laughs when he read them aloud in the courtroom. But the prejudice he embedded in the court’s precedents held sway beyond the passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote in 1920. It was not until the 1970s that the Supreme Court struck down state laws that treated men and women differently for no good reason.

The lawyer who brought those crucial challenges was Ruth Bader Ginsburg. When she became a justice of the Supreme Court, she hung a photograph and a political cartoon of Belva Lockwood outside her chambers. The women who went first — whose stories Norgren so capably tells — matter deeply to the ones who came after.

Since he declared that marriage equality is part of the road “through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall,” we can’t imagine how he could have sat this one out.

The administration’s brief to the Supreme Court was a legally and symbolically important repudiation of Proposition 8, the 2008 voter referendum that amended California’s Constitution to forbid bestowing the title of marriage on a union between two people of the same sex — a right the California Supreme Court had found to be fundamental under the State Constitution.

Like the arguments made by the lawyers for those who seek to overturn Proposition 8, and by a group of prominent Republicans earlier this week, the government’s brief says any law attempting to ban same-sex marriage must be subjected to heightened scrutiny because it singles out a class of Americans, historically subject to discrimination, for unequal treatment.

The brief said California’s civil unions law provides the rights and protections of marriage, so Proposition 8’s denial of the designation of marriage “does not substantially further any important governmental interest.”"

The Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office sting was revealed on Saturday by the Baton Rouge Advocate, which investigated the arrests of at least a dozen Louisiana gay men since 2011 who agreed to consensual gay sex with undercover officers. In all of the cases, the men were arrested under the state's anti-sodomy law, which was struck down as unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2003 ruling in Lawrence v. Texas.

Technically invalid yet still on the books, the state's ""Crime Against Nature"" law prohibits “unnatural carnal copulation by a human being with another of the same-sex or opposite-sex or with an animal” along with “solicitation by a human being of another with the intent to engage in any unnatural carnal copulation for compensation,” according to Louisiana legislature.

“This is a law that is currently on the Louisiana books, and the sheriff is charged with enforcing the laws passed by our Louisiana Legislature,” Casey Rayborn Hicks, a Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman, told the Baton Rouge Advocate. “Whether the law is valid is something for the courts to determine, but the sheriff will enforce the laws that are enacted.”

However, the Advocate also revealed that none of these cases had been prosecuted by District Attorney Hillar Moore III, whose office could find no evidence of any crime being committed by any of the arrested men.

While Hicks argued that the fact that the men agreed to sex in a public park made their actions illegal, Equality Louisiana’s Bruce Parker told MSNBC.com that this claim carried little legitimacy as no sex ever actually happened in the park and most of the men intended to have sex at a private residence.

“They started a conversation and the officer invited him back,"" Parker said. ""That’s a conversation that could happen anywhere. It’s the equivalent of me asking you out in a Post Office.”

As outrage from advocates for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community grew over the weekend, the East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Office posted two statement on its Facebook page. The first was a defense of the policy, which claimed that department was not trying to target or embarrass any particular community.

""When we receive calls from the public about lewd activity near our children, we have to respond,"" the statement reads. ""Our park operations, conducted at the specific request of the BREC Park’s Ranger, were an attempt to deter or stop lewd activity occurring in the park near children... The deputies used a statute that they felt fit the situation in order to remedy the concerns of the parents and park officials.""

However, one hour and several Facebook comments later the department posted a second, more conciliatory status:

The goal of our statement was to express our intent to the public, which was to keep the parks safe. We admit, however, the approach needs to change. We are not making excuses, simply stating we will learn from this, make changes and move forward. We will be working with all branches of government to find a better solution for keeping our parks safe. Thanks to all for their input.

While it appears that law enforcement in Louisiana may be rethinking any further application of the anti-sodomy statutes, ThinkProgress notes that similar laws remain on the books in over a dozen other states. In fact, two years ago a Michigan sheriff’s office was revealed to be executing similar stings against gay men in the area.

UPDATE on July 29 at 2:45pm ET: The East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff’s office has released a statement with an apology which note, ""While sections of La. R.S. 14:89, Crimes Against Nature, have not been removed from the Louisianalaw code, they have been deemed unenforceable and unconstitutional. The Sheriff’s Office will not use these unconstitutional sections of the law in future cases."" Read more at The New Civil Rights Movement."

The film — based on a Washington Post article written by Wil Haygood in 2008 — has a cast headlined by Forest Whitaker as Cecil Gaines. Gaines, an African American born a sharecropper’s son in Georgia, goes to Washington in the 1950s and eventually serves eight U.S. presidents as a White House butler.

Over the past several decades, important feature films have been made about most of the historical and cultural touchstones of post-World War II America, from the Vietnam War and John F. Kennedy’s assassination to Watergate and women’s liberation. But there’s been one glaring exception: The breadth and depth of the civil rights movement — the most influential social and political force of the 20th century, not just on American life but throughout the world — has never been represented in the dominant narrative medium of our age.

Until now.

A number of films about the civil rights movement are in various stages of development. The first out of the gate will be “Lee Daniels’ The Butler,” which stars Forest Whitaker as Cecil Gaines, an African American man born a sharecropper’s son in Georgia, who comes to Washington in the 1950s and eventually serves eight U.S. presidents as a White House butler. (The film is based on a Washington Post article written by Wil Haygood in 2008.)

Directed by Daniels and featuring a cavalcade of stars in cameo roles, “The Butler” largely focuses on Gaines’s family life and interactions with the presidential families he serves. But it also chronicles the burgeoning movement taking shape on the streets far beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.

While Gaines silently observes Dwight D. Eisenhower grappling with school desegregation, Lyndon B. Johnson preparing to sign the 1965 voting rights act and Richard M. Nixon plotting against the Black Panthers, his son Louis (David Oyelowo) is sitting in at a Nashville lunch counter, joining the Freedom Riders, crossing paths with Martin Luther King Jr. and eventually joining the Panthers himself.

Similar scenes have been portrayed as backdrops or perfunctory montages in previous films. But “The Butler,” which arrives in theaters Friday, is the first major feature film to capture the full sweep and scope of the civil rights movement, including its global reverberations. (Gaines retires during the administration of Ronald Reagan, who is seen vetoing sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime.) For that reason, if “The Butler” does well at the box office, projects about the same era that have been stalled over the past several years may find renewed momentum. Conversely, should the film flop, some of Hollywood’s most pernicious myths — most pointedly that there are not wide audiences for historical dramas in general and black films in particular — will become all the more entrenched.

“Yikes,” said Daniels, who visited Washington last week, when he considered “The Butler” as a cinematic and cultural bellwether. Upon reflection, however, it’s a burden he was happy to accept. “If it opens the doors for other civil rights films and African American dramas, right on,” he said. “That’s a great thing. Anything to help the cause.”

At least four major film or television projects about the civil rights movement are in the works: DreamWorks is developing an untitled Martin Luther King Jr. biopic. “Memphis,” about King’s final days and the hunt for his assassin, is back on track with director Paul Greengrass and producer Scott Rudin after being dropped by Universal Pictures in 2011. Director Ava DuVernay is preparing to direct “Selma,” about the 1965 voting rights campaign (a film that Daniels himself once intended to direct). And “America: In the King Years,” based on Taylor Branch’s trilogy of civil rights books, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning “Parting the Waters,” is in development as a seven-part mini-series at HBO.

Each of these projects has been gestating over several years, and each of them has been stymied or derailed at some point, sometimes because of disputes over King’s life rights, sometimes because financing fell apart, sometimes because a filmmaker got cold feet. But all of them have been subject to the tyranny of “comparables” in the entertainment business, whereby executives green-light or drop movies based on the performance of projects with similar themes and casting configurations.

“In any business, part of the job is to mitigate your risk,” Edward Saxon told me in 2007. Saxon, an independent producer, worked with Jonathan Demme 20 years ago when Demme sought to adapt “Parting the Waters” as a feature film. “So you say, ‘Okay, if this superhero movie does even half of what that superhero movie did, it’ll be successful.’ But when you tried to call up comparables on a movie like ‘Parting the Waters,’ they [didn’t] exist.”

That math might be changing. Consider: In 2009, Daniels’s drama “Precious: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire” became an unexpected art-house hit, and earned Daniels an Oscar nomination. Last year, “Lincoln,” Steven Spielberg’s historical drama about the 16th U.S. president, exceeded even Spielberg’s commercial expectations. This year, the Jackie Robinson biopic “42” and the micro-budget contemporary drama “Fruitvale Station” have both done well at the box office, earning more than $95 million and $10 million, respectively.

And it’s no coincidence that “The Butler” is opening the same month as did “The Help,” the period drama about African American domestic workers and their white employers that became a box-office smash in 2011 — and that shares more than a little thematic DNA with “The Butler.”

Eugene Allen saw eight presidents come and go over three decades serving on The White House staff. On Background's Nia-Malika Henderson talks with Wil Haygood, who wrote a book about Allen and whose reporting inspired the film version of ""The Butler."" (The Washington Post)

Knowing the importance of comparables, “The Butler” screenwriter Danny Strong crossed his fingers when “The Help” came out, watching its commercial journey closely. “I was writing ‘The Butler’ simultaneously and I was very worried: Could this hurt getting ‘The Butler’ made?” Strong recalled last week. On the strength of the $180 million “The Help” earned at the box office, he added, “we were able to go to private financiers and say, ‘Look at what a hit this was.’ It was enormously helpful in giving people confidence that we could quote unquote be the next ‘Help.’ And if we can make half as much as ‘The Help’ did, we’re a hit.”

Of course, the reason why “The Butler” was financed independently — the film boasts more than 30 producers, each of whom ponied up some money for the $25 million production — is because Sony, the studio that originally optioned Haygood’s article, has almost entirely gotten out of the business of producing modestly budgeted dramas. Like every other major movie company, Sony’s revenue is increasingly coming from overseas, where tent-pole pictures such as “Spider-Man” and “Men in Black” habitually rake in the euros. And like every studio, Sony has been operating under the stubborn belief that black films don’t do well overseas — despite success stories like “The Help,” which earned a respectable $42 million in non-U.S. markets.

For that reason, even with such recognizable stars as Whitaker, Oprah Winfrey and Cuba Gooding Jr., Daniels felt compelled to cast the biggest white stars he could find, “name actors that meant something overseas, so that we could finance the film.” (“The Butler” features Jane Fonda, Robin Williams, John Cusack and Alan Rickman in cameo roles.)

Despite the fact that the studio didn’t go forward with the project, Daniels credits Sony’s co-chairman, Amy Pascal, for seeing value in the story in the first place. “I’m not upset with her, I’m upset with the system,” he said, adding that the studios’ recalcitrance is “an incredible testament to Hollywood underestimating the intelligence of America.”

Branch, for one, is eager to put the “black doesn’t travel” shibboleth to rest. “To me, it’s just a matter of intuition that that’s wrong, because the civil rights movement went abroad so strongly,” he says. “The Solidarity movement against the Soviet Union was modeled on sit-ins. They were singing ‘We Shall Overcome’ in Prague and in South Africa. . . . I am convinced that in Germany and in India and Asia, a good story that crosses racial barriers and shows the potential of democratic freedom will have an enormous market, not necessarily because it’s black, but because it’s in the larger sphere of people growing.”

Branch says he’ll be watching how “The Butler” does domestically and, perhaps most crucially, internationally. “There are a hundred movies about that era that might come crowding behind the first successful one.”

Branch also thinks the election of Barack Obama represented a shift that is only now being seem in movies, a sentiment shared by “Selma” director DuVernay — who notes that a wide range of movies about African Americans are being released this year, including “Fruitvale Station,” the pre-Civil War-era drama “12 Years a Slave,” and “Black Nativity,” a modern-day musical. DuVernay isn’t looking to “The Butler” as an augury of “Selma’s” fortunes once it’s ready to make a distribution deal. “I would say it’s much less about one film as opposed to an overall collective energy around what’s real, what’s viable and what’s relevant and worth being told,” she said.

Whether it’s a function of comparables, cultural progress, changes in the global film business or the Obama effect, the zeitgeist seems to be shifting. The result is that one of the most vibrant, meaningful, potent and richly dramatic eras in American history may finally find the cinematic foothold it has been denied for far too long. As Daniels told me when I asked how “The Butler” got made in spite of the obstacles: “You can’t stop the universe from doing what is meant to happen.”"

If I had a father, he’d look like Delbert Belton, the 88-year-old World War II veteran beaten to death in Spokane, Wash.

And yes, if I had a son, he’d look like the white teenager who police say drove the getaway car in the Oklahoma killing.

These are all true statements if we identify ourselves and each other only by the color of our skin, which increasingly seems to be the case. Even our president has done so.

Barack Obama helped lead the way when he identified himself with the parents of Trayvon Martin, shot by George Zimmerman in the neighborhood-watch catastrophe with which all are familiar. Stepping out from his usual duties of drawing meaningless red lines in the Syrian sand, the president splashed red paint across the American landscape:

1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Obama View Photos A collection of cartoons of the president. Caption A collection of cartoons of the president. Wait 1 second to continue.

“If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon.”

In so saying, he essentially gave permission for all to identify themselves by race with the victim or the accused. How sad, as we approach the 50th anniversary of the march Martin Luther King Jr. led on Washington, that even the president resorts to judging not by the content of one’s character but by the color of his skin — the antithesis of the great dream King articulated.

Obama went even further after the Zimmerman verdict, expressing his identification not as leader of a racially diverse nation — or as the son of a white mother — but as a black man who remembers women clutching their purses tighter when he entered an elevator and being followed in department stores. All because he was black?

Even today, I am followed when I go to the second floor of a boutique in Georgetown. Apparently, store policy requires that an attendant be upstairs when a shopper is. The way department store clerks follow me around, you’d think my face was plastered on a “Wanted for Shoplifting” poster. This is especially so if I’m dressed like a slob.

In my 20s, I conducted an experiment when I had the opposite problem. No clerk would help me. It occurred to me that my ratty jeans and T-shirt might be the problem, so I went home, changed into a dress, and returned. You’d have thought I was a honey bun in a beehive. Just for fun, I bought a $38,000 purse. (That’s a joke.)

Was the clerk prejudiced? You bet. But like it or not, the way we present ourselves to the world affects the way we are treated. Thus it has always been. I’m betting that few women today clutch their purses tighter when a well-groomed man, black or white, enters the elevator. A punk wearing his britches around his rump and telegraphing attitude? Even Jesse Jackson — or Eminem — might feel a tingle of discomfort.

Nothing is fair about profiling, but one’s treatment by a stranger is not always necessarily linked to one’s racial or ethnic history. Sometimes it’s just . . . you.

The killings leading the news the past several days have been horrific in their apparent randomness. Were they racially motivated? Had the perps been white and the victims black, would Obama have identified with them? More to immediate concerns, did the president’s identification with Trayvon Martin nourish the killing passions of these youths?

Hard to say with any certainty, though one of those charged in the Oklahoma shooting apparently tweeted some messages this summer that unmistakenly convey racial animus toward whites. They might be dismissed as Twitter nonsense — but for the dead body.

We do know this much for certain: Had the races been reversed, the usual suspects would have had much to say. White teens beat up an elderly black veteran and leave him for dead? White teens shoot a talented black athlete visiting from another country?

Riots.

I make these observations not to exacerbate a problem but in the hope that we can stop this craziness before things escalate. The conversation-about-race that pundits keep insisting we need to have should end where it began. Maybe in his remarks on the 50th anniversary of the greatest peaceful demonstration in history, Obama can remind Americans that if we had sons and fathers, they’d look like Christopher Lane and Delbert Belton as well as Trayvon Martin.

Victim in chief is no role for a president.

Blacks seem to have crossed that line.”

Justice Antonin Scalia appeared to express that view during the argument in February in the voting rights case, Shelby County v. Holder, No. 12-96. “Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements,” he said, “it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes.”

Gay men and lesbians have yet to achieve formal legal equality. They are not protected against job discrimination in much of the nation, may not marry their same-sex partners in most of it and do not have their marriages recognized by the federal government in any of it. The fact that they are asking for equal treatment may help their cause in the cases challenging the federal Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which for purposes of federal benefits defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman, and Proposition 8, the California voter initiative that banned same-sex marriage there.

But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. suggested in March that ordinary politics would sort things out. “As far as I can tell,” he told a lawyer challenging the federal marriage law in United States v. Windsor, No. 12-307, “political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your side of the case.”

In the three months since that argument, three more states have adopted same-sex marriage, raising the total to 12, along with the District of Columbia.

Kenji Yoshino, a law professor at New York University, said the two different conceptions of equal protection are animated by different concerns. One is skeptical of government classifications based on race and similar characteristics, whatever their goals. The other tries to make sure that historically disfavored groups are not subordinated."

McClurkin was scheduled to perform in the D.C.-government-sponsored concert with other singers at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial during the “Reflections on Peace: From Gandhi to King” event. But at the request of Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D), who fielded concerns from activists Friday, the Grammy-winning singer decided not to perform, according to the mayor’s office.

“The Arts and Humanities Commission and Donnie McClurkin’s management decided that it would be best for him to withdraw because the purpose of the event is to bring people together,” said Doxie McCoy, a spokeswoman for Gray. “Mayor Gray said the purpose of the event is to promote peace and harmony. That is what King was all about.”

McClurkin disputed that account, saying he was “asked not to attend” the concert. In a lengthy video statement posted online Saturday, McClurkin said Gray “uninvited me from a concert that I was supposed to headline.”

“There should be freedom of speech as long as it’s done in love,” McClurkin said in the video, adding that he believes it is unfortunate that in today’s world, “a black man, a black artist is uninvited from a civil rights movement depicting the love, the unity, the peace, the tolerance.”

In 2002, McClurkin wrote on a Christian Web site that he struggled with homosexuality after he was molested by male relatives when he was 8 and 13. “I’ve been through this and have experienced God’s power to change my lifestyle,” he wrote. “I am delivered and I know God can deliver others, too.”

Phil Pannell, a local gay rights activist and civil rights advocate, said he raised objections with the mayor’s office Friday because he thinks McClurkin’s comments on homosexuality have not been in the spirit of the “beloved community” about which King spoke.

“I take no joy that he is not performing,” Pannell said. “I really admire Donnie McClurkin’s artistry, but this is a situation where a political polemic obscured his artistry.”

But Nolan Williams, the concert’s director, said he would have preferred McClurkin to have performed.

“Even in Tiananmen Square, they were singing ‘We Shall Overcome.’ The fight for human rights is a global fight that has to bring us together,” Williams said. “That has to bring us together whenever there are differences of opinions or differences in views. We still need to find a place to come together even when we don’t agree.”

Saturday’s concert was among a series of events scheduled to take place in Washington through Aug. 28 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, at which King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

During the concert, India’s ambassador to the United States, Nirupama Rao, noted that Bayard Rustin, one of the organizers of the March on Washington, is to be posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. Rustin, who died in 1987, was gay and has been heralded by gay rights activists as a trailblazer for civil rights.

Referring to Rustin and King, Rao said: “All these great personalities came to India and saw the power of Mahatma Gandhi’s message and in turn inspired a young African American leader from the late ’40s of the 20th century to learn about Mahatma Gandhi and take and internalize that philosophy and that creed so that he could lead the African Americans in this country in their struggle for civil rights.”"

Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers—they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right.”

He also muses rather colorfully about his own sexual orientation: “It seems like, to me, a vagina—as a man—would be more desirable than a man’s anus. That’s just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not logical, my man. It’s just not logical.”

In a quote that may raise even more eyebrows than his feelings about gays, Robertson claims he “never” saw black people mistreated during the pre-civil rights era in his home state, and strongly suggests that African Americans were more content under Jim Crow.

“Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I’m with the blacks, because we’re white trash,” he said. “They’re singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, ‘I tell you what: These doggone white people’—not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.”

Robertson also shares an interesting rationale for voting for Mitt Romney over President Obama, saying he favored the candidate because he was from Salt Lake City, a safer city than Chicago. “Where would I rather be turned around at 3 o’clock in the morning?” he said. As Magary points out, Romney, though a Mormon, hails from Boston.

The Robertsons, particularly Phil, are outspoken about their Christian faith (each episode of “Duck Dynasty” ends with a prayer) and have also campaigned for Republicans, but their show, a hit in red and blue states alike, is largely nonpolitical and has so far carefully avoided issues such as race and gay rights.

The comments could prove to be a headache for A&E, which has a ratings winner in “Duck Dynasty.” The August season premiere of the technically unscripted (if carefully edited) series garnered 11.8 million viewers, setting a record for a nonfiction cable program, and it regularly beats out many shows on broadcast. Season 5 is set to bow Jan. 15.

“We welcome the government’s belated recognition that it must give notice to criminal defendants who it has monitored under the most sweeping surveillance law ever passed by Congress,” Mr. Toomey said. “By withholding notice, the government has avoided judicial review of its dragnet warrantless wiretapping program for five years.”

The Justice Department change traces back to June, when The Times reported that prosecutors in Fort Lauderdale and Chicago had told plaintiffs they did not need to say whether evidence in their cases derived from warrantless wiretapping, in conflict with what the Justice Department had told the Supreme Court.

After reading the article, Mr. Verrilli sought an explanation from the National Security Division, whose lawyers had vetted his briefs and helped him practice for his arguments, according to officials with knowledge of the internal deliberations. It was only then that he learned of the division’s practice of narrowly interpreting its need to notify defendants of evidence “derived from” warrantless wiretapping.

There ensued a wider debate throughout June and July, the officials said. National security prosecutors raised operational concerns: disclosing more to defendants could tip off a foreign target that his communications were being monitored, so intelligence officials might become reluctant to share crucial information that might create problems in a later trial.

Mr. Verrilli was said to have argued that there was no legal basis to conceal from defendants that the evidence derived from legally untested surveillance, preventing them from knowing they had an opportunity to challenge it. Ultimately, his view prevailed and the National Security Division changed its practice going forward, leading to the new filing on Friday in Mr. Muhtorov’s case.

Still, it remains unclear how many other cases — including closed matters in which convicts are already service prison sentences — involved evidence derived from warrantless wiretapping in which the National Security Division did not provide full notice to defendants, nor whether the department will belatedly notify them. Such a notice could lead to efforts to reopen those cases."
http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/los-angeles-mayor-campaign-lapd-manhunt-dorner-investigation.html,,[],Dorner manhunt: Mayoral candidates want probe of ex-cop's claims about LAPD,"Candidates for mayor of Los Angeles called Saturday for an investigation of allegations of LAPD racism that were made by a fugitive former police officer who is suspected of killing three people this week.

Several said an investigation of the full circumstances surrounding the Police Department’s handling of fugitive Christopher Jordan Dorner was warranted. They spoke in response to a question on the matter at a candidates forum at Crenshaw High School.

The department announced Saturday evening that it would reopen its investigation into its firing of Dorner, which apparently prompted his vengeful rampage.

“Any allegations of racism and discrimination ought to be investigated within the LAPD, no matter where they come from,” candidate Kevin James, an entertainment lawyer, told an audience that filled the school library. James, the first to field the question, said nothing about the vast regional manhunt underway to capture Dorner.

“If you’ve got someone that will step up, and talk about the problems, talk about the inequality, talk about the discrimination, admit it, like people in public office are so afraid to do, then you can change it,” James said.

City Councilman Eric Garcetti said trouble with racism among officers had diminished in recent years. “That doesn’t mean that it’s a perfect department or that things can’t get worse,” he said. He promised to ensure “an internal investigation on this,” but did not define its scope. As for Dorner’s alleged killings, Garcetti concluded, “We have to make sure that justice is served there too.”

City Councilwoman Jan Perry urged the crowd not to lose focus on the risk that Dorner poses “to all of us, regardless of our race or ethnicity.”

“Yes, there should be a review and a public analysis of what happened in this particular case,” said Perry, the only African American candidate on stage at the forum. “Because it may be what you call a teachable moment about changing your protocols in dealing with individuals who may have manifestations of stress…or mental health issues that were never properly or adequately addressed. And then they pop out 10 or 15 years later in a manner like this.”

A fourth candidate, Emanuel Pleitez, a former technology company executive, recalled growing up on the Eastside, saying police had stopped him and his friends for no reason when he was growing up. “I know a lot of people that grew up with a deep hatred for LAPD,” he said.

“It’s a serious thing in our communities, and that needs to be addressed. Now yes, LAPD has taken strides in the right direction, but absolutely, there’s more to be done.”

One of the top candidates, City Controller Wendy Greuel, did not attend the forum. A spokeswoman said Greuel had a previous engagement, but supported the LAPD's reopening of the Dorner disciplinary case.

A report filed Friday by the Los Angeles Police Protective League showed the union has spent $305,000 on independent TV advertising for Greuel. As a result of spending by the police union and other big-money donors waging an independent campaign on Greuel’s behalf, the city Ethics Commission announced Saturday that it was lifting the $2.8-million spending cap that previously applied to mayoral candidates who accept city matching funds.

Removal of the cap was required by law once total independent spending for a mayoral candidate in the public matching program exceeded $309,000. For now, the only candidates in next month's primary with more than $2.8 million to spend are Garcetti, who has collected $3.7 million, and Greuel, who has raised $3.6 million.

Surveillance,"WASHINGTON — The movement to crack down on government surveillance started with an odd couple from Michigan, Representatives Justin Amash, a young libertarian Republican known even to his friends as “chief wing nut,” and John Conyers Jr., an elder of the liberal left in his 25th House term.

But what began on the political fringes only a week ago has built a momentum that even critics say may be unstoppable, drawing support from Republican and Democratic leaders, attracting moderates in both parties and pulling in some of the most respected voices on national security in the House.

The rapidly shifting politics were reflected clearly in the House on Wednesday, when a plan to defund the National Security Agency’s telephone data collection program fell just seven votes short of passage. Now, after initially signaling that they were comfortable with the scope of the N.S.A.’s collection of Americans’ phone and Internet activities, but not their content, revealed last month by Edward J. Snowden, lawmakers are showing an increasing willingness to use legislation to curb those actions.

Representatives Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, and Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, have begun work on legislation in the House Judiciary Committee to significantly rein in N.S.A. telephone surveillance. Mr. Sensenbrenner said on Friday that he would have a bill ready when Congress returned from its August recess that would restrict phone surveillance to only those named as targets of a federal terrorism investigation, make significant changes to the secret court that oversees such programs and give businesses like Microsoft and Google permission to reveal their dealings before that court."

Attorney General Eric Holder deplored aspects of the criminal-justice system Monday.

In a speech delivered Monday to the American Bar Association meeting at its annual convention in San Francisco, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called for a major change in the nation's criminal justice system that includes a bit of what prison and drug-war critics have been seeking for decades.

Holder noted that with the drug war entering its fifth decade, ""we need to ask whether it, and the approaches that comprise it, have been truly effective—and build on the Administration’s efforts, led by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, to usher in a new approach."" In truth, the asking has been done. And the answer is clear. The approaches have been stunningly effective if societal destruction is what one has in mind. For all the good ideas in Holder's speech, however, it was what was missing that ought to get some attention.

For instance, nowhere in Holder's speech, which included data about the damage caused to society by the war on drugs, did he directly mention the impact of law enforcement actions related to marijuana. Despite the evidence of marijuana's medicinal benefits and its generally benign effects (particularly when compared with tobacco and alcohol), the administration apparently plans, even with the reforms that Holder announced, to continue spending gargantuan annual sums to prosecute marijuana cases. This encourages state and local jurisdictions to do the same, a policy—an idiotic, counterproductive, destructive and expensive policy—that many supporters of President Obama expected to be changed years ago.

Holder made clear that changes he is proposing will not have an immediate impact and that this is ""only the beginning"":

As a nation, we are coldly efficient in our incarceration efforts. While the entire U.S. population has increased by about a third since 1980, the federal prison population has grown at an astonishing rate—by almost 800 percent. It’s still growing—despite the fact that federal prisons are operating at nearly 40 percent above capacity. Even though this country comprises just 5 percent of the world’s population, we incarcerate almost a quarter of the world’s prisoners. More than 219,000 federal inmates are currently behind bars. Almost half of them are serving time for drug-related crimes, and many have substance use disorders. Nine to 10 million more people cycle through America’s local jails each year. And roughly 40 percent of former federal prisoners—and more than 60 percent of former state prisoners—are rearrested or have their supervision revoked within three years after their release, at great cost to American taxpayers and often for technical or minor violations of the terms of their release. As a society, we pay much too high a price whenever our system fails to deliver outcomes that deter and punish crime, keep us safe, and ensure that those who have paid their debts have the chance to become productive citizens. Right now, unwarranted disparities are far too common. As President Obama said last month, it’s time to ask tough questions about how we can strengthen our communities, support young people, and address the fact that young black and Latino men are disproportionately likely to become involved in our criminal justice system—as victims as well as perpetrators. We also must confront the reality that—once they’re in that system—people of color often face harsher punishments than their peers. One deeply troubling report, released in February, indicates that—in recent years—black male offenders have received sentences nearly 20 percent longer than those imposed on white males convicted of similar crimes. This isn’t just unacceptable—it is shameful. It’s unworthy of our great country, and our great legal tradition. And in response, I have today directed a group of U.S. Attorneys to examine sentencing disparities, and to develop recommendations on how we can address them.

New policies that walk all that back about 50 paces would be welcome indeed. And there is no gainsaying the fact that doing so will not be easy.

Among the proposed changes:

• Altering the DoJ's charging policies of low-level, nonviolent drug offenders who are part of gangs or cartels so that they do not face ""draconian mandatory minimum sentences."" Sentences will be determined by individual conduct.

• Supporting bipartisan legislation introduced by Sen. Pat Leahy, Dick Durbin, Patrick Leahy, Mike Lee and Rand Paul that would end the imposition of mandatory minimums on some drug offenders.

• Increasing support for crime victims.

• Setting up a new task force to ""respond to the extreme levels of violence faced by far too many American Indian and Alaska Native children.""

Sign our petition urging Congress to abolish mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders. There has never been a better time to take action on this."

Jack Ohman's cartoon of April 25 made a strong statement about Gov. Rick Perry's disregard for worker safety, and his attempts to market Texas as a place where industries can thrive with few regulations. It is unfortunate that Gov. Perry, and some on the blogosphere, have attempted to interpret the cartoon as being disrespectful of the victims of this tragedy. As Ohman has made clear on his blog, he has complete empathy for the victims and people living by the plant. What he finds offensive is a governor who would gamble with the lives of families by not pushing for the strongest safety regulations. Perry's letter is an attempt to distract people from that message.

California has seen Perry's touting of his state's pro-business prowess firsthand. In February, a public-private Texas marketing firm ran radio ads featuring Perry denigrating California's taxes and regulation, and then Perry traveled there to recruit jobs. He made a similar trip , this time backed by a print-media ad buy , to Chicago this past week.

The AP story by Weissert has additional details which adds some perspective on Perry's 'outrage'.

Notably absent from Perry's display of outrage is any sense of shame for the consequences of the policies Perry has actively promoted as governor, or his own responsibility as head of the state government that failed so badly to protect its citizens. Republicans bill themselves as a party that strongly supports the idea of personal responsibility - yet they take none when their ideological pigeons come home to roost.

To be sure, there are damn few politicians who want to be labeled ""anti-business"" these days - but Perry and his ilk have gone so far to the opposite extreme, the cartoon is if anything understated in its criticism. The ideology of money is producing devastation on a global scale that conventional terrorists can only envy. Corporate whores like Perry are killing us, piecemeal as in West, Texas and on a planetary scale as well.

The video below shows how we are systematically being put at risk in service to the pro-business ideology, an ideology which is proving to be the greatest challenge of the 21st century. If we don't manage to rein it in, it may well be Game Over for America and the rest of the planet.

The suggestions seemed obvious to most but signaled a new tone for the Republican Party.

“Don’t use the term’anchor baby’ or phrases like ‘send them all back,’” said the memo from a Republican-aligned advocacy group, the Hispanic Leadership Network. “Do acknowledge that ‘our current immigration system is broken and we need to fix it.’”

Changing the way the party talks about immigration is about all House Republicans have to show for their efforts over the last 11 months — and even that effort has notable exceptions.

Though Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio has insisted recently that immigration reform is not dead, the House is about to finish the year without progress on a topic that is a priority to Latino voters, an electorate the GOP desperately needs to woo before the next presidential race.

PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political moments

In fact, the House’s most visible immigration-related action was a measure to defund an Obama administration program to defer deportations of young immigrants, a vote that increased Latino animosity even though it failed to become law.

The legislative sputter stems from Republicans’ focus on the 2014 midterm election. As lawmakers burnish their conservative credentials for potential hard-right primary challenges, they are betting they will have time to court Latinos before the 2016 election.

But the inaction raises questions about whether Republicans have learned from their electoral losses last year and can broaden the party’s base to appeal to more minorities. And it’s not only immigration reform. GOP promises to be more inclusive to women and gays also have produced few results.

“It’s foolhardy,” said Alex Nowrasteh, a policy analyst at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. “On the one hand, Republicans have improved their rhetoric and they’ve moved much more toward embracing immigration reform. On the other hand, immigration reform was passed in the Senate and was dropped in the House of Representatives, and that makes them look like they’re opposed to reform, which in a way, they are.”

In last year’s presidential election, Mitt Romney — whose comment about “self-deportation” infuriated immigration advocates — lost the Latino vote by a 44-percentage-point margin, the largest deficit of any Republican presidential candidate since the Clinton era. Alarmed GOP insiders jump-started congressional talks toward a bipartisan immigration overhaul, and Boehner announced the time had come for Congress to act.

But the speaker has refused to take up the Senate’s sweeping bipartisan overhaul of immigration laws, even though it would probably pass the House with Democratic support; nor are House Republicans expected to vote on their own measures any time soon.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

Divisions within the House GOP have left the party at a standstill. More Republican lawmakers than ever — nearly two dozen, by some counts — support the cornerstone of an immigration overhaul, which is a path to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally.

But many more oppose legalization efforts. Most House Republicans represent conservative districts, configured to include few minority voters. The handful of exceptions, including several from California, have already come under pressure in their districts, but most have little interest in the subject.

“There’s just no cohesion there yet,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has tried to persuade Republicans to take action. “All I hope is that they realize that the issue is not going away — that we need to act on it — that we’d be glad to consider any proposals or ideas they have.”

Hedging the political risks, House GOP leaders continue working behind the scenes with lawmakers to draft a series of bills that could be brought forward next year.

Together, they would resemble the main ingredients of the comprehensive Senate bill.

One, from Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, would provide a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as minors. Another would allow adult immigrants to apply for legal status as border security is ramped up.

President Obama has extended a hand to Boehner several times by saying he would be open to the House GOP’s piecemeal approach rather than the Senate’s big package.

“It’s Thanksgiving; we can carve that bird into multiple pieces,” Obama said during a speech in San Francisco on Monday. “A drumstick here, breast meat there. But as long as all the pieces get done — soon — and we actually deliver on the core values we’ve been talking about for so long, I think everybody is fine with it.”

PHOTOS: The debate over immigration reform

House Republicans, though, have resisted most White House initiatives. Many Republicans prefer to use the months ahead investigating what went wrong with the healthcare law. And some House members seem to have missed the memo on new talking points.

In March, after the memo was distributed on Capitol Hill, one of the House’s longest-serving Republican members, Don Young of Alaska, used a racial slur to describe the migrants who once worked on his family’s California farm.

Advertisement

Rep. Steve King of Iowa, who sponsored the legislation to allow deportation of young immigrants to resume, said some of them had “calves the size of cantaloupes” from hauling drugs across the border.

Longtime immigration advocate Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, warned that Republicans would face another election defeat if they failed to translate their new talking points into legislative action.

“Boehner, if he kills off immigration reform, will be remembered as the speaker who killed the GOP,” Sharry said.

John Fleming (R-LA) passed an amendment in the House Armed Services Committee protecting religious speech of service members in the military. President Barack Obama has now threatened to veto the bill if it passes the full House and Senate.

The White House released a Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) on H.R. 1960, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2014. Among other items, the SAP includes as an objection to the bill:

Expansion and Implementation of Protection of Rights of Conscience of Members of the Armed Forces and Chaplains of Such Members: The Administration strongly objects to section 530, which would require the Armed Forces to accommodate, except in cases of military necessity, “actions and speech” reflecting the “conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs of the member.” By limiting the discretion of commanders to address potentially problematic speech and actions within their units, this provision would have a significant adverse effect on good order, discipline, morale, and mission accomplishment.

The SAP includes a veto threat: “…if the bill is presented to the President for approval in its current form, the President’s senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill.”

In other words, Obama says he will veto any bill that forbids his appointees or officers from telling a soldier that he cannot mention Jesus during prayer or have a Bible on his desk, or that keeps those appointees from telling a chaplain (who is an ordained clergyman) what religious teachings he is allowed to give in worship services, or what spiritual counseling he can give to another soldier.

Ambassador Ken Blackwell, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, tells Breitbart News:

President Obama is waging a war on religion. He and Chuck Hagel are denying the most basic rights to those who put their lives on the line to protect all of our rights. It is shameful and appalling. I am confident that congressional leadership will show courage to stand up for our troops against this radical assault on religious liberty in the military.

This is the most compelling expression yet of the aggressive approach of the Obama-Hagel Defense Department to soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who are observant Christians or devout members of other peaceful faiths, as seen in Breitbart News’ previous reports regarding the unconstitutional infringements of one of America’s most treasured, fundamental rights.

All eyes are on House and Senate leadership to see if they stand firm on the bill for those in the military who are facing this new form of pressure.

In an interview%2C Oprah Winfrey seemed to chalk up much of the opposition to the president to racism

Oprah is still living in that other time when people separated themselves from one another by race.



Yet%2C our first black president is actually accorded more respect than some past presidents have received.

Shortly before receiving the medal of freedom from President Obama, Oprah Winfrey gave an interview to the BBC in which she seemed to chalk up much of the opposition to the president to racism: ""I think there's a level of disrespect for the office that occurs ... because he's African American,"" she said.

Her claim reminded me of the times when, as a child of the '70s, my father would ask an odd question about my friends, ""What is he?""

""Huh?"" I'd ask.

""You know, what is he — Italian? German? Lebanese? What is he?"" my father replied.

Colorblind eyes

I had no idea what my friends' ethnic origins were. It was only when I traveled with my father to the north side of Chicago where he grew up, and he pointed out which ethnic groups had lived in various parts of town, that I understood.

To be sure, I was well aware of racism. I had read Black Like Me as a third-grader. But the idea of discriminating on the basis of race simply made no sense to my young mind.

Oprah's pronouncement produced another ""huh?"" moment for me, considering the fact that it was millions of Americans that gave their colorblind eyes to her show for a quarter-century, famous enough to be interviewed by the BBC.

As communism wound down in the Soviet Union, President Reagan was asked whether he still considered it an evil empire. ""You are talking about another time, another era,"" he replied.

Oprah is still living in that other time and era in which people separated themselves from one another primarily on the basis of race — a real time to be sure — but one that is, for the most part, not our reality today. That's especially so at the highest levels of politics and entertainment.

Tea Party racism

Because it is more often than not Tea Party types who are accused of racial hostility toward Obama, I have a parlor game I play with my white conservative friends that tells me everything I need to know about the state of race relations in America.

""If your daughter were thinking of marrying a man like Clarence Thomas or one like Chris Matthews, which would you choose?"" I ask.

The answer is quick and unanimous: They'd choose to spend their holidays with a son-in-law who looks nothing like them but shares their values rather than one who merely shares their skin color.

Oprah might want us to believe Obama faces extraordinary opposition that can largely be explained by his race, but she conveniently forgets that in the past 100 years, six presidents were shot at, one killed, another impeached and two driven from office. All were loathed by millions. Some more than others.

Our first black president is actually accorded more respect than some past presidents have received. At the height of his health care reform failure, Obama has the lowest popularity of his presidency, yet the past eight (white) presidents in a row were all less popular at their own low points.

The success of the civil rights movement and the widespread acceptance of interracial marriage has fundamentally changed America's racial equation.

Some day soon, when we all look like actor and TV host Mario Lopez, it will simply be impossible to find people of a different skin color, let alone hate on the basis of it.

The law is so broad, the judge said, that it could criminalize preschool students parading on their first field trip to the high court.

Harold Hodge Jr. was arrested on the Supreme Court plaza in January 2011 while wearing a sign that criticized police treatment of blacks and Hispanics.

He claimed the law violates the constitution, and U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell agreed. She ruled Tuesday that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment's free speech protections.

The Rutherford Institute, a civil liberties organization which challenged the law on Hodge's behalf, said that ruling ""throws a lifeline to the First Amendment at a time when government officials are doing their best to censor, silence and restrict free speech activities.""

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington said the office was reviewing the decision.

If the Obama administration appeals, the case could reach the Supreme Court, historically the guardian of free speech rights. That could create the ultimate not-in-my-backyard case, except it would be more about the court's front yard.

In 2011, Hodge was on the Supreme Court plaza wearing a sign that said, ""The U.S. Gov. Allows Police To Illegally Murder and Brutalize African Americans And Hispanic People.""

After Hodge refused a Supreme Court police officer's order to leave the plaza, he was arrested and given a citation for violating the law.

That law makes it a crime to ""parade, stand, or move in processions or assemblages,"" or to display a ""flag, banner, or device designed or adapted to bring into public notice a party, organization, or movement,"" at the high court's building or grounds.

The charge eventually was dropped in a deal with prosecutors in which Hodge agreed to stay away from the Supreme Court grounds for six months. But after that period was up, Hodge decided he wanted to come back, and this time he was backed by lawyers.

Story continues

Last year, Hodge sued and said he planned to return to the plaza and picket, hand out leaflets, sing, chant and make speeches.

In a 67-page opinion, Howell, an appointee of President Barack Obama, said that the law's prohibitions on signs and processions were both overly broad. She wrote that the government ""essentially conceded"" during oral arguments that the ban on signs would prohibit a group of tourists assembling on the Supreme Court plaza, all wearing T-shirts to bring public notice to their organization — be it a church, school or other group.

The ban on processions, the judge wrote, ""could apply to, and provide criminal penalties for, any group parading or assembling for any conceivable purpose, even, for example, the familiar line of preschool students from federal agency daycare centers, holding hands with chaperones, parading on the plaza on their first field trip to the Supreme Court.""

The government argued that the law was a ""reasonable limitation on speech,"" because it furthered two significant interests: permitting unimpeded access of visitors to the Supreme Court, and preserving the appearance of the court as a body not swayed by external influence.

Howell wasn't buying it.

She said that first interest wasn't significant enough to justify the ban. As for the second, ""It is hard to imagine how tourists assembling on the plaza wearing T-shirts bearing their school's seal, for example, could possibly create the appearance of a judicial system vulnerable to outside pressure.""

Should the Supreme Court decide the case, it won't be the first time the justices have ruled on a challenge like this.

Howell went into detail on the history of the no-protests law, which was passed in 1949 and patterned after a law that applied to the U.S. Capitol grounds.

The Capitol grounds law was challenged by a coalition of women against the Vietnam War, and in 1972, a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia declared it unconstitutional. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision.

In 1981, the federal appeals court in Washington threw out the ""nearly identical"" law applying to the Supreme Court, saying it was ""repugnant to the First Amendment of the Constitution. ... We believe that it would be tragic if the grounds of the Supreme Court, unquestionably the greatest protector of First Amendment rights, stood as an island of silence in which those rights could never be exercised in any form.""

But the Supreme Court took a narrower view. The justices agreed that the law was unconstitutional as it applied to sidewalks surrounding the court, but they did not decide on the constitutionality of the law as a whole. Now, the current practice is that protesters have to stay on the sidewalk, but can't be on the marble plaza at the foot of the court's front steps.

In an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice Thurgood Marshall said the Supreme Court should have gone further. The late justice said he ""would not leave visitors to this court subject to the continuing threat of imprisonment if they dare to exercise their First Amendment rights once inside the sidewalk.""

Leon of Federal District Court for the District of Columbia said the N.S.A.'s mass collection of data was probably unconstitutional. President Obama appointed an advisory committee of outside experts to review the agency’s operations; it issued a report last week that recommended curbing the agency’s data collection.

Britain’s security services, which work closely with their American counterparts, have also been deeply embarrassed by the revelations, and one of Mr. Snowden’s more striking comments in the broadcast refers to “1984,” Orwell’s celebrated novel about a state controlled by an omnipresent Big Brother.

“Great Britain’s George Orwell warned us of the danger of this kind of information,” Mr. Snowden said. “The types of collection in the book — microphones and video cameras, TVs that watch us — are nothing compared to what we have available today. We have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go.”

But he also argued that his actions had set off a debate that could help restore faith in those who regulate electronic communications. “The conversation occurring today will determine the amount of trust we can place both in the technology that surrounds us and the government that regulates it,” Mr. Snowden said. “Together, we can find a better balance, end mass surveillance and remind the government that if it really wants to know how we feel, asking is always cheaper than spying.”

Mr. Snowden has spoken out publicly before, and his latest comments are in line with others he made this week. In a lengthy interview with The Washington Post, he said he had achieved what he set out to do. “For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission’s already accomplished,” he said. “I already won. As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated. Because, remember, I didn’t want to change society. I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself.”"

(CNN) - Some social conservatives are blasting Utah's ruling striking down part of that state's law banning polygamy.

The suit was brought by the stars of the television reality series ""Sister Wives,"" and a federal judge's ruling Friday throws out the law's section prohibiting ""cohabitation,"" saying it violates constitutional guarantees of due process and religious freedom.





Judge strikes down part of Utah polygamy law in 'Sister Wives' case

Former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum - who a decade ago came under fire for comments indicating polygamy would become legal if courts banned anti-sodomy laws - responded to the ruling over the weekend.

""Sometimes I hate it when what I predict comes true,"" the former U.S. senator tweeted Sunday.

Some times I hate it when what I predict comes true. http://t.co/JmIPiiJiyn — Rick Santorum (@RickSantorum) December 15, 2013

The Family Research Council, led by prominent social conservative Tony Perkins, also weighed the Utah statute, warning of ""serious consequences of redefining marriage.""

""Throughout history, marriage has been future-oriented, focused on the next generation and the best interests of children. The reality is that society needs children, and children need a mom and a dad,"" Perkins said Monday.

""However, redefining marriage to fulfill the desires of same-sex couples or polygamists only moves society away from this vital public interest and creates social chaos.""

In striking down the section of the law Friday, Judge Clark Waddoups used a 2003 Supreme Court landmark gay rights case Lawrence v. Texas, which ruled that anti sodomy laws were unconstitutional.

During that Supreme Court ruling a decade ago, Santorum told the Associated Press that bans on sodomy would open the doors to a ""right to polygamy"" and other sexual acts.

""If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual (gay) sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything,"" Santorum said in 2003.

But Waddoups' ruling keeps in place the ban on bigamy ""in the literal sense - the fraudulent or otherwise impermissible possession of two purportedly valid marriage licenses for the purpose of entering into more than one purportedly legal marriage.""

Some religious groups also criticized the ruling.

""This is what happens when marriage becomes about the emotional and sexual wants of adults, divorced from the needs of children for a mother and a father committed to each other for life,"" said Russell Moore, of the Southern Baptist Convention.

""Polygamy was outlawed in this country because it was demonstrated, again and again, to hurt women and children. Sadly, when marriage is elastic enough to mean anything, in due time it comes to mean nothing.""

(AP) — Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said emphatically Saturday that the Boy Scouts of America should not soften its strict policy barring gay members, and dismissed the idea of bending the organization to the whims of “popular culture.”

Mr. Perry, the country’s longest-serving governor, is an Eagle Scout, and in 2008 he wrote the book “On My Honor: Why the American Values of the Boy Scouts Are Worth Fighting For.” It detailed his deep love for the organization and explained why it should continue to embrace traditional conservative values — including excluding openly gay members and leaders.

The governor spoke at the Texas Scouts’ 64th annual Report to State, where hundreds of scouts from across the state filled the State House of Representatives to announce their delegations’ recent accomplishments. Mr. Perry had addressed the gathering several times before, most recently in 2010.

The Scouts’ national leadership announced last week that it was considering ending the mandatory exclusion of gay members. The group could allow different religious and civic groups that sponsor Scout units to decide for themselves whether to maintain the exclusion or open up their membership."
http://news.yahoo.com/senate-showdown-over-military-sexual-assault-bill-095237937--politics.html,,[],Senate showdown over military sexual assault bill,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has secured public support from nearly half the Senate, but not enough votes, for her proposal to give victims of rape and sexual assault in the military an independent route outside the chain of command for prosecuting attackers.

Gillibrand's solution for a problem the military calls an epidemic appears to have stalled in the face of united opposition from the Pentagon's top echelon and its allies in Congress, including two female senators who are former prosecutors.

Opponents of the proposal by Gillibrand, D-N.Y., insist that commanders, not an outside military lawyer, must be accountable for meting out justice.

Even so, major changes are coming for a decades-old military system just a few months after several high-profile cases infuriated Republicans and Democrats in a rapid chain of events by Washington standards.

""Sexual assault in the military is not new, but it has been allowed to fester,"" Gillibrand said in a recent Senate speech.

The Senate this week is set to consider an annual defense policy bill that would strip commanders of their ability to overturn jury convictions, require dishonorable discharge or dismissal for any individual convicted of sexual assault and establish a civilian review when a decision is made not to prosecute a case.

The bill would provide a special counsel for victims and eliminate the statute of limitations.

Those changes in military law are backed by members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. But overshadowing the revisions is the testy, intense fight over Gillibrand's proposal to strip commanders of their authority to prosecute cases of sexual assault. She wants to hand responsibility to seasoned military lawyers outside the chain of command.

Her solution has divided the Senate, splitting Republicans and Democrats, men and women, even former attorneys general, into unusual coalitions. The lobbying has been fierce, with dueling data, testimonials and news conferences with victims. Opponents invited Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Loretta Reynolds to the closed-door Republican caucus last week.

Story continues

Among Gillibrand's 47 announced supporters are conservative Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., along with 16 of the Senate's 20 women.

Standing against the plan is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.; the panel's military veterans John McCain, R-Ariz., and Jack Reed, D-R.I., and three of the committee's women — Sens. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., both former prosecutors, and Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.

Gillibrand says she privately has received backing from more than 50 senators, but support remains short of the filibuster-proof 60 votes that likely will be needed for her amendment to the defense bill. To secure more votes, she said last week she was considering scaling back her plan to focus solely on sexual assault and rape instead of all serious crimes. That prompted complaints from her original backers that it would create ""pink courts,"" and Gillibrand said on ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday she was reverting to her initial bill.

Either way, it hasn't diminished the opposition.

""There (are) now enough members of the Senate that begin to grasp that letting commanders walk away from this is a big mistake; holding their feet to the fire is what we need to be doing,"" said McCaskill. She said in an interview that, unlike Gillibrand, she wasn't changing ""the policy to get votes.""

McCaskill said the Pentagon already has moved unilaterally, reflected in the recent word from the Defense Department that reports of sexual assaults in the military increased by an unprecedented 46 percent during the last budget year. There were 3,553 sexual assault complaints from October 2012 through June, compared with 2,434 reports during the same period the previous year.

Defense Department officials cast the sharp increase as a sign that people are more confident about coming forward now that improvements are being made in handling assaults.

Gillibrand offers a different figure — 26,000.

That was the Pentagon's estimate of the number of military members who may have been sexually assaulted last year, based on an anonymous survey of military personnel. Thousands of victims were unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs aimed at curbing the crimes, according to the Pentagon report earlier this year.

""They didn't trust the chain of command. They didn't think anything would be done in their cases,"" Gillibrand said in an interview. ""The second reason they didn't report was because they feared or had witnessed retaliation. ... The command climate failed those victims.""

Pushing back against Gillibrand's proposal, Gen. Ray Odierno, chief of staff of the Army, said last week that adopting her plan would be a ""big mistake"" and that it would cost an estimated $113 million a year, including salaries for about 600 attorneys and support staff.

That financial assessment doesn't take into account the expense of training members of the military, medical and mental health benefits for victims, loss of productivity and possible separation from service for a Pentagon with a fiscal year budget of more than $500 billion.

""It would seem absurd for the military to say we can't possibly prevent sexual assault, rape, because we don't have lawyers to try the cases,"" Gillibrand said.

Bolstering their case, McCaskill, Ayotte and Fisher compiled additional changes that the Senate is expected to approve. They include barring defendants from using the good military character defense, allowing sexual assault victims to challenge a discharge or separation from the service, and extending the new protections to the military service academies.

""The reason this issue is so hard is because on one side is a very simple narrative, this is victim versus commanders and you should be for the victims,"" McCaskill said.

""On the other side, it's much more complex, and I'm guided by practical experience handling these cases and a pretty intimate knowledge of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and how it actually works ... and making sure we have a system that's constitutional, that works and that holds commanders accountable."""

Nebraska law requires that girls 17 or younger must have written, notarized consent from a parent or guardian in order to have an abortion. In this case, the teenager, identified only as ""Anonymous 5,"" is in foster care, but did not want to involve her foster parents out of fear that they would be so angry about her pregnancy that she could lose her placement at their home, according court documents.

A girl can bypass the consent provision in certain cases. Minors do not need parental permission in cases of medical emergencies, if they are victims of abuse, or if they can prove they are mature and well-informed enough to make the decision alone.

When she initially went before Judge Peter Bataillon in July, he ruled that she did not provide evidence she was a victim of abuse, and also ""failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that she is sufficiently mature and well informed.""

However, as Slate points out, Anonymous 5 showed some pretty mature reasoning at her appeal last week.

According to court documents, she testified that she could not ""be the right mom that [she] would like to be right now"" and could not support a child financially. She also feared her foster parents would likely take out their anger not only on her, but on her child.

Finally, she pointed out that putting the baby up for adoption ""would be worse"" for her and her two siblings because of the resentment her foster parents would have towards her. The siblings, ages 7 and 9, are under the care of the same couple.

The girl's attorney, Catherine Mahern, declined to tell Omaha.com whether or not the girl, who was 10 weeks pregnant at her first hearing in July, is still pregnant. Mahern did note that there are other ways to circumvent the parental consent law, including traveling to another state.

Nebraska is one of eight states that require notarized consent for a minor to obtain an abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Thirty-nine states require at least some level of parental involvement."

House passes restrictive abortion bill,"Story highlights The bill now heads to the state Senate for approval It includes a requirement for doctors to be present at an abortion It also prohibits government-administered insurance plans to pay for abortions Critics say the bill would make it hard for abortion clinics to stay in business

(CNN) —

North Carolina’s House of Representatives passed a restrictive abortion bill Thursday with a 74-41 vote. The bill now heads to the state Senate for approval.

The bill would place requirements on clinics that family planning advocates say would make it hard for them to stay in business. Among the requirements is the presence of a doctor when an abortion is being performed.

The bill allows North Carolina’s health department to make temporary new rules for the state’s 31 abortion clinics as it sees fit.

It also prohibits government-administered insurance plans, such as those under the Affordable Care Act, to pay for abortions – though it makes exceptions when a pregnancy endangers a woman’s life.

House committee members refashioned a bill on motorcycle safety into one principally about abortion after the state’s governor threatened on Wednesday to veto the abortion measures. That led the bill to be dubbed the “Motorcycle Abortion Bill.”

When legislators attached the abortion measures to the motorcycle safety bill, they placed them at the top of the bill and renamed it “Health and Safety Law Changes.” motorcycle safety measures dropped to the bottom of the bill.

Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, vowed to veto the abortion legislation the first time it came up.

In his campaign, he had promised not to restrict abortion in North Carolina, and abortion-rights advocates lobbied to hold him to his word.

McCrory warned in a statement that the legislation was unacceptable without significant changes, but he noted in his objections “that major portions of the bill are of sound (principle) and value.”

The language of the bill was reworded somewhat the second time around. It now says the health department should make rules without “unduly restricting access.”

McCrory could still veto, though there are enough conservative votes in the House and Senate to override it.

A similar but stricter law passed in Mississippi is coming close to shutting down that state’s last abortion clinic. Another such law passed in Alabama earlier this year.

These new state laws represent a broader, nationwide assault on a woman’s right to choose, said Staci Fox, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman.

“Bills like these have been introduced in 42 states. This is a whole new level of attack on women’s health.”

Some of the states that have already passed new laws did so in anticipation of legal challenges and have shored up war chests to fund the battles, she said.

They are prepared to go to court, even to challenge the landmark Supreme Court abortion ruling Roe v. Wade that provides the basic legal framework for abortion in the United States.

Abortion opponents confirm the judicial strategy behind the laws.

Americans United for Life states: “Using our model legislation and our hard-won expertise with abortion clinic regulations, we also intend to provoke future, strategic ‘test cases’ – federal and state legal challenges to carefully crafted and selected state laws – that will serve as vehicles to severely undermine Roe v. Wade and, ultimately, eradicate it from American law.”

She said the “arrogant” church of government does not have “faith in your ability to govern yourself,” so “you should not have faith in it” because “it does not have faith in us.”

Speaking at an Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition dinner, Palin said “enough is enough” of the “politically-correct police out there” and blasted the scrooges waging a “War on Christmas.”

Palin said Americans needed to take action to resist the “fundamental transformation” of society that many Americans “never signed up for.” Echoing themes from her book, Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas, which comes out on Tuesday, Palin said that “religious freedom is under attack,” and religion is “pushed out of the public square” and “censored.” Palin said one will see the censorship and double standards “blatantly come this holiday season.”

She said that the war on Christmas sounds like an oxymoron but it is real, “a symptom of a bigger issue,” and “just the tip of the spear in a larger battle.”

Palin then noted that the “scrooges who are too enlightened for religion” have a very “zealot-like faith in the church of big government.”

“What’s that done for you lately?” Palin asked.

She said the “church of big government” is run by the supposed “best and the brightest,” and she slammed the recent National Security Agency spying scandals, the barricading of the World War II Monument during the partial government shutdown, and the recent failures of Obamacare, which she said was the church of big government’s “crowning achievement” to date.

She blasted the “best and the brightest” in the Obama administration for believing “hicks in flyover country” or “hockey moms in Alaska” do not know what health insurance plans are best for their families or cannot run their own lives without government interference.

Palin also said the “lapdog media” allow the “best and the brightest” in the church of big government to “get away” with lies and bad policies, which has caused “irreparable damage” to the country.

She said under the “church of big government,” there have been “shuttered businesses and cities” and “poverty has gone up,” while a “record number of Americans are giving up and no longer bothering to look for work.”

“Where has that gotten you?” Palin asked.

She then blasted “immoral and unscrupulous” leaders who “ignore the Constitution in favor of their fundamental transformation agenda” while “enriching themselves and their cronies while their nation goes bankrupt… that’s dictatorship.”"

(CNN) —

When asked over the years if he can use executive power to stop deporting illegal immigrants, President Barack Obama has responded: Yes, we can! Other times, the answer was: No we can’t!

This week, at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center in San Francisco, Obama was heckled by an audience member who was later identified as Ju Hong, an undocumented student from South Korea who graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a degree in political science. When Hong pleaded with Obama to put the brakes on deportations and stop separating families, Obama responded:

“Now, what you need to know, when I’m speaking as President of the United States and I come to this community, is that if, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But we’re also a nation of laws. That’s part of our tradition.”

Courtesy San Diego Union Tribune Ruben Navarrette Jr.

But, on October 26, 2011, at the University of Colorado-Denver, Obama said this when talking to students about using an executive order to reduce student loan debt.

“We’re not going to wait for Congress. I’m going to act with or without Congress. Where they won’t act, I will, through a series of executive orders. … We’re going to look every day to see what we can do without Congress.”

And on October 25, 2010, on the Spanish-language radio show, “Piolin por la Manana” – when host Eddie “Piolin” Sotelo asked him why he hadn’t moved faster on immigration reform, Obama responded:

“I am president, I am not a king. I can’t do these things just by myself. We have a system of government that requires the Congress to work with the executive branch to make it happen.”

Yet, two years later, while facing re-election and eager to reignite support among Latinos, Obama managed to get something done without Congress’ approval.

On June 15, 2012, he announced that his administration was offering Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to allow undocumented young people to temporarily avoid deportation and apply for a two-year work permit. Speaking from the Rose Garden, Obama said:

“It makes no sense to expel talented young people who, for all intents and purposes, are Americans. … In the absence of any immigration action from Congress to fix our broken immigration system, what we’ve tried to do is focus our immigration enforcement resources in the right places. … Effective immediately, the Department of Homeland Security is taking steps to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people.”

Confused? Join the club.

Obama’s immigration schtick is simple. He blames Republicans for the fact that we don’t have immigration reform. H3 covers up for Democrats in Congress who have had a poor record on immigration. He insists that his administration is not deporting Dreamers or anyone else who isn’t a hard-core criminal. And – as he did this week – he claims that his hands are tied because he needs Congress as a dance partner.

So if a president takes action without Congress, he violates the law? But this isn’t true. There’s such a thing as the executive order.

Obama has issued 164 executive orders on such things as climate change and student debt. It’s a well-worn presidential tool – George W. Bush issued 287; Bill Clinton issued 308.

In his most recent use of executive power, Obama is attempting to tinker with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act so that Americans can keep their health plans a while longer.

The point: When it comes to using the power of the presidency for causes he really cares about, Obama is no shrinking violet. So he must not care about immigration.

The audience in San Francisco wasn’t buying it. Hong shouted at the president that he had “the power to stop deportations for all” because there are “thousands of families separated every single day.”

The actual figure is about 1,100 deportations every day if apprehensions and deportations keep pace with the rate in previous years – roughly 400,000 per year, totaling a record of nearly 2 million since Obama took office.

Obama pushed back against Hong, insisting that he didn’t have the power to stop deporting people or dividing families. “That’s why we’re here,” he said.

Other people in the crowd sided with Hong and began to shout: “Stop deportations! Yes, we can!”

On the defensive, Obama unleashed the left’s favorite weapon: condescension.

“So the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws,” he said. “What I’m proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic process to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won’t be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done.”

You know what is an easy way out, Mr. President? Not being constrained by core principles because you change your position whenever you need to get out of a scrape.

After the exchange, Hong claimed that he hadn’t planned to challenge the President of the United States, but that he couldn’t take it anymore.

“This is very urgent,” he told reporters. “This is the only venue where I could speak out, and I’m representing the voices of other undocumented students who are actually in the detention center right now and who cannot be here.”

Bravo. This young man is a hero for bravely speaking truth to power. Way to represent.

The move in this city of 100,000 people, which is troubled by crime and high unemployment, is part of a growing national trend that supporters say is designed to improve the community's employment prospects amid wider incarceration.

[pullquote]

Under the ordinance, approved by the City Council in a 6-1 vote and set to take effect in September, private companies that have city contracts and that employ more than nine people won't be able to ask anything about an applicant's criminal record; otherwise they would lose their city contracts. The ordinance is one of the nation's strictest ""ban-the-box"" laws, which are so called because many job applications contain a box to check if one has a criminal record.

[summary]

""Once we pay our debt, I think the playing field should be fair,"" said Andres Abarra of Richmond, who was released from San Quentin State Prison in 2006 after serving 16 months for selling heroin. Abarra, 60 years old, said he lost his first job out of prison, at a warehouse, about a month after a temporary agency hired him. The agency ran a background check and ""let me go on the spot,"" he said. He now works for an advocacy group called Safe Return that campaigned for the ordinance.

Others say the laws potentially endanger both employers and the public. ""We have a responsibility to protect our customers, protect other employees and then the company itself"" from potential crime, said Kelly Knott, senior director for government relations of the National Retail Federation, an industry group in Washington, D.C., which hasn't taken a position on ban-the-box laws but has cautioned against federal guidance that could limit how employers use background checks.

Richmond, with a population of about 100,000, joins 51 other municipalities that have passed similar ordinances, many in the past five years. Last year, Newark, N.J., barred private employers and the city government from inquiring into a job applicant's criminal history until they have made a conditional offer of employment, and employers can only take into consideration certain offenses committed within the past five to eight years.

Murder, voluntary manslaughter and sex offenses requiring registry can be inquired about no matter how much time has passed.

Ten states also have enacted ban-the-box legislation, according to the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit group that advocates for the laws. Many of those laws don't apply to job applications for ""sensitive"" positions, such as those involving work with children.

Michelle Rodriguez, a NELP staff attorney, said tougher sentencing laws in recent decades, particularly for drug crimes, have sent more people to prison, making post-incarceration unemployment a broader problem. ""It really could be anybody who has a criminal record now—your co-worker, your neighbor,"" Ms. Rodriguez said. ""And it doesn't mean they're a criminal. It means they had a run-in with the law.""

http://news.yahoo.com/colorado-halloween-costume-ban-125854491.html,,[],"CU-Boulder urges students not to wear 'offensive' Halloween costumes, including cowboys","The University of Colorado at Boulder is urging students not to wear Halloween costumes that fuel cultural stereotypes and could be deemed racist or offensive.



""If you are planning to celebrate Halloween by dressing up in a costume, consider the impact your costume decision may have on others in the CU community,"" Christian Gonzales, CU's dean of students, wrote in a letter. ""Making the choice to dress up as someone from another culture, either with the intention of being humorous or without the intention of being disrespectful, can lead to inaccurate and hurtful portrayals of other peoples' cultures.""



According to Gonzales, CU students have chosen costumes that ""included blackface or sombreros/serapes,"" overly sexualized ""geishas,"" ""squaws"" and stereotypes such as cowboys and Indians. They have also hosted ""offensively-themed parties,"" including ""ghetto,"" ""white trash/hillbilly"" and ""sex work.""



The parties, she wrote, ""reinforce negative representations of cultures as being associated with poverty.""



Last year, a Penn State sorority was put on probation after throwing a Mexican-themed party where guests dressed up in sombreros, mustaches and ponchos.



""How any constituent groups or individuals in the University could behave with such insensitivity or unawareness is a question we must both ask and answer,"" Penn State President Rodney Erickson wrote in an open letter to the Penn State community.



CU is hoping to avoid a similar situation.



""CU-Boulder values freedom of expression and creativity both in and outside of the classroom,"" Gonzales added. ""The CU community also values inclusiveness, respect and sensitivity. While everyone has the freedom to be expressive, we also encourage you to celebrate that you are a part of a vibrant, diverse CU community that strives toward respecting others.""



A university spokesman told Campus Reform the school supported the letter.



""When you dress up as a cowboy, and you have your sheriff badge on and a big cowboy hat, that's not a representation of a cowboy,"" Bronson Hilliard, the spokesman, said. ""That's kind of a crude stereotype.""



CU is not the first school to discourage ""offensive"" Halloween costumes.



Just last month, officials at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities sent students a similar letter.



""Please keep in mind that certain Halloween costumes inappropriately perpetuate racial, cultural, and gender stereotypes,"" the letter, signed by the dean of students, read. ""Although it may not be the intent, these costumes, and choosing to wear them, can depict identities in ways that are offensive or hurtful to others.""



The letter did not specify which costumes it deemed inappropriate. But Mike Schmit, the school's undergraduate student body president, said the message was clear: Use common sense.



“As a student, I think you’re better off erring on the side of not dressing like something that can be questionable,” Schmit told the Minnesota Star-Tribune. “Cowboys, for instance — totally fine. Indians — not totally fine.”"

Gov. Peter Kinder says ""We are better than this""

(CNN) —

A rodeo stunt at the Missouri State Fair has come under criticism after a clown donned a Barack Obama mask and stuck on a broom that descended from his backside.

The stunt took place during the bull riding competition on Saturday night.

Rodeo announcer Mark Ficken, president of the Missouri Cowboy Rodeo Association and a school superintendent, announced a special guest: “President Obama.”

Another voice is heard over the loudspeaker working up the crowd and saying, “We’re going to stomp Obama now.”

“As soon as this bull comes out, Obama, don’t you move,” the second voice said. “He’s going to getcha, getcha getcha, getcha.”

“Hey, I know I’m a clown,” the second voice said. “He’s just running around acting like one. Doesn’t know he is one.”

The stunt sickened Perry Beam, who came to the fair in Sedalia with his wife and a student from Taiwan to “give him a little piece of Americana.”

Beam likened the atmosphere to a Klan rally.

Opinion: Racist taunts at Obama should worry us all

“It wasn’t clean; it wasn’t fun. It was awful; it was sickening,” Beam said, “It was racist.”

The student, Jameson Hsieh, recorded a video of the incident, but had little to say afterward.

“He didn’t say anything. We rode all the way home in silence,” said Beam, who lives 50 miles away in Higginsville. “We were just ashamed, and he didn’t ask any more questions. I think he had seen enough. It is just disgusting.”

Condemnation came from organizers and politicians alike. The Missouri State Fair Commission called it “unacceptable” and said the clown has been banned “from ever participating or performing at the Missouri State Fair again.”

“The commission reiterated that the statements and actions Saturday night were inappropriate and not in keeping with the fair’s standards,” the agency said in a written statement. “The Missouri State Fair apologizes for the unconscionable stunt.”

The board of directors at Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association also issued an apology.

“The Sport of Rodeo is not meant to be a political platform. We are taking measures by training and educating our contract acts to prevent anything like this from ever happening again,” a statement on the group’s website said. “All Members of the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association are very proud of our Country and our President.”

And Republican Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder called for those responsible to be held accountable.

“I condemn the actions disrespectful to POTUS” – president of the United States – “the other night,” he said in a post to his official Twitter account. “We are better than this.”

U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill echoed Kinder.

“The state fair is funded by taxpayer dollars, and is supposed to be a place where we can all bring our families and celebrate the state that we love,” she said. “But the young Missourians who witnessed this stunt learned exactly the wrong lesson about political discourse, that somehow it’s ever acceptable to, in a public event, disrespect, taunt, and joke about harming the president of our great nation.”

“You know, sometimes stuff doesn’t work when you want it to. We’ve certainly had plenty of mistakes and things that haven’t worked the way that we want to,” Zuckerberg said of Facebook’s website when asked by ABC News about Obamacare’s website failure. “The right thing here is just to keep on focusing on building the service that you think is right in the long term.”

In the interview, Zuckerberg attempted to frame granting amnesty to America’s at least 11 million illegal aliens as a “civil rights issue”–a talking point used by Attorney General Eric Holder earlier this year.

“When you meet these children who are really talented, and they’ve grown up in America and they really don’t know any other country besides that, but they don’t have the opportunities that… we all enjoy, it’s really heartbreaking–right? That seems like it’s one of the biggest civil rights issues of our time,” Zuckerberg said. “There are a lot of misconceptions about that… and a lot of them came here because they just want to work. They want to help out their families and they want to contribute.”

Zuckerberg alluded in the interview that his goal in pushing for amnesty is to get tech workers from abroad for his company, rather than hiring Americans for jobs at Facebook.

“The future of our economy is a knowledge economy,” Zuckerberg said. “And that means that getting the most talented people into this country is the most important thing that we can do to make sure that the companies of tomorrow are founded here.”

Zuckerberg’s interview came as he and a group of illegal aliens last week conducted a “hackathon” to push for amnesty.

“One of the things that the ‘dreamers’ here today show is that even if, you know, you’re a child of someone who came here who wouldn’t be considered one of the higher-skilled workers… you can be one of the entrepreneurs of tomorrow,” Zuckerberg said of the hackathon. “That’s the American dream.”

Zuckerberg was asked, too, about how thus far amnesty efforts have been stalled in Congress, despite all the money he has spent through FWD.us and other lobbyists have spent through their respective outfits pushing to create support in Washington for comprehensive immigration reform. He said he still thinks there is a possibility an amnesty could be passed into law.

“I’m fundamentally an optimistic person, as an entrepreneur,” he said. “The vast majority of Americans want this to happen.”

Zuckerberg has relaunched advertising efforts to push for an immigration bill out of the House this Congress."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/03/23/The-Uncle-Tom-ing-Of-Ben-Carson-Begins,2013-03-23 00:00:00,"[""Larry O'Connor""]",The 'Uncle Tom-ing' of Ben Carson Begins,"MSNBC host and commentator Touré fired a clear and distinct shot at Dr. Ben Carson Friday, hammering the African-American Presidential Medal of Freedom winner for daring to challenge the Obamadoxy parroted by Touré and progressive journalists bent on supporting the President’s policies at all costs.

Dr. Ben Carson splashed onto the national stage with his blistering criticism of ObamaCare last month at the National Prayer breakfast, with President Obama seated just a few feet away. Carson is a heroic surgeon, Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery, who performed groundbreaking medical miracles at Johns Hopkins Hospital. He is a brilliant and passionate advocate for free market principals, individual responsibility, and the freedoms and liberty embodied in resistance to bloated big government programs like ObamaCare. He also happens to be black. Therefore, he must be stopped, now.

Like Clarence Thomas, Condi Rice, Colin Powell (until he got the message) and Herman Cain before him, Carson will now be the target of the most vile and reprehensible kinds of criticism from black progressives like Touré and his colleague Al Sharpton. A black man who doesn’t blindly support the president and the big government programs that has created a dependency on government that has crippled America’s underclass is susceptible to name calling that, otherwise, would not be tolerated in American political discourse.

On his show, Touré said this of Carson:

Carson is a brilliant medical thinker but he’s got intellectual tumors like a flat tax, which is regressive, and ignorant in the face of wealth inequality where the top 1% own 35% and the bottom 60% own 2.3%. I doubt Jesus would tax them equally. Just as I doubt the GOP would entertain a white non-politician with unserious ideas. But Carson has joined the GOP’s version of affirmative action, where blacks that can speak conservative game get raced to the front of the line because then people get to put a bumper sticker on their car that say, ‘How could I be racist? I would have voted for Carson!’ Which would fit nicely over the bumper sticker saying, ‘How could I be racist? I would have voted for Cain?’ Which fit nicely over the bumper sticker saying, ‘How could I be racist? I would have voted for Allen West!’ Yes, any black friend will do, no matter how far outside the political system they emerge from and no matter how unserious their ideas are. Because it’s all make believe. None of them will ever get a nomination for the Presidency, just as the GOP will never get black votes, because the only thing they care about is winning and not the economic or social needs of black people. But in the meantime, imagine away you guys. At CPAC Carson said, ‘Let’s say you magically put me in the White House.’ But, my brother, no magic is required to accomplish that. As soon as the sequester ends, you could take a White House tour.

Let’s be clear: Touré holds black men up to a different (lower or higher, not sure) standard when they criticize the President. He expects black people to think a certain way and pounces when they step out of line and express a different set of ideas than what Touré believes they should believe, due to their skin color. Because Carson is a black man, he is therefore the beneficiary of affirmitive action, in Touré’s mind, and if he dares to present an opposing view from MSNBC’s Obamadoxy, he is an Uncle Tom and betrayer of his race.

In short, Touré has a special contempt for black men who criticize President Obama. There may be many different interpretations of the definition of racial prejudice and/or racism, but my understanding of racism is that it is the belief that humans are divided into distinct groups based upon their skin color and genetic make-up, and those groups are expected to behave and think in certain ways (inferior or superior) solely based upon their race. Touré’s special loathing of Dr. Carson may not be based upon his race, but it certainly appears to be. And if that doesn’t fall under the description of racism, then I would really appreciate it if Touré could explain the distinction to me, because I’m having trouble seeing it."

Community leaders on both sides of the immigration debate, however, agreed that the president’s plan didn’t stray much from a proposal outlined Monday by a bipartisan group in the Senate.

The fate of any sort of immigration reform will rely on the fine print, which is yet to be sorted out. Obama said he wants a program that would create a path to citizenship.

One key difference between both plans is that the Senate proposal says the federal government must first certify that the U.S.-Mexico border is secure before there is a pathway to U.S. citizenship for the estimated 11 million who are in the country illegally.

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer welcomed the border enforcement portion of the Senate plan, spokesman Matthew Benson said.

“The governor is very encouraged that for the first time in a long time there is bipartisan agreement that border security must be the linchpin in immigration reform, specifically before… a pathway to citizenship,” Benson said.

Pat Sexton, president of the Tucson chapter of the Arizona Latino Republican Assn., said she agrees that securing the border must come first but doesn’t believe citizenship should be given to the millions here illegally.

The 60-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, who is originally from Guatemala, said there is already a clear path to residency and eventual citizenship.

“The pathway is for them to go back to their country and do it the way it’s supposed to be done,” Sexton said.

Arizona immigrant rights leaders and community organizers said they were generally encouraged by Obama’s proposal, stating that the announcement is a testament to the growth and influence of Latinos in the country.

Latino voter turnout in November’s election likely played a key role in the renewed interest in addressing immigration reform, said Petra Falcón, executive director of Promise Arizona.

“That’s why we are at this moment right now,” she said.

Some called the proposals set forth by Obama and the group of senators a recycled endeavor.

“This is nothing new or novel,” John Hill, executive director of Stand With Arizona, said.

“It’s the same empty promises of 1986,” he added, referring the immigration bill signed by President Ronald Reagan. That legislation led to the legalization of about 2.7 million people.

Hill, who heads the Phoenix-based anti-illegal immigration group, said that law, the Immigration Reform and Control Act, also pledged to secure the border and to compel employers to verify that job applicants were in the country legally. Neither effort, however, was enforced vigorously. Meanwhile, millions received legal status and millions more followed and remained in the country illegally, Hill said.

Since large Latino voter turnout in the November election, lawmakers have faced mounting pressure to confront immigration reform.

Promise Arizona, and other immigrant rights group in Arizona were part of a contingent of Latino advocacy groups in the state that made a huge push to register Latinos in Maricopa County, enrolling 34,000 who had never voted before.

These groups also signed up thousands of eligible Latinos to become permanent early voters, meaning they would be sent a mail-in ballot automatically in each election. In 2008, 90,000 Latinos were on the early voting list. In 2012, it increased to a record 225,000, according to Francisco Heredia, state director for Mi Familia Vota in Arizona.

Falcón said the plan is to mobilize the thousands they enrolled to vote and have them call and email their congressional representatives in Arizona to push for immigration reform.

“We are going to go back and knock on those doors…"" she said. “We need to make sure that every day our members of Congress hear from us .. .to make sure we get our message out there.”

Hill said his group -- an estimated 240,000 members strong -- plans to do the same.

“It is time to provide an opportunity for legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children and who know no other home,” Cantor said. “I’m pleased that many of my colleagues in both chambers of Congress on both sides of the aisle have begun work in good faith to address these issues.”

At a major speech at the American Enterprise Institute that detailed Republican policy proposals to “make life better” for Americans, Cantor called on his colleagues in both chambers of Congress on both sides of the aisle to address this issue and urged President Barack Obama to lead on a bipartisan immigration bill. Cantor said one of the “founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents.”

This is a reversal for Cantor, who voted against the DREAM Act in 2010.

“There are some who would rather avoid fixing the problem in order to save this as a political issue,” Cantor said. “I reject this notion and call on the President to help lead us towards a bipartisan solution rather than encourage the common political divisions of the past.”

Cantor said “there are more than 11 million people here illegally, many of whom have become part of the fabric of our country,” and “they, like us, have families and dreams.”

“While we are a nation that allows anyone to start anew, we are also a nation of laws, and that’s what makes tackling the issue of immigration reform so difficult,” Cantor said. “In looking to solve this problem soon, we’ve got to balance the respect for the rule of law and respect for those waiting to enter this country legally, with care for the people and families, most of whom just want to make a better life, and contribute to America.”

Cantor also called on Congress to pass the STEM Act, which would give foreign students who have advanced degrees in field such as science, technology, engineering, and math from American universities permanent residency.

He said discussions about immigration reform have made “border security, employment verification and creating a workable guest worker program immediate priorities.”

“It’s the right thing to do for our families, for our security, and for our economy,” Cantor said.

Cantor said his “grandparents fled the vicious anti-Semitic pogroms of the czars of Russia to come to America.” He said his grandmother, who was “widowed at a young age,” raised “her two sons in a tiny apartment atop a grocery store she and my grandfather had opened.”

“With little but her faith, thrift and hope for a better tomorrow, my grandma worked seven days a week to ensure that my dad and uncle could realize the promise of this great country,” Cantor said. “And today, my children and I stand as proof of the possibility to what may have seemed to her then like an impossible dream.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/national-review-back-warning-white-people-black-people-220330124.html,,[],National Review Is Back to Warning White People About Black People,"Fifteen months after The National Review ended its relationship with longtime writer John Derbyshire for an essay he wrote for TakiMag.com in which he instructs his children to be afraid of black people, the conservative magazine has published Victor Davis Hanson's version of the same article. It is unlikely Hanson will meet the same fate as his former colleague.

RELATED: Why John Derbyshire Hasn't Been Fired (Yet)

What's changed? Well, all the attention on the killing of Trayvon Martin and the trial and acquittal of George Zimmerman and the hardening of stances on the merits of racial stereotyping. Derbyshire's piece was a response to several essays written in the aftermath of Martin's death about ""The Talk"" that black parents give their sons about how to deal with with white police officers and other authority figures. In ""The Talk: Nonblack Version,"" Derbyshire wrote, ""There is a talk that nonblack Americans have with their kids, too."" In his talk, he said, he told his children that they should ""Avoid concentrations of blacks"" who are strangers, ""Stay out of heavily black neighborhoods,"" ""Do not act the Good Samaritan to blacks in apparent distress,"" and ""If accosted by a strange black in the street, smile and say something polite but keep moving.""

RELATED: John Derbyshire Has (Finally) Been Fired

In The National Review on Tuesday, Hanson notes that Attorney General Eric Holder told the NAACP that George Zimmerman's acquittal meant he had to give his son ""The Talk,"" about how black people are assumed to be violent by some white people and thus at great risk for harm. Hanson says, ""Yet I fear that for every lecture of the sort that Holder is forced to give his son, millions of non-African-Americans are offering their own versions of ensuring safety to their progeny."" Hanson does not try to be funny, the way Derbyshire did, and he doesn't make the same kind of vague warnings about a simmering race war. (Derbyshire said about 5 percent of blacks were ""ferociously hostile to whites,"" and another 50 percent or so of them would go along out of solidarity and becaue they think white people have it coming.) But his basic idea is the same: watch out for black kids.

Story continues

RELATED: Racist Writers Are Right to Feel Threatened

Hanson says his father — a Democrat! — told him once, ""When you go to San Francisco, be careful if a group of black youths approaches you."" Hanson continues:

Note what he did not say to me. He did not employ language like “typical black person.” He did not advise extra caution about black women, the elderly, or the very young — or about young Asian Punjabi, or Native American males. In other words, the advice was not about race per se, but instead about the tendency of males of one particular age and race to commit an inordinate amount of violent crime. It was after some first-hand episodes with young African-American males that I offered a similar lecture to my own son.

When he was a grad student, Hanson says, two black guys tried to break into his apartment while he was in it. Another time, four black guys tried to steal his bike while he was on it. ""Regrettably, I expect that my son already has his own warnings prepared to pass on to his own future children,"" he says.

RELATED: Florida's Problems with Racial Politics Go Far Beyond Trayvon Martin

This is dumb and not very polite, The Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates writes, but also does not actually make Hanson's kids safe.

If I were to tell you that I only employ Asian-Americans to do my taxes because ""Asian-Americans do better on the Math SAT,"" you would not simply question my sensitivity, but my mental faculties. That is because you would understand that in making an individual decision, employing an ancestral class of millions is not very intelligent. Moreover, were I to tell you I wanted my son to marry a Jewish woman because ""Jews are really successful,"" you would understand that statement for the stupidity which it is.

But racism makes people do dumb things, Coates writes. So does politics. There have been pretty clear political ""sides"" to the Trayvon Martin case ever since President Obama spoke about him in March 2012. Coates wrote last fall:

As civil-rights activists descended on Florida, National Review, a magazine that once opposed integration, ran a column proclaiming“Al Sharpton Is Right.” The belief that a young man should be able to go to the store for Skittles and an iced tea and not be killed by a neighborhood-­watch patroller seemed un­controversial… The moment Obama spoke, the case of Trayvon Martin passed out of its national-mourning phase and lapsed into something darker and more familiar—racialized political fodder.

Since the Zimmerman verdict, many people have defended racial profiling as the right reaction to crime rates — black people have a higher crime rate, though it is dropping, as it is with other demographics. The Washington Post's Richard Cohen did, so did Kathleen Parker, calling it ""common sense."" The racial debate intensified again after Obama's speech last Friday, when he said ""Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago."" Several people pointed out that black people commit crimes too, and why didn't Obama mention that? ""If you think of the young mother whose 2-year-old son was shot in the face by the two black teens that approached her in Atlanta and that baby had died, why do presidents choose to speak about one case and not the other?"" former George W. Bush press secretary Dana Perino said on Sunday. Hanson points out that black men allegedly robbed a jewelry store the same day Holder gave his talk:

What were the names of two of the men suspected of being the ones who last week shot it out with the Santa Rosa jeweler as Eric Holder demagogued the Trayvon Martin shooting? Traveon Banks-Austin and Alexander Tyvon Brandon. And so the tragedy continues.

They had similar names, so... so that must mean something, right?

And Fox News' Bill O'Reilly said on Monday night, ""The sad truth is that from the president on down, our leadership has no clue, no clue at all about how to solve problems within the black community."" The real problem black people face is not white racism, he said, but instead, ""The reason there is so much violence and chaos in the black precincts is the disintegration of the African-American family."" This is about personal choice, not oppression, O'Reilly said — ""White people don't force black people to have babies out of wedlock"" — except in the case of the liberal entertainment industry, which ""encourages the irresponsibility by marketing a gangster culture, hip hop, movies, trashy TV shows to impressionable children."" He continued, ""President Obama has welcomed some of the worst offenders in that cesspool to the White House when he should be condemning what these weasels are doing. These so-called entertainers get rich while the kids who emulate their lyrics and attitude destroy themselves."" Get it? Maybe the black president, in some small way, is the one who's really responsible for some black crime, too."
http://news.yahoo.com/rutgers-alumni-call-probe-coachs-firing-061128108--spt.html,,[],Rutgers alumni call for probe on coach's firing,"NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) — Mike Rice was fired as the Rutgers men's basketball coach after a video surfaced showing him shoving players and berating them with gay slurs, but critics said New Jersey's flagship public university still has more explaining — and maybe some more firing — to do.

A group of 13 faculty members Wednesday demanded that university President Robert Barchi resign for his ""inexcusable handling"" of the situation.

Alumni, lawmakers and a gay-rights group are among those calling for an investigation into why university officials took months to fire Rice after getting the video from a former basketball program employee in a scandal that touches on two long-standing issues on campus: the role of sports and the treatment of gays.

""If the roles were reversed and this was a professor and not a coach and this was a student in the classroom as opposed to a collegiate player this would be completely different. You wouldn't say, 'This was a first offense,'"" said Glenn Articolo, a radiologist who lives in Marlton and a 1991 Rutgers graduate. ""There's not a single employee at Rutgers University from the president to the janitor who wouldn't be dismissed immediately. It seems there's a double standard when it comes to the basketball coach or the football coach.""

Some alumni say athletic director Tim Pernetti should also be dismissed and some are questioning what Barchi knew, and when.

In a statement Wednesday, Barchi, who took office in September, said he was told of the video in November and agreed that it would be appropriate to suspend Rice, fine him and send him to anger management counseling. But he said he saw the video for himself only this week, and it was then that he decided Rice should be fired.

Pernetti also issued a statement Wednesday, but he and Barchi were not made available to answer reporters' questions.

Because he lasted the season, Rice is due a $100,000 bonus on top of his salary. He was paid $622,500 in 2012. Athletic Department spokesman Jason Baum said he'll get the bonus for coaching the final game of the 2012-13 season last month because it's contractually obligated.

Story continues

Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver, a Democrat who spoke about the topic on several radio and television shows Wednesday, is calling for legislative hearings on the details.

The gay-rights group Garden State Equality also called for an investigation.

Much of the anger over the university's handling of the situation came because Rice was not fired until after the public saw the video.

""Why did they fire him? Just because the tape came out?"" asked Jim Walton, a 1980 Rutgers graduate who is now a compliance and ethics manager in Philadelphia. ""They already knew the truth. If he should have been fired today, he should have been fired a long time ago.""

Some at Rutgers, a long-time also-ran in major sports, have been debating for years whether it's been worth it to spend more money and put more focus on trying to elevate the university's football and men's basketball programs.

The university has also dealt with how gay students are treated since Tyler Clementi, a freshman there, killed himself in 2010 days after learning his roommate had used a webcam to see him kissing another man. The roommate spent 20 days in jail last year after a jury convicted him of bias intimidation and other crimes in a case that sparked policy changes to try to make Rutgers friendlier to gay students.

""After the suicide of Tyler Clementi, I thought my alma mater would take the use of gay slurs by any member of the Rutgers community — students, faculty, administrators, or coaches — seriously,"" said Debbie Hadley, a 1991 Rutgers graduate who is a naturalist in Jackson. ""Clearly, Tim Pernetti did not. And yes, I believe he should be fired, too.""

Some students agreed that the coach needed to be ousted.

Alison Coopersmith, an 18-year-old first-year student majoring in political science said that if gay slurs are not tolerated by students, they shouldn't be tolerated by professionals, either.

""It's worse when they're in a position of power,"" she said.

But on campus, not everyone was up in arms Wednesday.

Taylor Akers, a 19-year-old sophomore pre-med major, said Rice should not have been fired. ""That happens all the time,"" he said.

(CNN) —

Edith Windsor, who filed the original case that could upend the Defense of Marriage Act, says just getting the case to this point is a kind of victory.

“We’ve made a huge step forward and a huge difference in how people look at us,” she said. “And so, it’ll happen. Another year if not now.”

It was the death of Windsor’s life partner, Thea Clara Spyer, that led to the case.

Theirs was not a fleeting romance – the women were together 42 years sharing ups and downs, laughs and tears. They also shared what they’d earned together, including from Windsor’s job as a programmer with IBM and Spyer’s work as a psychologist.

5 things we learned from day one of oral arguments

“We were mildly affluent and extremely happy,” Windsor said. “We were like most couples.”

But even after they married in 2007 in Toronto, some 40 years into their courtship, the two women were not “like most couples” in the eyes of the state of New York, where they lived, nor in the eyes of the U.S. government, which under the Defense of Marriage Act mandates that a spouse, as legally defined, must be a person of the opposite sex.

This fact hit Windsor hard in 2009, while in a hospital after suffering a heart attack a month after Spyer’s death. As she recovered and mourned, Windsor realized she faced a hefty bill for inheritance taxes – $363,053 more than was warranted, she later claimed in court – because Spyer was, in legal terms, little more than a friend.

“It was incredible indignation,” Windsor recalled feeling. “Just the numbers were so cruel.”

This anger gave way to action. Why, she and her lawyers argued, should her relationship with Spyer be any different when it came to rights, taxes and more than a heterosexual couple? Why should Windsor have to pay, literally, for losing her soulmate – even though, by 2009, New York courts had recognized that “foreign same-sex marriages” should be recognized in the state as valid?

In October, Windsor got an answer in the form of a ruling opinion from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That court found, in her favor, that the Defense of Marriage Act violates the Constitution’s equal protection clause and thus she shouldn’t have had to pay an inheritance tax after her partner’s death. This follows a similar ruling, in May, from another federal appeals court in Boston.

Federal appeals court strikes down Defense of Marriage Act

Neither opinion settles the matter for good. That is expected to happen when the Supreme Court will weigh the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act through the prism of Windsor and Spyer’s story. It is one of two cases related to same-sex marriage that the high court is considering. The other addresses California’s Proposition 8. The court is expected to rule on both cases by mid-June.

Even with those cases pending, Windsor said last fall – when the lower court decided in her favor, three years after Spyer’s death – that she felt she could finally breathe and celebrate.

It was a day she relished, and one she didn’t entirely expect after all her heartache.

“What I’m feeling is elated,” Windsor said. “Did I ever think it could come to be, altogether? … Not a chance in hell.”

By the numbers: Same-sex marriage

Instant chemistry in Greenwich Village

Born in Philadelphia in 1929, on the eve of the Great Depression, Windsor graduated from Temple University and earned a master’s degree, in 1957, from New York University, according to a fall 2011 story in the latter school’s alumni magazine.

She had come to New York hoping for a fresh start after a brief marriage, according to the report. And professionally, she found it – working for NYU’s math department and soon entering data into its UNIVAC, one of a few dozen of the huge commercial computers then in operation. Her knack for programming eventually helped her land a job, and to excel, at IBM.

But something was missing in her life, personally.

Or, as Windsor put it more succinctly, “I suddenly couldn’t take it anymore.”

In the documentary “Edie and Thea: A Very Long Engagement,” she recalled pleading with an old friend to take her “where the lesbians go.” And so Windsor spent one Friday night at Portofino, a restaurant in New York’s Greenwich Village.

“Somebody brought Thea over and introduced her. And we ended up dancing,” she recalled.

“And we immediately just fit,” added Spyer, on the documentary.

Timeline: Same-sex marriage

After reuniting two years later, according to their New York Times’ wedding announcement, their connection proved deep and lasting. In 1967, Spyer proposed marriage with a round diamond pin. A year later, they purchased a house together in Southampton, according to the NYU Alumni Magazine story.

Yet while the gay rights’ movement took off after the 1969 Stonewall Riots, which occurred while Windsor and Spyer were vacationing in Italy, an actual marriage – a legal union – seemed out of the question.

Marriage, at last, and then heartache

Regardless, their love remained strong.

On the documentary, filmed around 2007, Spyer said, “Each one of us, in fact, looks different from how we looked when we met. But if I look at Edie now, she looks exactly the same to me. Exactly the same.”

Windsor had halted her new career as a gay rights activist to help care for her partner, who suffered from multiple sclerosis. And it was after getting a “bad prognosis (that) I had another year to live and that was it” that Spyer proposed again.

“And I said yes,” Windsor recalled. “She said, ‘So do I.’ “

Video shows Spyer being pushed through the airport in her wheelchair. It was from that seat – on May 22, 2007, at Toronto’s Sheraton Gateway Hotel – that she gave her vows to make their marriage official in Canada.

“I, Thea Spyer, choose you, Edith Windsor, to be my lawful, wedded spouse,” she said. “For richer and for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part.”

Married same-sex couple awaits epic high court appeal

Having happily gone four decades without, Windsor soon realized how much the marriage meant to her. It made her and Spyer’s love legitimate and all the more real.

“It’s different because somewhere you’re a hidden person, and suddenly you’re a citizen of the world,” she said in October of 2012.

But what happened as Spyer’s condition worsened, and after her death, proved a stark reminder they were not legally united in their own country. And the fact that New York legalized same-sex marriage in 2011 didn’t mean that Windsor, for example, would suddenly get back the hundreds of thousands of dollars in inheritance tax that she’d given to the government.

That could happen, however, if the Supreme Court upholds the appeals court ruling. That is Windsor’s hope, as is that whether a committed couple is heterosexual or homosexual becomes irrelevant within the next decade.

In the meantime, Windsor said she’s proud to fight for something bigger than herself and the legitimacy of her union with Spyer. She hopes, through her struggle, to help make it so gay teenagers can “fall in love knowing there’s a future,” that children of gay couples won’t feel the need to explain their families, and that homophobia becomes a thing of the past.

“I feel like I’m representing them.”

Couple fights for right to marry"
http://news.yahoo.com/white-mayor-black-wife-nyc-shatters-image-160244789.html,,[],"White mayor, black wife: NYC shatters an image","Another milestone is passing in America's racial journey: The next mayor of New York City is a white man with a black wife.

Even in a nation with a biracial president, where interracial marriage is more accepted and common than ever, Bill de Blasio's marriage to Chirlane McCray is remarkable: He is apparently the first white politician in U.S. history elected to a major office with a black spouse by his side.

This simple fact is striking a deep chord in many people as de Blasio prepares to take office on Jan. 1, with McCray playing a major role in his administration.

""It reflects the American values of embracing different races, ethnicities, religions. I think it's just a great symbol,"" said William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, who is married to a black woman.

Cohen was already a senator when he started dating Janet Langhart, a black television journalist. He proposed several times, but she feared that her race would hurt Cohen's political future. They married in 1996, a few weeks after Cohen announced he would not seek a fourth term.

""There has been that fear (of interracial marriage) on the part of politicians. I didn't have it,"" Cohen said. He noted that a few white politicians have married Latino or Asian women, like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose wife is from Mexico, or Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is married to the Taiwan-born former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao.

There have been black men in politics who have been married to white women, such as Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas or former Massachusetts Sen. Edward Brooke. And high-profile women such as South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, whose parents are from India, and Mia Love, the black mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, are married to white men.

Yet unions of white men and black women have retained a forbidden aura, Cohen said.

""It's black and white, it's slavery and Jim Crow and the fact you can't talk about it,"" he said. ""Black and white has been more of a taboo in the eyes of enough people to be a deterrent.""

Story continues

The taboo is declining, polls show.

In July, a Gallup poll found that 87 percent of Americans approved of interracial marriage — the highest rate ever — compared with 4 percent in 1958. In 2010, more than 15 percent of all new marriages were interracial, according to the Pew Research Center.

Yet statistics also indicate why de Blasio and McCray are such a rarity.

The Gallup poll showed that 14 percent of white people did not approve of intermarriage, compared with 2 percent of black people. And white men are the least likely to marry outside of their race — more than 97 percent of white men are married to white women (82 percent of black men, 65 percent of Hispanics and 48 percent of Asians marry within their own group). The figures are based on 2005 census data analyzed by Michael Rosenfeld, a Stanford University sociologist who studies interracial marriage.

Much has been made of the difficulties black women have in selecting husbands from a pool of eligible black men shrunk by unemployment and incarceration. Among black women age 35 and over, more than 25 percent have never been married, compared with about 7 percent of white women, census figures show. Black men also are twice as likely as black women to marry outside of their race, according to Rosenfeld.

American history and culture, meanwhile, are littered with troubled tales of interracial couples. There have been centuries of debate over President Thomas Jefferson fathering children with his slave Sally Hemings; Sen. Strom Thurmond fought for segregation after having a child with a black housekeeper. In his 1991 film, Spike Lee dubbed interracial sex ""Jungle Fever.""

All of which helps explain why many saw the matrimonial script being flipped by McCray and de Blasio.

""We're seeing black women loved in a way we have not seen before,"" said Aja Monet, a poet and New Yorker.

She sees this trend in real life and fiction, from McCray to first lady Michelle Obama to the Olivia Pope character in ""Scandal,"" the hit TV show about a powerful black political operative in a relationship with a white president.

Monet has black, Cuban, Jamaican and Puerto Rican heritage. Her boyfriend is Korean-American. She noted that McCray and her brown children not only helped de Blasio connect with black voters — ""their love functioned like a political technology"" — but McCray also was a key player in de Blasio's campaign and will be an important part of his Democratic administration.

""It's fair to say the most important voice in my life is Chirlane McCray,"" de Blasio said after his victory.

As de Blasio and McCray celebrated on election night with their two children, Tiya Miles saw them on television and stopped in her tracks. ""I was very moved,"" she said.

Miles, a black University of Michigan professor, recently wrote a column about being stung by the sight of so many successful black men choosing white wives. It feels like ""a personal rejection of the group in which I am a part, of African American women as a whole, who have always been devalued in this society,"" Miles wrote.

""I think black women sit there with these feelings and they fester, and they take little bits of us over time,"" Miles said in an interview. ""We can deal, we can manage, we keep on moving because that's our job in life, but it still affects us.""

So for her, de Blasio and McCray's victory feels like confirmation — especially since McCray does not resemble the type of black woman that mainstream America usually deems beautiful, like Halle Berry or Beyonce.

""A woman who has darker skin and natural hair, and a white man,"" Miles said. ""To see a black woman who is in a long-term relationship with children and her partner, who does not fit that stiff, narrow, idealized image of what a black woman should look like, I think is powerful.""

It's more a simple sign of progress for Love, the mayor from Utah and a rising Republican star.

""I tend not to look at race in any issue,"" she said. However, ""the fact that people are able to marry someone outside of their race without feeling as if they are going to have any issues or repercussions is a great thing.""

Interracial marriage is not entirely accepted. A recent Cheerios ad featuring an interracial family inspired so many racist remarks that YouTube stopped allowing comments on it. And there remains some black resistance to marrying white people — it's widely accepted that if President Barack Obama had married a white woman, or even a light-skinned black woman, black voters would have caused him problems.

De Blasio was elected in New York, perhaps the most diverse city in America. But he is connecting with people across the country, especially the children of interracial marriages.

""Thank you, New York City, for this gift,"" wrote Liz Dwyer, whose father is white and mother is black, on her losangelista.com blog.

""It's just the resonance of it. How much it means for families to see a family like them in a visible place,"" said Ken Tanabe, a New Yorker with a Japanese father and Belgian mother. He is the founder of the Loving Day organization — www.lovingday.org — which organizes annual events celebrating the 1967 Supreme Court decision that struck down laws against interracial marriage.

""Within our community, when someone does well, it feels like an affirmation,"" he said. ""Not on the scale of a Barack Obama, but sort of a local version of that.""

Said Cohen, the former defense secretary: ""It says a lot about this country. Where we've come from, how far.""

""The mayor,"" he said, ""has shattered an image.""

With his ruling, Judge G. Murray Snow of United States District Court delivered the most decisive defeat so far to Sheriff Arpaio, who has come to symbolize Arizona’s strict approach to immigration enforcement by making it the leading mission for many of the 800 deputies under his command at the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office.

At 142 pages, the decision is peppered with stinging criticism of the policies and practices espoused by Sheriff Arpaio, who Judge Snow said had turned much of his focus to arresting immigrants who were in the country illegally, in most cases civil violations, at the expense of fighting crimes.

He said the sheriff relied on racial profiling and illegal detentions to target Latinos, using their ethnicity as the main basis for suspecting they were in the country illegally. Many of the people targeted were American citizens or legal residents."

U.S. District Judge Fred Biery has spoken. The Texas judge issued a ruling in the case he called ""The Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Bikini Top v. the (More) Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Pastie.""

Yes, indeed. At issue was a strip club's request for a preliminary injunction that would block enforcement of a San Antonio ordinance requiring its dancers to wear bikini tops while entertaining. The club had asked that its employees be allowed to wear nipple-covering ""pasties"" instead.

The fact that this case went to court is strange enough. But that seems downright pedestrian when compared with Judge Biery's hilarious ruling that was so full of double-entendres we could barely keep up.

The 29-page document starts off with a bang. ""An ordinance dealing with semi-nude dancers has once again fallen into the city's lap,"" he writes.

He continues:

The City of San Antonio (""City"") wants exotic dancers employed by Plantiffs to wear larger pieces of fabric to cover more of the female breast. Thus, the age old question before the Court, now with constitutional implications, is: Does size matter?

And that's just the first paragraph. All through the ruling, Biery doesn't miss an opportunity to drop a one-liner poking fun at the inherent ridiculousness of the case.

Some of the judge's best ""That's what she said!"" lines...

Plaintiffs clothe themselves in the First Amendment seeking to provide cover against another alleged naked grab of unconstitutional power.

Plaintiffs, and by extension their customers, seek an erection of a constitutional wall separating themselves from the regulatory power of City government.

While the Court has not received amicus curiae briefs, the Court has been blessed with volunteers known in South Texas as 'curious amigos' to be inspectors general to perform on sight visits at the locations in question.

To bare, or not to bare, that is the question. While the Court finds these businesses to be nefarious magnets of mischief, the Court doubts several square inches of fabric will stanch the flow of violence and other secondary effects emanating from these businesses.

Story continues

The judge's conclusion is the stuff of legend. Here it is, in all its glory:

Accordingly, the request for preliminary injunction is DENIED. Should the parties choose to string this case out to trial on the merits, the Court encourages reasonable discovery intercourse as they navigate the peaks and valleys of litigation, perhaps to reach a happy ending. It is so ORDERED.

It was also a victory for the industry’s steadfast, if surprising, allies: advocacy groups representing the very communities hit hardest by the obesity epidemic.

Dozens of Hispanic and African-American civil rights groups, health advocacy organizations and business associations have joined the beverage industry in opposing soda regulation around the country in recent years, arguing that such measures — perhaps the greatest regulatory threat the soft-drink industry has ever faced — are discriminatory, paternalistic or ineffective.

Many of these groups have something else in common: They are among the recipients of tens of millions of dollars from the beverage industry that has flowed to nonprofit and educational organizations serving blacks and Hispanics over the last decade, according to a review by The New York Times of charity records and other documents.

Soda companies have sponsored conferences for the National Hispana Leadership Institute, scholarships for local chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, financial literacy classes offered by the National Puerto Rican Coalition and programs from the National Hispanic Medical Association."

http://news.yahoo.com/nyc-mayor-lambastes-stop-frisk-ruling-061719911.html,,[],NYC mayor lambastes stop-and-frisk ruling,"NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge's stinging rebuke of the police department's stop-and-frisk policy as discriminatory could usher in a return to the days of high violent crime rates and end New York's tenure as ""America's safest big city,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg warned.

The ruling strikes at the heart of the legacy Bloomberg aims to leave when his third and final term ends this year. He said he would appeal but likely won't be around long enough to deal with the repercussions.

""This is a dangerous decision made by a judge who I think does not understand how policing works and what is compliant with the U.S. Constitution as determined by the Supreme Court,"" Bloomberg said. ""I worry for my kids, and I worry for your kids. I worry for you and I worry for me. Crime can come back any time the criminals think they can get away with things. We just cannot let that happen.""

U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin declared Monday that police have intentionally and systematically violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men.

She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes to the tactic, including reforms in policies, training and supervision. And she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in the some of the precincts where most stops occurred.

""The city's highest officials have turned a blind eye to the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially discriminatory manner,"" she wrote. ""In their zeal to defend a policy that they believe to be effective, they have willfully ignored overwhelming proof that the policy of targeting 'the right people' is racially discriminatory.""

But Bloomberg said police have done exactly what the courts and constitution allow to keep the city safe, reiterating the tactic was one tool that has helped drive down crime to record lows. The ruling could result, he said, in a return to the days of crime and mayhem, when murders hit an all-time high of 2,245 in 1990. Killings hit an all-time low of 418 in 2012.

Story continues

Scheindlin refused to hear testimony on crime rates, and her ruling skewered the city's defense of the practice and argument that it effectively polices itself.

Stop and frisk has been around for decades in some form, but recorded stops increased dramatically under the Bloomberg administration to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men. The lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class-action case.

About half the people who are stopped are subject only to questioning. Others have their bag or backpack searched, and sometimes police conduct a full pat-down. Only 10 percent of all stops result in arrest, and a weapon is recovered a small fraction of the time.

Scheindlin noted she was not putting an end to the practice, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops.

The judge presided over a 10-week bench trial this year that included testimony from NYPD brass and a dozen people — 11 men and one woman — who said they were wrongly stopped because of their race. She found that nine of the 19 stops discussed in court were unconstitutional, and that an additional five stops included wrongful frisking.

In her long ruling, she determined at least 200,000 stops were made without reasonable suspicion, the necessary legal benchmark, lower than the standard of probable cause needed to justify an arrest. She said that rank-and-file officers were pressured by superiors to make stops — and that police brass ignored mounting evidence that bad stops were being made.

Witness Nicholas Peart, who wept on the stand during the trial as he described a frightening encounter with police, said Monday that he hoped the ruling would mean ""tremendous steps forward.""

""I felt that it restores a sense of trust,"" said the 24-year-old Peart, who is black. ""Our voices do count, and count towards something greater.""

In a 2010 audience Q&A about his (then) new book on Barack Obama, Remnick confessed that what he saw among the everyday moms and dads and grandmothers and grandfathers who populate the Tea Party is an entity motivated mostly by fear and race:

When you hear people in the Tea Party movement saying, ‘I want my country back, I’ve lost my country,’ something is being said there, very often, that has to do with race. It has to do with otherness. It has to do with a nostalgia for an imagined America some time ago.

As I write this, Remnick is being celebrated all throughout the elite media for his morally illiterate New Yorker article that biographies Boston Marathon suspects, Tamerlan and Dzohokhar Tsarnaev. So impressed is the elite media, that George Stephanopoulos has invited Remnick to appear on “This Week” Sunday.

If you are naively wondering why all this is happening, here is what I wrote earlier today:

Much of this is and will be motivated by the left’s bizarre desire to forever rationalize radical Islam. For some reason, Islamists are the only racist, sexist, homophobic theocrats the media can’t summon outrage against. I suspect it is also the result of industry-wide disappointment over the fact that the bad guys aren’t right-wingers. (Would Remnick have summoned such eloquence for the savage second coming of McVeigh? Would the media be gushing over it?)

So what we have here is the media still looking for a way to blame the most inviting and inclusive country in the world for not being inviting and inclusive enough.

The same media that sees only evil in the peaceful Tea Party just can’t bring itself to see evil in the kind of terrorism they can’t exploit against the Tea Party or any of their enemies on the right.

The media will bend over backwards to shroud monstrous terrorism in lofty nuance.

You and I, though, are just monsters.

From what has been reported in the Associated Press, Dolan also said that the Catholic Church has been ""caricatured as being anti-gay.""

No Cardinal Dolan, the Catholic Church hierarchy hasn't been 'outmarketed' on gay marriage, nor have you been 'caricatured' as anti-gay. The hard truth is that, while right on so many of the most important issues of our time, the Catholic Church leadership in America is wrong on the question of gay marriage and someday (probably centuries from now) you will have to own up to it.

First of all, marketing isn't the problem. We know where the Catholic Church bishops stand on the issue as they have been engaged in a full on anti-gay marriage campaign including a recent exorcism against gay marriage in Illinois and using communion as a hostage against same sex marriage in New Jersey, not to mention the firing of a lesbian teacher from a Catholic school in Arkansas after her same sex marriage.

The logic of the Catholic position against gay marriage seems to go something like this -- marriage is ultimately, and most importantly about procreation, if you can't naturally procreate, you shouldn't get married. This, of course, doesn't sit that well with heterosexuals who don't want, or are unable, to have children. And of course it is an intentional non-starter with homosexuals who have the wrong body parts.

Stability, life long commitment, fidelity and love are not as crucial to the idea of marriage as procreation which is elevated above all else. For instance, the love between Edie Windsor and Thea Spyer that lasted over 40 years and including a final 30 years of Windsor caring for Spyer through her debilitating multiple sclerosis is demoted and diminished in the 'procreation' argument. Their life together, and love for each other doesn't rise to the level of marriage.

What is happening with increasing speed is that Americans do understand the Catholic Church's position but that people just don't agree with its conclusions. In fact, even Catholics themselves don't agree with the Bishops position as polls show a majority of them are for gay marriage. In fact Catholics in the pews are more in favor of gay marriage than the national average.

The other Cardinal Dolan comment that requires a response is that the church has been ""caricatured as being anti-gay."" The hard reality that Cardinal Dolan and all Christians need to face up to is that the Catholic Church along with every other church whether Orthodox, Protestant or Catholic has been horrifically, persistently and vehemently anti-gay for almost all of its history.

This is a fact. There is no 'caricature' needed.

The Church has inspired deep hatred of the LGBT community, and the fact that many of us who are LGBT still feel called to participate in the Church is perhaps the most powerful testimony to the presence of Christ that one can find in the world today.

But for one to deny that the Church is anti-gay in one sentence and then to maintain a stance against gay marriage in the next adds injury to insult. Let's just be very clear here -- if you are against marriage equality you are anti-gay.

Done.

You can not say you are supportive of me as a gay man, and then say but you are against my marriage to my partner Brad. It just doesn't work that way. If you are against gay marriage you are against gay married people. In the future, if you want to know if your actions or words are anti-gay -- try asking a gay person. We'll be glad to let you know.

The truth is, the Catholic Church, along with most religious traditions will eventually have to change their positions on LGBT people. It will take a long, long time. I certainly don't expect to live to see the Catholic Church hierarchy change official dogma on the issue.

But I have faith that they will. And then a simple 'we're sorry' would be appreciated.

The 61-57 vote for a four-year pilot program was cheered by supporters who say the House has long been the highest hurdle for legalization; the Senate has previously passed similar legislation and Gov. Pat Quinn said Wednesday he was “open-minded” about the proposal.

Illinois would become the 19th state to legalize medical marijuana and proponents say it would be the most restrictive program in the country, with conditions on qualifying illnesses, physician approval and production of the drug.

“Ladies and gentlemen, this is not about getting high, it’s not about dope, it’s not about what our mothers told us when we went to college,” said Rep. Lou Lang, D-Skokie, the chief sponsor. “This is about providing a product at no expense to the taxpayers to provide better health care to people who desperately need this product.”

National opinion polls have suggested Americans are increasingly comfortable with marijuana for medical use, but opponents pointed out that many in law enforcement and medicine, as well as the federal government, are not on board.

“This bill is absolutely a wrong piece of legislation,” said Republican Rep. Jim Sacia, a former FBI agent from Pecatonica who added that many Illinois sheriffs oppose the proposal.

Lang implored fence-sitting lawmakers to stop forcing people who need relief into “some back alley” to score their pot, saying “we’re turning granny into a criminal.”

The most persuasive arguments may have been those from lawmakers who related personal stories.

With her voice breaking, Rep. JoAnn Osmond, R-Antioch, told colleagues she opposed the measure in the past but changed her mind because of an ill friend and his wife who spent time at Osmond’s home while the man battled chronic pain tied to complications from cancer. Osmond wouldn’t let him use marijuana in her house. Now, two years since his death, she said she wonders about her decision because he was in a daze from a painkiller prescription that “made him extremely sick, very sick.”

North Side Democratic Rep. Kelly Cassidy told colleagues the story of a brother-in-law who suffers from terminal cancer and “would not be with us if not for making use of cannabis.” Pain pills were “sucking the life out of him,” but now he and her sister can “enjoy what will be his last days,” she said.

“My sister and my brother-in-law, who I love dearly, are able to make the best of an absolutely horrific situation as a result of this product,” Cassidy said.

Rep. Deb Mell, D-Chicago, said she has taken medication for pain since having an August mastectomy and can relate to the suffering. “There's a real panic that comes in because it's like, 'I can't live with this pain, but I can't keep taking these pills,’” she said.

Under the bill, an individual could be prescribed no more than 2.5 ounces of marijuana over two weeks. A doctor who prescribes marijuana must have had a prior and ongoing relationship with the patient.

Patients would have to buy the marijuana from one of 60 dispensing centers throughout the state rather than be allowed to grow their own. Workers at dispensing centers would undergo criminal background checks, the stores would be under around-the-clock camera surveillance, and users would carry cards that indicate how much they had purchased to prevent stockpiling.

Marijuana would be grown inside 22 cultivation centers registered with the Illinois Department of Agriculture.

A previous version of the legislation had allowed patients to grow their own, but that provision was removed to make the bill more restrictive, said Sen. Bill Haine, D-Alton, who sponsored similar legislation that passed the Senate in 2009 and will be the lead sponsor of the current measure.

The bill also says a person who uses medical marijuana would be required to take a field sobriety test if police pulled over a car. Refusal would lead to a one-year driver’s license suspension and revocation of the medical marijuana privilege, Haine said.

Currently, field sobriety tests in police stops for driving under the influence of marijuana generally can be inadmissible in court cases. The legislation now would allow field sobriety tests to be admissible as evidence at trial in a case of driving under the influence of marijuana, Haine said.

Haine acknowledged “there is a question as to how much marijuana impairs a driver.” Current Illinois law says a driver with a trace of marijuana in his system can be convicted of driving under the influence.

Haine, a former Madison County state’s attorney, dismissed the argument that “this can be abused, it’s a gateway drug. The people who are using it, many of them are terminal. I don’t know what gateway they’re talking about.”

The bill goes to the Senate, where President John Cullerton, D-Chicago, supported the previous medical pot bill that passed the upper chamber in 2009. The House vote came only hours after Quinn said he was impressed by the story of an injured military veteran who maintained marijuana provided him relief from war wounds.

Outside the capital, some opponents to the bill expressed their dismay.

“It’s really, strongly unfortunate,” said Dr. Eric A. Voth, a Topeka, Kan., physician who is chairman of the Institute on Global Drug Policy. He said he’s watched pro-marijuana lobbying groups work the medical marijuana angle for years.

“I think it’s unfortunate that Illinois fell into their clutches,” Voth said.

Voth’s biggest concern, echoed by John Kennedy, the executive director of the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police, is that the law would allow medical marijuana to bypass FDA regulation, which could jeopardize consumers, he said."

The initiatives come amid a growing national awareness of sexual assault in the military. Critics, especially in Congress, have questioned how the armed services handle these cases. Under one legislative proposal, sexual assault cases would be handled by an independent military legal authority, removing commanders from overseeing sexual assault cases within their units.

One new rule under consideration by Mr. Hagel would expand the role that victims have throughout the court-martial process, including the sentencing phase. In a handful of cases that have been the focus of sharp Congressional rebuke, senior commanders have overturned convictions of their subordinates in sexual assault cases.

Another rule would require that all reports of sexual assault filed by service personnel who choose to seek legal remedies be immediately brought to the attention of the first general or admiral in the chain of command of that organization. This, officials said, would guarantee accelerated senior-level supervision and rapid corrective action."

While Davis filibuster attempt ended shortly before midnight, it wasn't until 3 a.m. that Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst declared the bill dead and the special session over.

Opponents of the bill sit in the gallery holding hangers.

Davis spoke for nearly 11 hours. According to her office, Davis had a snack and a small amount of water before beginning. She was not allowed to lean or take a bathroom break.

Davis wore a pair of pink tennis shoes in place of her dress shoes in preparation for hours of speaking.

Davis filibuster took place in an near empty Senate floor. The bill she was fighting would have banned abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and force many clinics to upgrade their facilities and be classified as ambulatory surgical centers.

Members of the gallery react as Davis is called for her third and final violation, ending the filibuster. The reaction in the gallery grew so intense that it drowned out the proceedings, preventing lawmakers from completing their vote by the official end of the session -- killing the bill.

Sen. Wendy Davis attempted to block a Texas abortion bill that would have greatly restricted abortions in the state, by attempting a 13-hour filibuster. The attempt fell short by about three hours when the chairman ruled she had gone off topic.

Story highlights NEW: ""I underestimated how difficult it would be,"" Davis says The filibuster of Texas Sen. Wendy Davis became a viral sensation The White House took notice of her abortion rights stand Critics say the bill would have shut most of the state's abortion clinics

(CNN) —

A day after a filibuster and a raucous crowd in the state Capitol foiled passage of a bill that would have imposed strict new regulations on abortion in Texas, Gov. Rick Perry vowed Wednesday to try again.

Perry said the Legislature would convene July 1 in special session to take up the abortion bill, which was declared dead before dawn Wednesday. The bill failed after a night of drama in Austin during which a lone lawmaker talked for more than 10 hours in an attempt to run out the clock on a special session.

Chants of “shame! shame! shame!” from spectators who had filled the building drowned out the efforts of Republican lawmakers as they tried to pass it minutes before midnight.

“We will not allow the breakdown of decorum and decency to prevent us from doing what the people of this state hired us to do,” Perry said in a statement calling lawmakers back into another special session. Texans “value life and want to protect women and the unborn,” he said.

Perry’s announcement came a day before he was to address the National Right to Life convention in Dallas on Thursday.

Opinion: The truth about the Texas filibuster and abortion

And it came on a day when abortion rights advocates found a new hero in state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth.

Though Republicans control the state Senate, Davis tried to block the abortion bill by attempting a 13-hour filibuster Tuesday.

“I underestimated how difficult it would be – both physically and mentally,” Davis told CNN’s “AC360” on Wednesday. “About two hours in, I realized I was in for a long day. My back started hurting pretty early on and began to really hurt as the hours ticked by.”

But, she said, the energy from the packed gallery “kept me going throughout the day.”

Davis fell short of her goal by less than three hours when the chair ruled she had gone off topic. The gallery erupted in boos. Her fellow Democrats stalled for time with procedural tactics.

And as the clock wound down, opponents of the bill drowned out proceedings on the floor, preventing lawmakers from completing a vote in time to get it passed.

At 3 a.m., Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst stepped to the Senate floor to declare the bill dead and the special session over.

Texas parents agree not to pressure teen to have abortion

“We empowered the voice of people in Texas and people who wanted to stand against this intrusion, this big government intrusion, into their personal lives,” Davis said Wednesday night.

Even if the bill winds up passing in the next special session, the reaction will not be split along partisan lines, she predicted. “It’s a reaction coming from Republicans, independents and Democrats alike, which is saying: Governor Perry, Lieutenant Governor Dewhurst, stay out of my private decision-making.”

The bill would have banned most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and tightened standards on abortion clinics and the doctors who work at them. Critics said the measure would have shut most of the abortion clinics in Texas.

“He (Perry) lost this fight in regular session, and even after they broke the rules he and his allies lost again in front of the entire country last night,” said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a statement.

“They tried every trick in the book, blocking testimony from the very women whose lives would be affected, voting in the middle of the night, shutting down the debate — they couldn’t get this done because Texans would not let them.”

Wearing pink sneakers, Davis, 50, took to the floor of the chamber late Tuesday morning to criticize the bill. Rules called for her to stand, unaided, until midnight, for the filibuster to succeed.

She was not allowed to sit down, lean or take a bathroom break, and she was allowed three warnings before the Senate was to be allowed to vote on whether to stop the filibuster.

The senator spent much of the time reading testimony and messages from women decrying the bill and recounting the struggles they, their friends or relatives faced before birth control and abortion were legalized.

“Women realize that these bills will not protect their health,” she said. “They will only reduce their access to abortion providers and limit their ability to make their own family-planning decisions.”

Early in the diatribe, her comments were ruled off topic and she was given her first warning.

During the evening, a fellow senator helped Davis put on a back brace, which was ruled to have violated filibuster rules, and she got her second warning.

Finally, at about 10 p.m., Davis talked about the abortion pill, RU486, and the chairman ruled again that her comments were off topic.

But a member of the Senate then moved that the ruling be appealed, and the status of the ruling was in doubt.

The final hours of the session were marked by confusing parliamentary maneuvers until Sen. Leticia Van de Putte stepped to the microphone, ending the debate.

“At what point must a female senator raise her hand or her voice to be recognized over the male colleagues in the room?” the Democratic senator asked after she had been ignored.

At 15 minutes before midnight, the gallery erupted in applause and chants of “Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!”

As the session ended, Davis waded into the crowd of supporters and praised them as “the people who truly made this happen.”

Texas Right to Life blamed “the angry mob of protesters in the Senate gallery” for the failure of the bill to pass.

“Ultimately, we should be encouraged that we had the votes and that so many came to support the bill,” the anti-abortion group said on its website. “We will continue to work to pass Pro-Life legislation that protects women and saves lives in Texas.”

The last stand

Davis’ stand captivated abortion rights advocates from coast to coast, prompting the hashtag #standwithwendy on Twitter.

The White House took notice.

“Something special is happening in Austin tonight,” said a post on President Barack Obama’s official Twitter account. The account is run by Organizing for Action, a nonprofit group established to support the president’s legislative agenda.

A post by Aimee Parker of Los Angeles said: “I’m in absolute awe of you, @WendyDavisTexas. Thank you for your passion, perseverance and unparalleled badassery.”

English comedian Ricky Gervais weighed in as well.

“Whatever the outcome, @WendyDavisTexas efforts entered her into the pantheon of American heroes tonight.”

Heady times for Davis, who was first elected to the Texas Senate in 2008, defeating a longtime Republican incumbent to do so.

Last year, she staged a filibuster to force a special session in an attempt to stop $5 billion in cuts to Texas public schools, according to her website.

Davis, who became a single mother at age 19, went on to graduate with honors from Harvard Law School, it says.

Her filibuster was no record. In 1977, Sen. Bill Meier staged a 43-hour marathon.

The special session ends with irony, Twitter user Cody Beckner said, echoing the governor’s own words.

“‘In Texas, we value all life,’ Gov. Perry TX. Said on the eve of the state’s 500th execution.”

In addition, a majority lacks trust in the federal government, and an increasing number of people say it’s too big.

These are just some of the findings of a Fox News poll released Wednesday.

Sixty-two percent of voters say the government secretly collecting the phone records of millions of Americans is an “unacceptable and alarming invasion of privacy rights.”

That’s nearly twice as many as think it’s an “acceptable government action to help prevent terrorism” (32 percent).

Republicans (by 74-18 percent) and independents (by 67-26 percent) think the NSA surveillance of Americans is unacceptable. Democrats split: 48 percent say it’s acceptable, while 46 percent say unacceptable.

Views are similar on the U.S. Department of Justice monitoring certain reporters as part of its leak investigation. By a 34 percentage-point margin, more voters think the government’s seizure of journalists’ records was mainly done for political reasons (63 percent) as opposed to national security reasons (29 percent).

The Justice Department secretly obtained phone records and emails from some news organizations that had broken stories based on government leaks.

In general, when asked how much “trust and confidence” they have in the federal government, 37 percent of voters say they have a great deal (5 percent) or a fair amount (32 percent). Sixty-three percent say they have not much confidence (41 percent) or none at all (22 percent).

Meanwhile, the portion of voters saying the federal government is too big is growing: 64 percent feel that way, up from 56 percent in 2009. That’s more than double the number who feel government is the right size (29 percent).

The NSA and Justice Department programs have more voters thinking the president has broken his promise to lead “the most open and transparent administration ever.”

The poll finds 35 percent think the Obama administration has been less open and transparent than previous administrations. That’s up 10 points since last year when 25 percent felt that way (June 2012). The change comes mainly from an increase in the number of Republicans (+16 points) and independents (+14 points) saying the White House is less transparent.

At the same time the number of voters believing the administration is more open and transparent has dropped to 24 percent down from 32 percent a year ago. This shift comes more from an across-the-board decline, as fewer independents (-14 points), Democrats (-8 points) and Republicans (-6 points) say this White House is more open than others.

The largest portion of voters -- 39 percent -- says the transparency of this White House is about the same as previous administrations. And that’s unchanged from 39 percent last June.

There is good news in the poll on the economy: 18 percent of voters say the economy is in excellent or good shape, which is double the 9 percent who felt that way in January.

In addition, the number saying the country is in a recession has dropped 14 points: 27 percent today, down from 41 percent a year ago (June 2012).

Those numbers, however, haven’t boosted President Obama’s job performance rating.

Obama’s current 44 percent approval rating is the lowest he’s received in more than a year. Some 45 percent of voters approved last month and 47 percent approved in January.

Opinions are split over whether Obama is honest and trustworthy as equal numbers -- 48 percent -- say yes and no. In May, 49 percent of voters said Obama was honest, and 51 percent said so last year (July 2012). His highest honesty rating was 73 percent in April 2009.

The Fox News poll is based on landline and cell phone interviews with 1,019 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from June 9 to June 11. The full poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points."

Teens' Facebook posts monitored by school district,"GLENDALE, Calif. (AP) - A Southern California school district is trying to stop cyberbullying and a host of other teenage ills by monitoring the public posts students make on social media outlets in a program that has stirred debate about what privacy rights teenage students have when they fire up their smartphones.



Glendale Unified School District hired Geo Listening last year to track posts by its 14,000 or so middle and high school students. The district approached the Hermosa Beach-based company in hopes of curtailing online bullying, drug use and other problems after two area teenagers committed suicide last year, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.

The company expects to be monitoring about 3,000 schools worldwide by the end of the year, said its founder, Chris Frydrych.

In Southern California, the district is paying $40,500 to Geo Listening, and in exchange, the company's computers scour public posts by students on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, blogs and other sites. Analysts are alerted to terms that suggest suicidal thoughts, bullying, vandalism and even the use of obscenities, among other things. When they find posts they think should spur an intervention or anything that violates schools' student codes of conduct, the company alerts the campus.

The Glendale district began a pilot program to monitor students online last year at its three high schools, Glendale, Hoover and Crescenta Valley.

""We think it's been working very well,"" said the district's superintendent, Dick Sheehan. ""It's designed around student safety and making sure kids are protected.""

Some students say they are bothered by the monitoring, even if it's intended to help them.

""We all know social media is not a private place, not really a safe place,"" said Young Cho, 16, a junior at Hoover High. ""But it's not the same as being in school. It's students' expression of their own thoughts and feelings to their friends. For the school to intrude in that area — I understand they can do it, but I don't think it's right.""

The company does not have a list of students' names and instead uses ""deductive reasoning"" to link public accounts to students, Frydrych said. It also only looks at public postings.

Brendan Hamme, an attorney with the Southern California branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the district is walking a fine line with its social media surveillance.

The program is ""sweeping and far afield of what is necessary to ensure student safety,"" he said.

Daily reports to school administrators include a screen capture of the flagged posts, along with details of whether they were made on or off campus, the time and date, the user's name, if available, and a description of why the post caught the attention of analysts, Frydrych said.

It's up to administrators to decide to act and, so far, no students have been disciplined because of a post discovered under the pilot program, Sheehan said."

Lerner used to oversee the IRS division that targeted groups for additional scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status. At a May 22 hearing, she invoked her right not to answer lawmakers' questions after declaring in an opening statement that she had done nothing wrong.

Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted along party lines Friday morning, with 22 Republicans saying she waived the Fifth and 17 Democrats arguing she did not. Lerner remains under subpoena, and the committee believes it could bring the long-time IRS official back and compel her to testify.

Late Friday, her attorney, William Taylor, issued a statement saying, ""It is too bad that an issue like this gets put to a vote in a highly polarized forum. A party line vote does ‎not affect anyone's constitutional rights and this one does not affect Ms. Lerner's.

""Her rights under the constitution are no different now than they were when she asserted them.""

More On This...

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the committee, said at the opening of Friday's meeting that ""I believe Lois Lerner waived her Fifth Amendment privileges.""

""She did so when she delivered an opening statement,"" Issa said.

Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., reiterated Issa's argument, delivering a fiery speech about Lerner's attempt to protect herself under the Fifth.

Gowdy said Lerner made nine separate assertions, with the advice of counsel, and then authenticated a document.

""That's not how the Fifth Amendment works,"" Gowdy said. ""You're not allowed to just say your side of the story ... She could have sat there and said nothing.""

Democrats, meanwhile, like Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., challenged Gowdy's argument, calling attempts to block Lerner's invoking of the Fifth Amendment ""an egregious abuse of power that tramples the Constitution and serves no valid legislative purpose.""

Connolly said that ""the majority has brought us to a point where we risk allowing this committee to be transformed into a Star Chamber proceeding that establishes future Legislative Branch precedent where any chairman -- whether a Democrat or a Republican -- is free to compel an American invoking their constitutional right against self-incrimination to physically appear before the Committee for no other reason than to be pilloried, delayed, embarrassed, and burdened into unknowingly, unintentionally, and ironically, forfeiting the very sacred constitutional right that is intended to protect every American against forced self-incrimination by the government.""

""You may make a small-term political gain,"" Connolly warned Republicans, but ""at a long-term political cost.""

The committee is scheduled to vote Friday on whether Lerner waived her Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions by making an opening statement.

Legal scholars have differed in their views on the committee's case against Lerner, who the IRS has placed on administrative leave.

Lerner's lawyer, William Taylor, said he disagreed with the committee's claim.

""There was nothing voluntary about her statement,"" he said in a statement. ""She had informed (the) committee that she would invoke and requested to be excused and (the) committee ordered her to appear and invoke her rights in public.

""It went so far as to serve a subpoena on her to assure that she would be compelled to attend, unlike other witnesses who appeared voluntarily. In any event, protesting your innocence and invoking the right not to answer questions, which is what she did, is not a waiver.""

Either way, it is a tale of central Alabama, a region dotted with churches and youth groups.

“He owns the stage when he’s on it,” said Blane Jett, 22, who first attended one of Mr. Pitt’s events when he was in high school. “He’s got the anointing of God on him, and no one else can do it like him.”

Mr. Pitt and his organization, Whosoever Ministries, have stood apart from others in the way they have regularly drawn crowds of more than 5,000. He brought a showman’s flair to the stage, where he would share his own story of sin and redemption with ceaseless exuberance and an array of effects that rivaled those at rock concerts.

His story was a gripping one: After a troubled college stint, a drug overdose and a pivotal meeting with his parents in the family’s basement, Mr. Pitt was moved to become a preacher and began inviting people to his home in 2004. He called his events the Basement.

“He is so real,” said Shelby Jackson, who first encountered Mr. Pitt’s messages on a DVD seven years ago. “He’s not afraid to share his heart and his struggles with the Lord.”"

The rules are different, depending on who you are.","First lady Michelle Obama speaks about the nation's libraries and museums before handing out the 2013 National Medals for Museum and Library Service to recipients in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, May 8, 2013. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)

The first rule of handling a heckler: Don’t get mad. Don’t try to get even. Get smart. Give better than you’ve so rudely gotten.

Michelle Obama may have forgotten the basics when confronted with every public speaker’s nightmare Tuesday night. A determined heckler interrupted the first lady’s talk at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser at a home in Washington, haranguing her over her husband’s failure to sign an anti-discrimination order on behalf of gays and lesbians.

Obama at first seemed flummoxed by the interloper. And then, in a rare display of public peeve, she turned stern and combative. Moving away from the lectern and toward the heckler, she threw down a challenge. “One of the things I don’t do well is this,” she said, referring to the disruption. “Do you understand?” She said the protester could “listen to me, or you can take the mike, but I’m leaving. You all decide. You have one choice.”

As comebacks go, it wasn’t one of the classics, such as the surefire response of every nightclub comic to the blowhard in the third row: “I was the same way when I had my first drink, too.”

Then again, the rules of engagement between hecklers and speakers vary by time, place and position. Comedians are expected to whip out a withering retort; almost all have a few anti-heckler lines stored and ready for deployment. Sports fans, too, are entitled to heckle opposing players and to second-guess the refs.

Michelle Obama is only the latest political figure to face an impassioned heckler. From Reagan to Romney, and Clinton to Christie we look at how politicians have handled the uninvited interlocutors. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

Politicians and public figures, meanwhile, fire back at their own peril.

Confronted by a heckler who urged him to raise taxes on corporations, Mitt Romney replied that they were part of his no-new-taxes pledge during a campaign stop in Iowa in 2011. “Corporations are people, my friend,” he declared, thereby providing a soundbite that reinforced his opponents’ portrayal of him as a friend of the wealthy.

On the other hand, George W. Bush defused an international incident in 2008 when an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at him and shouted, “This is a farewell kiss, you dog.” Bush’s amused response: “All I can report is it is a size 10.”

Unlike first ladies, seasoned politicians have faced hecklers many times and have strategies for dealing with them, says Chris Lehane, a Democratic political consultant. A humorous response is risky, he says, because it can come off as making light of a serious issue (“The middle of a speech is not the time to get in touch with your inner Seinfeld,” he says). Getting angry doesn’t play well, either; it makes a pol seem rattled and thin skinned.

Better, says Lehane, an advisor to President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, was Gore’s “standard operating procedure” for dispatching loudmouths.

When interrupted, Gore would stop, listen a moment, and say, “‘the First Amendment’s a great thing, isn’t it? Let’s hear it for the First Amendment!’ The crowd’s roar would drown out the heckler, and then he’d continue: ‘Now, what I’m really here to talk about is [fill in the blank]. People have travelled a long way to hear this. My staff would be glad to have a conversation with you about the issue you’ve raised.’ That was the signal to the staff to hustle the guy out.”

According to Keith Fields, a comedian and magician, one of the most effective heckler-stoppers is to respond by saying, “Pardon me?”

“It puts the spotlight on the heckler, and they usually don’t know what to do next,” says Fields, the author of “How to Handle Hecklers.” “A heckler is a voice from the dark. If you shine a light on them, you take away their [anonymity]. They’re not good at thinking on their feet.”

Good comics know they have to size up a heckler quickly and to tailor their comeback appropriately, Fields says. Is the person drunk or angry? Or just a jerk? Male or female? A poorly conceived putdown can turn an audience’s natural sympathy for the performer against him. Witness the fate of former “Seinfeld” star Michael Richards, whose n-word-laden rant in response to a heckler in 2006 buried his career.

When in doubt, said Fields, there’s always a one-size-fits-all reply: “I’m sorry, I don’t speak alcoholic.”

As hecklers go, Robin Ficker was practically a pro. The Bethesda attorney and frequent political candidate terrorized visiting NBA teams at Washington Bullets and Wizards home games for years by taunting them from a seat behind the opposing bench. Ficker wasn’t subtle; his booming voice could be heard in the cheap seats.

Ficker was so obnoxious — or effective, depending on your perspective — that the NBA passed a rule outlawing fans from “interfering” with communications between players and coaches during timeouts.

Most of the players he taunted simply ignored him, or pretended to, Ficker says. But a few responded. Hall of Famer Charles Barkley always talked back. Once, Ficker tried picking on Barkley’s supposed political ambitions, yelling, “Charles, before I vote for you, I want to know what your views are about the economy, NAFTA and health care.”

Replied Barkley, “I do have a view about the death penalty. They should use it on you.”

Ficker recommends that Michelle Obama use a little humor or do some “role playing” to prepare for the next heckler she faces.

But even a veteran heckler like Ficker has only limited sympathy for the woman who interrupted the first lady. “It wasn’t very polite to the wife of the leader of the country,” he said. “I understand that many people feel the leaders of this country aren’t listening to them, but this woman’s timing was very poor.”

Yes, speakers sometimes look bad dealing with hecklers. But hecklers usually look worse.

The most famous heckle in recent years may have been the outbursts of Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), who twice shouted, “You lie!” during President Obama’s speech to Congress about health-care reform in 2009.

The impromptu commentary brought national and international attention to Wilson and supercharged his campaign fundraising. But it also was widely condemned as unacceptable by members of Congress from both parties.

In the end, Wilson did what most hecklers never do: He apologized for his behavior."

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) echoed Collins on ""Fox News Sunday."" The House Intelligence Committee chairman called for an external investigation into the matter, with congressional oversight.

""This should send a chill up your spine. This is something we cannot let stand. It needs to have a full investigation,"" Rogers said.

An inspector general's report set to be released this week says IRS officials knew about the targeting of conservative groups as early as 2011, months before the agency's commissioner told Congress it wasn't taking place.

""I just don't buy that this was a couple of rogue IRS employees,"" Collins said. ""After all, groups with 'progressive' in their names were not targeted similarly. There is the evidence that higher level supervisors were aware of this. And the IRS was not forthcoming in telling Congress about the problem.""

Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) adopted a different tone. He said on ""Fox News Sunday"" the matter is ""definitely worth looking into,"" but made clear that he is ""not going to leap to conclusions based on initial reports."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said on NBC News's ""Meet The Press"" that she is ""concerned"" about the matter and that lawmakers ""have to take a good look at it.""

The soon-to-be-released inspector general's report is sure to raise questions about the timing of the IRS's Friday apology. The report was prepared for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which requested an audit in 2011, as some conservative groups were voicing concerns.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), the chairman of the Oversight Committee, said that the IRS's apology doesn't appear to be forthright.

""One of the most offensive parts is my committee ... instigated this investigation, got the IG to do the investigation. Before the IG's report comes to the public or to Congress as required by law, it's leaked by the IRS to try to spin the output. This mea culpa's not an honest one,"" Issa said on ""Meet The Press.""

Issa said lawmakers need to review the report to ensure the IRS's targeting of certain groups doesn't happen again.

""This is something you have to institute changes to make sure it doesn't happen again. There has to be accountability for the people who did it. And quite frankly, up until a few days ago, there's got to be accountability for people who are telling lies about it being done,"" he said.

Jesse Jackson Jr. was charged in federal court Friday with conspiring to use campaign funds for personal use -- in an alleged $750,000 spending spree that included purchases of a gold-plated Rolex and pricey children's furniture.

It had been expected that a plea agreement would be entered into court Friday, but that agreement is apparently still pending.

Instead, federal prosecutors charged Jackson Friday with conspiracy. Prosecutors separately charged his wife Sandi with filing false federal tax returns, but according to her attorney she has reached a plea agreement.

In a statement, the former Illinois Democratic congressman said he offers ""no excuses.""

""Over the course of my life I have come to realize that none of us are immune from our share of shortcomings and human frailties,"" he said. ""Still I offer no excuses for my conduct, and I fully accept my responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes I have made.""

He continued: ""To that end I want to offer my sincerest apologies to my family, my friends and all of my supporters for my errors in judgment and while my journey is not yet complete, it is my hope that I am remembered for the things that I did right.""

The charging document accused Jackson and an unnamed co-conspirator of submitting false campaign finance reports ""to conceal their conversion of approximately $750,000 from the campaign for their personal benefit.""

Prosecutors claim Jackson and the co-conspirator used more than $580,000 of that to pay off credit card bills for their purchases. They claim the purchases included a more than $43,000 ""gold-plated men's Rolex watch"" and nearly $10,000 worth of ""children's furniture,"" as well as $5,000 of ""fur capes and parkas.""

The document also called for Jackson to hand over a slew of expensive memorabilia items if found guilty, including Bruce Lee and Michael Jackson memorabilia.

The penalty for Jackson is a maximum of five years in jail and $250,000 in fines. For his wife, the maximum is three years and $100,000 in fines.

Fox News is told that the former congressman, expected to be in Washington next week when he goes to court, is ""extremely depressed"" and ""broken-hearted."" A source said he feels ""like he's losing everything"" and is trying to figure out how to provide for his family.

Jackson resigned last November shortly after being reelected to the House. The son of civil rights leader Jesse Jackson Sr. had been treated for bipolar disorder, but also has been the subject of an ongoing federal investigation over campaign funds.

The Chicago Sun-Times earlier reported that the probe had split into two separate investigations, with one into Jackson's wife Sandi. Sandi recently resigned as a Chicago city alderman.

The filing Friday is a blow for a public figure who was once considered a rising star.

Jesse Jackson Jr. first took office in 1995 after winning a special election and began his career in Washington with a star power and pedigree that set him apart from his hundreds of other House colleagues.

But despite high expectations, he largely went unnoticed as a policymaker. Instead, he gained a reputation for quixotic pursuits such as trying to impeach President George W. Bush and push through constitutional amendments that had no chance.

Jackson, 47, disappeared in June, and it was later revealed that he was being treated at the Mayo Clinic for bipolar disorder and gastrointestinal issues. He returned to his Washington home in September but went back to the clinic the next month.

Howley connects the dots surrounding a number of recent leaks coming of out CBS News about the fate of its award-winning investigative reporter, Sharyl Attkisson.

From the beginning, Attkisson has been one of the few mainstream journalists willing to dig into the September 11 terror attack in Libya, and the Administration’s response to it. Fearing the story might lead exactly where it did yesterday with Jonathan Karl’s bombshell report, the mainstream media has poured most if its energy into wishing the story away or playing Palace Guard for the White House.

Attkisson’s dogged pursuit of the truth has not only pitted her against a media desperate to protect Obama, but also, apparently, against her bosses at CBS News, one of whom is the brother of a top Obama official.

Moreover, CBS News president David Rhoades is not only the brother of President Obama’s national security advisor, Ben Rhodes, but ABC News reports that Ben Rhodes was very much involved in the editing of the now-infamous CIA talking points.

So…

1. According to ABC News, Obama’s national security advisor Ben Rhodes was deeply involved in the editing of the CIA talking points.

2. These same CIA talking points are central to what many believe is a White House coverup.

3. Ben Rhodes is the brother of CBS News president David Rhodes.

4. At CBS News, Sharyl Attkisson is one of the only mainstream media journalists with the dogged determination and moral courage to demand the truth about the White House’s involvement in the CIA talking points.

5. For months now reports have surfaced that Attkisson’s bosses are unhappy with her, that she has trouble getting her Libya stories on the air, and that she’s being accused of engaging in “advocacy.”

He Was Previously Senior Editor At National Review', 'Lives In Washington']",Goldberg: A petty decision by Obama,"It’s official. President Obama has named former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) as his nominee for secretary of Defense. Hence, we may be in store for the worst Defense secretary nomination fight since George H.W. Bush’s failed appointment of Sen. John Tower (R-Texas) more than 20 years ago.

The interesting question is, why? Why waste the political capital? Why pass over more qualified candidates who would sail through confirmation, including Michele Flournoy — who’d be the first female Defense secretary?

The most ridiculous answer is among the mainstream media’s favorites: bipartisanship. According to Politico, the choice “appeals to Obama’s bipartisan spirit.” The Washington Post, in a front-page news story, says that a “successful nomination of Hagel would add a well-known Republican to the president’s second-term Cabinet at a time when he is looking to better bridge the partisan divide, particularly after a bitter election campaign.”

What is particularly bizarre about this talking point is that it often appears in articles that go on to talk about how tough and grueling the nomination battle will be thanks to strong Republican opposition. So which is it? Is it a bridge across the partisan divide? Or is it an “in-your-face” nomination (South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham’s words) aimed at eliciting a fight with Republicans?

Advertisement

At least from the perspective of nearly everyone on the right, it’s the latter. Whether it’s payback for the scuttled non-nomination of Susan Rice to be secretary of State or whether it’s simply of a piece with Obama’s efforts to divide and conquer the GOP that were on display throughout the “fiscal cliff” negotiations, the consensus in much of conservative Washington is that Obama is making this nomination at least in part out of spite.

Indeed, that’s one major reason Hagel has so many unlikely friends these days. Hagel — never overburdened with too heavy a reputation for insight, knowledge or humility — is loathed, with ample justification, by many foreign-policy hawks, Israel supporters and neocons (those are overlapping but hardly synonymous groups, by the way). He is arguably the most prominent opponent of sanctions on bad actors in the Middle East. He’s heaped scorn on those who’d take a hard line with Iran. His geopolitical acumen is of the sort that fails to shine even in the comment sections on blogs. The Iraq war, for example, was according to Hagel a war for oil.

And Hagel’s views on Israel are, to be generous, hard to reconcile with those of the man who successfully campaigned for president just a couple of months ago as a staunch friend of that country. Even if Hagel’s gaffe about the perfidious influence of the domestic “Jewish lobby” was accidental, his coolness to Israel is hard to dispute. For instance, when Palestinian suicide bombers were tearing the country apart in 2002, Hagel insisted in an OpEd article that this was the time for Israel to “take steps to show its commitment to peace.”

For some, the thinking seems to be that if the Hagel nomination is a thumb in the eye of the neocon crowd, it must be worth it. David Greenberg writes in the New Republic that many “liberals are bending over backward to praise Hagel, in effect saying they would prefer an archconservative male mediocrity to a liberal female rising star.” Why? Because punishing Hagel’s enemies is worth a potentially lousy Defense secretary.

This spirit results in some really batty arguments for Hagel’s confirmation. For instance, New York Times columnist Roger Cohen writes that the “chief” reason Hagel should be confirmed is that doing so “will provoke a serious debate on what constitutes real friendship toward Israel.” Even if you agree with Cohen’s barmy views of geopolitical “friendship,” Hagel’s got real problems if this is the best case for his nomination.

The Defense Department faces imminent cuts, Chinese and Russian nationalism are ascendant, the Middle East is becoming even more destabilized and theocratic, and we’re still at war in Afghanistan, but Hagel’s chief qualification is that he’ll be a great conversation starter? Wow.

The coming nomination fight will undoubtedly focus on the strength of the case against Hagel. But the real indictment of Obama’s pick is the weakness of the case for Hagel — and the pettiness of the pick in the first place.

As loyal as its viewers are, there are always wary network executives and even exhausted writers and producers who'd just as soon let it go. It's a good policy, after all, to leave your audience wanting more.

Clinton's finale could hardly have been more dramatic. After falling ill with a stomach virus in early December, she fainted, suffered a concussion and landed in a hospital with a blood clot between her brain and skull. Meanwhile, her detractors drummed up conspiracy theories about ""Benghazi fever,"" and her supporters had a moment of genuine fear that Clinton might not be around to follow the script that so many have been writing for her over the last several years.

That script goes something like this: Clinton will take a long, much-deserved vacation, then assume a low-key schedule of advocacy work and lucrative speaking engagements. She'll exercise, sleep more and eat better.

""I would like to see whether I can get untired,"" she said in November.

Her hair will finally find the sweet spot between the Stepford-esque helmet head of the campaign trail and the current granny-cum-Eileen-Fisher-model look. She might even, heaven forfend, indulge in some surgically assisted ""freshening up.""

And then in late 2014, a more vibrant, less jowly Clinton will return to the spotlight and announce her candidacy for president.

It'll be a win-win. Voters who supported Clinton in 2008 will be thrilled in a better-late-than-never kind of way. Voters who were so besotted with Barack Obama that they turned on Clinton as if canceling plans with an old friend in favor of a hot date will be thrilled in an all's-right-with-the-universe kind of way.

When it comes to historic elections, 2008 was just what most Democrats wanted. First the exciting young black guy, then the somewhat less exciting but eminently reliable old white lady. It was as if liberal voters promised to eat their vegetables if they could just have dessert first.

But as Clinton's health scare reminded us, vegetables are perishable. Clinton is 65 and presumably healthy, but she cannot be presumed to maintain her past and current energy levels into her 70s. Moreover, as she has said numerous times, she has no plans to seek the presidency in 2016. She has instead joked that maybe she'll host a decorating show.

Nonetheless, Clinton's fans are even now closing their eyes and imagining her in the Oval Office. And the idea that she may never get there — by choice, defeat or some kind of health or personal circumstance — remains unthinkable, even devastating. To put another woman in the job, even one that might better uphold the liberal principles that made Clinton's supporters love her in the first place (someone like, say, Elizabeth Warren), would be a kind of betrayal, not to mention a long shot.

But for Clinton voters, there's something even more devastating than that: admitting that 2008 was their one and only chance, and they missed it.

During the 2008 Democratic primary, when support shifted from Clinton to Obama, the rationale was that he stood a better chance of winning. Clinton was too polarizing — too Clintonesque. But there was another rationale: the less-discussed yet widely held belief that an Obama presidency today would in no way preclude a Clinton presidency tomorrow.

Amid the rancor of that primary, the question for lots of Democrats wasn't ""Which one do we want?"" but ""Which one goes first?"" It wasn't enough to get a candidate elected; they wanted a lock on the successor, too.

But in real life, unlike in a script, the gun that appears in the first act isn't guaranteed to go off in the third. Voters may have been willing to wait for a Clinton presidency, but that doesn't mean she's going to wait for them.

And who could blame her? If her political career were a television drama, it would be in something like its 20th season now. Maybe it's time her fans stopped demanding more episodes. Anyway, that decorating show sounds promising.

Scandal Investigation,"A former senior investigator with the State Department’s criminal investigative unit has turned whistleblower and alleged to both the media and Congress that senior staff within State Department covered up investigations into appalling behavior committed by members of Hillary Clinton’s security staff and our ambassador to Belgium. One of those alleged to have interfered was Cheryl Mills, Hillary’s chief of staff.

The case in which Clinton enforcer Mills allegedly intervened centered upon Brett McGurk, Obama’s nominee to be US ambassador to Iraq.

McGurk’s expected nomination fell apart after a computer hack exposed his racy e-mails and an extramarital affair with Wall Street Journal reporter Gina Chon.

According to the memo, the SID “never interviewed McGurk, allegedly because Cheryl Mills from the Secretary’s office interceded.”

“Without that interview, SID has been unable to close the case,” the memo concludes.

Mills is a longtime associate of the Clintons, going back to 1992, and was also at the center of the first scandal to hit Hillary’s State Department: Benghazi. Gregory Hicks, the former Deputy Chief of Mission in Libya, testified before Congress that Mills instructed him not to cooperate with the Congressional investigation into the September 11 terror attacks.

Mills isn’t the only high-ranking official being named. Patrick Kennedy, the Undersecretary of State for Management, is directly accused of killing an investigation into our Ambassador to Belgium, Howard Gutman, who is accused of slipping away from his security detail to solicit sex from minor children.

Gutman was a big Democratic donor before taking the post, having raised $500,000 for President Obama’s 2008 campaign and helping finance his inaugural.

* At least seven agents in Clinton’s security detail hired prostitutes while traveling with her in various countries, including Russia and Colombia.

Investigators called the use of prostitutes by Clinton’s security agents “endemic.”

Amid all the other scandals, this latest mess is still picking up some traction in the mainstream media. Here is Chuck Todd’s “Today Show” report:

Text of the Settlement Full Coverage: Clinton Accused

By Peter Baker

Washington Post Staff Writer

Saturday, November 14, 1998; Page A1 President Clinton reached an out-of-court settlement with Paula Jones yesterday, agreeing to pay her $850,000 to drop the sexual harassment lawsuit that led to the worst political crisis of his career and only the third presidential impeachment inquiry in American history. After more than 4 1/2 years of scorched-earth legal warfare, Clinton and Jones brought a sudden end to the case with a four-page deal in which he acknowledged no wrongdoing and offered no apology. The agreement, which will be filed with a federal appeals court considering whether the lawsuit should go forward, requires the president to pay within 60 days. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's chief attorney in the case, said the president still insists Jones's allegations of a crude proposition in a Little Rock hotel suite seven years ago ""are baseless"" but agreed to make the payment in the interest of finally putting the matter behind him. ""The president has decided he is not prepared to spend one more hour on this matter,"" Bennett said. ""It is clear that the American people want their president and Congress to focus on the problems that they were elected to solve. This is a step in that direction."" The settlement foreclosed the possibility that Clinton's personal life would be reopened for public inspection at a sensational trial had the lawsuit dismissed in April been reinstated, as many lawyers involved believed it would be. It also may help the president's allies defend him against independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's allegations that he lied and obstructed justice during the case, while providing a new opportunity for the White House to cut a separate deal with Congress to drop impeachment proceedings. Just hours before the settlement was inked yesterday, Starr sent new evidence to the House Judiciary Committee stemming from a witness in the Jones case, Kathleen E. Willey, who also accused Clinton of an unwelcome sexual advance. Jones made no public comment, but her husband, Steve, told reporters outside their California condominium that the payment amounts to an apology on its own. ""Let the impeachment hearings begin. We want out of it,"" he said. ""Paying a substantial amount of money makes a statement on its own. This is Paula's reputation that we were fighting for. This has nothing to do with an ax to grind with Bill Clinton."" John W. Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute, which financed her lawsuit, called the deal ""justice for Paula"" and said it would draw attention to ""the importance of protecting powerless women from workplace harassment and the role of the rule of law in our highest offices."" The extraordinary case came to an extraordinary finale, with the defendant agreeing to pay $850,000 even though the plaintiff originally only asked for $700,000 when she filed suit -- and even though the case was dismissed without a trial. The document signed late yesterday afternoon made no mention of how Clinton would pay for the settlement, but sources said it likely would come from both his legal defense fund and a separate deal with one of his insurance companies. Sources said the president's lawyers have reached a tentative agreement with Chubb Group Insurance to buy out the personal liability policy that had covered some of his legal expenses for close to half of the settlement. ""When all is said and done, not a penny will come out of his pocket,"" said one person close to the situation. The Jones camp, which has struggled with bitter internal divisions in recent weeks, has yet to determine how it will divide the money among the many lawyers who have staked a claim on it. Although lawyers involved believe Jones will get a decent share of the settlement, it remains to be determined how much. Even as both sides celebrated yesterday, they were cognizant of the enormous toll the lawsuit has taken on everyone involved. For Clinton, even though the case was dismissed by a federal judge, the Jones suit will forever mar his chapter in the history books, cementing an image as a leader whose reckless personal life endangered an otherwise remarkable political career. The case opened a Pandora's box of allegations about his past sex life and made him the first president ever interrogated under oath as a defendant in a civil lawsuit or before a grand jury as a possible criminal target. Jones v. Clinton also yielded a historic decision by the Supreme Court, which ruled 9 to 0 last year that even the chief executive can be sued. And it was the resulting search for evidence that led Jones's lawyers to Monica S. Lewinsky and the chain of events that prompted Starr's report to Congress alleging that Clinton committed 11 impeachable offenses. Jones filed her suit in May 1994, accusing Clinton of luring her to a suite at the Excelsior Hotel during a May 8, 1991, conference when he was governor of Arkansas and she was a state clerk. During that brief encounter, she said he touched her, tried to kiss her and dropped his pants and asked for oral sex. Clinton has denied that steadfastly, maintaining he does not even remember meeting her. U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright dismissed the case last spring, ruling that even if Jones's allegations were true, such ""boorish and offensive"" behavior would not be severe enough to constitute sexual harassment under the law. Jones then asked the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the decision and, after Starr's report came out, argued that Clinton's alleged misconduct during the case justified a reversal. Two members of the three-judge panel appeared sympathetic during oral arguments last month and on Tuesday the court asked for the full transcript of Clinton's Jan. 17 deposition in the case, which some lawyers close to the Jones camp interpreted as a sign that they were concerned about possible perjury by the president. To short-circuit the appeal, the two sides came together yesterday after two months of fitful negotiations that often appeared on the verge of collapse and nearly unraveled because of the unsolicited intrusion of a New York tycoon who offered $1 million of his own money to persuade Jones to drop the case in the national interest. While previous attempts to settle had repeatedly failed, Jones's lawyers approached Bennett in September with a $1 million proposal that abandoned her long-standing demand for an apology from the president, a condition that had been a deal-killer for Clinton. Bennett countered with a $500,000 offer, then upped it to $700,000, but Jones held out for the full $1 million and insisted on taking the other $1 million from businessman Abe Hirschfeld as well. Hirschfeld's involvement spooked the White House, if for no other reason than the mercurial real estate mogul has been indicted on state tax evasion charges in New York. Frustrated by their client's unyielding stance and convinced that Hirschfeld was too erratic to deal with, Jones's lawyers informed her they planned to quit, which appeared to shake her into agreeing to break ties with her would-be benefactor. William N. McMillan III, a California attorney and husband of Jones's friend, Susan Carpenter-McMillan, took over negotiating this week and assured Bennett that Hirschfeld was out of the picture, according to sources close to the case. Bennett insisted on a written commitment and McMillan faxed a letter that said, ""I further represent to you that the money from Mr. Abraham Hirschfeld is no longer on the table and that there will be no payment from Mr. Hirschfeld as part of the settlement with your client."" Bennett spoke with the president three times Thursday even as he was consulting with advisers about whether to attack Iraq and finally Clinton authorized his legal team to settle, one source said. Yesterday afternoon the agreement was signed by Bennett, McMillan, Jones lawyer Donovan Campbell Jr. and Bill W. Bristow, the lawyer for co-defendant Danny Ferguson, the state trooper who escorted Jones to meet with Clinton. ""Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to be an admission of liability or wrongdoing by any party,"" the document said. At the White House, aides were relieved to finally have the matter behind them. ""The feeling here was unanimous and universal -- it's over!"" said one official who asked not to be named. ""Those two words have so much power, because nothing is ever over here. It's over."" With the case settled, the president has a chance to end the distractions of scandal for the final two years of his presidency, this official added. ""What this means is that not a single one of those 750 days [left] will be taken up by Paula Jones,"" he said. Said another White House adviser, ""It's just another piece of the puzzle put in so he can move forward on his own agenda for the next two years."" Still, there are tricky details to be resolved. Clinton's lawyers must finalize a plan to pay the settlement. Richard M. Lucas, counsel to the Clinton Legal Expense Trust, said it has not been contacted about financing a deal and would have to confront legal questions before deciding whether it could participate. The legal document founding the trust authorizes it to pay ""legal fees and expenses,"" but ""it's silent on settlements,"" said Lucas. ""It's something the trustees have never had to deal with as a board."" The trustees might also have to deal with Larry Klayman, an attorney and longtime Clinton foe who has repeatedly tried to block insurance coverage of Clinton's expenses in the Jones case and has threatened to challenge use of defense fund money for any settlement. Jones, too, must figure out money matters. Her Dallas-based lawyers have a contingency agreement for at least a third of any proceeds from the case. The Rutherford Institute is legally entitled to reimbursement of its $400,000 in expenses. And her former lawyers have placed an $800,000 lien on the case and while they have said they would come down some, they have been tough negotiators so far. ""For all she's been through, she should get some money,"" said one of those lawyers, Joseph Cammarata. But he offered no estimate, adding, ""In Clinton-speak, it depends on your definition of 'some.' ""

http://news.yahoo.com/verdict-ex-detroit-mayor-corruption-trial-132417332.html,,[],Verdict in ex-Detroit mayor corruption trial,"DETROIT (AP) — Jurors reached a verdict Monday in the federal corruption trial of ex-Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick after 14 days of deliberations.

Lawyers for Kilpatrick, his father Bernard and city contractor Bobby Ferguson were summoned to Detroit federal court. The verdict was to be read Monday morning, court spokesman Rod Hansen said in an email.

Kilpatrick is charged with turning the mayor's office into a cash machine by collecting kickbacks and bribes from people who wanted city business. He's also charged with looting a nonprofit fund that he created to help distressed Detroiters.

Kwame Kilpatrick arrived at court roughly 20 minutes before the verdict was to be read and didn't comment to reporters. Bernard Kilpatrick, who arrived separately, said his family was doing ""better than expected.""

Prosecutors say Kwame Kilpatrick rigged contracts that benefited Ferguson's construction company. In turn, the government says Kilpatrick got a cut of the spoils Kilpatrick's lawyer says the former mayor simply got cash gifts from political supporters and city employees while in office.

Kilpatrick is charged with 30 crimes, including racketeering conspiracy, bribery, extortion and tax evasion. His father, Bernard, is a co-defendant along with Ferguson. The conspiracy charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. To convict on that count, the jury must find that at least one of them agreed to commit two crimes, such as extortion, bribery or fraud.

The main theme of the government's case is that Kwame Kilpatrick ensured that Ferguson got city excavation work and then enjoyed the cash spoils. But he also is accused of strong-arming other contractors to give public jobs to Ferguson and shaking down businesses.

Kilpatrick, a Democrat, resigned as mayor in 2008 in another scandal. He pleaded guilty to obstructing justice by lying in a civil case about whether he had had sex with a top aide. He subsequently served 14 months in prison for violating his probation in that case."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/27/New-Obama-Administration-Crackdown-Looms-On-Tax-Exempt-Groups,2013-11-27 00:00:00,['Frances Martel'],New Crackdown by Obama Administration Looms on Tax-Exempt Groups,"With a happy Iran at the negotiating table and plenty of reasons to take the spotlight off health care, the Obama administration now seeks to tie the hands of political opponents by limiting spending by tax-exempt groups with political messages.

The Treasury and IRS announced they were currently working on adapting the tax code to limit what kinds of groups could apply for 501(c)(4) status, a category designated for political non-profits and “social welfare” groups that follow less stringent spending rules than political action committees (PACs). The Obama administration’s proposed changes to the code would prevent 501(c)(4)s from engaging in advocacy for a specific candidate and political advocacy generally, including paying for campaign ads on television. Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Mark Mazur called the move “a first critical step toward creating clear-cut definitions of political activity by tax-exempt social welfare organizations.”

Unlike PACs, 501(c)(4)s do not currently have to disclose donors legally. They have surpassed unions and trade associations in political spending and become a pivotal part of the post-Citizens United campaign finance landscape. They do not aid candidates directly, but take on issues and buy ads that directly argue to the public one way or another. While the groups can be of any political stripe, spending by conservative groups has greatly surpassed that by liberal organizations like Organizing for America. And although the measure would crack down on bigger organizations like Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS, the strength of smaller, Tea Party-central advocacy groups who rely on their tax exempt status to promote messages mainstream political figures would otherwise ignore would most likely be among the hardest hit.

Conservatives both complying with the law in their roles running 501(c)(4)s and those in office have responded to the measure with uniform outrage. A spokesman for the NRA, a 501(c)(4), called the measure a “blatant abuse of the tax code designed to muzzle the American people’s free speech rights.” Rep. Darrell Issa described the move as a “crass political effort,” and placed emphasis on the fact that unions and trade organizations– often much more likely to contribute to liberal efforts– were left to their own devices while the IRS and Treasury turned on these particular political non-profits.

This isn’t the first time the IRS proposes to crack down on political groups voicing opposition to President Obama’s policies, but it is the most sweeping attempt. Controversy with such groups came to a peak this year when it was discovered that more than 80% of 501(c)(4) groups on the IRS’ watch list between 2010 and 2012 were conservative and/or Tea Party affiliated organizations.

While the administration promises careful scrutiny of the tax code before making any large changes, President Obama’s vocal disapproval of the expressive freedoms protected by the Citizens United ruling and his administration’s targeting of opposition groups through the IRS leave little room to expect tax reforms to have anything but a chilling effect on the national political discourse."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/31/Menendez-Prostitution-Scandal-Donor-Melgens-Political-Contributions,2013-01-31 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Menendez Prostitution Scandal: Donor Melgen's Political Contributions Exploded After IRS Filed Tax Lien,"Ophthalmologist and Democratic political donor Dr. Salomon Melgen may have tried to buy cover from the IRS for the $11.1 million he owes in back taxes from 2006 to present, Breitbart News has learned. Melgen may have intended to court politicians with political donations and prostitutes with the hopes that they would help him wipe his IRS slate clean.

Melgen was a political donor from as far back as the early 1990s. According to Federal Election Commission records published on the Center for Responsive Politics website OpenSecrets.org, Melgen made his first political donation to a young first-term Democratic U.S. Congressman: Bob Menendez. After that $500 donation, Melgen’s friendship with Menendez developed further (the two were reportedly close before Menendez first took office).

Meanwhile, Melgen and his wife Flor started making more political donations to Menendez and other politicians and groups. As the years went by, the donations grew in size. Melgen became a regular on the political circuit. He hosted fundraisers for candidates and became close with the Clinton family throughout the 1990s. Salomon and Flor Melgen donated $2,000 total to President Bill Clinton’s 1996 re-election campaign, after having given $3,000 to Hillary Clinton’s brother–Hugh Rodham–for his failed 1994 U.S. Senate bid out of Florida.

The donations continued to grow in size and quantity before Melgen began facing tax problems with the IRS in July 2002. The Free Beacon reports that the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Melgen for about $1.3 million then for unpaid taxes dating back to 1999, and that lien was released in November 2002.

Melgen continued supporting Democratic politicians from Florida and some other higher-profile Democrats around the country. He and his wife supported now-former Sens. Chris Dodd and Bob Graham, and Sens. Tom Harkin Chuck Schumer and Bill Nelson. He threw some cash to then House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (who reared Nancy Pelosi in House politics in the early 2000s after he lost the House Majority to Newt Gingrich in the 1994 elections.

After that original tax lien was wiped away–at this time, the details of why the lien was removed are unclear–all was going well for Melgen until, in 2008, he got slapped with another lien. According to the Free Beacon, the IRS charges in that lien that Melgen owed $6.2 million in back taxes dating to 1998. That second lien was lifted in August 2011.

It was in the middle of these first two liens–around the beginning of 2006–that Melgen ramped up his political activity. Until then, from that first donation to Menendez in 1993, Melgen and his wife Flor had donated a total of $88,360 to political candidates and groups. Save for two anomalies–a $250 donation to former Florida Republican Rep. Mark Foley, who resigned after his own sex scandal hit him, and a $1,000 donation his wife Flor gave to George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s–Melgen and his family didn’t donate to Republicans.

From the beginning of 2006 to present, Melgen almost quadrupled his political donation activity of the previous decade or longer. In the past seven years, he, his wife, and his daughter Melissa–who is the marketing director for her father’s eye clinic company–donated a total of $324,600 to political figures and groups. Like before, most of that went to Democrats.

According to a current Dominican Republic government official this reporter interviewed while writing for The Daily Caller before joining Breitbart News, Melgen allegedly began hosting sex parties replete with “sex, hookers and drinking.” Menendez allegedly attended these parties. While the senator and his staff deny prostitution parties took place at the villa or that Menendez participated in them–even though two prostitutes have alleged, in an interview with this reporter who broke the original story while at The Daily Caller, that they were paid to have sex with Menendez–Menendez’s staff admitted the senator flew to the Dominican on Melgen’s private plane on three occasions and told NBC News’ Michael Isikoff that Menendez stays at Melgen’s villa while there about twice a year.

The Dominican official told this reporter Menendez has allegedly been attending these sex parties at Melgen’s villa “for at least the past three years, probably longer.”

Back in the United States, Melgen continued increasing his political profile as a donor. In 2011, he expanded his reach outside the Democratic Party to begin funding two prominent Hispanic Republicans’ political efforts. He and his wife pushed Florida Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Over the course of 2011 and 2012, the Melgens donated $10,000 to Diaz-Balart and $9,800 to Ros-Lehtinen–a powerful congresswoman who at the time chaired the House Foreign Relations Committee.

As these sex parties allegedly continued in the Dominican, and Melgen continued building his political profile with bigger and bigger donations to higher and higher profile politicians–all while flying his private jet around–the doctor’s tax problems went from bad to worse. The Free Beacon reports that in May 2011 Melgen was hit with another IRS tax lien, this one for $11.1 million in unpaid taxes dating back to 2006. The previous $6.2 million lien was still in effect for another few months before the IRS released it in August 2011–meaning the doctor had $17.3 million in liens against him at that point.

The $11.1 million lien remains in place to this day. But in April 2011, one month before the IRS filed this additional lien for $11.1 million, and four months before the earlier $6.2 million IRS lien was released, the doctor and journalist Emilio Sanchez founded Hispanic media company VOXXI. Sanchez is the CEO.

“At VOXXI, we aim to fill a void in the mainstream media by delivering great journalism and telling captivating stories that educate, engage and entertain, all with a Hispanic touch and enriched by the power of social media,” VOXXI said in its mission statement. “We will defend the role of Hispanics in this nation by providing a news platform where Latinos can be heard and respected. As an independent voice, VOXXI fosters an open and dynamic dialogue, empowering our community to act and react on current events and trends.”

Documents filed with Florida’s Secretary of State’s office show Melgen is listed as the managing member of La Vox LLC, the limited liability company that owns VOXXI.

A few months later, at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., Melgen and Sanchez threw a bash celebrating VOXXI’s launch. Photos published online from the event show attendees other than Melgen and Sanchez include: Menendez, Diaz-Balart and Ros-Lehtinen, among many other politicians.

In a phone interview with Breitbart News on Thursday, Sanchez said the Menendez-Melgen story had nothing to do with his website. “There is no relationship between VOXXI and the Dr. Salomon Melgen–Senator Robert Menendez story,” he said. “We don’t have to make a statement.”

When asked if Melgen owned 100 percent of La Vox LLC or had a controlling interest in the company, Sanchez responded: “I don’t have to give you financial information on the company.”

Sanchez also said an earlier report from LatinoRebels.com that his company would be releasing a statement on the scandal was “not true,” and that his company won’t release a statement.

Through a spokeswoman, Diaz-Balart refused to comment to Breitbart News when asked for details on his connections to Melgen. A spokesperson for Ros-Lehtinen has not returned several requests for comment.

About two months after that event was Easter week. That week is the timeframe in which two women from the Dominican Republic alleged, in an interview with this reporter, they were under-paid to have sex with Menendez; they claim they were promised $500 each but say they only received $100 apiece.

Shortly after that Easter-week incident, a tipster who goes by the name “Peter Williams” alerted the George Soros-funded Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), which began investigating. CREW alerted ABC News reporter Rhonda Schwartz, who also started investigating but for reasons unknown never ran a story, and the FBI.

FBI Special Agent Regino Chavez launched an inquiry into the prostitution angle of this scandal as it relates to Menendez and Melgen as early as August 1, 2012, emails show. In September 2012, Chavez emailed “Williams” to tell him that the FBI had been able to “confirm most of” the information he was providing on that front and that the FBI “know[s] that you are providing accurate information.”

As Schwartz never continued to not run a story on the matter and CREW didn’t publish anything either–while the FBI worked its will–this reporter got wind of the allegations floating around there. Early on November 1, 2012, this reporter broke the story in The Daily Caller.

A couple weeks ago, the emails between “Williams” and the FBI’s Chavez surfaced, as did many more details.

Over the ensuing months since the story first broke, ABC News has not run a story. While guest-hosting ABC’s Sunday news show “This Week,” the network’s foreign affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz had Menendez on for six minutes and chose not to ask about the FBI inquiry. Media coverage elsewhere has been scant as well.

Melgen’s personal media company has ignored the story, something a VOXXI spokeswoman told Breitbart News has been a decision made by leadership. “It was an editorial decision,” VOXXI spokeswoman Julissa Bonfante said when asked why the outlet didn’t cover it.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/03/DHS-Email-We-Absolutely-Gave-Special-Treatment-to-GreenTech-Visa-Requests,2013-08-03 00:00:00,['Michael Patrick Leahy'],DHS Email: 'We Absolutely Gave Special Treatment to GreenTech' Visa Requests,"An April 2013 email from a career Department of Homeland Security official released on Friday by the office of Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) stated that the Department of Homeland Security “absolutely gave special treatment” to green card visa applications filed by foreign national EB-5 investors in GreenTech Automotive, the company Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe served as chairman of from 2010 to 2012.

In the released email, the names of the sender as well as the recipient have been redacted, but both are described as “career DHS officials.” The text of the email also refers to a person called “D1,” which Senator Grassley’s office believes is US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director Alejandro Mayorkas. President Obama nominated Mayorkas to become Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security on June 27.

Mr. Mayorkas testified before a Senate committee holding hearings on his nomination on July 25. The hearings were attended by only Democrats. Republicans did not participate because Mr. Mayorkas is the subject of an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General’s Office.

The email, dated April 12, 2013, is from a “Senior USCIS Career Official” and is sent to “USCIS Career Officials.” It reads as follows:

We absolutely gave special treatment to GreenTech at the directive of D1. D1 was working directly with the RC’s [EB-5 Regional Center] atty, [name redacted]. Additionally, I would call a wholesale rewrite of the AAO’s [Administrative Appeals Office] decision by the front office special treatment. Look at the first draft in the attached email and the final version, attached.

Senator Grassley asked Mr. Mayorkas about an apparent inconsistency between this email and his earlier testimony in a letter he sent to Mr. Mayorkas on Thursday. Grassley wrote to Mayorkas that “you testified [on July 25]: ‘I have never ever in my career exercised undue influence to influence the outcome of a case.'” Grassley noted in his letter to Mayorkas that “D1 [mentioned in the April 12, 2013 email] is an apparent reference to you.”

Grassley then cited Mayorkas’ testimony to the Senate committee on July 25:

Several documents call into question some of the statements you made regarding preferential treatment in your testimony at last Thursday’s hearing. For example, you were asked in the hearing about communications with Terry McAuliffe with respect to Gulf Coast Funds Management. You testified: “I was asked to attend a meeting with Mr. McAuliffe so that I could hear in person his complaints… two years ago… I heard those complaints, and that was the extent of the interaction… I moved on with my work.” (Emphasis included in Grassley letter)

But, Grassley wrote, “Contrary to the impression left by your answer, documents indicate that both before and after that meeting, you actually engaged in nearly a dozen contacts with Gulf Coast Funds Management between 2010 and 2013, including direct communications with Gulf Coast’s attorneys.” Grassley concluded, “That one meeting with Mr. McAuliffe was clearly not the extent of your interaction on that matter.”

The EB-5 foreign national investor program has come under intense scrutiny over the past several years. Under the program, enacted into law in 1990, foreign nationals may obtain temporary and permanent green card resident visas in return for investing a minimum of $500,000 in an American company.

The possibility that foreign nationals who have invested in GreenTech Automotive have been granted temporary green card visas due to the political influence of the principals involved is a key issue currently under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General’s Office.

Terry McAuliffe, who was chairman of GreenTech Automotive during the period when political influence may have played a role in the granting of visas, is a friend and chief fundraiser for former President Bill Clinton. Anthony Rodham, brother of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is the President and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management, which the Department of Homeland Security designated the EB-5 Regional Center that works exclusively with GreenTech Automotive to help secure green card visas for its EB-5 investors.

Grassley’s letter to Mayorkas was one of two stories about GreenTech Automotive that made headlines on Friday. In a related story, GreenTech Automotive confirmed to Breitbart News on Friday that it has received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission to produce company documents. According to the Washington Post, those documents were subpoenaed as evidence in the SEC’s investigation into claims made by GreenTech Automotive to its investors."

On Wednesday afternoon, Loretta Fuddy, the director of Hawaii's Department of Health, died in a small, commercial plane crash off the coast of the Hawaiian island Molokai. Fuddy, who had been director of Hawaii's health department since March 2011, was the official who verified and approved the release of President Obama's birth certificate. Fuddy said then that the records ""further prove the fact that he was born in Hawaii.""

Early reports indicate that the plane, a 2002 Cessna Grand Caravan, suffered catastrophic engine failure. The other eight passengers on board were rescued. According to Rev. Patrick Killilea who met with the survivors, Fuddy was wearing her life jacket in the water and was holding hands with deputy director Keith Yamamoto when she let go.

Tweets, comments, and web posts from the birther movement quickly insinuated that the tragedy was no accident. Some implied that the White House was ""tying up loose ends,"" while others commented ""that anyone with any connection to Obama or his background has a tendency to have a 'shortened' life span.""

And, of course, Donald Trump weighed in:

How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama’s “birth certificate” died in plane crash today. All others lived — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2013

Despite the media whirlwind around the birther conspiracies, Fuddy's life and numerous successes are being celebrated.

Just yesterday, a report published by the United Health Foundation, American Public Health Association and the Partnership for Prevention, confirmed that Hawaii is the country's healthiest state.

According to Hawaii House Speaker Joe Souki, Fuddy, 65, “was especially passionate about the most vulnerable in our communities, a champion for mothers, newborns, and early childhood care. Her warm, caring spirit for the people of Hawaii will truly be missed.”

“Our hearts are broken,” Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie said in a statement. “Loretta was deeply loved and respected. She was selfless, utterly dedicated, and committed to her colleagues in the Department of Health and to the people of Hawaii. Her knowledge was vast; her counsel and advice always given from her heart as much as from her storehouse of experience.”

In August, Fuddy told Honolulu's Midweek magazine, ""I'm a child of the '60s, the Kennedy era of 'ask what you can do for your country' public service and Catholic values."""

Also entering the building were two members of the City Council and attorney Gloria Allred, who represents Filner’s former director of communications, Irene McCormack Jackson, in a lawsuit seeking unspecified damages from Filner and the city.

Council President Todd Gloria, a Democrat, and Councilman Kevin Faulconer, the council’s senior Republican, are set to meet with City Atty. Jan Goldsmith on Tuesday.

Goldsmith last week said that he expects Filner to either resign or be ousted and that he was working on a potential settlement to the lawsuit that would provide Filner with “an exit.”

Allred declined comment Monday on whether the settlement discussions involved the possibility that Filner would resign as she has demanded.

The 70-year-old Democrat has refused demands from all nine council members, and numerous members of the the Democratic Party in Sacramento and Washington, to resign.

Sixteen women have accused Filner of sexual harassment, including three city employees, two military veterans, a retired Navy admiral, a nurse, two singers, two business executives, and two college officials. The harassment, they said, included unwanted touching and inappropriate sexual comments.

A recall movement began Sunday to gather enough signatures to force a recall election. Former Councilman Carl DeMaio, who lost to Filner in the November election, announced Monday that he will assist the signature-gathering campaign and urged members of the City Council to do the same.

But also Monday, supporters of Filner held a rally and news conference outside City Hall. Kathleen Harmon, a longtime supporter, told a small crowd that, “We’re going to stand behind him. We ask him not to resign.”

Rally organizer Enrique Morones, an activist on the issue of immigrant rights, ended the rally with the call, “Bob, get back to mayoring. We love you.”

When Filner announced he would undergo two weeks of intensive behavioral therapy, he said he would return to City Hall on Aug. 19 ready to be “the best mayor I can.”

In an emotional and defiant address to the council after the vote was announced, Filner apologized to his victims and supporters but also said he had been victimized by “the hysteria of the lynch mob” caused by politicians and the media once the allegations by some 18 women became public.

“I faced lynch mobs many times when I was younger,” Filner said, a reference to his activism in the 1960s as a Freedom Rider in the segregated South when he spent two months in a Mississippi jail.

But, Filner added, his voice breaking, “The city should not have been put through this, and my own personal failings were responsible.” The resignation is effective Aug. 30.

“This settlement is an end to our civic nightmare and allows this city to begin to heal,” said Council President Todd Gloria, one of two council members who negotiated for three days with Filner, his attorneys, and the city attorney to reach the deal.

Within minutes of the council decision, a spokesman for the state attorney general’s office confirmed that a criminal investigation into Filner’s treatment of women “is underway.” Investigators have been interviewing some of the women who have come forward with allegations.

Filner’s resignation does not affect the investigation, a source close to the investigation said.

Filner, 70, was elected in November as the city’s first Democratic mayor in two decades.

When he entered the council chambers after the vote was announced, his supporters stood and applauded but council members, all of whom had called for Filner to resign, showed no emotion.

He repeated his previous apologies to the city and to the women he has offended. But he also called on the council and his potential successors not to abandon the agenda he brought to the mayor’s office: better neighborhood services, respect for city employees and concern for lower-income neighborhoods.

Filner said that his own conduct provided the ammunition for his critics but that “well-organized interests who have run this city for half a century” conspired to run him from office. He singled out politicians and the media for criticism.

He apologized to his ex-fiancee, Bronwyn Ingram, who ended their relationship just days before the first allegations were made against Filner. She said she had caught Filner making dates with other women.

“I love you very much,” Filner said to Ingram, who was not present. “You love San Diego as much as I did. I personally apologize for the hurt I caused you.”

“Justice has been done,” said City Atty. Jan Goldsmith.

The deal approved 7-0 by the council does not resolve the lawsuit filed against Filner and the city by Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred on behalf of Irene McCormack Jackson, Filner’s former director of communications.

Under the agreement, the city will pay $98,000 to Filner’s private attorneys. The city will also defend Filner against the Jackson lawsuit and pay any damages that result from a court decision or an out-of-court settlement.

Council members insisted that even though the deal obligates the city to assist Filner financially in fighting the lawsuit, it is in the best interests of the taxpayers because it may limit any damages the city might face from her case.

Even as he apologized, Filner remained defiant, blasting the council’s decision to pay some of his legal fees only if he resigned. “I cannot afford to continue this battle,” he said, “even though if I did I know I would be vindicated.”

His conduct, he said, was due to awkwardness and thoughtlessness but not an intention to harass or abuse women.

The council now must call an election to be held within 90 days to find a successor. In the interim, Gloria will assume greater authority but not the full powers of the “strong mayor” adopted by voters in 2004.

Filner becomes the fourth of the last seven mayors of San Diego to leave office early.

Before the council went into closed session, it heard the comments of several dozen people from among the 200-plus who had crowded into the council chambers for the 1 p.m. meeting.

Many demanded that the settlement be rejected and that the recall movement be allowed to proceed. Others, some speaking Spanish, said the council should remember Filner’s long history of support for minority communities.

Joan Raymond, a retired garbage truck driver, expressed support for Filner and urged the council to let the voters decide his fate, calling fears of civic paralysis if he remained as mayor exaggerated.

“It’s the city workers in the field that make the city run 24/7. Our water is still being delivered. Our toilets are still flushing. Our trash is still being picked up despite this political hysteria,” Raymond said.

Laura Fink, a political consultant and one of Filner’s accusers, pressed for his ouster. Early in the scandal, Fink told interviewers that Filner had patted her buttocks.

“Today I stand shoulder to shoulder with the other women that have come forward asking for the mayor to resign,” she told the council.

“Without the mayor’s resignation, our city will continue to be paralyzed with this scandal, progress will be arrested, and our focus will continue to be monopolized by this dark chapter in our history,” Fink said.

The scandal began in mid-July when three former Filner supporters sent letters to him demanding that he resign. When he refused their demand, the three held a news conference to again seek his resignation for alleged sexual harassment.

Faced with the allegations, Filner distributed a video in which he admitted treating women with disrespect, apologized and said, “I need help.” He hired new staff to give a sense of stability in his office.

Then he announced he planned to undergo a two-week regimen of intensive behavioral therapy. He promised to return to City Hall on Aug. 19 ready to be “the best mayor I can.”

At first, the allegations were anonymous. Then Allred filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Filner and the city on Jackson’s behalf.

Soon other women began going public with accusations in television interviews. By Friday, 18 women had accused Filner of groping them and making lewd remarks.

His accusers included three business executives, two college officials, two military veterans, a Navy admiral, two singers, three city employees and a nurse.

EMILY%27s List and National Organization for Women step up efforts on behalf of Christine Quinn

Quinn would be first woman mayor of New York City

National women's groups are stepping up their efforts in the New York City mayors race to support City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and denounce former Congressman Anthony Weiner for his lewd online behavior.

The women's poliitcal group EMILY's List is sending out an e-mail to supporters Friday saying ""New Yorkers deserve better than the circus their mayoral race has turned into."" The e-mail, written by communications director Jess McIntosh, was sent under the subject line ""I don't want to talk about Carlos Danger"" - a reference to the pseudonym Weiner allegedly used for some of his on-line trysts.

EMILY's List, which specializes in raising money for female candidates, extolled Quinn's qualifications and encouraged supporters to contribute to Quinn's campaign.

Thursday the National Organization for Women hosted a rally with Quinn in New York and NOW President Terry O'Neill said ""Mr. Weiner does have a problem and his behavior is sexist. Let's be clear: It is not respectful of women,"" according to the New York Daily News.

EMILY's list and the New York chapter of NOW had previously endorsed Quinn for the race, saying she is the most qualified candidate and hailing the historic possibility of election the first woman mayor of New York City.

Sonia Ossorio, president of NOW of New York City said Friday that Weiner has clearly demonstrated that he does not have the judgement or maturity to be mayor.

She added that the saga brings to mind Susan B. Anthony who spent decades crusading for women's right to vote. ""She fought for our vote,"" Ossorio said, ""and to think that a woman would squander their vote on someone like Anthony Weiner who doesn't take public office seriously, who is unfit and who has made a mockery of elected office, and who has done it by disrespecting woman . . . I feel embarrassed for our culture.""

Weiner resigned his seat in Congress in 2011 after it was revealed that he had sent lewd text messages and images to women on-line. This week he acknowledged that he had continued to engage in graphic on-line exchanges even after he left Congress. Thursday he said he may have exchanged texts with as many as ten women overall.

Weiner has rejected calls to quit the mayor's race, saying he believes New Yorkers are more interested in what he can do for the city than his boorish behavior, which he says is now behind him."

During a joint press conference with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, President Obama called for an investigation into the IRS, saying, “We’ve got to make sure that it is doing its job scrupulously.” (Sandi Moynihan/The Washington Post)

Senior lawmakers investigating what went wrong at the Internal Revenue Service are planning to focus on whether IRS officials misled Congress about a policy that targeted conservative groups for extra screening when seeking a tax exemption, congressional aides say.

With the first high-profile hearing on the topic set to begin Friday morning, congressional aides say lawmakers in both chambers will seek answers about why they weren’t told that the IRS had singled out conservative groups for scrutiny despite multiple inquiries in recent years.

“I’m not an unreasonable guy, but hiding what happened to Congress is inexcusable and how this was allowed to happen must be answered,” Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said through a spokeswoman Thursday.

The questions from lawmakers come amid a rising furor over the IRS’s unfair treatment of conservative groups during an 18-month period that ended in early 2012, spawning FBI and Justice Department criminal investigations in addition to at least four congressional probes.

This week, President Obama demanded the resignation of acting IRS commissioner Steven T. Miller, replacing him Thursday with budget official Daniel Werfel, a veteran of Republican and Democratic administrations. Also on Thursday, Joseph Grant, commissioner of the agency’s tax exempt/government entities divisions, announced that he would soon retire.

The Friday hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees the IRS, will be the first of several sessions in coming weeks where lawmakers will grill current and former officials about the IRS’s screening practices.

Tea party organizations and other conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status increasingly complained in recent years that they were receiving overly detailed questionnaires from the IRS and facing long delays.

Republican officials wrote letters and held public and private briefings with top IRS officials demanding to know whether the IRS was giving extra scrutiny to conservative groups. Each time, agency officials said no.

But a report by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration said senior agency officials became aware of what was happening more than a year ago, raising questions about whether IRS officials had been forthcoming with Congress.

For example, in May 2012, according to congressional aides briefed by the IRS and inspector general, Miller learned that targeting had been occurring. But in September, he sent a response to GOP senators asking questions that did not acknowledge the screening.

Lawmakers now say those statements and others from IRS officials will be a core focus of the inquiry, with multiple congressional committees investigating the matter. Miller is scheduled to testify Friday along with Inspector General J. Russell George, who conducted the audit on screening practices released this week.

What the IRS told Congress could also be part of criminal inquiries. In testimony on Wednesday, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said one possibility that investigators will explore is whether “false statements” were made in the IRS case.

The House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee and Senate Finance Committee also plan their own hearings next week. The House oversight panel is focusing on disclosures by Lois Lerner, the direct supervisor of the tax-exempt unit.

In a letter to Lerner this week, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), the committee’s chairman, wrote: “We are concerned that information you have provided to the committee related to this matter on prior occasions was false or misleading.”

IRS officials did not respond to a request for comment late Thursday.

IRS plans to reduce victims%27 six-month waiting times

More than 3%2C000 workers assigned to identity theft%2C double 2011number

More than 35%2C000 employees trained to help taxpayers recognize identity theft

The IRS Thursday pledged to provide swifter help to hundreds of thousands of frustrated Americans victimized by tax fraud through identity theft.

""I want you to know that we understand your frustration, and we're working hard to get your cases resolved as quickly as we can,"" said acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller as he announced the federal tax agency's latest efforts to combat the fast-rising crime.

It likely won't be easy.

The IRS caseload — involving victims whose stolen Social Security numbers were used by thieves to collect unwarranted tax refunds — soared to 449,809 in 2012, up more than 80% from the previous year, National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson reported to Congress last month.

And victims routinely need to wait more than six months and speak to multiple IRS employees before their issues are resolved, reported Olson, who heads an independent office within the IRS.

The IRS resolved more than 500,000 identity-theft cases during the last calendar year, but still has just under 300,000 similar cases pending, said Miller.

""We still are challenged by our inventory, and folks are waiting longer than they should expect to,"" he said. ""This is going to improve over the next year.""

The IRS as of late 2012 had more than 3,000 employees working on identity-theft-related issues, more than double the 2011 count, said Miller. An additional 35,000 employees have been trained to aid victims and help taxpayers recognize identity-theft indicators, he said.

After absorbing federal budget cuts during the last two fiscal years, the IRS has reassigned workers from other jobs to help with identity-theft response. The shifts affect other work, said Miller, but were needed because ""identity theft in its pernicious nature threatens the IRS as an enterprise"" by undermining taxpayer confidence.

He issued the victim aid pledge at the start of the annual federal tax-filing season while updating IRS efforts to block fraudulent tax refunds related to identity theft and stop the thieves behind the crime wave.

The IRS blocked issuance of more than $20 billion in fraudulent refunds in fiscal year 2012, up from $14 billion the year before, the agency reported.

Working with federal, state and local authorities, the IRS in January took action against 389 suspects in identity-theft-related actions. The effort included 109 arrests and 189 indictments, said Miller. A similar effort in January 2012, the start of the continuing crackdown, resulted in action against 105 suspects.

The IRS hasn't controlled the crime wave yet, said Miller, but he added, ""The more barriers we put up ... the more likely it is that criminals will turn elsewhere."""

http://news.yahoo.com/gop-leaders-impeachment-talk-premature-211834512.html,,[],GOP leaders say impeachment talk premature,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — The Republican National Committee chairman and a leading conservative, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, urged caution Monday for Republican critics calling for President Barack Obama's impeachment, but would not rule out impeachment altogether as new details emerged about the White House's role in the developing scandal at the Internal Revenue Service.

""There's a few chapters before we get to the last one. So it's up to us to connect the dots first,"" RNC chairman Reince Priebus told reporters when asked about impeachment ahead of a New Hampshire GOP fundraiser.

Some conservatives have compared recent IRS wrongdoing to the Watergate scandal, and Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., last week raised the prospect of impeachment.

""There isn't a weekend that hasn't gone by that someone says to me, 'Michele, what in the world are you all waiting for in Congress? Why aren't you impeaching the president? He's been making unconstitutional actions since he came into office,'"" Bachmann said during a Washington news conference with tea party leaders.

Paul, a tea party favorite who is considering a 2016 presidential bid, said such rhetoric is premature.

""We need to figure out the truth of what happened before we go anywhere else,"" Paul said, standing at Priebus' side.

The Internal Revenue Service has acknowledged inappropriate scrutiny of tea party groups applying for tax-exempt status ahead of the last election.

White House chief of staff Denis McDonough and other senior presidential advisers knew in late April that an upcoming report was likely to find that IRS employees had targeted conservative political groups. The White House said McDonough and the other advisers did not tell Obama about the impending report, leaving him to learn the results from news reports later.

The issue has given conservatives a new rallying cry following a disappointing 2012 election cycle. But some GOP leaders worry their criticism could backfire if it appears their attacks appear too politically motived.

Story continues

While striking a moderate tone on impeachment, Paul said Monday that it ""stretches credulity"" to think no one else in the Obama administration knew about the misconduct.

""For goodness sake, somebody's got to be fired, if not go to prison,"" he said in an evening speech to roughly 500 New Hampshire Republicans gathered in the state capital.

Priebus blamed Obama for creating a culture of political ""guerrilla warfare"" that allowed politics to infiltrate the IRS.

""I think this is just the beginning. It's certainly not the end,"" Priebus said. ""And I'm sure there's going to be a lot more to it. We'll see how far it goes. We'll see how high it goes, too."""

USA TODAY

The former Illinois congressman has admitted misusing %24750%2C000 in campaign funds

His wife%2C Sandi Jackson%2C has pleaded guilty to falsifying tax returns for six years

Jesse Jackson%27s lawyers link crime to his bipolar disorder%3B prosecutors cite %22greed and entitlement%22

WASHINGTON — Former Illinois congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. was sentenced to two and a half years in prison Wednesday for using $750,000 in campaign money for living expenses, trips and luxury goods — a stunning fall for a once-rising political star from a famous family.

Jackson and his wife, Sandi Jackson, treated campaign funds as a ""personal piggy bank,"" U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson told the Democrat, who represented Chicago's South Side for 17 years. ""There may be gray areas in campaign finance. This case did not come near to those areas.

""As a public official, you are supposed to live up to a higher standard of ethics and integrity,"" said the judge, who is no relation to the former congressman.

Sandi Jackson received a one-year prison term.

During an emotional hearing, both Jacksons tearfully admitted wrongdoing and begged the judge to consider the damage prison terms would inflict on their children, ages 13 and 9.

""I take responsibility for my actions,"" Jesse Jackson Jr. said, sobbing openly in court as his family looked on. ""I misled the American people.""

Both Jacksons received shorter prison terms than recommended by federal prosecutors, who sought to imprison him for four years and his wife for 18 months. Jesse Jackson Jr. could have several months shaved off his sentence for good behavior.

""No one is celebrating today,"" his lawyer Reid Weingarten said. ""The fall from grace is complete.""

Jackson, 48, is the son of civil rights leader and former presidential candidate, Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr.

The senior Jackson, who joined other family members in the courtroom Wednesday, said that his son's bipolar disorder had taken an enormous toll. ""A year ago, I thought we might have lost him,"" Jackson told reporters after the sentencing. ""He is still recovering.""

The sentencing ends a chapter in a years-long federal probe into the conduct of Jackson, who pleaded guilty in February to misusing campaign funds.

Court filings show Jackson used donors' money as his own, spending lavishly on luxury goods and services, including a $43,350 gold-plated men's Rolex watch, $5,687 for a ""holistic retreat"" in Martha's Vineyard and more than $5,000 on capes and fur parkas. He also used campaign funds for more commonplace expenses, such as dry cleaning and toothpaste purchased from Costco.

In court, Jackson's lawyers sought to tie his crimes to his mental condition. Weingarten called him a ""good person"" whose judgment was impaired by his bipolar disorder. He asked for leniency. ""There are not widows and orphans surrounding the courthouse wanting his head.""

Weingarten noted that lawmakers in the 1980s were permitted to use campaign money for personal expenses. ""If you took a microscope and looked at all these campaign (reports), you would find a lot of gray,"" he said.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves said the case ""strikes at the integrity of the campaign-finance system"" and deserved punishment

Prosecutors and the judge also questioned how big a role Jackson's mental health issues played in the theft of campaign funds that lasted for several years. The couple routinely used donors' money to supplement their income in ways that ""can't be chalked up to a periodic loss of control,"" said Jackson, the federal judge.

Sandi Jackson, a former Chicago alderman, pleaded guilty to falsifying to the couple's tax returns over a six-year period. Her lawyers sought to spare her prison time, saying she needed to care for her children. ""Give me her time,"" Jesse Jackson Jr. implored.

""My heart breaks every day with the pain it has caused my babies,"" Sandi Jackson said in court, her voice breaking.

""It's not the government that put your children in this position,"" the judge dryly told Sandi Jackson before ordering her to prison.

Graves, the prosecutor, said Sandi Jackson was not an unwitting accomplice to her husband's crimes. ""The facts show that she stole and that she stole a lot of money,"" he said.

Sandi Jackson used a credit card tied to her husband's campaign to pay for $171,000 in personal goods, Graves said. He ticked off a string of expenses funded with donors' contributions, including a Sub-Zero refrigerator, school fees and a trip to Walt Disney World.

The judge agreed to stagger the sentences to allow one parent to remain home with the children. Jesse Jackson Jr. will serve his time first and must report to authorities in November. Sandi Jackson will begin serving her sentence a month after her husband is released.

Jackson Jr. was first elected to Congress in a 1995 special election to replace Mel Reynolds, a Democrat who resigned after he was convicted of having sex with a teenage campaign worker.

Jackson won re-election by a wide margin last November, despite the federal investigation and his absence from both his congressional job and the campaign trail. Jackson had been on extended medical leave. He resigned from Congress several weeks after Election Day.

The judge recommended assigning the former congressman to a minimum-security federal prison camp in Montgomery, Ala., or a low-security facility near Raleigh, N.C. The Bureau of Prisons makes the final decision.

The case doesn't end with Wednesday's sentencing. Jackson still must pay $750,000 to the government. Sandi Jackson was order to pay $22,000 in restitution. That's money she took from her campaign account as a Chicago alderman and used to buy shoes, a visit to a Las Vegas spa and other personal expenses, the judge said.

By Fareed Zakaria

July 4 in America is a good time to reflect on the glories of U.S. democracy – especially given the turbulence in so many democracies these days, from Egypt to Brazil to Turkey.

More: Egypt's Morsy out, uncertainty in

As we watch these protests around the globe, we should keep in mind that the distinctive feature of the American system is actually not how democratic it is, but rather how undemocratic it is.

What do I mean? Well, we have three co-equal branches of government and the one with the final say on many issues, the Supreme Court, is composed of 9 unelected men and women. The American senate is the most unrepresentative upper house in the democratic universe, with the exception of Britain's House of Lords, which is utterly powerless. California's 38 million people have the same representation in the Senate as do Wyoming's 576,000. State and local governments battle federal power constantly. Private businesses and other non-governmental groups are also part of the mix.

Now there are aspects of this system that many Americans don't like – especially the abuse of the system by largely invented practices like the filibuster – but the basic system of checks and balances, as the famous phrase goes, has worked well.

The form of government that came out of the French revolution, by contrast, is one of absolute sovereignty, centralizing all power at the top. Since that revolution, France has had many upheavals and changes in its regime. It went through two monarchies, two empires, one proto-fascist dictatorship, and five republics before it got to the present regime. The United States, by contrast, has had a continuous constitutional existence since 1789.

Why is this important as we look at the world today? In so many of these cases, what we are watching are democratic governments, elected freely and fairly, that are abusing individual rights, ignoring minority groups, and eroding checks and balances. Observing the early flowering of this phenomenon in the mid-1990s, I described it as ""illiberal democracy,"" and that is the problem we confront in Egypt and so many developing countries.

The good news is that the other elements within these societies are fighting back against illiberal democracy – political groups, student movements, opposition parties. The clash between the Egyptian military and the Muslim Brotherhood reminds one of the many clashes between kings and lords, the church and the state, that produced the development of Western liberal democracy. It can look very messy while it's happening, neither side has a monopoly of virtue, but the contest between various centers of power over time helped create a system of checks and balances in the West.

So what we're watching around the world might look like crisis and breakdown, but it might turn out to be the road to better government.

Headlock Bob","SAN DIEGO -- Mayor Bob Filner has put the entire city of San Diego in one of his trademark headlocks.

Seven of nine City Council members, countless members of the local Democratic establishment, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee and U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein have demanded his resignation after seven women stepped forward to accuse the 70-year-old of multiple instances of unwanted, sexually charged touching. Two recall efforts have been launched.

Filner has admitted he has a problem, has apologized to the citizens of San Diego and the women he has “offended,” and has claimed in a Univision television interview that he has a “monster … inside me.” But, he maintains, he has not sexually harassed anyone.

So he’s hanging in there.

Amazingly, no one of any gravitas has stepped forward with a full-throated defense of the man. How could that be? He represented this area in Congress for 20 years and was a member of the San Diego City Council for six years before that.

Could it be because he is brusque, truculent, unpleasant to work for and given to inappropriate outbursts? His awfulness inspires extreme metaphors. One of his political enemies told reporter Liam Dillon of the Voice of San Diego that Filner is not just an [vulgar singular epithet] but “the Grand Canyon of [vulgar plural epithet].” Sorry I can’t spell it out, but use your imagination.

Don Harrison, a longtime friend of Filner who is editor of San Diego Jewish World, suggested in a column that Filner’s lack of support may be something the mayor wishes to ponder when he leaves for two weeks of behavioral rehab, scheduled to start Aug. 5.

Harrison created a list of 18 questions Filner should ask himself. Coming in at No. 13: “After all the good I have done in the political world, why has my support melted away so quickly? Are character issues — on which I now see I clearly have fallen short — more important than policy issues?”

Dillon, who has covered Filner for several years, offered this theory Monday: “He has upset so many people over the years that when it came time for someone to step in front of the bus for him, there was no one because he’d thrown them all under the bus already.”

Like many reporters, Dillon said he has often found the mayor’s candor and humor refreshing, but he has also had his share of Filner weirdness. Twice, Dillon said, the mayor has gently slapped him in the face for no apparent reason. The first slap occurred after a news conference in December 2011, when then-Rep. Filner received a union endorsement in his quest for mayor.

“I’d never had anyone hit me while I was doing my job before,” Dillon told me. “I was sort of taken aback.” Filner did it again sometime later at City Hall. “I put my finger in his face and said, ‘You’re not allowed to do that,’ ” Dillon said. “It never happened again.”

(Sam Hodgson, a Voice of San Diego photographer who witnessed the first slap, said he told a Filner staffer, “Your candidate just slapped our government reporter in the face.”)

San Diegans are not holding out much hope that the mayor’s rehab will be successful.

In an automated telephone survey released Friday, 67% said Filner should resign. Sixty percent said he should be recalled if he stays in office, and 74% said they believe the allegations are true. The unscientific survey, noting that the city attorney has asked that Filner never be alone with a woman while he is on city business, asked whether that affects his ability to run the city. Sixty-eight percent said it does.

Still, Headlock Bob is hanging in there.

And why shouldn’t he? In an awesome display of civic-mindedness, the chief executive of San Diego’s largest newspaper suggested last week at a community meeting that the politically conservative paper would not call for the liberal Filner’s resignation because the story is good for circulation, according to the San Diego Reader.

“I’ve got to be a little selfish,” said U-T San Diego CEO John Lynch, whose paper has been at odds with Filner for years. The mayor’s troubles, he said, are a “gift that keeps giving.”

And in an awesome display of chutzpah, Filner has asked the City Council to pay his legal bills in connection with the sexual harassment lawsuit brought by his former communications director, Irene McCormack Jackson. The council has invited public testimony Tuesday evening before it votes on the request in a closed session.

Meanwhile, two San Diegans have launched separate but equally dubious recall efforts.

One, Stampp Corbin, editor of the LGBT Weekly, is a longtime Filner supporter who may or may not have launched his recall in an effort to gum up an apparently more sincere effort announced Monday evening by Republican land-use consultant and longtime Filner foe Michael Pallamary.

(It’s getting hard to find a normal news conference in this town right now. On Monday, with a “No more Grabby Grabby” sign in the background, Pallamary, in a cringe-worthy move, trotted out his 8- and 10-year-old grandchildren to tell reporters they support their “Poppy.”)

Even if either recall effort gathers the more than 100,000 signatures needed to get a measure on the ballot, San Diego’s municipal recall code conflicts with state law, and would have to be amended by the City Council, which is about to go into its August recess.

As local television legal analyst Dan Eaton told NBC 7 here, on the off chance that a recall petition does qualify for the ballot, “You’re more likely looking at Christmas, and it might be well into 2014 before San Diegans get a chance to vote.”

What can the city do but cry uncle?

""The average family of four will see a $36 cut in their monthly benefits, bringing the average per-person benefit from $1.50 a meal to $1.40 a meal,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said. ""Shame on this Congress for allowing this to happen.""

But the cut, which will reduce monthly benefits for all 47 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by roughly 7 percent, is happening thanks mainly to Democratic votes that hastened the demise of a benefit increase from the 2009 stimulus bill. Each of the representatives at Tuesday's presser voted with their party for a pair of 2010 spending bills that set the cuts in motion.

The first bill took money allocated for future food stamp use and used it instead to prevent states from laying off teachers. Democrats supported the bill grudgingly, lamenting that it would cause a food stamp cut in 2014. When it came time to support a second bill that raided future food stamp funds once again, pushing the cut to November 2013, they protested -- at least at first.

""This is one of the more egregious cases of robbing Peter to pay Paul, and is a vote we do not take lightly,"" more than 100 Democrats wrote in an August 2010 letter to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

But then President Barack Obama smoothed things over in a meeting at the White House, because the bill in question was the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act -- a priority of the first lady's. The measure provided free lunches and updated nutrition standards for schools.

""I am very pleased we were able to work together with the president and his team to address concerns regarding cuts to the food stamp program that are included in the child nutrition bill,"" Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said in a statement at the time. On Tuesday, Lee told HuffPost the president had pledged to support replacing the SNAP funds, a vow he fulfilled in subsequent budget blueprints that didn't become law. Congress and the White House have been otherwise silent about the issue for the past three years.

On Tuesday, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) defended the 2010 tradeoff.

""It was a piece of legislation that said let's change nutrition standards, let's get junk foods out of our schools, and let's make sure that our kids can have those fruits and vegetables,"" DeLauro told HuffPost. ""There was no money for it. The price of it was $2.2 billion. That came from the food stamp program and all of us here complained. And we were opposed to that but we knew that it was a good first step in getting the Hunger-Free Kids Act.""

Friday's cut is happening thanks to the expiration of a 13.6 percent food stamp boost from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the stimulus bill. Originally, lawmakers had planned to let SNAP's annual inflation adjustments catch up to the increase sometime after 2015. Canceling the enhanced benefits this November means the government will spend $5 billion less on nutrition assistance next year -- an annual SNAP spending cut 25 percent larger than what House Republicans are seeking in farm bill negotiations starting this week.

DeLauro pivoted from November's food stamp decrease to Republican demands that food stamps be reduced by 5 percent, or $40 billion over 10 years, though the two things are completely separate.

""This is about people wanting to make a $40 billion cut in the food stamp program,"" DeLauro said, ""not to put in place a Hunger-Free Kids Act, but in fact to take food out of the mouths of our children, or seniors, and the disabled. A much different time, a much different place, and a much different set of circumstances."""

Among the answers he comes up with is the White House’s own arrogance.

Stein reviews a series of reasons why 2013 broke bad for the President. The Obamacare rollout gets top billing and unexpected events in Newtown and Syria also make the list. But at least a few people see the source of the problem as coming not from outside the White House but within it:

Mike Lux, who served as Obama’s liaison to the progressive community

during the 2008 White House transition and has been critical of the

administration since, argued that self-assuredness played a damaging

role, preventing Obama and his team from seeing problems on the horizon.

When would-be allies warned the White House about the looming dangers

of health care insurance cancelations or the potential backlash to a

Larry Summers Federal Reserve nomination, the advice was heard, but not

necessarily heeded. “I feel like the White House goes it alone too much,” said Lux. “In

advance of a battle or even in the early stages of a problem, it doesn’t

seem like they have gone out of their way to build unity and cohesion

in the party and with progressive allies.” A top progressive operative put it more bluntly: “These guys are

stunningly arrogant. They really believe that their shit doesn’t smell,

that they have all the answers. And that arrogance continues to hurt

them.”

Stein concludes that the hinge point of the bad year was Obamacare. That was the place where false promises and foreseeable problems all rushed together in a sickening crunch for the administration. After the government shutdown in October, the Republicans were polling badly and Obamacare was trending up despite the fact that the site did not work at all. Two months later, with the scope of their failure made clear, all of those gains have been reversed and then some."

I was covering Iran-Contra during the Reagan administration when [Peggy Noonan] was working for that president, in which we were funding a war illegally. We were trying to make a deal with the Iranians at the time. That was a pretty big damn scandal.

Brokaw seems to be employing a tactic common among has-been journalists these days. They seem to be afraid that any story seen as “bigger” than the stories they covered in their day somehow diminishes their life work, and therefore any suggestion to this effect must be smacked down immediately.

So, in Brokaw’s opinion:

The Department of Justice obtaining secret subpoenas naming reporters as an aider, abetter and co-conspirator and confiscating thousands of reporters’ phone records is not as serious as Abu Ghraib.

The President’s inaction as our consulate was under attack in Libya, resulting in the death of four Americans at the hands of terrorists, and the Administration’s efforts to mislead the press and American people during a presidential campaign doesn’t rise to the level of Abu Ghraib.

The IRS using their power and intimidation tactics to discriminate against groups and individuals because of their political beliefs is not as significant as Abu Ghraib

Brokaw explained his rationale for making Abu Ghraib the be all and end all of presidential scandals: “Abu Ghraib was a big scandal and how it – no one was really held accountable for it.”

If accountability (or lack thereof) is the new standard for scandals, then Brokaw needs to re-calibrate his memory of Abu Ghraib and the comparison to the Obama scandals. Eleven soldiers were convicted of various charges relating to the Abu Ghraib incident. Meanwhile, every single government employee involved with Benghazi, the IRS, HHS fundraising, AP subpoenas and the Fox News/James Rosen subpoenas continues to cash their paychecks and are in line for full government pensions.

No matter how boring and unimaginative you are, no matter how many facts you get wrong — all your cronies are always right there to back you up.

Jonathan Alter is a tiresome, washed-up leftist whose latest book — the title of which I forget — isn’t selling so well and didn’t do so well in the facts department. In other words, it has been an embarrassment of Joe McGinniss

proportions. And yet, over the past couple of weeks, Alter’s media comrades have attempted to come to his rescue to try to pump sales by any means necessary.

Earlier this week, The Huffington Post and Politico’s Dylan Byers both humiliated themselves with their transparently desperate attempts to help Alter out. And now it appears to be the Washington Post’s turn.

You would think that the sting of humiliation that comes with whiffing on the four biggest stories of the Obama presidency might result in something of a wake-up call for the financially troubled Post. But, as if to prove you can’t teach an old Palace Guard new tricks, yesterday the Post poured its bandwidth and investigative resources into… The Tale of the Fox News Supply Closet.

You see, in order to sell his book — other than groveling like a punk

— Alter salted his love letter to Obama with the kinds of tidbits he knew his fellow Obama-worshipping, Fox News-hating media pals would love: a bunch of nonsense about how Roger Ailes — one of the most successful network executives in history — is some kind of paranoid freak — you know, like Ted Turner.

Among a litany of over a dozen falsehoods about Ailes, Alter claimed that the Fox News chief is so paranoid about wiretaps (doesn’t sound so paranoid today!) that he “once worked out of a supply closet.” Ailes outright denied the claim to Politico, saying, “It’s completely false and silly. In fact, I had no idea we have a supply closet.”

Well, that obviously set off alarm bells at the same astute Washington Post that missed the IRS, AP, Verizon, and Benghazi scandals. And the result Friday was an in-depth, source-driven, 500-word investigative report into whether or not there are supply closets within the Fox News HQ.

No, I am not kidding.

And while it is fun to laugh this stuff off, you have to look at the The Matrix of what is really going on — which is pure character assassination.

Unlike the shriveling Post, Roger Ailes and Fox News are not only wildly succeeding in a media environment where almost everyone else is faltering, but they have been acting like real journalists in the fine tradition of what we saw from the Post during Watergate.

Unlike the Post, Fox News is not whiffing at these scandals or guarding The State’s palace. Instead, they are digging, asking tough questions, pressing for answers, breaking news, and letting Power know that there is at least one real watchdog among the many lapdogs.

But all Fox News and Ailes get in return is to find themselves being investigated and held accountable by a mainstream media — that not only refuse to do the same to the current administration, but are trying to prevent that from happening to the administration.

USA TODAY

Still%2C the president%27s approval rating is up 2 percentage points to 53%25

Nearly six in 10 say the federal government threatens their personal rights and freedoms

In a showdown between the government and the news media%2C more than six in 10 Americans side with the media

WASHINGTON —

Americans are divided over whether to believe the White House on controversies over the Libyan attack that killed a U.S. ambassador and the Internal Revenue Service targeting of Tea Party groups, but they overwhelmingly agree on this: The furors are going to make it more difficult for President Obama to get things done in his second term.

A USA TODAY poll conducted by Princeton Survey Research finds nearly three of four Americans say the controversies will make it harder for the president to accomplish his goals; nearly a third say they will make it much harder. Just one in five believe they won't have an impact.

The nationwide poll, taken Thursday through Sunday, finds skepticism about some of Obama's explanations of what happened. A 53% majority say the IRS decision to single out conservative groups for extra scrutiny before granting tax-exempt status was made for political reasons, something the administration flatly denies. By 50%-44%, they say Obama deserves at least a little of the blame, though the White House says he didn't know about it until the scandal was in the news.

On the other hand, even more of those surveyed are cynical about why Republicans are pursuing investigations into the attack last fall that left U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans dead. Six in 10 say Republicans are holding hearings on it more to score political points against the Democrats and Obama than to find ways to prevent future attacks. Even a third of Republicans say the hearings are driven by politics.

""With the Republicans clearly in a posture of driving a political agenda, there's a lot of risk for them, just as there's risk for the president,"" says Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist who was among a group that met with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough last week to discuss how the administration should move forward.

GOP pollster David Winston, an adviser to House Speaker John Boehner, points to the inclination by Americans to allot some of the blame for the IRS scandal to Obama. ""It means they aren't buying the Pfeiffer narrative,"" he says. Senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer on five TV talk shows Sunday said the president hadn't known about the targeting of conservative groups and acted appropriately when he learned of it.

Winston acknowledged GOP problems, too: ""The public is looking at what's going on and says neither one of them is doing what's needed to address the problem.""

The issues don't seem to be going away anytime soon.

Four congressional committees and the Justice Department are investigating the IRS. Douglas Shulman, a Bush appointee who headed the IRS during most of the questionable actions, is to testify today before the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Finance Chairman Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, and ranking Republican Orrin Hatch of Utah on Monday sent outgoing IRS commissioner Steven Miller a letter with 41 detailed questions about what transpired in the agency.

Pfeiffer says the controversies don't need to slow down work on other issues, including the push for an immigration overhaul.

""That's a question that only Republicans can answer,"" he said in an interview. ""Immigration continues to progress along without much attention as all these issues were unfolding last week, and it didn't seem to slow things down at all. If Republicans use these as an excuse to delay the people's business, that's one thing. If they continue to work with us, that's another.""

A BLIP OR A TURNING POINT?

Harvard professor Joseph Nye, one of the nation's leading presidential scholars, dismisses as overblown comparisons to big scandals that bedeviled previous second-term presidents, such as the Iran-contra affair during the Reagan administration. ""It's quite plausible a year from now or five years from now what we're seeing this week or two may turn out to be a blip rather than a major turning point,"" he says.

Even so, the impact is nonetheless costly for Obama, he says.

""It distracts him from other issues; obviously you've got to spend a fair amount of time on firefighting,"" says Nye, whose new book is titled Presidential Leadership and the Creation of the American Era. What's more, he says, ""in the election in 2012, you gain a certain amount of momentum which gives you a degree of authority. This chips away or undercuts that political momentum.""

The USA TODAY poll also asked about the disclosure that the Justice Department secretly had seized phone records of Associated Press reporters and editors while investigating a leak of classified information. In a showdown between the government and the news media, more than six in 10 Americans, 62%, say it is more important that the media be able to report stories they feel are in the national interest. Just 23% say it is more important that the government be able to censor news stories it feels threaten national security.

That is by far the highest level of support for the media in the 10 times the question has been asked over the past three decades in polls by Princeton Survey Research and Gallup. Only three previous times has a majority said it was more important to be able to report the story.

Those results reflect a swing by Republicans to the side of the press — possibly at least in part because doing so puts them at odds with the Democratic president. In 2006, the last time the question was asked, 53% of Republicans said it was more important that the government be able to censor news stories. Now, 53% say it's more important that the media be able to publish.

The poll of 1,002 adults by land line and cellphone has a margin of error of +/-3.6 percentage points.

Among other findings, those surveyed:

Are divided over whether the Obama administration was involved in a political coverup about the Benghazi attack; 40% see a coverup while 45% don't.

Disapprove of Obama's handling of the attack and its aftermath by 44%-37%. His critics feel more intensity about the issue: 26% strongly disapprove, compared with 16% who strongly approve.

Say the IRS action targeting conservative groups was done for political reasons, 53%-33%. Nineteen percent say Obama deserves a lot of the blame for it; 31% say just a little.

PERILS OF BIG GOVERNMENT

Nearly six in 10 say the federal government threatens their rights and freedoms, a line of attack that Boehner, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans have hammered as a theme against Obama. Fifty-eight percent call the government a threat — 35% call it a major threat, 23% a minor threat — while 37% say it's not a threat.

McConnell decried a ""culture of intimidation"" that he said linked the IRS controversy to the AP subpoena and even implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and Republicans predicted the controversies could expand as more information is uncovered. White House press secretary Jay Carney confirmed Monday that senior White House officials had been informed weeks ago about the IRS investigation but chose not to inform the president. And The Washington Post reported on its front page Monday on an aggressive investigation by the Justice Department into leaks to a Fox News Channel reporter.

""I have a hunch that a lot more is going to come out, frankly,"" Baucus, a Democrat, told Bloomberg's Capitol Gains TV program, referring to the IRS controversy. ""And I think it's important that we have the hearings, and I think that will encourage other information to come out that has not yet come out.""

So far, Americans don't seem transfixed by any of them. In a

Pew Research Center Poll,

taken at the same time in the same omnibus survey as the USA TODAY poll, one in four said they were following the IRS and Benghazi stories ""very closely""; just 16% were very closely following the story of the AP subpoenas. To compare, 30% were closely following news of the economy.

Other surveys haven't shown them hurting Obama's approval rating, at least so far. In a CNN/ORC poll taken Friday and Saturday, the president's approval rating was 53%, up 2 percentage points from the previous survey in early April. In the Gallup daily poll, Obama's approval rating Monday was 49%, in the same neighborhood it has been for a month.

""The general pattern with scandals is that the public doesn't care very much,"" says Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth who studies political scandals. ""Only the most significant scandals move the needle on approval. The pattern is a collective shrug from the public, in part because the people who pay attention to political news already have made up their minds about the president one way or another.""

That doesn't mean the controversies don't matter, he cautions. ""They clog up the news agenda and divert more of the interest of the media and the efforts of Congress into scandals and investigations instead of legislation.""

On that, Americans already agree."

Rucker Also Is Co-Author Of', 'A Very Stable Genius', 'A No. New York Times Bestseller']","In the Clintons’ talk of brokering compromise, an implicit rebuke of Obama years","In recent stump speeches and policy remarks, Bill and Hillary Clinton have offered sharp criticisms of the partisan gridlock paralyzing Washington, signaling a potential 2016 campaign theme if Hillary Clinton chooses to run for president.

The Clintons’ critiques in recent days have been explicitly aimed at congressional Republicans, who helped spur a 16-day government shutdown and potential debt default in October. But their remarks also seem to contain an implicit rebuke of President Obama’s failure to change Washington as he pledged when first running for the White House.

The arguments suggest a way that Hillary Clinton could attempt to run in 2016 as an agent of change — potentially putting her at odds with the two-term Democrat she would be seeking to replace.

At campaign rallies and other recent appearances, both Clintons have called for soothing partisan tensions and have espoused a vision of governing by compromise. Barnstorming Virginia this week with longtime friend and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, Bill Clinton repeatedly assailed ideological politics on both sides of the aisle.

“When people sneeringly say, ‘McAuliffe is a dealmaker,’ I say, ‘Oh, if we only had one in Washington during that shutdown,’ ” the former president said at a rally here in Norfolk on Monday. “It’s exhausting seeing politicians waste time with all these arguments. It is exhausting. People deserve somebody who will get this show on the road.”

Former President Bill Clinton headlined a rally for Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe on Monday night. Here's what you missed. (The Washington Post)

Such themes of change and comity are particularly ironic for the Clintons considering that one or the other has held public office in Washington for the past two decades. Bill Clinton’s tenure in office was also marked by fierce partisan battles that roiled the nation, including an impeachment fight and two government shutdowns.

In the 2008 Democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton dismissed Obama’s message of post-partisanship as woefully naive. But since stepping down as Obama’s secretary of state earlier this year, she has adopted a similar theme, repeatedly berating lawmakers for choosing “scorched earth over common ground.”

“We are careening from crisis to crisis instead of having a plan, bringing people to that plan, focusing on common-sense solutions and being relentless in driving toward them,” Clinton said last week during at a Center for American Progress gala.

Neither Clinton has brought up Obama directly in their remarks or explicitly criticized his leadership. Still, the Clintons’ general critiques carry echoes of the charges Republicans have frequently leveled against the current president: that Obama doesn’t respect their ideas and resists any compromise with them.

Obama has been making his own pleas for bipartisanship, even if they fall on deaf ears on Capitol Hill. “Now more than ever, America needs public servants who are willing to place problem solving ahead of politics,” he said at Wednesday’s memorial service for former House speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.).

The Clintons have been careful to distinguish between promoting bipartisanship and ceding ground on core values. Hillary Clinton, for example, has been busy advocating for traditionally liberal issues such as minority voting rights, gay marriage equality and women’s rights.

This appears to be an effort by Clinton, following a four-year hiatus from domestic politics, to cement ties to the Democratic Party’s progressive wing. If she runs, Clinton would want to avoid a repeat of the 2008 campaign, when Obama built support among liberal activists by running to her left on the Iraq war.

The Clintons’ message is one that Democrats across the country could carry into the 2014 midterm elections, where the battle for control of the Senate could come down to a handful of hotly contested races in states that lean Republican.

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D), who represents a Northern Virginia swing district, said after a recent McAuliffe rally that the message laid out by Bill Clinton would be “a really powerful theme into the next cycle.”

“We’re the party of governance,” Connolly added. “You want things to work? You have to eschew that hard-right, I-know-best ideology.”

In Kentucky, where Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R), Clinton recorded a video endorsing Grimes in which he says the nation needs more political leaders “willing to work together across the lines of party, geography and philosophy.”

“We have simply got to have more people who are willing to reach across the aisle and say, ‘I’m ready to work with you to build a better future,’ ” Clinton said.

In his Virginia speeches, Clinton said that he learned through eight years as president and 12 years as Arkansas governor that it’s important to advocate for your own philosophy but a mistake to not consider your opponent’s.

“When you’ve got a complicated set of problems with a lot of moving parts — and even Albert Einstein couldn’t give you the right answer to every question — the only thing that works is cooperation,” Clinton said Sunday in Dale City.

Principled compromise, Clinton asserted later that evening in Hampton, Va., is “a moral position.”

“It simply recognizes that nobody’s right all the time, your life is as important as mine, your opinion is entitled to the same respect mine is, and we’re all in this together, so we might as well work together to row this boat and go somewhere,” Clinton said.

Clinton’s presidency, however, was marred by plenty of partisan battles. Republicans torpedoed his health-care reform proposal and won control of the House midway through his first term. In 1995, a budget stalemate with the GOP-controlled House led to two separate government shutdowns. Three years later, the House voted to impeach Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

Nevertheless, Clinton credited his work across the aisle with balancing budgets and creating 22 million new jobs — and lamented the state of the country today.

“This economic thing, it’s terrible,” Clinton said in Hampton. “Median family income — after you adjust for inflation, is lower than it was the day I left office. That was a long time ago. And we need somebody who wants to do something about it.”

Many voters attending the rallies said they longed for a return to the Clinton era.

“He’s the voice of reason,” said Sally Mullikin, 52, a self-described women’s rights advocate from Richmond.

“We’re tired of the fighting,” said Eileen Slade, 63, a Democrat from Midlothian, Va., who was wearing a “Ready for Hillary” button. “We want compromise — whatever it takes to get things done.”

This is the sentiment that both Clintons have been channeling. At his Virginia stops, Bill Clinton repeatedly said the Founding Fathers wanted elected officials to be practical above all else, designing a system of governing that would force them to negotiate with each other.

“Read the Constitution of the United States of America,” Clinton said Sunday in Richmond. “It might as well have been subtitled, ‘Let’s Make a Deal.’ ”"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/opinion/keller-obamas-fault.html,2013-03-04 00:00:00,['Bill Keller'],Obama’s Fault - The New York Times,"In the summer of 2011, the president tried to find a grand bargain with House Republicans, and failed. Then, with the Republicans threatening to cut off the government’s borrowing power unless they got budget cuts, the White House and Republicans agreed on a bad bargain: the debt ceiling was raised, and the sequester was launched. There is a strong argument to be made (Noam Scheiber made it well last year in his book “The Escape Artists: How Obama’s Team Fumbled the Recovery”) that the president was unwise to let Republican zealots get away with such blackmail. Authorizing the government to pay the bills Congress has already incurred should be a matter of routine, not ransom. But the sequester was locked and loaded.

Which brings us to missed opportunity No. 2. Remember, the original plan was for the sequester to detonate at the beginning of this year, at the same time as the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. These twin shocks were supposed to work together to drive both parties toward the middle. For Republicans, the horrible prospect of an automatic, across-the-board tax increase (plus sequester’s deep cuts in defense spending) would be reason to come to the negotiating table. For Democrats, the opportunity to extract a little more tax money from the wealthy (plus the threat of cuts to cherished domestic programs) would be incentive to bargain.

But with 2012 winding down, the White House and House Republicans struck another bad deal. They let the Bush tax breaks expire for the top bracket, while making them permanent for everyone else. The sequester spending cuts were postponed until — well, until now.

That year-end tax deal was not a negotiating triumph for the Democrats. Obama wanted $1.2 trillion in new revenues over 10 years. Boehner let it be known he would go as high as $800 billion. By the time the master deal-makers of the White House were done, the “compromise” tax hike was $620 billion. I’d love to be the guy who sells the president his next car.

But the bigger mistake was to do the deal at all. Here we had Washington staring down the double barrels of that fiscal shotgun — automatic spending cuts and automatic tax hikes — and the White House agreed to remove one barrel. Once the tax deal was done, the Republicans, having budged once on taxes, felt no inclination to budge again. As John Boehner would say, over and over, “He’s gotten his tax hikes.” And with Republicans unwilling to revisit the issue of taxes, Democrats had even less enthusiasm for a broader budget bargain that would cut programs they regard as sacred.

If Obama had held firm and let the Bush tax cuts expire for everyone, as some recommended at the time, he would now have at his disposal a powerful inducement for both parties to come together. A bargain could be built around restoring the lower rates for most taxpayers. With an actual, large tax cut at the heart of it, you just might construct the kind of big bipartisan bargain that has been so elusive. But it’s too late for that."

Helderman', 'Reporter Focusing On Political Enterprise Stories', 'July', 'Rosalind Helderman Is A Political Enterprise', 'Investigations Reporter For The Washington Post. She Joined The Post In']",Virginia Democrat to Gov. McDonnell: Explain gifts or resign,"A Democratic state senator on Tuesday called on Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) to detail and return all gifts given to members of his family by a prominent donor — or resign from office.

State Sen. J. Chapman Petersen (Fairfax) became the first elected official in either party to raise the possibility that the governor should resign over the gifts.

In a letter to the governor, Petersen wrote that revelations about gifts provided by dietary supplement manufacturer Jonnie R. Williams Sr. gave “the strong impression that your family was materially and systematically benefited by this person and his company.”

“In return, it appears you allowed this person to use the Governor’s Mansion and the Governor’s Office for the purpose of giving unique credibility to his company,” Petersen wrote in the letter. “That is unacceptable.”

Petersen wrote that if the governor can’t explain or deny the reports or return the items, he would “humbly suggest” that McDonnell step down.

Tucker Martin, a spokesman for the governor, called the letter “blatantly political” and “not unexpected,” citing a blog post from Petersen questioning why Democrats did not joke about the Williams situation at a major annual fundraiser Saturday.

Petersen’s call comes as anxiety has deepened in Richmond over the growing controversy, which has sparked state and federal investigations.

One Republican lawmaker said Tuesday that there is now “concern” among his colleagues about the effectiveness of McDonnell for the rest of his term. Another Republican said GOP legislators are “appalled.” Both lawmakers spoke on the condition of anonymity so that they could speak freely about the governor.

“It’s just embarrassing,” the GOP lawmaker said. “Why wouldn’t they be jumping up and down about this?” the Republican said of Democrats. “Every time I see something new on this, I just think, ‘You have got to be kidding me.’ ”

But those sentiments are being expressed among Republicans only quietly, to avoid deepening the governor’s troubles.

And Democrats have been virtually silent about McDonnell, even as they have hammered Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II, the GOP nominee for governor, over his ties to the same donor.

A spokesman for the state Democratic Party, Brian Coy, did not directly address whether party leaders agreed with Petersen’s call, instead indicating that McDonnell should “address questions and cooperate with the two ongoing investigations.”

A spokesman for Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic candidate for governor, noted that McAuliffe has called for a ban on gifts valued at more than $100 but also declined to join Petersen’s effort.

“There are ongoing investigations that will provide concrete facts and evidence so that Virginians know exactly what happened,” spokesman Josh Schwerin said.

Williams paid $15,000 for the catering at the 2011 wedding of McDonnell’s daughter. Authorities are also investigating whether Williams provided tens of thousands of dollars in additional payments to members of the McDonnell family, as well as gifts of high-end clothing, according to people familiar with the inquiry.

One of those gifts was a $6,500 Rolex watch for the governor that had been solicited from Williams by first lady Maureen McDonnell, those people have said. The governor wore the watch in a January 2012 interview with the Richmond Times Dispatch and told the newspaper that it was a gift from his wife.

He did not disclose the catering, he has said, because it was a wedding present to his daughter. He has not addressed other gifts from Williams, including the additional money, clothes or the Rolex.

McDonnell has said he has been diligent in his annual financial disclosures of gifts he received, but he has repeatedly refused to publicly outline all of the gifts Williams gave to Maureen McDonnell or other members of his family.

He has said he is constrained in what he can say on the topic because of the investigations.

“As an attorney, certainly Senator Petersen understands this office’s not discussing the details of matters pending in the legal process,” Martin said in a statement Tuesday. “And, as a legislator, certainly, Senator Petersen is aware that Virginia’s disclosure requirements do not pertain to the families of elected officials.”

The gifts came as the McDonnells took steps to promote Star Scientific and its product, a non-FDA-approved anti-inflammatory called Anatabloc.

On Aug. 1, 2011, Williams met with a top policy adviser for the Department of Health and Human Resources to pitch his product, at a meeting organized by Maureen McDonnell.

The first couple allowed the company to use the governor’s mansion for a luncheon marking the launch of the product in August 2011.

The governor has characterized those efforts as part of a broad campaign to boost state business and said the company got no special benefits, including economic incentive grants or state contracts, from his administration.

According to state law, McDonnell must disclose all gifts to him worth more than $50. But he does not have to disclose gifts to immediate family members or gifts received from family or “personal friends.”

He has said he has known Williams for four or five years and considers him a “family friend.”

Since taking office in 2010, McDonnell has disclosed receiving $9,650 in personal gifts — including private plane rides and a summer lake house vacation — from Williams and Star Scientific.

Petersen said in an interview that he decided to write the letter because he was disturbed by what he termed the “deafening silence” from the political establishment about the revelations.

“I’m not saying it’s legal or it’s illegal. I’m saying it’s unacceptable,” he said."

Updated 9:32 p.m. ET 7/8/2013

(CNN) – Gracie Mansion isn't the only contested hotspot for political redemption in New York City this year.

The day after former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer announced his campaign for city comptroller, he was issued a direct challenge for the post by a woman who says she was the madam who supplied him with escorts.



Self-described ""ex-madam"" Kristin Davis used Spitzer's campaign to once again announce her already-declared candidacy for comptroller on Monday.

""Eliot Spitzer broke state and federal laws in his use of prostitutes and paid no penalty; I broke the law and paid my debt to society,"" Davis, who served four months in prison, said in a statement. ""There cannot be two standards of justice, one for the average citizen and another for the political and social elite.""

Spitzer, a Democrat, resigned as governor in 2008 amidst a scandal surrounding his use of prostitutes.

Spitzer: 'You need skin as thick as a rhinoceros'

Davis, a former hedge fund senior vice president, first filed with the city campaign finance board in September of 2012 to run for city-wide office. The exact post she was seeking was not specified at the time. She filed to run specifically for comptroller in June, according to the board. Her campaign now needs at least 3,750 signatures to qualify for the ballot.

This is not Davis' first go at public office, nor her first time using the title of ""Elliot Spitzer's madam"" in her campaign. She ran as a protest candidate for New York governor in 2010.

Self-avowed madam who claims Spitzer ties is running for NY governor

Now running as a Libertarian with a plan to legalize marijuana in New York City, Davis first announced her campaign in April. She did so in a release challenging the other major candidate for city comptroller, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer.

""I have more financial management experience than either Eliot Spitzer or Scott Stringer,"" Davis said in her statement Monday. ""They are both career politicians looking to use the office of Comptroller as a stepping stone to higher office.""

Stringer had originally been considered a candidate for mayor until he instead announced a candidacy for comptroller. He left a crowded field of mayoral contenders that has become increasingly complicated, particularly by the official candidacy of former Congressman Anthony Weiner.

Weiner quickly found himself at the head of the race for the Democratic primary, polls show. This despite having resigned from office in 2011 after he was caught sending lewd photos of himself on Twitter.

Polls: Weiner gaining ground in NYC mayoral battle

Spitzer and Weiner make two current New York City candidates whose sexual improprieties led to falls from power. And they are not alone.

This has become the season of political resurrection, a season best exemplified by Republican Rep. Mark Sanford's successful campaign for the U.S House of Representatives.

When politics gives you a second chance

In 2010 and 2011, Spitzer co-hosted a political talk show on CNN."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/14/NY-Times-Clinton-Foundation-Rife-With-Cronyism,2013-08-14 00:00:00,['Wynton Hall'],NY Times: Clinton Foundation Rife with Cronyism,"On Wednesday, the New York Times ran a blistering investigative report revealing the Clinton Foundation as a nonprofit rife with crony capitalist conflicts of interest and multi-million dollar deficits despite raking in at least $492 million from 1997 to 2007.

In 2007 and 2008, the Clinton Foundation, which is soon to be renamed the “Bill, Hillary, & Chelsea Clinton Foundation,” ran a $40 million deficit. Last year, it ran a deficit of over $8 million despite the Foundation and two subsidiaries generating $214 million in revenues.

Hillary Clinton plans to relocate her offices to the Foundation’s Manhattan headquarters in the weeks to come. Former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Clinton planned to use the Foundation as a “launching pad into 2016,” a reference to her potential presidential run.

The nexus between Clinton Foundation donors, foreign governments, and corporate interests has long been a concern to government watchdog groups. As of 2008, the Clinton Foundation raised at least $46 million from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Brunei, Oman, and other foreign governments–the very governments Secretary of State Hillary Clinton eventually negotiated with. Wealthy foreign investors, like Saudi businessman Nasser Al-Rashid and Indian politician Amar Singh gave at least $1 million each.

Previous news accounts have chronicled how Clinton Foundation donors have profited. In 2004, New York developer Robert Congel donated $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Shortly thereafter, Sen. Hillary Clinton reportedly helped the developer bag millions in federal assistance for his mall project. Congel and Hillary Clinton’s spokesperson denied any crony pay-to-play connection.

The New York Times says the cronyism and conflicts have reached critical mass. “The Clinton Foundation had become a sprawling concern, supervised by a rotating board of old Clinton hands, vulnerable to distraction and threatened by conflicts of interest,” reports the Times. “It ran multimillion-dollar deficits for several years, despite vast amounts of money flowing in.”

Despite the apparent fiscal mismanagement, well-connected Clinton allies appear to be doing quite well. In 2009, Douglas Band, whom Clinton insiders describe as a “kind of surrogate son to Mr. Clinton,” co-founded Teneo, a consultancy that has since hired Hillary Clinton confidante and disgraced mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner spouse Huma Abedin. As the Times explains:

Mr. Band poached executives from Wall Street, recruited other Clinton aides to join as employees or advisers and set up shop in a Midtown office formerly belonging to one of the country’s top hedge funds….Teneo worked on retainer, charging monthly fees as high as $250,000, according to current and former clients. The firm recruited clients who were also Clinton Foundation donors while Mr. Band and Mr. Kelly encourage4d others to become new foundation donors….Some Clinton aides and foundation employees began to wonder where the foundation ended and Teneo began.

Among Teneo’s earliest clients was now-defunct MF Global, run by disgraced Obama bundler Jon S. Corzine.

The Times says Chelsea Clinton “became increasingly concerned” that Band and Teneo’s outside business were negatively impacting the Foundation.

Now, the Times says Hillary, Bill, and Chelsea Clinton are gearing up for a $250 million fundraising push as Hillary prepares to use the Foundation “as a base for her to home in on issues and build up a stable of trusted staff members who could form the core of a political campaign.”"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/opinion/keller-salvaging-obama.html,2013-11-11 00:00:00,['Bill Keller'],Salvaging Obama - The New York Times,"But even if the chances of success are small, the more the White House presses the issue, the more it isolates the ideologues from the pragmatists, and the more it separates the right wing from business donors.

As Paul Taylor, who follows immigration for Pew Research, puts it: “It’s better politics if the president wins, but it’s still good politics if he loses.”

Rebalance foreign policy.

For years the administration has talked of “rebalancing” our military strategy to address an increasingly assertive China. The Pentagon, liberated from Iraq and drawing down in Afghanistan, has taken some modest steps in this direction, deploying more of the Navy to Asia, devoting more resources to China’s space and cyber threats. But our rivalry with China is not, and should never be, primarily military. We need to compete on the fields of economics and diplomacy. Unfortunately the civilian custodians of our foreign policy have been bogged down in the Middle East, a region that matters a lot, but not as much as it did when we were more dependent on imported oil.

In the Middle East, Obama is now pretty much where he wants to be — jaw-jaw, not war-war, as Churchill liked to say — and that is clearly where the American people prefer him to be. Talks (hopeful) are underway to rid Syria of chemical weapons and (less hopeful) to find a diplomatic end to that country’s civil war. There is fitful progress in the talks aimed at testing whether Iran’s new president has the will and the authority to put a verifiable lid on that country’s nuclear program. Talks are taking place on the eternal conundrum of Israel’s coexistence with the Palestinians. Success at any of those tables would be a blessing to humanity and a great lift for the president.

But while diplomats are patiently tending these negotiations, there is time to pay attention to unfinished Asia business. The biggest item awaiting some Washington juice is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an immense, stalled, Asian free-trade agreement that would do more to counter burgeoning China than any number of battleships.

Like most free-trade agreements, it has opposition, from critics who fear it would insufficiently protect labor, consumers, the environment and intellectual property. It’s time for the administration to cut some deals, crack some heads and open up those Asian markets.

Forget the Grand Bargain. Go for little bargains.

The idea of a grand fiscal bargain — a megadeal that wins bipartisan support on the whole complex of spending, taxes and entitlements — was all the rage a year ago, but it has passed its sell-by date. Not only has it proven politically unattainable as long as the House is in thrall to a band of least-government ideologues, it has also been overtaken by reality. Even relatively conservative economists concede that the deficit — a very sustainable 4 percent of gross domestic product — is not the problem, at least not in the foreseeable future. There is a distant problem for Social Security and Medicare as my baby-boom generation retires, and it would be nice to address it before young Americans find the cupboard bare. But the immediate and urgent problems are sluggish growth and too few jobs."

Such as the one just spectacularly blown up in the Senate. To get three judges onto a coveted circuit court, frustrated Democrats abolished the filibuster for executive appointments and (non-Supreme Court) judicial nominations.

The problem is not the change itself. It’s fine that a president staffing his administration should need 51 votes rather than 60. Doing so for judicial appointments, which are for life, is a bit dicier. Nonetheless, for about 200 years the filibuster was nearly unknown in blocking judicial nominees. So we are really just returning to an earlier norm.

The violence to political norms here consisted in how that change was executed. By brute force — a near party-line vote of 52 to 48 . This was a disgraceful violation of more than two centuries of precedent. If a bare majority can change the fundamental rules that govern an institution, then there are no rules. Senate rules today are whatever the majority decides they are that morning.

What distinguishes an institution from a flash mob is that its rules endure. They can be changed, of course. But only by significant supermajorities. That’s why constitutional changes require two-thirds of both houses plus three-quarters of the states. If we could make constitutional changes by majority vote, there would be no Constitution.

In fact, that wasn’t the case. Thousands who had bought insurance have been receiving cancellations notices from insurers.

As of today, the Senate effectively has no rules. Congratulations, Harry Reid. Finally, something you will be remembered for.

Barack Obama may be remembered for something similar. His violation of the proper limits of executive power has become breathtaking. It’s not just making recess appointments when the Senate is in session. It’s not just unilaterally imposing a law Congress had refused to pass — the Dream Act — by brazenly suspending large sections of the immigration laws.

We’ve now reached a point where a flailing president, desperate to deflect the opprobrium heaped upon him for the false promise that you could keep your health plan if you wanted to, calls a hasty news conference urging both insurers and the states to reinstate millions of such plans.

Except that he is asking them to break the law. His own law. Under Obamacare, no insurer may issue a policy after 2013 that does not meet the law’s minimum coverage requirements. These plans were canceled because they do not.

The law remains unchanged. The regulations governing that law remain unchanged. Nothing is changed except for a president proposing to unilaterally change his own law from the White House press room.

That’s banana republic stuff, except that there the dictator proclaims from the presidential balcony.

Remember how for months Democrats denounced Republicans for daring to vote to defund or postpone Obamacare? Saboteurs! Terrorists! How dare you alter “the law of the land.”

This was nonsense from the beginning. Every law is subject to revision and abolition if the people think it turned out to be a bad idea. Even constitutional amendments can be repealed — and have been (see Prohibition).

After indignant denunciation of Republicans for trying to amend “the law of the land” constitutionally (i.e. in Congress assembled), Democrats turn utterly silent when the president lawlessly tries to do so by executive fiat.

Nor is this the first time. The president wakes up one day and decides to unilaterally suspend the employer mandate, a naked invasion of Congress’s exclusive legislative prerogative, enshrined in Article I. Not a word from the Democrats. Nor now regarding the blatant usurpation of trying to restore canceled policies that violate explicit Obamacare coverage requirements.

And worse. When Congress tried to make Obama’s “fix” legal — i.e., through legislation — he opposed it. He even said he would veto it. Imagine: vetoing the very bill that would legally enact his own illegal fix.

At rallies, Obama routinely says he has important things to do and he’s not going to wait for Congress. Well, amending a statute after it’s been duly enacted is something a president may not do without Congress. It’s a gross violation of his Article II duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.

A Senate with no rules. A president without boundaries. One day, when a few bottled-up judicial nominees and a malfunctioning health-care Web site are barely a memory, we will still be dealing with the toxic residue of this outbreak of authoritative lawlessness.

Steven Miller, appearing on the Hill for a second hearing in two weeks on the scandal, acknowledged that the agency was trying to get ahead of a damning investigative report at the time. As was confirmed over the weekend, he admitted the agency had a question planted at a conference two Fridays ago -- a senior IRS official, in response to the question, then confessed to a long-running program that singled out conservative groups for additional scrutiny.

""Obviously the entire thing was an incredibly bad idea,"" Miller said.

Miller explained that the agency had been trying to brief lawmakers on the Hill, in advance of the release of the inspector general report. But that ""did not work out,"" he said, so they used the planted question.

""The report was coming, we knew that,"" he told the Senate Finance Committee.

The issue raised more questions for lawmakers about the way in which the agency addressed public concerns about the screening program. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, criticized the IRS for using the planted question to come forward, suggesting it compounded the problems with the agency's response.

In a tense round of questioning, Hatch also asked why neither Miller nor former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman acknowledged the program before -- Congress had been asking about the allegations since 2012.

Shulman claimed he did not have a ""full set of facts,"" but said he was aware in the spring of 2012 there was an internal list that included the term ""Tea Party."" That list was used as the basis for singling out some groups applying for tax-exempt status. Shulman also said he did not know how the controversial program started, adding that lower-level officials ""should have run up the chain"" their knowledge about the program earlier.

""You should have corrected the record, and you should have done it long before today,"" Hatch said.

He also accused Miller of lying when he didn't acknowledge the program in letters to Congress last year, despite being aware of it.

""That's a lie by omission, there's no question about that in my mind,"" Hatch said.

Miller, as he claimed last week, said he ""did not lie.""

Shulman got into another tense exchange with Republican Sen. John Cornyn, when the former commissioner refused to apologize for the practice which started under his leadership.

Shulman said he was ""deeply, deeply saddened"" by what happened and acknowledged it started ""on my watch."" But he said he's not ""personally responsible"" for creating the screening list.

Cornyn later said that the response was ""an insult.""

The hearing followed one by the House oversight committee last week; they are likely just the first of several as committees begin to investigate the IRS program.

""The IRS abandoned good judgment and lost the public's trust,"" said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, at the start of Tuesday's hearing.

Hatch, the top Republican on the panel, alleged that officials didn't decide to come clean until the investigative report was imminent and ""their hand was forced.""

""Were they simply holding out until after the election?"" Hatch asked.

It was the first time lawmakers were able to question Shulman, the man who ran the IRS when agents were improperly targeting Tea Party groups.

The Senate Finance Committee, which has launched a bipartisan probe, was also hearing from Inspector General J. Russell George.

Shulman faced scrutiny, after having told a House committee in March 2012 there was ""absolutely no targeting"" by the IRS of conservative organizations. Shulman, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, left the IRS in November when his five-year term ended.

The hearing comes after White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that the president's counsel was told on April 24 about the preliminary findings of an IRS audit that showed tax officials unfairly targeted Tea Party groups. Senior legal counsel Kathryn Ruemmler was told about the audit on April 24, Carney said Monday. She then told Denis McDonough, Obama's chief of staff and other senior officials about the investigation.

""It was the judgment of counsel this is not a matter she should convey to the president,"" Carney said.

Carney also said while Ruemmler knew the subject of the investigation and potential findings, they were not given a draft of the report and understood details could change.

Ahead of the hearing, Baucus and Hatch sent a letter to the IRS Monday, asking for an explanation. The letter included 41 separate requests for information. They gave the IRS until May 31 to respond.

The two senators said the IRS had not been forthcoming about the issue in the past.

""Targeting applicants for tax-exempt status using political labels threatens to undermine the public's trust in the IRS,"" Baucus and Hatch wrote. ""Lack of candor in advising the Senate of this practice is equally troubling.""

For more than a year, from 2011 through the 2012 election, members of Congress repeatedly asked Shulman about complaints from Tea Party groups that they were being harassed by the IRS.

Shulman's responses, usually relayed by a deputy, did not acknowledge that agents had ever targeted Tea Party groups for special scrutiny. At a congressional hearing March 22, 2012, Shulman was adamant in his denials.

""There's absolutely no targeting. This is the kind of back and forth that happens to people"" who apply for tax-exempt status, Shulman said at the House Ways and Means subcommittee hearing.

The IRS has said Shulman did not know about the targeting at the time of the hearing.

The agency's inspector general says he told Shulman on May 30, 2012, that his office was auditing the way applications for tax-exempt status were being handled, in part because of complaints from conservative groups. However, the inspector general said he did not reveal the results of his investigation.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/12/rogers-irs-targeting-tea-party-and-other-political-groups-intimidation/,2013-05-12 00:00:00,[],"Republicans slam IRS targeting of Tea Party as 'chilling,' a form of intimidation","Washington Republicans on Sunday characterized the IRS targeting Tea Party groups and other conservative political organizations as “chilling” and intimidating acts that heighten Americans' mistrust in government.

Their comments follow the IRS acknowledgment Friday that the agency targeted such groups during the 2012 election cycle to see whether they were violating their tax-exempt status -- a revelation followed by a report that such activity dated back to the previous year.

“The conclusion that the IRS came to is that they did have agents who were engaged in intimidation of political groups,” Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers told “Fox News Sunday.” “I don't care if you're a conservative, a liberal, a Democrat or a Republican, this should send a chill up your spine. It needs to have a full investigation.”

Evidence that the IRS was flagging such groups in 2011 was included in a draft inspector general's report obtained Saturday by Fox News and other news organizations and is expected to be released in full later this week.

That information seemingly contradicts public statements by IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman, who told congressional investigators in March 2011 that specific groups were not being targeted.

On Sunday, Fox News obtained a timeline from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that shows the practice started in 2010 and that IRS agents also were looking for groups associated with such phrases as ""We the People,"" and ""Take Back the Country.""

Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins on Sunday also called the IRS activities chilling and said she was disappointed that President Obama had not condemned the actions.

“This is truly outrageous and it contributes to the profound distrust that the American people have in government,” Collins told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “It is absolutely chilling that the IRS was singling out conservative groups for extra review. And I think that it’s very disappointing that the president hasn’t personally condemned this.”

At about the same time, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney released a statement saying: “If the inspector general finds that there were any rules broken or that conduct of government officials did not meet the standards required of them, the president expects that swift and appropriate steps will be taken to address any misconduct.""

Michigan Republican Rep. Dave Camp, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said Friday his committee will hold a hearing on the issue.

The IRS said Friday that it was sorry for what it called the ""inappropriate"" targeting of the conservative groups during the 2012 elections.

But the draft report seemingly contradicts public statements by Shulman and shows senior IRS officials knew agents were targeting Tea Party groups as early as 2011.

Lois G. Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt organizations, said Friday that the practice was initiated by low-level workers in Cincinnati and was not motivated by political bias.

But on June 29, 2011, Lerner found out that such groups were being targeted, according to the inspector general's report.

She was told at a meeting that groups with ""Tea Party,"" ""Patriot"" or ""9/12 Project"" in their names were being flagged for additional and often burdensome scrutiny, the report states.

The 9/12 Project is a group started by conservative TV personality Glenn Beck.

Collins also said she does not believe the activity was limited to “a couple of rogue IRS employees.""

""After all,” she added, “groups with `progressive' in their names were not targeted similarly.""

California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Affairs, was also dubious about the explanation that the flagging was a limited, low-level activity.

""This mea culpa is not an honest one,"" he told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Lerner said that about 300 groups were singled out for additional review, with about one-quarter scrutinized because they had ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" somewhere in their applications.

She also said 150 of the cases have been closed and no group had its tax-exempt status revoked, though some withdrew their applications.

The allegations were first made by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington, D.C., think tank. It claimed the EPA was not being fair as it weighed whether to charge fees to groups seeking information via Freedom of Information Act requests.

Its research showed liberal groups have their fees for documents waived about 90 percent of the time, while conservative groups are denied fee waivers about 90 percent of the time.

""This activity calls into question the objectivity of the FOIA employees at EPA and undermines public confidence in an agency that is charged with protecting our air and water,"" a group of nearly three dozen House Republicans wrote in a letter to EPA Acting Administrator Bob Perciasepe.

Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., chairman of the Republican Study Committee, said in a separate statement that the findings are ""not a coincidence"" and track with the kind of targeting conducted by the IRS against conservative groups.

""Politics should not play a role in approving or denying fee waivers, and the EPA clearly crossed the line by injecting bias and favoritism into their decision making process,"" he said.

In the letter, he and other lawmakers asked a string of questions on the EPA policy governing fee waivers, including who is in charge of that determination.

The letter follows efforts by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to probe the allegations.

Perciasepe told the House Energy and Commerce Committee on May 16 that ""our policy is to treat everybody the same,"" and the agency is considering pursuing an investigation.

In a statement to Fox News, the EPA said: ""The Office of Inspector General received from the Environmental Protection Agency the official request to look into this matter just over a week ago, so the request is currently under review by the OIG at this early stage.""

http://news.yahoo.com/white-house-insists-obama-not-involved-irs-141138176.html,,[],White House insists Obama was not involved in IRS,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A top White House adviser insisted Sunday that President Barack Obama learned the Internal Revenue Service had targeted tea party groups only ""when it came out in the news"" while Republicans continued to press the administration for more answers.

Trying to move past a challenging week that put the White House on the defensive, senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer was scheduled to appear on five Sunday news shows to repeat the administration's position that no senior officials were involved in the decision to give tea party groups extra scrutiny. Pfeiffer's appearances were unlike to quiet GOP critics, who have seized on the revelations as proof that Obama used the IRS to go after his political enemies.

""The deputy secretary of the treasury was made aware of just the fact that the investigation was beginning last year,"" Pfeiffer said. ""But no one in the White House was aware.""

Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., suggested there was a written policy to target conservative groups opposing the president, but when pressed could not provide details.

""I haven't seen a policy statement, but I think we need to see that,"" Paul said. ""And when that comes forward, we need to know who wrote the policy and who approved the policy.""

Regardless of when the president first learned of the investigations, Pfeiffer said the president wanted to ensure such activities were not repeated.

""The activity was outrageous and inexcusable, and it was stopped and it needs to be fixed to ensure it never happens again,"" Pfeiffer said.

A Treasury Department inspector's report said this week that conservative and small-government tea party groups that were critical of Obama received extra scrutiny. IRS agents did not flag similar progressive or liberal groups, according to the watchdog.

The report concluded that a regional IRS office in Ohio improperly singled out tea party and other conservative groups for more than 18 months and took no action on many of their applications for tax-exempt status for long periods of time — hindering their fundraising for the 2010 and 2012 elections.

Story continues

The new acting IRS commissioner is in the midst of a 30-day top-to-bottom review while Republicans continue to demand answers of Obama and his allies in government.

That's not sufficient, said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio.

""I think a special counsel is going to wind up being necessary,"" he added said.

That move is not needed, said Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.

""I don't see the point,"" he said of a special counsel to investigate the scandal.

Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., said the IRS had stepped so far over its mandate that it asked book groups for reading lists and church groups about their prayers before granting them tax-exempt standing. It's government over-reach, he said, and a reason why Republicans need to have their own investigation into the agency.

""This is about trust,"" Price said.

But he stopped short of calling for a special counsel.

Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., said Republicans were using the incidents to embarrass the president.

""There is no Republican agenda other than to stop the president of the United States,"" he said.

BuzzFeed later reported that the official was Gene Sperling, who heads President Obama's White House Economic Council.

Woodward has repeatedly accused the White House of ""moving the goal posts"" in the fight over the looming budget sequester. He has been challenged on the facts of his assertions many times, but has not strayed from his claims.

UPDATE: Sean Hannity will interview Woodward on Fox News tomorrow night, according to a tweet from Politico's Dylan Byers.

Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday, Woodward described a tense series of exchanges he had with the White House.

""Well, they're not happy at all, and some people kind of, you know, said, look, we don't see eye to eye on this,"" Woodward said. ""They've said that this is factually wrong, and it was said to me in an e-mail by a top --""

""What was said?"" Blitzer prodded. ""It was said very clearly, you will regret doing this,"" Woodward said.

""Who sent that e-mail to you?"" Blitzer asked. ""Well, I'm not going to say,"" Woodward said.

""Was it a senior person at the White House?"" Blitzer asked.

""A very senior person,"" Woodward said. ""It makes me very uncomfortable to have the White House telling reporters, you're going to regret doing something that you believe in.""

Woodward also spoke to Politico, and read out part of the email. He said he had been ""yelled at"" for about 30 minutes, and that the official wrote, “I apologize for raising my voice in our conversation today. You’re focusing on a few specific trees that give a very wrong impression of the forest. But perhaps we will just not see eye to eye here. … I think you will regret staking out that claim.”

BuzzFeed's Ben Smith wrote Wednesday night that the official was Sperling.

""Officials often threaten reporters that they will 'regret' printing something that is untrue, but Woodward took the remark as a threat,"" Smith wrote.

""But I don't know that she's ever had a real job, I mean, since she's been grown up.""

Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator for Tea Party Patriots, said she wants to see resignations over what she called the ""disturbing, illegal and outrageous abuse of government power.""

Republican lawmakers also seized on the acknowledgment, after having complained about the suspected harassment more than a year ago. Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell called for a ""government-wide review"" to assure ""these thuggish practices"" are not in use elsewhere. House Republican Leader Eric Cantor later said the House would investigate.

Reaction was swift and harsh after Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups, acknowledged the issue at a conference Friday sponsored by the American Bar Association.

She confirmed that organizations were singled out because they included the words ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their applications for tax-exempt status.

In some cases, groups were asked for their list of donors, she said.

""That was wrong. That was absolutely incorrect, it was insensitive and it was inappropriate,"" Lerner said. ""The IRS would like to apologize for that.""

Lerner said the practice was initiated by low-level workers in Cincinnati and was not motivated by political bias. After her talk, she told The Associated Press that no high-level IRS officials knew about the practice. She did not say when they found out.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney later said the agency's inspector general was investigating, calling the agents' actions ""inappropriate"" and saying ""there needs to be action taken"" if wrongdoing is found.

As conservatives condemned the IRS for the additional scrutiny, IRS officials after the conference tried to offer a fuller explanation of what happened.

The IRS put out a written statement saying protocol was changed at the Cincinnati office in response to the rising number of applications for 501(c)(4) groups. This classification grants tax-exempt status to social welfare groups. Unlike other charitable groups, these organizations are allowed to participate in political activities but their primary activity must be social welfare.

The agents tried to ""centralize work"" in response to the applications, the IRS said, leading to problems the agency claims have since been fixed.

""Mistakes were made initially, but they were in no way due to any political or partisan rationale. We fixed the situation last year and have made significant progress in moving the centralized cases through our system,"" the IRS said.

On a hastily arranged conference call Friday, Lerner said that the staffers who flagged those groups did so as ""short-hand"" to deal with the ""great number"" of cases in the system.

She acknowledged that some of the letters sent were ""far too broad"" and that asking for donors is ""generally not what we do.""

""We made some mistakes, some people didn't use good judgment,"" she said, while claiming the reviews were not partisan.

During the conference earlier Friday, Lerner said the number of groups filing for the tax-exempt status more than doubled from 2010 to 2012, to more than 3,400. To handle the influx, the IRS centralized its review of these applications in the office in Cincinnati. As part of the review, staffers look for signs that groups are participating in political activity. If so, IRS agents take a closer look to make sure that politics isn't the group's primary activity, Lerner said.

In all, about 300 groups were singled out for additional review, Lerner said. Of those, about a quarter were singled out because they had ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" somewhere in their applications. Lerner said 150 of the cases have been closed and no group had its tax-exempt status revoked, though some withdrew their applications.

Many conservative groups complained during the election that they were being harassed by the IRS. They accused the agency of frustrating their attempts to become tax exempt by sending them lengthy, intrusive questionnaires.

The forms, which the groups made available at the time, sought information about group members' political activities, including details of their postings on social networking websites and about family members.

Groups shared some of those forms with FoxNews.com back in February 2012, when the complaints first surfaced. In letters sent from IRS offices in Cincinnati, chapters including the Waco (Texas) Tea Party and the Ohio Liberty Council were asked to provide a list of donors, identify volunteers, financial support for and relationships with political candidates and parties, and even printed copies of their Facebook pages.

""Some of what they (the IRS) asked was reasonable, but there were some requests on there that were strange,"" Toby Marie Walker, president of the Waco Tea Party, told FoxNews.com last year.

A dozen Republican senators wrote to the IRS in March 2012 expressing concerns about various accounts that the IRS inquiries were ""perceived to be excessive.""

IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman told Congress in March 2012 that the IRS was not targeting groups based on their political views.

""There's absolutely no targeting. This is the kind of back and forth that happens to people"" who apply for tax-exempt status, Shulman told a House Ways and Means subcommittee.

On Friday, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he's ""glad"" to see the IRS apologize but said it's not good enough.

""We need to have ironclad guarantees from the IRS that it will adopt significant protocols to ensure this kind of harassment of groups that have a constitutional right to express their own views never happens again,"" he said, adding that he would be discussing the matter with the IRS commissioner.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said ""the fact that Americans were targeted by the IRS because of their political beliefs is unconscionable.""

Story highlights NEW: Ray Nagin's family allegedly received Hawaii vacation, first-class Jamaica trip Nagin allegedly took bribes of $60,000, $2,250, $50,000, $10,000 and $112,500 Indictment says he filed false tax returns from 2005 to 2008 Nagin was the voice of a devastated New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina in 2005

Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, who captured the drama of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 with an “SOS” call to the nation, was indicted Friday on 21 federal corruption charges, including bribery, money laundering, fraud and filing false tax returns.

Nagin allegedly defrauded the city through “a bribery and kickback scheme” in which he received checks, cash, wire transfers, personal services and free travel from businessmen seeking contracts and favorable treatment from the city, the 25-page federal indictment says.

As part of the alleged bribes, Nagin’s family members received a vacation in Hawaii; first-class airfare to Jamaica; private jet travel and a limousine for New York City totaling $23,500; and cellular phone service, the indictment said.

Nagin’s family-owned granite-business Stone Age LLC allegedly benefited in the corruption, too, the indictment said.

Nagin could not immediately be reached for comment.

According to the indictment, the bribing businessmen allegedly received city contracts of $1 million for consulting, more than $3 million to build a project at Louis Armstrong International Airport, and $1 million for another airport project, the indictment said. Other contracts were for sidewalk repairs in the French Quarter and professional services, authorities allege.

Among the conspiracy charges is an accusation that Nagin awarded “no bid” work to a city contractor who provided “concealed and direct campaign monies” to Nagin, the indictment says.

Read the indictment

Nagin allegedly received bribes from city contractors in the amounts of $60,000, $2,250, $50,000 and $10,000, the indictment says.

He also is accused of receiving a bribe in the form of granite inventory from a city construction contractor.

Nagin faces nine counts of honest services wire fraud, alleging he received nine wire transfers amounting to $12,500 each that were bribes or kickback payoffs from the same city construction contractor in 2010 and 2011, the indictment says. Those bribed totaled $112,500.

In his 2005 tax return – the same year that Katrina hit the Gulf Coast – Nagin allegedly filed a false tax return claiming his income was $156,278, the indictment says.

He is also accused of filing false returns for 2006 listing his income at $170,364, for 2007 with an income of $31,163, and for 2008 with a $143,852 income, the indictment said.

The indictment does not detail what the government claims the returns should state.

In 2005, as Katrina became the single most catastrophic natural disaster in U.S. history, Nagin took center stage on behalf of victims when he excoriated the slow pace of federal and state relief efforts, even using profanities.

Nagin, who is black, urged the reconstruction of a “chocolate New Orleans,” adding, “You can’t have New Orleans no other way.” He later apologized, saying everyone is welcome to the city.

In issuing a national “SOS” during Katrina, Nagin expressed the desperation of a battered Gulf Coast:

“I need reinforcements, I need troops, man. I need 500 buses, man. We ain’t talking about – you know, one of the briefings we had, they were talking about getting public school bus drivers to come down here and bus people out here,” he told radio station WWL-AM.

“I’m like, ‘You got to be kidding me. This is a national disaster. Get every doggone Greyhound bus line in the country and get their asses moving to New Orleans.’

In 2010: Nagin – One day New Orleanians will recognize my good work

“That’s – they’re thinking small, man. And this is a major, major, major deal. And I can’t emphasize it enough, man. This is crazy,” Nagin said then.

The hurricane slammed the Gulf Coast in 2005 and killed 1,833 people, directly or indirectly, in five states. Damages totaled $108 billion, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Current New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who won election in 2010 when term limits kept Nagin out of the race, said the charges mark “a sad day for the city of New Orleans.”

In the 2006 mayoral race, Nagin beat then Lt. Gov. Landrieu, scion of a prominent Louisiana political family.

“Today’s indictment of former Mayor Ray Nagin alleges serious violations of the public’s trust,” Landrieu said in a prepared statement. “Public corruption cannot and will not be tolerated.”

The potty-mouth professor is Joseph Schwartz, a political science professor who told he’s won every teaching award at the university. He’s also a card-carrying Democratic Socialist (but he stresses he’s not an authoritarian communist).

The good professor, along with a handful of his followers, took over a “right to work” discussion hosted by Temple’s College Republicans and featuring a representative from Pennsylvania Right to Work Defense and Education Foundation.

Joseph Oleksak, the chairman of Temple’s Republican group, said the meeting was running smoothly until Professor Joseph Schwartz started raising questions.

[pullquote]

“I understand that not everyone agrees with my point of view,” Oleksak told me. “But the fact that somebody can come into another person’s meeting and take it over and then accuse them of racism – it’s an insult.”

Watchdog group Campus Reform obtained a video of the meeting and it shows Schwartz, along with students identified as members of the Temple Democratic Socialistic club, raising arguments with the speaker.

At some point, the professor used the “F-word” leading to a warning from the speaker. A member of the College Republicans told him that if kept cursing he would have to leave.

“The guest speaker took great offense to that and he asked him that if he was going to swear to get out of the presentation,” Oleksak said.

“Oh come on, f*****g a--,” Schwartz said. “I believe in the religion of foul language.”

A university spokesperson told me they were investigating the incident and would determine if any actions should be taken.

“Temple University is a community of scholars in which freedom of inquiry, freedom of expression and mutual respect are valued,” spokesperson Eryn Jelesiewicz said.

“It’s important that we all foster an environment conducive to civilized intellectual and educational stimulation within the university free from unlawful harassment by other members of the community.”

Professor Schwartz told me that he was passionate but not disrespectful.

“I would apologize for using profane language,” he said. ‘Otherwise, I think I made substantive points and I don’t think they were responded to. If people want to be effective in their politics, they’re going to have to learn to argue for it.”

Schwartz said he was just trying to “generate an intellectual exchange.”

“A university is a place for open dialogue,” he said. “People should not disrupt other speakers. They should respect speakers with other points of view.”

Oleksak said he’s not surprised that their meeting was disrupted by the professor and his followers. He said it’s just a way of life on one of the nation’s most liberal college campuses.

“It’s sad to say [but] I didn’t expect anything else,” he said. “That’s the sad part. I knew something like this was coming.”

The cold, hard reality is that American college and university campuses are hostile places to young people who cherish freedom.

Some of the nation’s great institutions of higher learning are infested with left-wing professors, protected by tenure, who use their classrooms to spew their anti-American rhetoric.

Where else are they going to find gainful employment?"

But this week, Lewinsky is back in the headlines after the National Enquirer claimed it had obtained a ""sex tape"" recorded for Clinton by Lewinsky around November 1997.

In typical tabloid style, the magazine describes the ""bombshell"" tape as ""steamy"" and ""sensational,"" and claims it obtained the audio from a source who disobeyed orders to destroy it.

""I was supposed to shred everything in late 1998,"" the unnamed ""cleaner"" told the National Enquirer. ""But for some reason I kept this material.""

According to CNN, Lewinsky and Clinton began their sexual relationship in November of 1995, two years before this tape was allegedly recorded. The scandal broke in 1998, however, after Linda Tripp contacted the office of Whitewater Independent Counsel Ken Starr and revealed she had recorded Lewinsky allegedly talking about the affair.

The magazine also published what it says is a complete transcript of the allegedly 3 minute, 47 second audiotape.

""Hi handsome,"" the reported transcript begins. ""I couldn't bear the idea of sitting down to write you another note. So I though I would tape it, hope that's ok.""

In the transcript, Lewinsky goes on to say she has ""two proposals"" for Clinton, ""neither of which is you not seeing me.""

""You can't refuse me because I'm too cute and adorable and soon I won't be here anymore to pop over,"" she continues, according to the transcript. ""I could take all my clothes off and start... well.. I know you wouldn't enjoy that? But, I hope to see you later, and I hope you will just follow my script and do what I want.""

Although the National Enquirer is often written off as a salacious spreader of gossip and unsubstantiated tall tales, it should be noted that the tabloid has broken some national scandals -- perhaps most notably one-time presidential candidate John Edward's 2006 affair."

President Obama and his family are vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard until Aug. 18.

President Obama and his family are vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard until Aug. 18.

President Obama began his Martha’s Vineyard vacation in traditional style Sunday, wasting no time in hitting the golf course.

Taking a break from wrangling over immigration reform and planning for federal budget debates, the president began his first full day of vacation with a midday round at Farm Neck Golf Club in Oak Bluffs. He was joined by aide Marvin Nicholson and White House chef Sam Kass, with Robert Wolf, a former UBS Americas chairman and one of Obama’s principal Wall Street allies, completing the foursome.

But if the president had been hoping to get his vacation off on the right foot, he was out of luck.

“His first putt was a miss, which Obama reacted to by leaning back and kicking his knee up, as if trying to coax the ball into breaking right,” according to the pool report from the journalists who watched him play the first hole.

“He let out a little, ‘Ooooh,’ as it happened. Next one missed, too. Last one he just dragged in the hole,” the report added.

It is the fourth time Obama has vacationed on the upscale island, although he skipped a trip here last year during the presidential campaign. Golf has been his preferred way to unwind — he has played more than a dozen rounds on previous visits.

Lee Gibbon, a restaurant owner from Washington state who is vacationing on the island, was sitting in the golf course’s cafe when Obama showed up to play a round.

“He said, ‘Isn’t this a great day?,’ and some people wished him well, and he went and teed off,” Gibbon said.

He described the president as an “accomplished” rather than a “great” golfer, but said he was impressed by what he saw. “Taking a shot in front of 50 people — that’s a lot of pressure,” Gibbon said.

The president arrived with first lady Michelle Obama shortly before 4 p.m. on Saturday. He is due to return to Washington on Sunday, and no public events are planned during his vacation. Aides said he will continue to receive daily updates from national security adviser Susan Rice and deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors, both of whom are on the island.

Residents on Martha’s Vineyard said they have learned to spot familiar signs indicating that the president is in town.

Margaret Saul, a sales clerk at Alley’s Farm Stand, a short distance from where the Obamas are staying, said Secret Service agents had stopped to buy groceries Saturday night.

“They tell everyone they are here on a fishing trip,” she said. “They think they are blending in, but it’s obvious,” she added, noting that the agents typically travel in pairs in black cars and often have radio wires in their ears.

However, one familiar accompaniment to the president’s trip has been more muted than usual, with Republicans largely avoiding criticizing Obama for vacationing on an island dotted with multimillion-dollar homes.

Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah) was an exception, telling a newspaper last week that the choice made the president appear “tone deaf” because most of Stewart’s constituents “could never afford to visit Martha’s Vineyard.”

Islanders rejected that argument, saying they thought that the commander in chief deserved a break and expressing hope that the publicity would encourage more people to visit, boosting the local economy.

One retailer was looking to cash in with T-shirts bearing the slogan “I vacationed with Obama — Martha’s Vineyard ’13,” while another store, Portobello Road in Edgartown, had already sold a handmade wooden sign reading “Obama Rules” and was touting a second.

The Obamas are again staying on Martha’s Vineyard’s western tip, but in a different home after their previous choice, the 28-acre Blue Heron Farm, was sold to an owner who refused to rent it out.

Their new place is a $7.6 million, six-bedroom house overlooking Chilmark Pond and the ocean beyond, and it features a swimming pool and a basketball court. It is owned by David Schulte, a Democratic donor who is a friend of the president and works in corporate restructuring.

Because the house is a few hundred feet from a major road, the Secret Service has banned nearby traffic during the eight-day visit, ruffling some feathers. The Vineyard Gazette reported that Chilmark Selectman Warren Doty complained that the new approach would be “very disruptive,” and the town sent out an e-mail advising residents with complaints to contact the White House.

But at the twice-weekly artisans fair in West Tisbury, a few miles from where the Obamas are staying, residents and tourists were keen to play down the dispute.

“I think everyone is excited and perfectly willing to put up with the road closure here,” Jay Kirch, 81, said as he sat in the shade at a picnic table. “I do believe he needs protection and privacy.”

Lorri Hart, 54, who was selling her custom-made jewelry at the fair, echoed Kirch’s view on the traffic disruption, saying, “I’m fine with that as long as he brings a lot of people here to visit.”

“We’re used to a lot of important people coming here, but it’s still exciting,” she added."

Send Him Statements To Fact Check Emailing Him', 'Tweeting At Him', 'Or Sending Him A Message On Facebook.']",Sequester politics: Claims about the FAA furloughs,"“The FAA is furloughing thousands of air traffic controllers and will purposely delay thousands of flights every day. The FAA’s unnecessary and reckless action will disrupt air travel for millions of Americans, cost jobs and threatens to ground the U.S. economy to a halt. It doesn’t have to be that way. The FAA can make other cost cuts, and deem air traffic controllers ‘essential employees.’”

— text of online ad “Don’t Ground America” promoted by Airlines for America and other trade groups.

Before the sequester began, we examined closely some of the claims and counterclaims made about the impact on the Federal Aviation Administration. Unlike many of the other agencies we rated, which had predicted cutbacks based on some dubious accounting, the FAA made a pretty good case that its cost structure — 71 percent of the operations budget pays for salaries — left it little wiggle room in making cuts. “The FAA assertions have the appearance of a Geppetto Checkmark,” we wrote, though we held off making a final ruling.

Furloughs of air traffic controllers were implemented last weekend, and the resulting flight delays have created a political firestorm, and lawmakers are already looking for a way to close the gap. Critics — including a coalition of airlines and pilots that has filed a lawsuit to block the action — have charged that the FAA has other ways to cut costs beside furloughing air traffic controllers. In its ad, the group also claims that controllers could be deemed “essential employees” and keep working, such as during a government shutdown because Congress failed to complete appropriations bills.

Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Penn.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, in a statement listed a number of nonpersonnel costs that he said could be examined first, including “nearly $500 million for consultants; $325 million in supplies and travel; the FAA has 46 aircraft that cost $143 million to operate.”

A committee staff member said some of Shuster’s ire stemmed from the fact that he believes that Transportation Department officials have not responded in a timely way for information on how the agency would cope with the sequester cuts. Still, we did find examples in congressional testimony in which administration officials have addressed questions about some of these line items.

So let’s take a look at the claims in the trade group ad. How much flexibility does the FAA have?

The Facts

The lawsuit makes an interesting claim, arguing that during a similar sequestration in 1986, Congress imposed a budget cut of 4.3 percent, “which was accomplished without freezing hires of air traffic controllers, much less furloughs.” But that’s missing the whole story: as furloughs loomed in 1986, lawmakers passed a special appropriations bill that restored the 4.3 percent cut for a number of crucial programs, including FAA controllers, federal meat inspectors and Coast Guard operations. By itself, the FAA got back almost 75 percent of the $116 million that it would have lost under sequestration, news reports show.

Indeed, this year Congress gave a special exemption from the sequester to the Agriculture Department’s food inspectors. But the airline industry failed to get a similar deal, leading to the furloughs that were avoided nearly three decades ago.

Why do the trade groups believe the controllers could be deemed “essential employees,” as during a government shutdown? Vaughn Jennings, a spokesman for Airlines for America, cited an exception in the U.S. code, drawn from the Antideficiency Act, that the Office of Management and Budget has relied on for government shutdowns. He said it could apply also to a sequester.

This turns on legal interpretation, but we could find no support for this position among government officials, congressional Republicans or legal experts. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal employees from making or authorizing expenditures in excess of what has been appropriated.

In the case of a government shutdown, there is a temporary lapse in appropriations. So to prevent possible harm to public safety, certain employees can be “excepted” and required to work — temporarily without pay. The assumption is that the government will eventually get funded, and workers will receive their overdue pay.

A sequester is a fundamentally different matter. In this case, Congress, through the budget process, already has decided how much money agencies can receive, so experts say it is against the law for the government to arbitrarily conclude some workers can keep working, even for public safety reasons.

“We stand by our position,” Jennings said. “The courts have not ruled on this, and our opinion still holds that there is no reason why the exception would apply to one aspect of the law (shutdown) but not another (sequester). Our position is based on the plain language of the statutes involved.”

The trade group did not explain how the FAA could make other cost cuts, so let’s look at the items that Shuster provided in his statement. We had looked at some of these issues previously and found them to be misleading. Shuster’s list now has expanded but the FAA provided The Fact Checker with fairly detailed explanations of these line items.

$500 million in consultants: The $514 million spent on “advisory and assistance services” refers not to consultants but to operational contracts to support the air traffic control system. That means things like telecommunications and weather radar — assistance that helps maintain the integrity of the system. Consultant contracts amount to just $21 million, but that mostly means environmental experts who check to make sure noise regulations are being followed.

In response to the sequester, the FAA already is aiming to cut about $50 million, or about 10 percent, from the”advisory and assistance services” contracts, officials said.

$325 million in supplies and travel: The $134 million in “supplies and materials” refers mainly to parts needed for air traffic control, back-up generators, heating and ventilation equipment and the like. Because of the sequester, the $117 million earmarked for parts and maintenance is scheduled to decline 18 percent, to $96 million, while spending on HVAC equipment and fuel has been slashed 40 percent, to $16 million, in 2013.

Meanwhile, the $154 million in “travel and transportation of persons” refers mainly to on-site equipment repair, FAA officials said. It also includes travel for new controller training, but that will be suspended as part of the sequester. FAA says this line item is targeted to decline about 13 percent, to $134 million.

Forty-six aircraft that cost $143 million to operate: The $143 million figure is from a 2010 GSA report, congressional aides say, but FAA officials say that year was an anomaly because $60 million was spent to upgrade the avionics on 17 aircraft. In 2012, the aircraft bill was much lower--$78 million--and that has been cut 12 percent, to $69 million, in 2013.

Why does the FAA need so many planes? Thirty-two of the planes are used for flight checking of navigational aids, both when they are installed and then as a regular test. This program has been reduced 14 percent because of sequester, from $58 million in 2012 to $50 million in 2013. Three planes are based in Atlantic City to test evolving technologies in the NextGen air traffic control system, eight are used for aviation safety inspector training and three are based at Reagan National airport for travel to accident investigations.

Add it up, and the FAA says it plans to cut about $110 million — 12 percent — from $903 million of possible areas for cuts identified by Shuster.

The FAA’s work force is heavily unionized, and the furloughs have been ordered without trying to make allowances for the level of traffic in particular airports. The FAA argues that it did not want to be in the position of picking “winners and losers,” either among airports or union members. We obviously can’t make a judgment about the right course of action.

The Pinocchio Test

The ad, and remarks from congressional critics, makes the dilemma facing the FAA seem all too easy. While some of these questions remain to be adjudicated in a legal setting — assuming Congress does not act first — the trade groups go too far in making it appear as if the FAA has ordered furloughs without first looking for other cost cuts or deeming controllers as essential employees.

The FAA has very high fixed costs — both in terms of salaries and contracts — giving it little flexibility. The ad thus is rather misleading about options facing the agency.

We are not sure why the airline industry blames the FAA in the first place. The Obama administration proposed the sequester, and Congress approved it with bipartisan support. The FAA’s hands are tied unless Congress and the White House reach a deal similar to the solution found in 1986.

USA TODAY

President Obama and his team are looking to turn the page this week, but it won't be easy.

White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer hit the talk show circuit Sunday, but faced many more questions about the Internal Revenue Service and Benghazi than about the economy and national security.

Pfeiffer dismissed Republican ""conspiracy theories"" about the Benghazi attack last September, and said the White House did not know about IRS targeting of conservative groups until recent news about an inspector general's investigation.

Calling IRS actions ""outrageous and inexcusable,"" Pfeiffer told ABC's This Week that the administration would work with Congress on ""legitimate oversight"" — but ""what we're not going to participate in is partisan fishing expeditions designed to distract from the real issues at hand.""

On NBC's Meet the Press, Pfeiffer sad that while there is ""a very real problem at the IRS,"" the Republicans are also trying ""to drag Washington into a swamp of partisan fishing expeditions, trumped-up hearings and false allegations.""

""We are not going to let that happen,"" Pfeiffer said. ""The president has got business to do for the American people.""

Republicans, meanwhile, are gearing up for more congressional hearings on the IRS, trying to find out if any high-ranking Obama administration or campaign officials knew about the targeting of conservative groups for extra scrutiny.

""This is just the beginning of this investigation,"" said Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on Fox News Sunday.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told NBC that the recent allegations reflect a ""culture of intimidation"" within the Obama administration.

""What we're talking about here is an attitude that the government knows best,"" McConnell said. ""The nanny state is here to tell us all what to do. And if we start criticizing, you get targeted.""

Turning the page in the short term may be impossible, with two major congressional hearings coming up this week.

The Senate Finance Committee has a session Tuesday featuring the first testimony on Tea Party targeting, from former IRS commissioner Douglas Shulman.

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform plans a hearing Wednesday that is scheduled to include Shulman and Lois Lerner, director of tax-exempt organizations for the IRS.

In his string of Sunday interviews, Pfeiffer noted that Obama has installed a new temporary director of the IRS, and authorized a 30-day review of agency operations. He told Fox that there will be ""a top-down review of the IRS, and everything will be looked at.""

Republicans also say they will continue investigating whether the White House sought to cover up the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans. The administration initially attributed that attack to a violent protest over an anti-Islam film, but said days later it was a terrorist group operation after all.

Pfeiffer said last week's White House release of administration e-mails detailing the development of ""talking points"" about Benghazi show that initial intelligence did indicate a protest. He said changes were made out of concern for undermining the investigation of the attack.

Republicans have also criticized the administration over the Justice Department seizure of Associated Press phone records, part of an investigation into news leaks.

As Obama tries to move the past the scandal allegations, his schedule this week includes a meeting with the president of Burma, a speech on counterterrorism, and a commencement address at the U.S. Naval Academy. The administration is also trying to strike deals with Congress on the budget and a major immigration bills.

Ongoing investigations could complicate the administration's efforts to get back to its own agenda.

Some Republicans said the recent revelations, especially at the IRS, undermine Obama's support of ""big government"" initiatives.

Ryan, the 2012 Republican candidate for vice president, told Fox News Sunday that he and GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney had to run last year against big government in theory.

""Now we are seeing big government in practice,"" Ryan said. ""Now, we're seeing the arrogance. We're seeing the cronyism in practice in this second term. And that is even uglier than big government in theory.""

On ABC, Pfeiffer said Obama has take steps to overhaul government, and will continue to do so.

""The test here is, when problems arise, how do we address it?"" Pfeiffer said. ""And in the IRS, we are taking decisive action to make sure this never happens again, and we're going to hold those responsible accountable."""

USA TODAY

President Obama's staff has unmasked and fired a national security official who tweeted critical comments under a pseudonym.

Jofi Joseph, tweeting under the handle @natsecwonk, once wrote: ""I'm a fan of Obama, but his continuing reliance and dependence upon a vacuous cipher like Valerie Jarrett concerns me.""

A federal law enforcement official, who was not authorized to commeny on the matter, told USA TODAY that Joseph is not under investigation, as has been reported

Other Obama staff members and officials — including Secretary of State John Kerry and former National Security adviser Tom Donilon — had also been targeted by @natsecwonk, which was shut down last week.

The secret Twitter feed also raised questions about the administration's handling of the 2012 attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya.

The Daily Beast, which broke the story, reported that Joseph, who is well known in national security circles, ""has also worked at the State Department and on Capitol Hill for Senators Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and (Vice President) Joe Biden. Until recently, he was part of the administration's team working on negotiations with Iran.""

Of course, Joseph also insulted Republicans on his mystery Twitter feed: ""So when will someone do us the favor of getting rid of Sarah Palin and the rest of her white trash family? What utter useless garbage .... ""

Politico reported on the investigation into Joseph's Twitter activities:

""After a probe that included an investigation into Joseph's travel and shopping patterns — parsed from over 2,000 tweets — lawyers from the White House counsel's office confronted Joseph and ordered him to leave the executive complex, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Joseph had been scheduled to rotate out of White House duty to a senior job in the Pentagon, an administration official told Politico.""

A federal law enforcement official, who was not authorized to comment on the matter, told USA TODAY that Joseph is not under investigation."

Patty Murray, are hiding their budget from their Republican colleagues, Breitbart News has learned exclusively. Murray did share her budget plan with her Democratic colleagues on Tuesday.

The budget is scheduled for markup on Wednesday morning in committee, and senators are only expected to read opening statements at the hearing. It will not be until later on Wednesday that Republicans will be allowed to read the full budget proposal.

House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan, on the other hand, shared his budget with his Democratic colleagues ahead of its release. It is unclear why Murray will not show the budget to Republicans ahead of the Wednesday morning markup hearing. A Murray spokesman has not immediately returned Breitbart News’ request for comment.

A Senate Republican aide told Breitbart News it is possible Senate Democrats will not share their budget ahead of its public release with their colleagues across the aisle because it embarrasses them.

“I think it speaks volumes about Senate Democrats’ fear of the American people that they must hide their plan until they’ve first had a chance to mislead the media about it,” the Senate GOP aide said in an email. “If they had courage and confidence their plan would be popular, they would have been on the Sunday shows and holding press conferences bragging about it, as did Chairman Ryan. Instead, it’s leaks and crickets.”

What is known about Murray’s budget is already proving problematic for the Democrats. The Hill reports the budget includes $1 trillion in tax hikes; Murray claims it contains about $1.85 trillion in deficit reduction between spending cuts and tax hikes. Murray’s budget also voids sequester cuts for the next nine years.

The Hill‘s Erik Wasson notes that “once the sequester cuts are turned off, Murray’s budget appears to reduce deficits by about $800 billion, using the Congressional Budget Office’s baseline.” He adds that Murray’s budget “does not contain net spending cuts with the sequester turned off.”

The Murray budget, according to Wasson, also includes “reconciliation instructions on tax reform, a move that could allow the budget, which cannot be filibustered in the Senate, to become the legislative vehicle for a tax reform bill.”

Murray is supposedly moving forward with that idea even though such a stunt is likely to spark massive Democratic Party infighting. Wasson notes that Montana Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, “has opposed including the instructions in the budget, arguing it would tie his hands in tax reform.”

A spokesperson for Baucus has not responded to Breitbart News’ request for comment on how he feels about Murray’s move to include tax reform reconciliation in the budget package."

(CNN) – New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner issued an apology Thursday after a woman he was speaking to referred to his Democratic primary rival, Christine Quinn, using a gay slur.

Weiner said he had admonished the woman at the time, but was apologizing if anyone was left with the impression he condoned what she said about Quinn, who is a lesbian.



""Homophobia is vile and destructive and something I have fought against for the entirety of my career, including being a vocal supporter of gay marriage since 1998 and standing up on the floor of Congress for transgender Americans,” Weiner said in a statement that was distributed by his campaign on Twitter.

“I admonished the woman amid a large crowd on a street corner and by no means believe that anything about her comment was appropriate. If the impression is that I did, I apologize because behavior like this will absolutely not be tolerated in my administration,"" he said.

The exchange, which came while Weiner was canvassing New Yorkers for signatures on his ballot petition, was captured by a reporter for the Washington Post.

“You a registered Democrat?” Weiner asked a woman the Post described as elderly.

“I am, and I’m not voting for uh, what’s her name? The dyke,” the woman responded.

Weiner asked the woman to sign his petition before saying, “You really shouldn’t talk that way about people.”

After she apologized, the Post said Weiner responded, ““It’s okay. It’s not your fault.”

When asked about the exchange with the woman later, Weiner said he has “admonished her to not say anything further,” but that he had “no memory of saying anything beyond that.”

Weiner is making a political comeback attempt. He left Congress in 2011 after getting caught up in a lewd messaging scandal.

Polls have shown him trailing Quinn in their race for a spot on the ballot in November. Other Democrats in the race include New York City Public Advocate Bill de Balsio's and former City Comptroller Bill Thompson.

If she wins the Democratic primary and goes on to win the general election in November, Quinn would become New York’s first female and first openly gay mayor."

The improper activities “were not influenced by any individual or organization outside the IRS,” the auditors said they were told by Internal Revenue Service officials.

Instead, the report painted a picture of an IRS unit based in Cincinnati that used “inappropriate criteria” for deciding which applications to examine, without any review by senior managers. The targeting, including that of groups that used “tea party” in their names, continued for more than 18 months, while some applications for nonprofit status languished for more than three years, the report found.

The statement that no one outside the IRS was involved, if it holds up, would counter efforts by Republican leaders to depict the IRS actions as a politically motivated scandal linked to President Obama. Faced with a barrage of questions on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that no one there had known of the matter until April, when the White House counsel’s office was briefed about the report.

But the controversy showed no signs of abating, as both the House and Senate prepared to hold hearings. At the top of the agenda will be questions about why IRS officials who were aware of the problems continued to assure Congress that no improper targeting had occurred.

“Unfortunately, the report raises more questions than it answers,” said House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Vista), whose committee was among those requesting the report. “What we do know for sure is that the IRS personnel responsible for granting tax exemptions systematically targeted conservative groups for extra scrutiny, and that officials in Washington, D.C., were aware of this practice, even while publicly claiming that it never happened.”

The pace of investigations picked up as Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said that he had ordered an investigation into whether anyone at the IRS broke laws.

The IRS actions were “certainly outrageous and unacceptable,” Holder said at a news conference. “But we are examining the facts to see if there were criminal violations,” he added.

The president, in a statement released late Tuesday, said the activities described in the report from the Treasury inspector general for tax administration were “intolerable and inexcusable.”

“The IRS must apply the law in a fair and impartial way, and its employees must act with utmost integrity,” Obama said. “This report shows that some of its employees failed that test.”

Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, whose agency includes the IRS, said inspector general recommendations for better training for IRS personnel and clearer guidelines would be implemented “without delay.”

In its own statement, the IRS agreed that the reviews had been “inappropriate,” but said all the organizations that were singled out for extra review ultimately received similar treatment, regardless of ideology.

“It is also important to understand that the group of centralized cases included organizations of all political views,” the statement said, referring to cases that received heightened scrutiny.

The report looked at records for 298 organizations that IRS specialists scrutinized for their level of political activity. Of those, 96 applications were pulled out because they mentioned “tea party,” “patriots” or “9/12""; the remaining 202 applications did not have such phrases.

According to one IRS official cited in the report, the fact that two-thirds of the targeted groups were not flagged because of conservative-sounding words proved that the agency was “not politically biased in its identification of applications.” The other groups selected are not identified, however, so their political views, if any, remain unknown.

The agency also said that “there was no intent to hide” what was going on. Top career officials sent letters to members of Congress in 2012 that reassured them the IRS was not targeting any groups.

The inspector general’s office began its inquiry after receiving complaints from Congress that conservative groups were being harassed by the IRS. J. Russell George, inspector general for tax administration, was appointed to that position by Republican President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate in 2004. He’s a former Republican Capitol Hill staff member.

The problems at the IRS started in March 2010, as staff in a Cincinnati field office — the main office handling tax-exempt organizations — struggled to cope with a flood of applications for “social welfare” exemptions. Many came from politically oriented organizations that sprang up after the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision loosening the rules for political donations. Between 2010 and 2012, the number of applications for tax exemption as social welfare groups almost doubled.

Unlike charities, social welfare groups, governed by Section 501(c)4 of the tax code, are allowed to participate in politics so long as that is not their primary purpose. But the IRS has never clearly defined the limits. The groups also can keep their donors’ names secret.

With many groups spending millions of dollars on elections, campaign reform advocates were pressuring the IRS to tighten enforcement of limits on politically active tax-exempt groups. Workers at the exempt organizations division, assigned the task of screening the applications, selected organizations for additional review whose paperwork included references to the “tea party” or similar words — a decision that wasn’t reviewed by top officials at the agency until more than a year after the screenings began, according to the report.

In June 2011, Lois Lerner, the IRS official in Washington who supervises the agency’s tax-exempt division, ordered the staff to change its approach. After a period of time using new, more appropriate, rules, however, the Cincinnati staff in January 2012 once again changed the criteria. This time they began screening for groups that were focused on the Constitution or on limiting or expanding government, according to the report. Officials in Washington did not intervene to fix that until May 2012.

Not only was the method misguided, the report said, it also didn’t work very well. The audit found that 14 groups weren’t flagged for extra scrutiny even though their files contained evidence of significant involvement in political campaigns.

The report concludes that the IRS workers had not considered the “public perception” of using politically oriented criteria in evaluating cases. Another problem: The staff doing the reviews had a “lack of knowledge” about what activities tax-exempt groups may legally engage in.

Many of the organizations received a long, detailed list of questions for further information, including requests for the names of all donors. The IRS asked whether the officers or directors intended to run for public office, where they worked and what conversations they had with people at their functions.

Nikole Flax, chief of staff for the office of IRS commissioner, told Issa’s committee staff that the request for donors’ names was unprecedented in IRS history, Issa said in a letter to Lerner.

The letter accused Lerner of lying or hiding information from Congress on four separate occasions, saying that she had failed to inform the committee of the screening or of the internal concerns, even after repeated questioning.

“Providing false or misleading information to Congress is a serious matter, with potential criminal liability,” the letter said.

He Has Covered The Pentagon', 'Served As The Berlin Bureau Chief', 'Reported More Than Countries. He Joined The Washington Post In']",General’s promotion blocked over her dismissal of sex-assault verdict,"An Air Force general has run afoul of Congress for granting clemency to a convicted sex offender without any public explanation, the latest case to raise fundamental questions about how the military justice system handles sex crimes.

The case is the second this year in which a three-star Air Force general has raised lawmakers’ hackles by effectively pardoning an officer found guilty of sexual assault, a crime many experts see as a growing problem in the military.

This time the general is a former astronaut who has served as a role model for other female officers as she climbed into the upper ranks of the Air Force.

Lt. Gen. Susan J. Helms, who as a crew member of the space shuttle Endeavour became the first U.S. military woman to travel in space in 1993, was poised to make another ascent in her career in March when the White House nominated her to become vice commander of the Air Force’s Space Command.

But her nomination has been blocked by Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), a member of the Armed Services Committee, who wants to examine Helms’s previously unpublicized decision to overturn the conviction, on charges of aggravated sexual assault, of a captain at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

Helms’s action mirrors another case that has drawn angry attention from Congress and prompted legislators to propose landmark changes in military law. In that instance, victims’ advocates called for the firing of Lt. Gen. Craig A. Franklin, commander of the Third Air Force in Europe, after he tossed out the sexual-assault conviction of a star fighter pilot in February.

In both cases, the generals ignored the recommendations of their legal advisers and overruled a jury’s findings — without publicly revealing why. Neither general was a judge and neither observed the trials, but they intervened to grant clemency before the convictions could be heard by an appeals court.

Helms explained in an internal memo that surfaced only recently that she reversed the jury after reviewing the evidence and finding the captain’s testimony more credible.

Drew Pusateri, a spokesman for McCaskill, said the senator is blocking Helms’s nomination until she receives more information about the general’s decision.

“As the senator works to change the military justice system to better protect survivors of sexual assault and hold perpetrators accountable, she wants to ensure that cases in which commanders overturned jury verdicts . . . are given the appropriate scrutiny,” Pusateri said.

A string of abuse scandals

The Air Force has been rattled by a string of sexual-abuse scandals over the past year, including the rape and assault of dozens of recruits by basic-training instructors at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.

The latest embarrassment struck Sunday, when Arlington County police arrested the chief of the Air Force’s sexual-assault prevention branch and charged him with sexual battery. Police said Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski was drunk when he approached a woman in a Crystal City parking lot and grabbed her breasts and buttocks. Maj. Mary Danner-Jones, an Air Force spokeswoman at the Pentagon, said Krusinski was “removed from his position immediately” when the Air Force learned of his arrest.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called Air Force Secretary Michael Donley to “express outrage and disgust” over Krusinski’s arrest and promise that the matter will be dealt with “swiftly and decisively,” according to a Pentagon statement.

The Pentagon has acknowledged that sexual assault in the military is widespread. It estimates that 19,000 offenses are committed each year but that fewer than one in six cases are officially reported. Many victims say they are reluctant to press charges because they lack faith in the military justice system. Of those cases that are reported, about one in 10 proceeds to trial.

It is rare for commanders to grant clemency. The Air Force said it has recorded 327 convictions over the past five years for sexual assault, rape and similar crimes, but only five verdicts have been overturned in clemencies.

Advocacy groups, however, said any decision to overrule a jury’s verdict for no apparent reason has a powerful dampening effect.

“When commanders and those in authority set convictions aside, reduce sentences or drop charges, it creates a chilling effect in the system,” said Nancy Parrish, president of Protect Our Defenders, a group that represents victims of sex crimes in the military.

Hagel last month said he would support a legislative proposal to change military law so that commanders could no longer set aside convictions for serious sex crimes. His decision marked a reversal for the Pentagon, which had long resisted the measure. Some lawmakers want more far-reaching legal changes.

A verdict appealed

The case in which Helms overturned the jury finding began in October 2010, when a noncommissioned officer at Vandenberg reported that she had been sexually assaulted by Capt. Matthew S. Herrera in his bedroom after a night of drinking.

Herrera’s housemate told authorities that he had a history of acting aggressively with women, according to the case file obtained by The Washington Post. Investigators found another woman, a second lieutenant, who said Herrera sexually assaulted her in the back seat of a car a year earlier, although she did not report it at the time.

Herrera was charged in both cases. At his court-martial, his attorneys argued that the sexual encounters were consensual. A jury of five Air Force officers found Herrera guilty of sexually assaulting the lieutenant and sentenced him to 60 days behind bars, a loss of pay and dismissal from the Air Force. He was found not guilty of assaulting the noncommissioned officer.

Herrera applied for clemency, arguing that he was innocent and that it would be an injustice to force him to register as a sex offender. Documents show that Helms’s legal adviser urged her to reject Herrera’s request. But in February 2012, the general granted clemency without explanation, erasing Herrera’s conviction.

Soon afterward, the noncommissioned officer who had accused Herrera of sexually assaulting her said that she had crossed paths with him at Vandenberg and, because she was junior in rank, she was required to salute him.

“He had a very smug look on his face,” Tech. Sgt. Jennifer J. Robinson said in an interview. “I was devastated and shocked.”

Herrera did not respond to interview requests placed through his attorney, Richard P. Lasting of Los Angeles.

General’s rationale

Helms declined to comment through an Air Force spokesman. Although the general did not publicly divulge her reasons for overturning the conviction, she wrote a memo for her personal files explaining her decision, said the spokesman, Lt. Col. John Dorrian.

The memo was not made part of the case file or shared with prosecutors, defense lawyers, Herrera or his accusers, Dorrian said. In response to an inquiry, however, the Air Force provided a copy to The Post. It also gave a copy to McCaskill’s office.

In the five-page memo, dated Feb. 24, 2012, Helms wrote that she reviewed the court-martial transcript and trial exhibits. She said she came to the opposite conclusion of the jury and found Herrera to be a more credible witness than the lieutenant. Helms wrote that it was not unreasonable for Herrera to believe that the woman had given implied consent.

“It is undoubtedly true that [the accuser’s] feelings of victimization are real and justifiable,” Helms wrote. “However, Capt. Herrera’s conviction should not rest on [the accuser’s] view of her victimization, but on the law and convincing evidence.”

Instead of sexual assault, Helms found Herrera guilty of committing “an indecent act,” a lesser offense. The Air Force said Herrera was involuntarily discharged in December."

McDonnell described as aware of gifts from Virginia businessman,"Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell was aware of gifts and financial help provided by a wealthy Richmond area businessman during the same months the governor and his wife took steps to help his company, according to people familiar with documents and interviews gathered by federal investigators.

For example, McDonnell (R) was present at a charity auction in 2011 when the chief executive of Star Scientific, which makes a dietary supplement, successfully bid on a fashion tour of New York for the governor’s wife in front of a crowd of onlookers, witnesses said.

Separately, the executive, Jonnie R. Williams Sr., flew the governor and his wife on a weekend trip to Cape Cod, in Massachusetts, over Labor Day weekend last year. And Williams repeatedly allowed the governor, his sons and staff to play golf and buy golf gear at elite Richmond area country clubs, running up more than $7,000 on Williams’s tab, according to the documents turned over to authorities.

Each of these newly public examples of Williams’s generosity came on top of more than $150,000 worth of valuables and money The Washington Post has previously reported — gifts that Williams provided to the governor’s family over more than 18 months in 2011 and 2012.

People familiar with accounts that Williams and others have provided to investigators, as well as witnesses interviewed by The Post, say each of those gifts came with the governor’s knowledge — contrasting with an assertion by McDonnell’s attorneys that he was in the dark about the extent of the gifts Williams bestowed on his family.

View Graphic Timeline: Star Scientific and Gov. McDonnell

Attorneys for the governor and first lady Maureen McDonnell argued to federal prosecutors two weeks ago that the governor should not be charged with any crimes, in part because of this ignorance, people familiar with the sessions said.

The governor could not have been influenced to improperly help the Star Scientific executive, they asserted, based on gifts he didn’t know about at the time. The couple’s attorneys told prosecutors that Maureen McDonnell worked to hide Williams’s gifts because she feared her husband’s disapproval, the people said.

Case status

What had been an unusually fast-paced investigation has hit some delays as prosecutors consider the evidence, including the governor’s account and new information, several people familiar with the probe say.

In recent weeks, the governor’s legal team lost a secret court battle to withhold from prosecutors internal office communications, those people said. McDonnell’s attorneys said the papers were protected by attorney-client privilege because they concerned communications between the governor and some staff members who are lawyers.

Prosecutors have now asked the governor’s and first lady’s attorneys to return for a second round of discussions no later than the week of Sept. 15, during which prosecutors are expected to lay out the key elements of the case, said a person familiar with the schedule.

Prosecutors could decide whether to file charges after the meetings, the person said. But the timing is somewhat tricky, because voters go to the polls Nov. 5 to select McDonnell’s successor, and prosecutors may want to avoid a perception that their work is influencing the results, people familiar with the investigation said.

A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment.

Rich Galen, a spokesman for the governor’s legal team, said the “evidence is clear” that McDonnell complied with state disclosure laws, which require that elected officials report all gifts worth at least $50 but do not require that gifts to immediate family members be made public.

McDonnell has disclosed receiving $9,650 in gifts from Williams and Star Scientific, including private plane trips and a summer lake-house vacation.

On Friday, Galen said that Williams’s version of events cannot be trusted, and he stressed that neither Williams nor his company received any state grants, loans, contracts or similar tangible state benefits. Bill Burck, an attorney for Maureen McDonnell, said it is not surprising that the first couple socialized with Williams, since they were all friends.

Galen noted that a Star spokeswoman has previously said that the company never sought any special benefits from the state.

Williams’s version

Williams and other Star Scientific officials have provided investigators with extensive details of gifts Williams gave to the governor and his relatives, and in some cases, their accounts differ from the governor’s about McDonnell’s role and knowledge, according to people familiar with the evidence.

Those accounts show that Williams arranged to be reimbursed by his company for many of the gifts, a sign that he viewed the gifts as a business expense that would pay dividends to the company.

The company has told investigators that corporate officials initially were not aware that Williams was tapping company accounts to pay for gifts to the McDonnells, other than when Williams formally sought reimbursement for plane trips he provided to McDonnell for campaign events, according to people familiar with their accounts.

Jerry Kilgore, an attorney for Williams, declined to comment, as did Abbe Lowell, Star’s attorney.

People familiar with the probe say Williams and the company have turned over records showing that he paid for golf outings for the governor at elite country clubs in the Richmond area a half-dozen times between May and September 2011. The records are also said to indicate that Star reimbursed Williams that year for $7,500 in greens fees, golf equipment and apparel for the governor, his twin college-aged sons and members of his staff.

Star, likewise, underwrote a trip Williams arranged for the governor and first lady to Cape Cod a year ago, paying for private plane travel and a stay at a seaside inn.

The governor’s disclosure form appears to report the gift, noting that Star paid nearly $7,400 for flights between Richmond and Massachusetts, lodgings and event expenses in 2012.

The disclosure form doesn’t note these details: that the first couple went together to the Cape, joined by Williams, Williams’s wife and Johns Hopkins University doctor Paul Ladenson, who has served as a top consultant to Star. The weekend was part of a campaign by Williams to sell the governor and other top state officials on his company’s new dietary supplement, Anatabloc, the people said.

Ladenson, who also attended a luncheon hosted by the first lady at the governor’s mansion to mark the launch of Anatabloc in 2011, did not respond to requests for comment.

Virginia State Police records show taxpayers paid $2,967.83 for the governor’s protective detail to join him for the five-day stay at the Chatham Bars Inn, a hotel once described by Boston Magazine as a likely haunt of a modern-day Jay Gatsby.

That same Labor Day weekend, Williams also used personal credit card reward points to pay for McDonnell’s then-24-year-old daughter, Rachel, and a friend to fly to Florida for a vacation, according to people familiar with his account. The trip was described as a graduate school graduation present.

Another example of Williams’s gift-giving submitted to investigators involved a September 2011 fundraiser in Richmond for the American Cancer Society, which Williams attended as a guest of the first lady. The event, “Cure By Design,” featured a fashion show with cancer survivors as models and an auction of clothing and other fashion-related items.

Williams arranged for a male model with whom he is friends to travel to Richmond from New York for the event and escort Maureen McDonnell down the catwalk, recalled designer Alex Garfield, who served as a celebrity auctioneer at the event. Pictures on the charity’s Facebook page show the governor and first lady posing with Williams, the model and Garfield.

Garfield recalled that as the auction began, the governor appeared on the stage to take part. In front of a large audience, Williams agreed to pay $15,000, the winning bid, to give the first lady one of the evening’s most prized items: a weekend in New York and a tour of the fashion district conducted by Garfield.

“The governor was standing on the stage next to me,” Garfield said. “We were watching everybody. If he knew [Williams], he knew it.”

Although Williams paid for the trip, Garfield indicated that the first lady hadn’t claimed her prize.

Governor’s version

McDonnell has said he once considered Williams — whom he met shortly before his 2009 campaign for governor — a “family friend.”

“The McDonnells and Williams families were friends. They socialized together because of their friendship. The notion that there was anything else to it is just plain wrong,” Burck, the attorney for Maureen McDonnell, said Friday.

Since news emerged that Williams is cooperating with prosecutors, the governor’s spokesman has described the executive as someone long in trouble with government entities. On Friday, Galen said Williams needs to “appear to be cooperating” to avoid his own legal troubles.

Galen called Williams “hardly a credible source” and said evidence will show that Williams repeatedly “falsified his expense accounts with respect to his claimed dealings with the Governor and Mrs. McDonnell.”

In an e-mail exchange with The Post, Galen did not address the most recently discovered gifts from Williams to the governor and his family.

McDonnell apologized last month for breaching the public’s trust in his interactions with Williams. But he has also said publicly that he was not aware of all of Williams’s gifts.

For example, attorneys for the first couple told prosecutors in their August meeting that Maureen McDonnell did not initially tell her husband that Williams took her on a $15,000 shopping trip in New York in spring 2011. Nor did she tell him that Williams was the source of a $6,500 Rolex watch, inscribed with the words “71st Governor of Virginia,” which she gave the governor for Christmas that year, the McDonnells’ attorneys said.

Many of McDonnell’s loyalists have long maintained quietly that the governor was a victim of his wife’s excesses and was so busy with state business that he had little time to monitor her behavior.

As a legal matter, ignorance could be helpful to the governor if it helps him convince prosecutors that he was not taking action in exchange for Williams’s gifts and that his wife was not working on Williams’s behalf when she used her role and state offices to help the company.

Attorneys for the governor and first lady maintain that he also was initially unaware that she on several occasions bought stock in Star Scientific, purchases that gave his family a financial stake in the company as she was simultaneously promoting the company at Star events across the country.

They have said publicly that the governor’s actions to help the company were limited, were not out of the ordinary and were not undertaken as part of any exchange with Williams.

Those actions are even less problematic, they have argued to prosecutors, when paired with how little he knew about his wife’s actions.

Prosecutors are now weighing that claim, along with Star corporate records and other evidence they have gathered over a months-long investigation. People familiar with Williams’s account have said that the executive has told prosecutors that he and the governor had discussed ways to help Star.

The governor’s allies have bemoaned leaks of allegations that have surfaced in the probe, and Galen said in a written statement that the leaks were intended to “harm the reputation of Governor McDonnell and his family.”

“It is important for citizens to take much of what Mr. Williams says with a grain of salt,” Galen said."

Serrano Was A Federal Law Enforcement', 'Terrorism Reporter In The Los Angeles Times', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Bureau.

Dennis K. Burke, who resigned from the U.S. attorney’s office following the Fast and Furious matter, told investigators that he leaked an internal memorandum to a television producer in which ATF Special Agent John Dodson discussed an earlier case involving gun trafficking on the border. Burke told investigators that he did not believe he had done anything illegal.

However, he was sharply admonished by his supervisor, the deputy attorney general in Washington. He was prodded to resign over Fast and Furious and left the U.S. attorney’s office in Phoenix in August 2011. Until then he had been seen as a rising Democratic political star.

Under the Fast and Furious program, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives purposely allowed hundreds of guns to be illegally purchased in the hope of tracking them to Mexican cartel leaders. Instead, almost all of the firearms were lost. Two turned up at the site of the slaying of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in southern Arizona in December 2010.

Burke could not be reached for comment Monday.

In November, the inspector general’s office issued a report sharply criticizing the ATF for Fast and Furious. The findings Monday were a follow-up to that report and determined that “Burke’s disclosure was likely motivated by a desire to undermine Special Agent’s Dodson’s public criticisms of Operation Fast and Furious.”

The Dodson memo discussed a case he worked on in which he served as an undercover agent posing as an illegal straw purchaser providing firearms to a trafficker, and he discussed the tactic of “walking” firearms as a way to build an investigation. Burke saw the document as evidence that Dodson also condoned “gun walking” investigations, and personally emailed it to a friend in Washington with the intent of sharing it with a Fox News producer.

The inspector general’s report said Burke told both Deputy Atty. Gen. James M. Cole and the inspector general that he had leaked the internal memo. He said he did so thinking it was already in the hands of congressional investigators and would come out eventually. Nevertheless, Burke acknowledged it had been a “mistake” to leak the document.

Burke’s departure came after he also leaked a separate internal memo to the New York Times about the guns recovered at the site of the Terry slaying. Burke admitted he had leaked the memo, which was published on the paper’s website with his fax number on the copy. Cole called the leak “another horrible incident of bad judgment.”

The inspector general referred the Burke matter to the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility to determine whether Burke’s behavior violated any state bar association rules of conduct. It was unclear whether the office would go further and open a broader investigation.

Before he stepped down, Burke had a promising political future and had built a strong record for being tough on border crime. He was seen as a likely Democratic candidate for governor or senator from Arizona, and he had been a protege of Janet Napolitano, now secretary of the Homeland Security Department, who earlier served as attorney general and governor in Arizona.

Washington (CNN) - Two Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have asked the panel’s chairman to withdraw his Obamacare subpoena of the White House chief technology officer, according to a letter sent Monday.

In the letter released to reporters, Reps. Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Gerald Connolly of Virginia called Rep. Darrell Issa’s subpoena of Todd Park “unnecessary and misguided,” and said it was part of a “predetermined political strategy rather than a constructive effort to conduct responsible oversight.”



The California Republican subpoenaed Park on Friday, saying he had refused to testify at a hearing scheduled for Wednesday on the rocky rollout of the HealthCare.gov website.

“Your unwillingness to appear before the committee continues an unfortunate pattern of the current administration when it comes to matters of transparency and congressional oversight,” Issa wrote in a letter to Park.

Connolly and Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the Oversight panel, argued that Issa mischaracterized a proposed delay by Park in testifying as a refusal to do so.

“When Mr. Park received your invitation to testify, his immediate response, as conveyed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, was to agree to testify before the Committee, but to request a short delay while the lion’s share of fixes to Healthcare.gov are being implemented in November,” Cummings and Connolly wrote, noting that Park also offered to give a briefing to Congress.

“He did not request a delay of months, but of weeks.”

The delay is necessary, the two Democrats argued, because preparing for a congressional hearing would take away from time needed to fix the beleaguered website.

“Mr. Park has been a key leader in around-the-clock efforts to improve the functionality of the HealthCare.gov website, and diverting Mr. Park’s energies at this moment could seriously impair those efforts.”

Democrats have criticized Issa and other Republicans for their sustained assault on HealthCare.gov and the law that created it in heated congressional hearings over the past few weeks.

Democrats argue the hearings and Issa’s multiple subpoenas of Obama administration officials, are politically motivated.

Issa has said he’s interested only in the truth.

An IRS official said groups with words %22tea party%22 or %22patriot%22 in applications were singled out

Many conservative organizations said they were being harassed by the IRS

Head of House investigating panel say further probes on the horizon

WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service apologized Friday for subjecting Tea Party groups to additional scrutiny during the 2012 election, but denied any political motive.

Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS unit that oversees tax-exempt groups, said organizations that included the words ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their applications for tax-exempt status were singled out for additional reviews. Her remarks, which came at an American Bar Association gathering, were first reported by the Associated Press.

White House spokesman Jay Carney on Friday afternoon called the IRS action ""inappropriate"" and said the Obama administration supports a full investigation, suggesting the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration would have jurisdiction.

Lerner said the practice, initiated by low-level workers in Cincinnati, was wrong.

""It was an error in judgment, and it was not appropriate, but that's what they did,"" Lerner told reporters. She declined to talk about how many employees were involved and whether there would disciplinary action. ""I think they were insensitive, or less sensitive than they should have been.""

The error, she said, was in assuming that any group with ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in its name necessarily needed more scrutiny for political activity just because of its name. About 300 groups that had applied for tax-exempt status were put into a ""bucket"" of cases needing further scrutiny, and of those, about a quarter had tea party affiliations.

That problem was compounded when examiners asked more intrusive questions in what's known as a ""development"" process. ""Some of the development letters that were send were far too broad and include things like asking for the organization's donor list, which is not generally what we do,"" Lerner said.

Since the problem was discovered sometime last year, the IRS has approved about 130 of the original 300 applications, and about 25 have been withdrawn. The rest remain pending, and no application has been denied.

Lerner said she had never discussed the issue with Treasury or White House officials and could not say whether they knew of the problems before her apology Friday. She said her focus had been on fixing the problem.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., announced Friday afternoon that the Republican-led chamber will investigate.



Earlier, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asked the White House to conduct a government-wide review to ensure ""that these thuggish practices are not underway at the IRS or elsewhere in the administration against anyone, regardless of their political views.""

Tea Party groups said they were outraged by the IRS actions.

Jenny Beth Martin, the national coordinator of Tea Party Patriots, said the IRS workers involved should resign. ""The IRS has demonstrated the most disturbing, illegal and outrageous abuse of government power,"" she said in a statement.""This deliberate targeting and harassment of tea party groups reaches a new low in illegal government activity and overreach. It is suspicious that the activity of these 'low-level workers' was unknown to IRS leadership at the time it occurred.""

Conservative groups complained during the election that they were being harassed by the IRS. They said the agency asked them an inordinate number of questions to justify their tax-exempt status, and 27 Tea Party groups joined with conservative lawyer Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice to push back on the IRS.

Kentucky 9/12 Project is one of the conservative organizations that joined with Sekulow to complain of government overreach.

Its executive director, Eric Wilson, said his group applied for tax-exempt status in December 2010. He said the IRS responded with an 88-page questionnaire that sought all the organization's correspondence, the names of its members -- along with details of group's activity on Facebook and Twitter. It was eventually granted its nonprofit designation last month.

""I would love to say that I feel vindicated, but to think that the government has the capability to reach into the lives of people in our organization is not only scary but describes the times we live in today,"" Wilson said of the apology.

Certain tax-exempt charitable groups can conduct political activities but it cannot be their primary activity.

In March 2012, Rep. Charles Boustany Jr., R-La., asked the IRS to explain why it was ""questioning new tax-exempt applicants, including grassroots political entities such as Tea Party groups, about their operations and donors.""

In response, the IRS acknowledged last June that there were backlogs in processing tax-exempt determinations for political groups, which were attributed to a spike in applications during an election year. But IRS Deputy Commissioner Steven T. Miller assured Boustany at the time that the office ""took steps to coordinate the handling of the cases to ensure consistency.""

""Despite their unwillingness to cooperate, more than a year later, the IRS has now admitted to what we long suspected — it was targeting tea party groups,"" Boustany said in a statement Friday. ""The IRS's 'too little too late' response is unacceptable, and I will continue to work to ensure there are protections in place so no American, regardless of political affiliation, has their right to free speech threatened by the IRS.""

The Nixon administration obtained an injunction to stop their publication.

Spiro T. Agnew, who served as vice president under President Richard Nixon, resigned his position after being indicted for bribery charges, becoming the first U.S. vice president in history to resign under criminal charges.

President Richard Nixon resigned his office after being implicated in a cover-up following a burglary at political offices in the Watergate building.

In one of his first acts as president, Gerald Ford granted ""a full, free and absolute pardon"" to former President Richard Nixon for all crimes he may have committed while president, including his involvement in the Watergate scandal.

For 444 days -- ending in what would be the final year of his presidency -- President Jimmy Carter sought to gain the release of 52 Americans held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran.

Senior officials working for President Ronald Reagan secretly arranged for the sale of military weapons to Iran with the hope that American hostages held there would be released and the proceeds could be used to fund the Contras fighting in a rebellion in Nicaragua -- a violation of the Boland Act that expressly prohibited U.S. funding of the rebels.

President George H. W. Bush pardoned former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger and five other officials who served under Ronald Reagan for their involvement in trading arms for hostages in Iran.

President Bill Clinton was ultimately impeached by Congress after he lied under oath about an affair he had with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

Former CIA covert agent Valerie Plame Wilson had her identity revealed by George W. Bush's Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage after her husband wrote a scathing op-ed in The New York Times.

When President George W. Bush addressed the nation aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln in May of 2003, standing in front of a ""Mission Accomplished"" banner, few expected that the U.S. involvement in the deadly Iraq War would last for another eight years.

President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came under intense scrutiny about the handling of the investigation of the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that led to the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other embassy employees.

Officials in the Obama administration's Internal Revenue Service came under fire after revelations that workers in its Cincinnati office targeted for extra scrutiny tea party and conservative groups applying for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status.

Story highlights Howard Kurtz: AP phone records search, other stories have turned press on Obama He says attention isn't just out of press self-interest; Obama's stuck in number of scandals He says that for the first time, press started to think Obama misled them Kurtz: GOP may overreach to damage Obama; still, scandal could drown out governing

Editor’s Note: Howard Kurtz is the host of CNN’s “Reliable Sources.”

(CNN) —

The press has turned on President Obama with a vengeance.

Suddenly, the White House briefing room is filled with confrontational questions. Suddenly, the news pages are ablaze with scandal, and the commentators – even some of the president’s usual defenders – are bemoaning his shortcomings. Suddenly, Obama isn’t getting the benefit of the doubt.

According to Obama’s longtime detractors, the denizens of the fourth estate are finally climbing out of a tank in which they have been immersed since roughly 2007. But the reality is a bit more nuanced than that.

CNN Howard Kurtz

There are a number of unsavory allegations swirling around Washington, but do not underestimate the importance of the Justice Department seizing two months of Associated Press phone records without so much as a heads-up. This not only seems like a case of prosecutorial overreach, even in a case involving national security, it strikes at the heart of what journalists do – and has fostered feelings of betrayal. Does the administration not understand the chilling effect on reporters and their sources, they wonder, or simply not care?

It’s easy to say that news organizations recoiled from Obama only when their own special interests were threatened, and maybe there’s some truth to that. But the media also have a deep, abiding love for scandal, and beyond the AP phone records story, the administration is lately providing that scandal in spades.

The battle over Benghazi has mostly divided along partisan lines, with conservatives seeing a sustained coverup and liberals perceiving a partisan attack on what was a bungled operation and confused aftermath. But the report by ABC’s Jonathan Karl alleging the scrubbing of the Susan Rice talking points (following a less-noticed report by Stephen Hayes of the Weekly Standard) transformed the tone of the coverage in a single stroke.

The Karl report turned out to be based on an inaccurate, misleading characterization of an email, but for the first time, many journalists came to believe the administration had something to hide—and that they had been personally misled in press briefings. That is guaranteed to get the blood flowing.

The disclosure that the IRS selectively targeted conservative groups for review brought immediate condemnation from many across the media spectrum, including Carl Bernstein, who investigated the Nixonian abuses, of which this story carries an unmistakable echo. And it is the trifecta of these scandalous sagas that will dominate coverage for months as media outlets feast on the cycle of investigations, hearings, subpoenas, resignations and denials.

Any doubt that scandal trumps ideology in the media firmament can be dispelled with a glance back at Bill Clinton’s tenure, when what he called the “knee-jerk liberal press” investigated Monica Lewinsky, Whitewater and other allegations with a fervor that eventually put it on a virtual war footing against the White House.

More troubling for the current crew is that news outlets are starting to pivot to broader questions about whether Obama is competent at the business of government or a passive bystander in his own administration. That impression, if it takes hold, cannot be Etch-a-Sketched away.

To be sure, some of Obama’s antagonists will overreach by framing every scandal as the next Watergate and each revelation as an impeachable offense. That may trigger a counter-reaction in which some of the president’s liberal allies shift their focus from the administration’s missteps to the opposition’s overkill.

Some in the media rolled over for Barack Obama in the 2008 campaign, though the record was decidedly more mixed once he took office. But personal feelings toward this president who has never courted the press no longer matter; nor do personal predilections on gun control and immigration reform. The scandal machinery has kicked into high gear, and its sheer noise may drown out everything else.

Jackson To Obama: 'Stop Trying To Relate, Be F--king Presidential'","Samuel L. Jackson did not mince words when he said President Obama needs to ""stop trying to 'relate'"" and ""be f--king presidential.""

The 64-year-old recently gave a candid interview to Playboy's Stephen Rebello. The discussion opened with talk of his new flick with Spike Lee, ""Oldboy,"" and then turned to talk of linguistic errors in society today. Jackson told an anecdote about how, when he was younger, he always made sure to address his elders properly. Nowadays, he sees people on Twitter who don't even know the difference between ""your"" and ""you're."" (To which the actor asked: ""How the f--k did we become a society where mediocrity is acceptable?"")

Rebello raised the point that even highly educated people, including Barack Obama, consciously drop g's from words in order to sound more like the average Joe.

""First of all, we know it ain’t because of his blackness, so I say stop trying to 'relate,'"" Jackson replied while chatting with the men's magazine in West Hollywood. ""Be a leader. Be f--king presidential. Look, I grew up in a society where I could say 'It ain’t' or 'What it be' to my friends. But when I’m out presenting myself to the world as me, who graduated from college, who had family who cared about me, who has a well-read background, I f--king conjugate.""

He then addressed comments he made last year to Ebony magazine, saying he hopes ""Obama gets scary in the next four years."" Alas, he doesn't think much has changed since then, due to the political deadlock in Washington.

""He got a little heated about the kids getting killed in Newtown and about the gun law,"" he told Playboy. ""He’s still a safe dude. But with those Republicans, we’re now in a situation where even if he said, 'I want to give you motherf--kers a raise,' they’d go, 'F--k you! We don’t want a raise!' ... How do we fix the fact that politicians aren’t trying to serve the people, they’re just trying to serve their party and their closed ideals?""

(The actor's use of the f-word is not out of anger. He has said that using the term ""motherf**kers"" helped stop his stutter.)

Despite his harsh words, Jackson has long been an Obama supporter. Last September, before the 2012 election, he starred in an ad telling people to ""Wake the F--k Up"" and vote for Obama, dubbing Mitt Romney an ""out-of-touch millionaire.""

In 2008, Jackson helped raise $10 million for Obama, according to The Hill. Both he and Sharon Stone donated $50,000. Other donors included Halle Berry, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jamie Foxx."

FBI investigating allegations Sen. Menendez patronized prostitutes in Dominican Republic

A team of FBI agents has been conducting interviews in recent weeks in the Dominican Republic and the United States, looking into allegations that Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) patronized prostitutes in the Caribbean nation, but has found no evidence to support the claim, according to two people familiar with the investigation.

One person said agents have asked about whether a Florida eye doctor — a close friend and major campaign donor to Menendez — provided the senator with prostitutes on vacations there. Another person said investigators are looking into allegations involving underage prostitutes and sex parties.

The two, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an active investigation, said FBI agents are following leads provided by an unknown tipster. In a series of e-mails with the FBI, the tipster alleged that the doctor, Salomon Melgen, had made prostitutes available to Menendez while he was staying at his friend’s resort home in the Dominican Republic. The tipster, in particular, mentioned young prostitutes and prostitution parties.

The FBI agents are also examining the role Menendez played in advocating for a port security contract in the Dominican Republic that would benefit Melgen, two people familiar with the case said. Menendez has urged U.S. officials to put pressure on the Dominican government to enforce the dormant contract, saying enhanced port security is important for interdicting drug trafficking. Melgen is an investor in the company holding the contract.

FBI spokesman Michael Leverock, of the bureau’s field office in Miami, declined to comment for this article.

Menendez has vehemently denied the prostitution allegations, calling them false “smears.”

“As we have said all along, Senator Menendez welcomes any review because his actions have been appropriate, and we believe the facts will confirm that,” a Menendez aide said Friday.

The staff member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the senator’s efforts on behalf of the port deal were appropriate. “The senator has had a long history of advocating for increased port security across the world,” the aide said.

Melgen and his attorneys declined to comment on any criminal investigation.

The relationship between Menendez and Melgen has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks. Menendez acknowledged this month that he had failed to properly disclose two trips he took in 2010 on Melgen’s private plane to Melgen’s villa, near the resort of Casa de Campo. The senator said he wrote Melgen a personal check for $58,500 to reimburse him for the plane rides last month. The Senate Ethics Committee is investigating the matter.

Separately, Melgen is under criminal investigation over allegations of Medicare fraud. Three people with knowledge of the probe disclosed this week that it focuses on whether Melgen defrauded the government by overcharging Medicare for millions of dollars in eye injections and billing the government for treatments that were unnecessary.

The FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General raided Melgen’s Palm Beach eye clinic Jan. 29, searching records and collecting boxes of documents. The raid came days after the tipster’s e-mail exchange with the FBI was posted anonymously on a Web site.

Melgen’s attorney said this client was cooperating with authorities in the Medicare investigation and declined to answer further questions.

“At this time it would be inappropriate to comment about the ongoing investigation,” said the attorney, Kirk Ogrosky.

In checking into the prostitution allegations, FBI agents are examining claims initially made in a series of letters the tipster wrote last spring to staff members at a government watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), according to the two people familiar with their inquiries.

The claims were also carried on a conservative news Web site, the Daily Caller.

CREW’s executive director Melanie Sloan said her staff could not get the tipster to agree to meet or speak on the telephone. As a result, Sloan told a Washington Post reporter last month, she had doubts about the credibility of the person’s claims. The FBI began looking into the tipster’s story after CREW forwarded his information to the Justice Department and the FBI’s Washington field office in July.

Prostitution is not illegal in the Dominican Republic. But soliciting underage prostitutes is illegal. Also, a politician who accepts free gifts and special favors in exchange for official acts can face criminal prosecution for abuse of public office.

The allegations in the letters included the names of a few women who allegedly had improper relations with Menendez and Melgen, including that of a Dominican teenager who told a local television station she had no involvement and had never left her village.

The Miami Herald reached another one of the women for an interview, and she explained that she worked for Melgen and considered him a generous person but did not elaborate. An attorney for the woman, Svitlana Buchyk, told a Post reporter Friday that the tipster’s claims about her are “absurd.”

“Ms. Buchyk is an actress and model attending to her career,” said her attorney, Gerald Greenberg. “Any allegation that she had an improper relationship with Senator Menendez or anyone else is sheer nonsense. The claims about her that have appeared in fringe-media sources are irresponsible and utterly absurd.”

Greenberg declined to discuss whether his client had been interviewed by law enforcement officials.

In an e-mail to the tipster in September, FBI agent Regino Chavez wrote, “If you can give me . . . information on all the young ladies who were victimized that would be helpful.” The agent repeatedly asked the tipster, who called himself Pete Williams and only corresponded by e-mail, to meet, but he declined.

According to FBI affidavits filed in court, Chavez was listed last year as a member of a task force based out of the Miami field office that specialized in tracking crimes involving abuse of minors, soliciting minors to engage in prostitution and sex trafficking.

While she technically served a stint as a White House advisor to the President, her role has always been that of an aggressive political operator. That their meetings coincided with the IRS targeting of conservative and Tea Party organizations raises many questions.

Cutter may have had an official White House title, but she has always been a campaign operative. In 2010, she was named an Assistant to the President, charged with communications and outreach for ObamaCare. Presumably, it is in this role that she was in meetings with Shulman. This itself is odd, because as the IRS is tasked with implementing large swathes of ObamaCare, HHS is responsible for the public outreach and oversight of the public exchanges at the heart of the law.

Cutter has not revealed the details of the meetings she attended with Shulman. We don’t know the exact dates they met, except that they must have coincided with the IRS targeting of conservative groups. We do know that the targeting began around the time that ObamaCare was enacted.

It is hard to imagine a meeting agenda that would include both the supposedly non-partisan IRS Commissioner Shulman and the hyper-partisan Cutter. The IRS is supposed to develop technocratic rules to implement ObamaCare. Communications and outreach ought not be part of their mission. Could it be that part of the White House’s outreach plan on ObamaCare was to silence opponents?

Cutter should be called to testify under oath before the House Oversight Committee to explain the details of these meetings. Her portfolio at the time, communications and outreach, imply a political component that would not ordinarily be tasked to the IRS Commissioner. What, exactly, were the nature of these meetings?"

""It became apparent to all of us quickly that this was not a demonstration, this was a violent attack,"" Ham said. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton initially had portrayed the embassy attack as a response to an inflammatory internet video.

Ham said he was in Washington D.C. for a routine meeting on September 11, 2012 with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Martin Dempsey, when an alert came in from commanders in Stuttgart, Germany that a violent assault was underway on the consulate in Benghazi and Ambassador Chris Stevens was missing.

Asked if it was a terrorist attack, Ham said the intelligence left no doubt that it was.

“I don't know if that was my first reaction, but pretty quickly as we started to gain understanding within the hours after the initiation of the attack, yes.""

While Ham did not address reports he was pushed into retirement after Benghazi, he said a quick response to the attack was not possible -- and he defended the decision not to scramble fighter jets.

""It was perfectly understandable to me why people would say you should have done that (but) in my military judgment, there was not a necessity and there was not a clear purpose in doing so.""

Ham's public assessment, believed to be his first since the attack that left four Americans dead, including Stevens, bears special weight since he was the regional commander for Africa.His comments last weekend are in line with those of his former boss, Panetta, who testified before the Senate Armed Services committee in February.

""When I later found out that you had RPGs and mortars and there was an attack on that second facility, there was no question in my mind it was a terrorist attack,""then Defense Secretary Panetta said.

Asked why Clinton initially blamed an internet video for the attack -- calling it a ""response to inflammatory material posted on the internet"" -- when senior military officials knew the day of the attack it was terrorism, the State Department Monday tried to portray the disconnect as old news.

""I'm not going to litigate what's already been evaluated,""said spokeswoman Jen Psaki.

""This Administration has always been clear that violent extremists were involved in this attack,"" Psaki said. ""The question was who exactly they were and whether there was also a demonstration at the same time. It now appears that there wasn’t, despite the intelligence assessment at the time.

In a letter to Hagel and Secretary of State John Kerry, Republican Congressman Frank Wolf, is pressing the administration to explain why it has not used the military to detain five Benghazi suspects.

Ham told the Aspen conference he believed the fragile government in Libya was to blame for the investigation's lack of progress."

Update 7:12 p.m. ET, 12/6/2013

(CNN) - The White House clarified Thursday that President Barack Obama did live with his Kenyan uncle in Cambridge, Massachusetts for a ""brief period of time"" before attending Harvard Law School in the 1980s after previously saying there was no record of the two ever meeting.

The clarification comes amid GOP criticism over the issue of Obama’s honesty and trustworthiness, two personal traits the president has taken a hit on in recent polls.



Obama apologizes for health coverage cancellations due to Obamacare

Onyango Okech Obama, President Obama's uncle, was granted permission Tuesday by a federal immigration judge to stay in the United States, where he has lived illegally for the past five decades. In his testimony before the judge, Obama's uncle mentioned that then-student Obama had stayed with him for three weeks after he was accepted into law school.

The White House was asked about their relationship in 2011 at which time the administration said there was no record of the President and Onyango Okech Obama having ever met. Carney retracted that information Thursday saying that the President himself had never been consulted about their relationship.

""Back when this arose, folks looked at the record, including the President's book, and there was no evidence that they had met. And that was what was conveyed. Nobody spoke to the President,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters.

""When Omar Obama said the other day and there were reports that he had said the other day that President Obama, back when he was a law school student, had stayed with him in Cambridge, I thought it was the right thing to do to go ask him.""

Carney continued: ""Nobody had asked him in the past, and the President said that he in fact had met Omar Obama when he moved to Cambridge for law school and that he stayed with him for a brief period of time until his, the President's, apartment was ready.""

Carney said after that period, Obama and his uncle ""saw each other once every few months while the President was in Cambridge"" but eventually ""fell out of touch.""

The White House said they had no record that the President had met his relative after his uncle was arrested for drunk driving in 2011. The driving violation brought to light Onyango Okech Obama's illegal status, and he was then ordered to regularly check in with immigration.

""The President has not seen Omar Obama in 20 years, and has not spoken with him in roughly 10 years,"" Carney said, adding that Obama had ""absolutely zero"" involvement in his relative's deportation case.

Onyango Okech Obama isn't the first of the President's relatives to have issues with immigration status. Onyango Okech Obama's sister, Zeituni Onyango, was granted permission to stay in the United States in 2010 after a six-year-plus legal battle over her status.

While the immigration court was considering Zeituni Onyango's case in 2009, then-White House spokesman Ben Labolt said Obama would stay out of his aunt's immigration case and ""the president believes that the case should run its ordinary course.""

It seems that Onyango Okech Obama's appearance and mention of his nephew's stay before law school in immigration court earlier this week was what prompted the White House to take measures to correct the record.

The administration's initial denial that the President had met his uncle and subsequent reversal of the record raises speculation that Onyango Okech Obama's court appearances and immigration status first led the White House to distance the President from the controversy and deliver misleading information.

The President is already facing questions about his credibility after technological issues and reports of canceled insurance plans plagued the recent rollout of parts of Obamacare, the sweeping healthcare reform law passed in his first term. A CNN/ORC International survey released last month indicates that 53% of Americans now believe that Obama is not honest and trustworthy, the first time that a clear majority in CNN polling has felt that way.

The reversal over details of Obama's relationship with his uncle could prove to be another detriment to Obama's credibility with the public.

Obama: People do think I'm trustworthy

And Republicans say the White House's change of story indicates a lack of trustworthiness in the President.

""It just goes back to this thing of the White House not being completely forthright with facts with the public. It's what's contributed to his trustworthiness numbers going way down,"" said Republican Strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro said Friday.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Obama has been ""lying to the American people.""

""He's been exposed. And these little lies, like, you know, lying about whether you met someone or not that's been significant in your life - listen, those are big things because it goes to the character of the person that you're dealing with,"" he said Thursday on Fox News.

""And President Obama is proving himself not to be trustworthy on the small things and now the very big things.""

Obama attended Harvard Law School beginning in 1988 when he was 28 after serving as a community organizer in Chicago."

Even before recent revelations of misconduct by his Administration, Obama’s approval ratings have been declining throughout the year. On Monday, Rasmussen reported that 47% of likely voters approved of Obama’s handling of his job, while 51% disapproved. This is a massive 20 point negative swing since the first of the year.

At the end of 2012, 57% of voters approved of Obama, while just 41% disapproved. He garnered good will from voters following his reelection in November. Yet, in just 6 months, the post-reelection honeymoon is clearly over. His approval rating is even lower than President Bush as this point in his second term. In June 2005, 48% of voters approved of the job Bush was doing, while 47% disapproved. As fatigue over the Iraq war grew and conservatives felt alienated, Bush’s approval ratings plummeted into the 30s by the time his term was complete.

Obama’s approval ratings have remained steady because he has enjoyed the full support of his base. The current scandals engulfing his Administration, however, threaten that support. The expansive government spying revealed in the NSA leak is opposed by a considerable block of Obama’s core supporters. He had campaigned in 2008 against many Bush policies related to the global war on terror. Rather than reverse these policies, in many cases he has expanded them.

As the full extent of the government spying becomes clearer, it, along with the other scandals, will likely erode some of Obama’s base support. The recent data from Rasmussen makes it clear this base support is all he has left. If part of that goes, Obama won’t just share Bush’s policies, but his approval ratings as well.

During Thanksgiving week, the Treasury Department announced a proposal to limit the political activity of 501(c)(4) groups. The Obama Administration claimed that the plan was necessary to clarify confusing tax laws.

The House Ways and Means Committee investigators believe that the proposal was designed by examining Tea Party group applications, figuring out exactly how they proceeded, then limiting those very actions in the new proposal, thus shutting them out of the political process.

House Ways & Means Chairman Dave Camp said, “The committee has reviewed thousands of tax exempt applications. The new regulation so closely mirrors the abused tea-party group applications, it leads me to question if this new proposed regulation is simply another form of targeting.”

Tea Party groups, just as other tax-exempt 501(c)(4) organizations, have to prove that the majority of their work is for “primary” social-welfare purpose if they want to keep their tax-exempt status. The primary purpose of most Tea party groups is illuminating for Americans the size of government and the erosion of the Constitution. They do so through nonpartisan voter guides, speakers forums, pamphlets, or voter-registration drives.

Now, however, the IRS is planning to recognize those very activities as “political activity,” not “social welfare,” thus rendering Tea Party groups unfit for 501(c)(4) status.

Thus, the new proposal is not about clarifying tax laws but rather, as Dave Camp stated, “to put Tea Party groups out of business.”

The new rule only applies to 501(c)(4) groups. The League of Women Voters Education Fund, a Democratic stronghold, is registered as a 501(c)(3), considered a “charity” that is strictly limited regarding its political activity. That same organization claims on its website that it holds “candidate debates and forums,” and its “educational activities” include “understanding candidate views and ballot initiatives.”

The League can still issue its voter guides, registrations, and candidate forums. Any conservative social-welfare organization acting similarly will probably lose its tax-exempt status. And guess which groups are unaffected by the new rule, because they are 501(c)(5)s?

As Strassel writes:

The same president who in May was “outraged” by the IRS’s actions now says it was all just some confusion over tax law (which his new rule fixes). He told Chris Matthews last week that the media had hyped what was a few poor IRS souls in Cincinnati who were “trying to streamline what is a difficult law to interpret… And they’ve got a list, and suddenly everybody’s outraged.”"

The poll shows an 8-point swing against Obama since April. Another shocking finding, undoubtedly linked to recent scandals, is that 68% of voters think the federal government is “out of control.”

Last month, 47% of voters approved of the job Obama was doing, while 45% disapproved. Disapproval of Obama has jumped 6 points since the latest scandal revelations. Among Independents, only 40% approve of Obama, while 52% disapprove. At this time 4 years ago, 60% of voters approved of Obama and only 30% disapproved.

The scandals are also taking a toll on voters expectations for Obama’s second term. A plurality 49% believe his is a lame-duck, while 47% think he still has the ability to accomplish things in his final years in office. For the first time ever, also, less than a majority see Obama has “honest and trustworthy.”

The poll also contained troubling news for embattled Attorney General Eric Holder. Just 28% of voters approve of Holder’s job performance, while 40% disapprove. It is surprising that almost 70% of voters even have an opinion of an Attorney General’s job performance.

The particular nature of the current scandals, featuring cover-ups and abuses of power, are having a dramatic effect on how voters see the federal government. 68% believe the government is “out of control” and acting in a way that threatens civil liberties. Only 26% of voters report they don’t feel this way. Even a plurality of Democrats, 47-45, say the government is “out of control.”

These are no ordinary scandals and their consequences for Obama and the Democrats are only beginning to be felt.

The poll of 1,013 voters was conducted Saturday through Monday by Republican and Democrat polling firms."

Decision could affect standing of other Obama appointees

Case could ultimately wind up in the Supreme Court

The president has maintained that the appointments were legal because the Senate was on vacation

A federal appeals court said Friday that President Obama overstepped his authority with a series of recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board.

The case may wind up in the Supreme Court and determine how far the president can go in appointing people whose nominations would otherwise be blocked by the Senate.

The result could affect the standing of other Obama recess appointees, such as the head of the president's new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray.

White House press secretary Jay Carney said the administration ""respectfully but strongly"" disagrees with the court's ruling, arguing that it ran counter to precedents dating back 150 years.

The Justice Department also criticized the court's decision. ""We disagree with the court's ruling and believe that the President's recess appointments are constitutionally sound,"" a department spokesperson said.

Administration officials indicated they would appeal the decision, and predicted they would win similar cases pending before other judges.

""This is one case in one court,"" said Carney.

In legal briefs, Obama said his recess appointments were legal because the Senate was on vacation at the time. The president has authority to make temporary appointments without Senate approval if the Senate is not in session.

But Republican senators who joined in a lawsuit said the chamber stayed in a ""pro forma"" session during the time in question, denying Obama the right to make recess appointments — and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed with them. In these ""pro forma"" sessions, a senator would gavel an empty chamber to order every few days and then recess again.

Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said today's decision ""will go a long way toward restoring the constitutional separation of powers,"" while Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the decision ""reaffirmed that the Constitution is not an inconvenience but the law of the land.""

Senate Republicans had blocked Obama's appointees to the National Labor Relations Board, calling them too pro-union.

It's not known whether the Supreme Court will step into this White House-Congress dispute.

As it stands now, the decision invalidates hundreds of decisions made over the past year by the National Labor Relations Board.

Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work Foundation, released a statement calling the court's decision ""a victory for independent-minded workers.""



On Jan. 4, 2012 — the same day he appointed Cordray — Obama appointed Deputy Labor Secretary Sharon Block, union lawyer Richard Griffin and NLRB counsel Terence Flynn to fill vacancies on labor relations board — those are the appointments in question.

The Cordray appointment is still under challenge in a separate case pending before the appeals court.

C. Boyden Gray, a former White House counsel to President George H. W. Bush, said in a statement that one key takeaway from today's decision is that the president ""has no power to declare when a recess exists"" as he said Obama did with the appointment of Cordray and the NLRB board members.

On Wednesday, he told the House Government Oversight Committee that the State Department went out of its way to keep Hicks from communicating with Congressman Jason Chaffetz and Oversight Committee staff without a State Department lawyer.

The State Department seemingly made Hicks unavailable to the media, as the State Department switchboard had no information on Hicks’ whereabouts or contact information when Breitbart News asked for it in December and January.

“I was instructed not to allow the RSO, the acting Deputy Chief of Mission, and myself to be interviewed by Congressman Chaffetz,” Hicks told Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

Chaffetz, along with a congressional delegation, visited the U.S. embassy in Tripoli following the attacks.

“You had several Congressional delegations come to you from various places around the world. Has that ever happened, when lawyers get on the phone to you prior a congressional delegation, coming to investigate a time when we’ve had four Americans lose their lives?” Jordan questioned. “Have you ever had anyone tell you, ‘Don’t talk with the people from Congress coming to find out what’s at play?'”

“Never,” Hicks responded. He said that it was the first time such an incident ever occurred.

According to Hicks, one of the State lawyers on the phone call tried to accompany the members of the delegation and staff from the Oversight Committee to every meeting Hicks attended.

The State Department lawyers were excluded from a classified briefing Hicks attended with the delegation because the attorneys did not have clearance to attend. The incident provoked a phone call from then-Sec. Clinton’s State Department Counsel, Cheryl Mills.

“You had another conversation on the phone with Cheryl Mills. She’s the counselor for the Department of State. She’s the staff counsel to Secretary Clinton,” Jordan clarified. He asked, “Is that a pretty important position?” Hicks responded affirmatively on both accounts.

“She is the fixer for the Secretary of State. She’s as close as you can get to Secretary Clinton?” Jordan asked.

Hicks agreed, saying Mills was “very upset” about State lawyers being excluded from the classified briefing with Chaffetz and the rest of the delegation.

“She demanded a report on the visit,” Hicks said. Mills served as the Counselor and Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton since January of 2009."

USA TODAY

The enmity between President Obama's team and a top House Republican is spilling out into public view.

First, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., who is investigating the Obama administration as chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, described White House spokesman Jay Carney as a ""paid liar.""

Then long-time Obama adviser David Plouffe responded on Twitter by referring to accusations against Issa stemming from the 1970s and '80s.

""Strong words from Mr Grand Theft Auto and suspected arsonist/insurance swindler,"" Plouffe tweeted. ""And loose ethically today.""

Issa's attack on Carney came during an interview on CNN's State of the Union, as he criticized the White House for saying the IRS targeting of conservative groups came only from officials in the agency's Cincinnati office.

Said Issa: ""Their paid liar, their spokesperson ... he's still making up things about what happens in calling this local rogue. The reason the (IRS official) Lois Lerner tried to take the Fifth is not because there is a rogue in Cincinnati, it's because this is a problem that was coordinated in all likelihood right out of Washington headquarters and we're getting to proving it.""

Carney himself said that ""I'm not going to get into a back-and-forth with Chairman Issa.""

CNN provides the background on Plouffe's counterattack on Issa:

""In 1972, then-19-year-old Issa too was arrested under suspicion of stealing a car, but Issa claims it was a case of mistaken identity and the charges were ultimately dropped.

""In 1982, the office and factory of two companies Issa had purchased, Quantum Enterprises and Steal Stopper International, caught on fire. The insurance company's investigation found ""suspicious burn patterns"" and company officials noted that in the month before the fire Issa had increased his insurance from $100,000 to $462,000.

""As the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza noted, the ""Ohio state fire marshal never determined the cause of the fire and no one was ever charged with a crime""; Issa and the insurance company settled out of court."""

Even before recent revelations of misconduct by his Administration, Obama’s approval ratings have been declining throughout the year. On Monday, Rasmussen reported that 47% of likely voters approved of Obama’s handling of his job, while 51% disapproved. This is a massive 20 point negative swing since the first of the year.

At the end of 2012, 57% of voters approved of Obama, while just 41% disapproved. He garnered good will from voters following his reelection in November. Yet, in just 6 months, the post-reelection honeymoon is clearly over. His approval rating is even lower than President Bush as this point in his second term. In June 2005, 48% of voters approved of the job Bush was doing, while 47% disapproved. As fatigue over the Iraq war grew and conservatives felt alienated, Bush’s approval ratings plummeted into the 30s by the time his term was complete.

Obama’s approval ratings have remained steady because he has enjoyed the full support of his base. The current scandals engulfing his Administration, however, threaten that support. The expansive government spying revealed in the NSA leak is opposed by a considerable block of Obama’s core supporters. He had campaigned in 2008 against many Bush policies related to the global war on terror. Rather than reverse these policies, in many cases he has expanded them.

As the full extent of the government spying becomes clearer, it, along with the other scandals, will likely erode some of Obama’s base support. The recent data from Rasmussen makes it clear this base support is all he has left. If part of that goes, Obama won’t just share Bush’s policies, but his approval ratings as well.

In an article on its website Sunday, the newspaper said Edward Snowden, 29, had asked the paper to reveal his identity and that he never planned to remain anonymous. The article said he was staying in a luxury hotel in Hong Kong, and said he had lined the door of his hotel room with pillows to prevent eavesdropping.

“I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong,” he was quoted as saying. He said he expected U.S. authorities to “demonize” him.

The development was the latest in a dizzying week that saw unauthorized publication of a “top secret” order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court authorizing the collection of telephone records; internal documents on a National Security Agency program that obtains data on foreigners from U.S. Internet companies; a directive from President Obama ordering preparation of a secret target list for cyber warfare; and a digital map that shows where the NSA spies the most.

The Guardian said Snowden was working at an NSA facility in Hawaii three weeks ago when he decided to release the documents. It said he copied the documents and then told a supervisor that he needed to go away for several weeks for medical treatment. He left for Hong Kong on May 20.

The Obama administration has prosecuted six people for illegal disclosures of classified information under the espionage act, more than all other administrations combined. Given the political furor over the leaks of some of the nation’s most closely held secrets, U.S. authorities are likely to swiftly seek Snowden’s arrest and extradition from Hong Kong, which is part of China.

Indeed, earlier Sunday, the chairs of both congressional intelligence committees had called on the Justice Department to prosecute whoever was responsible for the leaks about the telephone and Internet data surveillance programs and other national security secrets to the media in recent days.

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), who heads the House intelligence panel, said the unauthorized disclosures served to aid America’s enemies by revealing secret surveillance methods.

“If you tell our adversaries and enemies in the counterterrorism fight exactly how we conduct business, they are not going to do business the same ever again,” he said.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who heads the Senate intelligence committee, said the government needs to plug the leaks immediately. Both lawmakers appeared on ABC’s “This Week.”

Feinstein said the surveillance programs have proved their value in terrorism investigations, but most cases remained classified so officials can’t “give the public an actual idea of people that have been saved, attacks that have been prevented, that kind of thing,” she said.

But Sen. Mark Udall, (D-Colo.), a member of the Senate panel, called for lawmakers to reconsider the Patriot Act, the law that authorizes expanded surveillance by the NSA on Americans, and for a public hearing on whether the government should be allowed to collect so much data on Americans.

He said he supports an NSA program code-named PRISM, which is used to obtain Internet data on foreign targets, but is troubled that the NSA has collected and archived records on virtually every domestic telephone call over the last six years for potential use in terrorism or espionage investigations.

“It’s the scale of this really concerns me and the fact that the American public doesn’t know about it,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “The fact that every call I make to my friends, to my family, is noted, where I am, the length of it, the date, that concerns me.”

Udall also said he was not convinced that the operation had led to the detection or disruption of any terrorism plots. “It hasn’t been proven that it works,” he said.

Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas), who chairs the House homeland security committee, complained of what he called the “warehousing of all the phone records from all the major carriers” by the federal government. “That’s something I think we’ll look at in Congress,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), told “Fox News Sunday” that secretly collecting data on every telephone call “sounds like an extraordinary invasion of privacy.” He said he would ask Internet providers and telephone companies to ask their customers to join him in a class-action lawsuit to challenge the legality of the surveillance.

But Michael Hayden, the retired Air Force general who formerly led the CIA and the National Security Agency, defended the programs and said the idea of “trolling through millions of records” was “simply not true.”

He said the database of telephone records can only be accessed with a court order and only in terrorism investigations.

“So you roll up something in Waziristan,” Hayden said. “You get a cellphone number. It’s the first time you’ve ever had that cellphone number. … Here’s how it works: You simply ask that database, ‘Hey, any of your phone numbers in there ever talked to this phone number in Waziristan?’ ”

(CNN) —

Beleaguered New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner got into a war of words Wednesday with a man who lashed out at him for being “married to an Arab,” in addition to chastising the former congressman about his well-documented sexting scandal.

The incident began inside a bakery in Brooklyn’s Borough Park neighborhood, where the man yelled out to Weiner, who had just bought cookies and an iced coffee, “You’re a real scumbag.”

Weiner offered a quick retort, then said to no one in particular, “Very nice, that’s a charming guy right there.” It’s then that the man, later identified as Saul Kessler, responded: “Married to an Arab.”

The comment is an apparent reference to Weiner’s wife, Huma Abedin, who works for Hillary Clinton. Abedin’s late father was an Islamic scholar from India and her mother, a sociologist, is from Pakistan. Weiner is Jewish, as were most of those inside the Brooklyn bakery.

The Democratic candidate responded with, “Very nice, in front of children… That is charming.” Kessler didn’t stop talking, even as Weiner was leaving the bakery, saying, “You are disgusting, disgusting.”

“It takes one to know one, jackass,” Weiner replied.

The two then went face-to-face, with Kessler accusing Weiner – who resigned in disgrace after 12 years in Congress representing part of New York City after admitting to sending sexually suggestive images and carrying on inappropriate relationships with women over the Internet – of doing “disgusting things, and you have the nerve to even walk around in public.”

A visibly agitated Weiner responded,”And you’re a perfect person? You’re my judge? What rabbi taught you that?”

At one point, Kessler implored Weiner to “think about your wife, how could you take the person you’re most closest to … and betray her?”

The mayoral hopeful then accused Kessler of acting like he is superior, even though he doesn’t “have the moral authority to judge me.”

Weiner: Hate media? Love me

The back-and-forth went on for about a minute longer before Weiner left the bakery. He seemed to quickly brush off the confrontation, saying, “He has every right to (challenge me). It’s America.”

The Weiner campaign released a video of Wednesday’s exchange, a version of which also was captured by blogger Jacob Kornbluh. Talking with reporters later in the day, Weiner described what happened as “just some enthusiastic exchange with a voter.”

“Look, you’re allowed to say stuff to me,” said Weiner, who, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday, trails three other Democratic candidates ahead of next week’s primary. “But if you’re going to say vile things about me and my family, you should expect that I’m going to go back at you.

“Hecklers don’t get a chance to necessarily get the last word if they cross the line.”

Reached by CNN later in the day, Kessler admitted calling out Weiner for being “married to an Arab.”

“It’s just a certain feeling I have as a Jew,” said the 51-year-old real estate manager, explaining his remark. “And my attitude is that – not all Arabs – but, in general, … they want to kill every Jew.”

Kessler said of a Jewish person marrying into such a family: “It’s like a betrayal.”

Kessler also said Weiner has bothered him for some time. Kessler called him a “phony.” But Kessler said he should have acted differently.

“(Given that I felt) a little bit of anger, I probably shouldn’t have said it,” Kessler said about the Arab comment. “I shouldn’t have called him a scumbag.”

“But it was in the heat of the moment.”

Is Huma Abedin blaming herself?"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/26/OFA-Sells-Access-to-President-Obama-for-Anyone-Who-Donates-500k,2013-02-26 00:00:00,['Michael Patrick Leahy'],OFA Sells Access to President Obama for Anyone Who Donates $500k,"On Saturday, the New York Times reported that Organizing for Action–the Obama for America presidential campaign structure recently re-organized as a 501 c 4 tax-exempt “issues advocacy” non-profit–is offering access to President Obama to any donors (individuals or corporations) who contribute $500,000 to the group. According to the Times, such contributions place “donors on a national advisory board for Mr. Obama’s group and [gives them] the privilege of attending quarterly meetings with the president, along with other meetings at the White House.”

The Obama team’s brazen attempt to convert the assets of its political campaign into assets to promote the President’s political agenda and the electoral fortunes of his Democratic allies is unprecedented in American political history. It is clearly a violation of the intent of current federal election laws.

The Obama team is betting that they’ve cleverly discovered a loophole, one that Republicans will fail to challenge legally. Even if the legality of this unprecedented and highly political attempt to circumvent the intent of federal election law is challenged, Obama’s team is further betting that their attorneys will argue their case successfully before regulators and judges. To date, the Obama tactic has caught Republicans flat footed.

Not only is the conversion of questionable legality, it also is in absolute contradiction to everything President Obama has ever said about the negative influence of large financial donations on the political process in America. In 2010, for instance, when the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision paved the way for SuperPACs that could accept unlimited donations from individuals and corporations alike, President Obama was one of the Court’s harshest critics. But the President’s opinion on the evils of unlimited donations to political organizations–especially those that pretend to be “issues advocacy” groups–appears to have changed in the three years since that decision.

The expensive and valuable assets of Obama for America were quickly made available to Organizing for Action, which has already begun to use them extensively in Obama’s “permanent campaign,” hosting State of the Union listening parties and bombarding the internet with pro gun control emails. It is unclear if the new Organizing for Action entity has paid fair market value–or anything at all, for that matter–to the old Obama for America organization for these assets.

The assets include a sophisticated state-of-the-art analytics driven data base that holds extensive information on each of 2 million Obama for America volunteers, 17 million email subscribers, 22 million Twitter followers, and virtually every registered voter in the country. These assets will deployed by the same management team that ran Obama for America, headed up by former campaign manager Jim Messina. At Organizing for Action, Messina will use the technological infrastructure developed over several years at Obama for America to instantaneously deliver communications in multiple formats (email, text, facebook, tweets) using the same methodology to the same vast audience that received those very similar messages during President Obama’s presidential campaigns.

“Issues advocacy” social welfare non-profit groups organized under Section 501 c 4 of the Internal Revenue Service code, which Organizing for Action claims to be, are not subject to the same federal election laws that prohibit corporate donations and limit individual contributions to political candidates to $2,600 per election. In its new iteration, the organization that was until January 17, 2013 known as Obama for America and was governed by these strict campaign laws can now accept unlimited donations from both corporations and individuals. Better yet, it is not required to publicly disclose the names of these donors.

All this is happening while the Organizing for Action management team–and the Obama administration–are pretending and saying out loud with a straight face that it is not a political organization. In reality, it is nothing but a political organization, and its immediate purpose is to advance the President’s second term agenda and defeat Republican House and Senate candidates in 2014. With that accomplished, and Democrats in control of both the House and Senate there will be nothing to stop President Obama and his radical left wing agenda.

Even MSNBC’s Chuck Todd found the cash for access scheme unpalatable. “This just looks bad,” Todd said on Monday. “It looks,” Todd said “like the White House is selling access.It’s the definition of selling access. If you believe money has a strangle hold over the entire political system this is ceding the moral high ground.”

Todd is right. It looks bad because it is bad.

Bob Edgar, the president of the usually liberal advocacy group, Common Cause, agrees with Todd. “It just smells. The president is setting a very bad model setting up this organization,”he said.

White House press secretary Jay Carney tried to sell the administration line that Organizing for Action is just like any other 501 c 4, and this sort of thing is done all the time to the usually compliant White House press corps on Monday, but most of them could barely withhold their incredulity at Carney’s claims. Indeed, Carney became so frustrated at their skepticism that he abruptly curtailed the normal press briefing and walked off unceremoniously as unanswered questioned were left hanging in the air."

Lois Lerner, director of tax exempt organizations for the IRS, said 75 applications were singled out between 2010 and 2012 for extended review because the words ""tea party"" and ""patriot"" were included in the groups' names. Those applications were part of approximately 300 which received additional scrutiny during that time.

Draft ""talking points"" obtained by The Weekly Standard and ABC News depicted efforts by State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in the days after the attack to strip out references to prior attacks in Benghazi. According to the excerpts, she argued that the administration should not give Congress ammunition to ""beat up"" on her department.

During a press conference Monday, President Obama even acknowledged that the country now knows that ""clearly (the staff in Benghazi) were not in a position where they were adequately protected.""

A review of now-public State Department records as well as a classified State Department cable, first reviewed and reported by Fox News, shows a steady stream of documented warnings to Washington from intelligence and State security officials on the ground in Libya that the Islamist threat was severe and growing.

One of the most significant warnings was an August 2012 State Department classified cable, which has not been made public, that summarized an emergency meeting in Benghazi where the CIA briefed on the significant threat of terrorist activity.

More On This...

The cable, sent under Ambassador Chris Stevens' signature and marked SECRET, warned the office of Secretary of State Clinton that the CIA advised ""ten Islamist militias and AQ training camps (were) within Benghazi.""

The cable also warned that the 17 February Brigade, the group charged with protecting the consulate, appeared to be compromised. It said ""requests to provide a daily police presence have gone unanswered,"" adding there was also a ""lack of host nation security support to the US mission.""

In addition to identifying the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi, the groups ultimately blamed for the assault, a key section of the cable, which remains classified, seemed to foreshadow the attack itself.

""RSO (Regional Security Officer) expressed concerns with the ability to defend Post in the event of a coordinated attack due to limited manpower, security measures, weapons capabilities, host nation support, and the overall size of the compound,"" it said.

During congressional hearings in January, Clinton was asked whether she had seen the cable by Republican Rep. Michael McCaul. Clinton said she had no knowledge of the warning which former diplomatic security agents have told Fox News amounted to a ""cry for help.""

""Congressman, that cable did not come to my attention,"" Clinton testified before the House Foreign Affairs committee. ""I have made it very clear that the security cable did not come to my attention or above the assistant secretary level where the ARB (Accountability Review Board) placed responsibility where, as I think, Ambassador Pickering said the rubber hit the road.""

In February, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham followed up on the classified cable.

After the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed he knew about the cable which summarized the August emergency meeting in Benghazi, Graham questioned why the military was read in when Clinton apparently was not.

Gen. Martin Dempsey responded: ""Well, I don't know that she didn't know about the cable.""

Graham said: ""She said she didn't. Are you stunned that she didn't?""

Dempsey said: ""I would call myself surprised that she didn't.""

In addition to attacks in Benghazi on the British ambassador -- which forced the temporary closure of the U.K. operation -- the International Red Cross and United Nations, in the summer of 2012 the group Ansar al-Sharia was so well-established it held an annual conference in Benghazi to promote Islamic law.

Records released by the House oversight committee, including a report from the regional security officer, also documented more than 200 cases of violence in Libya in the year leading up to the attack, specifically between June 2011 and July 2012. Another security review, on June 25, 2012, reported a spike in violence with ""foreigners also increasingly targeted.""

While much has been made of the State Department's failure to respond to repeated security requests for extra help, a former diplomatic security agent and 20-year veteran of the department, who reviewed the publicly available documents on the condition of anonymity, told Fox News the multiple warnings present a compelling argument that State Department leadership was negligent.

The State Department, in a document put out last week, noted that while an internal review found certain senior officials ""demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability"" in response to security concerns, there was no specific finding of misconduct."

http://news.yahoo.com/petraeus-email-objected-benghazi-talking-points-220924269.html,,[],Petraeus email objected to Benghazi talking points,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Then CIA-Director David Petraeus objected to the final talking points the Obama administration used after the deadly assault on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, because he wanted to see more details revealed to the public, according to emails released Wednesday by the White House.

Under pressure in the investigation that continues eight months after the attacks, the White House on Wednesday released 99 pages of emails and a single page of hand-written notes made by Petraeus' deputy, Mike Morell, after a meeting at the White House on Saturday, Sept. 15. On that page, Morell scratched out from the CIA's early drafts of talking points mentions of al-Qaida, the experience of fighters in Libya, Islamic extremists and a warning to the Cairo embassy on the eve of the attacks of calls for a demonstration and break-in by jihadists.

Petraeus apparently was displeased by the removal of so much of the material his analysts initially had proposed for release. The talking points were sent to U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to prepare her for an appearance on news shows on Sunday, Sept. 16, and also to members of the House Intelligence Committee.

""No mention of the cable to Cairo, either?"" Petraeus wrote after receiving Morell's edited version, developed after an intense back-and-forth among Obama administration officials. ""Frankly, I'd just as soon not use this, then.""

Petreaus' email comes at the end of extensive back-and-forth between officials at the CIA, White House, State Department and other agencies weighing in on a public explanation for the Sept. 11, 2012, attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans

The emails were partially blacked out, including removal of names of senders and recipients who are career employees at the CIA and elsewhere.

The emails show only minor edits were requested by the White House, and most of the objections came from the State Department. ""The White House cleared quickly, but State has major concerns,"" read an email that a CIA official sent to Petraeus on Friday, Sept. 14.

Story continues

Critics have highlighted an email by then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland that expressed concern that any mention of prior warnings or the involvement of al-Qaida would give congressional Republicans ammunition to attack the administration in the weeks before the presidential election. Fighting terror was one of President Barack Obama's re-election strong points

That email was among those released by the White House, sent by Nuland on Sept. 14 at 7:39 p.m. to officials in the White House, State Department and CIA. She wrote she was concerned they could prejudice the investigation and be ""abused by members to beat the State Department for not paying attention to agency warnings so why do we want to feed that either? Concerned.""

After Nuland sent several more emails throughout that Friday evening expressing further concerns, Jake Sullivan, then-deputy chief of staff at the State Department, said the issues would be worked out at a meeting at the White House on Saturday morning.

A senior U.S. intelligence official told reporters Wednesday that Morell made the changes to the talking points after that meeting because of his own concerns that they could prejudge an FBI investigation into who was responsible for the attacks.

The official said Morell also didn't think it was fair to disclose the CIA's advance warning without giving the State Department a chance to explain how it responded. The official spoke on a condition of anonymity without authorization to speak about the emails on the record. Petraeus declined to be interviewed Wednesday.

The intelligence official said Morell was aware of Nuland's objections but did not make the changes under pressure from the State Department but because he independently shared the concerns.

That is contradicted in an email sent to Rice on Saturday, Sept. 15, at 1:23 p.m. by a member of her staff whose name was blacked out. The email said Morell indicated he would work with Sullivan and Ben Rhodes, the White House deputy national security adviser, to revise the talking points. The intelligence official disputed that assertion and insisted Morell acted alone.

An email from Morell also says he spoke to Petraeus ""about State's deep concerns about mentioning the warnings and the other work done on this.""

The emails were shared with Congress earlier this year as a condition for allowing the nomination of John Brennan for CIA director to move forward. An interim report last month from the Republicans on five House committees criticized the Obama administration and mentioned the emails, but the issue exploded last Friday when new details emerged.

Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee read some of the emails aloud last Wednesday at a hearing with State Department officials. The next day, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, called on the White House to release the emails.

A Boehner spokesman said Wednesday the emails released by the White House only confirm the interim report.

""They contradict statements made by the White House that it and the State Department only changed one word in the talking points,"" Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said in a statement. ""The seemingly political nature of the State Department's concerns raises questions about the motivations behind these changes and who at the State Department was seeking them.""

The White House released the full set of emails sent to Congress under the pressure in hopes of putting an end to the controversy that has dogged the administration for months. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Wednesday that ""these e-mails have been selectively and inaccurately read out to the media.""

""To make clear what is and is not in these e-mails, today the White House took the extraordinary step of releasing these e-mails,"" Schultz said in a statement. ""You can now see what the Congress has seen — collectively these e-mails make clear that the interagency process, including the White House's interactions, were focused on providing the facts as we knew them based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation.""

An official with the CIA's office of congressional affairs whose name was blacked out sent the final version to Petraeus on Saturday, Sept. 15, at 12:51 p.m. Petraeus responded at 2:27 saying he'd prefer not to even use them in that form.

But he said the decision was up to the White House's national security staff.

""NSS's call, to be sure; however, this is certainly not what Vice Chairman (Dutch) Ruppersberger was hoping to get for unclas use. Regardless, thanks for the great work.""

Ruppersberger is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

At a Capitol Hill hearing Wednesday, Attorney General Eric Holder said there has been ""very, very substantial progress"" in the investigation into who was responsible for the twin nighttime attacks in Benghazi. Earlier this month, the FBI said it was seeking information on three people who were on the grounds of the diplomatic mission when it was attacked. The FBI posted photographs of the three people and said they may be able to provide information to help in the investigation.

Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who sits on the Intelligence Committee, said, ""I didn't find anything that looked like a smoking gun in terms of political cooking of the talking points. There is very little input from the White House.""

But he added, ""There are some things to criticize in here. The State Department looks like it is trying to avoid blame.""

(CNN) —

Beleaguered New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner got into a war of words Wednesday with a man who lashed out at him for being “married to an Arab,” in addition to chastising the former congressman about his well-documented sexting scandal.

The incident began inside a bakery in Brooklyn’s Borough Park neighborhood, where the man yelled out to Weiner, who had just bought cookies and an iced coffee, “You’re a real scumbag.”

Weiner offered a quick retort, then said to no one in particular, “Very nice, that’s a charming guy right there.” It’s then that the man, later identified as Saul Kessler, responded: “Married to an Arab.”

The comment is an apparent reference to Weiner’s wife, Huma Abedin, who works for Hillary Clinton. Abedin’s late father was an Islamic scholar from India and her mother, a sociologist, is from Pakistan. Weiner is Jewish, as were most of those inside the Brooklyn bakery.

Huma Abedin emerges, stands by her husband

The Democratic candidate responded with, “Very nice, in front of children… That is charming.” Kessler didn’t stop talking, even as Weiner was leaving the bakery, saying, “You are disgusting, disgusting.”

“It takes one to know one, jackass,” Weiner replied.

The two then went face-to-face, with Kessler accusing Weiner – who resigned in disgrace after 12 years in Congress representing part of New York City after admitting to sending sexually suggestive images and carrying on inappropriate relationships with women over the Internet – of doing “disgusting things, and you have the nerve to even walk around in public.”

A visibly agitated Weiner responded,”And you’re a perfect person? You’re my judge? What rabbi taught you that?”

At one point, Kessler implored Weiner to “think about your wife, how could you take the person you’re most closest to … and betray her?”

The mayoral hopeful then accused Kessler of acting like he is superior, even though he doesn’t “have the moral authority to judge me.”

Weiner: Hate media? Love me

The back-and-forth went on for about a minute longer before Weiner left the bakery. He seemed to quickly brush off the confrontation, saying, “He has every right to (challenge me). It’s America.”

The Weiner campaign released a video of Wednesday’s exchange, a version of which also was captured by blogger Jacob Kornbluh. Talking with reporters later in the day, Weiner described what happened as “just some enthusiastic exchange with a voter.”

“Look, you’re allowed to say stuff to me,” said Weiner, who, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday, trails three other Democratic candidates ahead of next week’s primary. “But if you’re going to say vile things about me and my family, you should expect that I’m going to go back at you.

“Hecklers don’t get a chance to necessarily get the last word if they cross the line.”

Reached by CNN later in the day, Kessler admitted calling out Weiner for being “married to an Arab.”

“It’s just a certain feeling I have as a Jew,” said the 51-year-old real estate manager, explaining his remark. “And my attitude is that – not all Arabs – but, in general, … they want to kill every Jew.”

Kessler said of a Jewish person marrying into such a family: “It’s like a betrayal.”

Kessler also said Weiner has bothered him for some time. Kessler called him a “phony.” But Kessler said he should have acted differently.

“(Given that I felt) a little bit of anger, I probably shouldn’t have said it,” Kessler said about the Arab comment. “I shouldn’t have called him a scumbag.”

“But it was in the heat of the moment.”

Is Huma Abedin blaming herself?"

Follow Her On Twitter']","Samuel L. Jackson disses Obama's pronunciation: ""Be f**king Presidential ... stop trying to 'relate'""","Samuel L. Jackson has some words of wisdom for President Obama when it comes to his deliberate dropping of “g’s” off the ends of words to seemingly sound like Joe Average.

“First of all, we know it ain’t because of his blackness, so I say stop trying to ‘relate.’ Be a leader. Be f**king presidential,” Jackson told Playboy magazine. “Look, I grew up in a society where I could say ‘It ain’t’ or ‘What it be’ to my friends. But when I’m out presenting myself to the world as me, who graduated from college, who had family what cared about me, who has a well-read background, I f**king conjugate.”

The 64-year-old actor, who stars this fall in the highly-anticipated remake of “Oldboy,” is also known in social media circles as the “grammar police.”

“On Twitter someone will write, ‘Your an idiot,’ and I’ll go, ‘No, you’re an idiot,’ and all my Twitterphiles will go, ‘Hey, Sam Jackson, he’s the grammar police.’ I’ll take that,” he continued. “Somebody needs to be. I mean, we have newscasters who don’t even know how to conjugate verbs, something Walter Cronkite and Edward R. Murrow never had problems with. How the f**k did we become a society where mediocrity is acceptable.”

Raised in Tennessee, Jackson went on to note that he’s finally proud to acknowledge his Southern roots, and how his strict family upbringing put him in good stead.

“Looking back, I love the South so much, even though there was a time when I didn’t feel so proud of being from there. The sense of community there is unheard of in this day and age. The idea that it takes a village to raise a child—it works,” he said. “The one thing my family insisted on was, don’t embarrass us. Don’t make us come to jail, because though we will come to see you, we’re going to leave you there. It just wasn’t an option for me. I was more afraid of the people I lived with than the people I ran with.”

The famed actor also staunchly defended director Quentin Tarantino’s controversial use of the “N” word in last year’s hit “Django Unchained.”

“These 20-somethings can’t turn around and tell me the word n**ger is f**ked-up in ‘Django’ yet still listen to Jay Z or whoever else say ‘n**ger, n**ger, n**ger’ throughout the music they listen to,” he told the men’s magazine. “You can’t have it one way and not the other. Saying Tarantino said ‘n**ger’ too many times is like complaining they said ‘kike’ too many times in a movie about Nazis.”

However, there are a couple of things he says won’t do onscreen – not even for his buddy Tarantino. Maybe.

“Probably dress up as a woman and kiss another guy. I don’t think people want to see me do that,” Jackson added. “He hasn’t asked me, but you know what? If it’s done right and the story is good, I might.”"

Obama tells veterans he is working to reduce backlog of VA claims

The backlog is down%2C but not as much as he would like%2C Obama says

President spoke to a convention of disabled veterans

Calling it his ""mission"" to help veterans ""recover from the wounds of war,"" President Obama said Saturday his team is working to reduce the backlog of compensation claims at the Department of Veterans Affairs.

""I'm going to be honest with you, it has not moved as fast as I wanted,"" Obama told a convention of disabled veterans in Orlando. ""We are not where we need to be, but we are making progress.""

The president also outlined plans to spend more than $100 million on new research into mental health challenges, including post-traumatic stress disorder and what he called ""this epidemic of suicide among our veterans and troops.""

Obama also said he is enlisting colleges to help train veterans for ""the high-skilled jobs of tomorrow.""

Speaking to some 3,400 people at the Disabled American Veterans' convention, Obama praised the ""9/11 generation"" of warriors who have fought wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and again pledged to help them transition back to civilian life.

One major complaint from veterans has been the backlog of claims for compensation from the VA.

As the president noted in his speech, the number of claims has increased in recent years, in part because the Obama administration offered benefits to veterans suffering from PTSD as well as Vietnam veterans who were exposed to the jungle defoliant Agent Orange.

According to the White House, the VA backlog — which includes claims that have been in the system for 125 days or more — has decreased from 611,000 to about 496,000 in recent months, a 20% reduction.

""After years of military service,"" Obama said, ""you shouldn't have to wait for years for the benefits you've earned.""

The quality of care at VA hospitals has also been criticized.

Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, listed the VA's shortcomings in an op-ed for the Orlando Sentinel, writing that ""in addition to the department's massive disability-benefits backlog, a disturbing pattern of preventable veteran deaths and other patient-safety issues has emerged at VA hospitals around the country.""

Miller added: ""Sadly, the department's widespread and systemic lack of accountability may be encouraging more veteran suffering instead of preventing it.""

Derek Bennett, chief of staff for the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said the organization supports Obama's efforts to reduce the VA backlog, which ""poses a financial and emotional roadblock to transitioning from military to civilian life.""

Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., said some veterans in Illinois have to wait more than 500 days to have disability claims processed. ""While I am pleased the president recognizes the seriousness of this issue,"" Kirk said, ""the time to act is long overdue.""

During his speech, Obama listed a series of ""priorities"" for veterans, including sufficient funding, improving the health care system, addressing homelessness among former troops and providing job training for returning service members.

With U.S. involvement in Iraq over and the war in Afghanistan coming to an end, Obama said ""the job of caring for our veterans goes on, and our work caring for our newest veterans has only just begun.""

After the speech, the president and first lady Michelle Obama flew to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., to begin a week-long vacation."

USA TODAY

Tea Party-groups requesting tax exempt status were filtered out for additional scrutiny

A Cincinnati-based IRS office is responsible for such applications nationwide

The IRS says applications were delayed%2C but none was denied

WASHINGTON — Washington's latest political scandal involves a little-known unit of the Internal Revenue Service that determines which groups don't have to pay taxes. Staff in that unit had singled out conservative political groups for greater scrutiny of their applications for tax-exempt status, an IRS official said last week. President Obama said Monday the IRS must not be ""anything less than neutral in terms of how they operate ... I have no patience for it. I will not tolerate it.""

The IRS inspector general is likely to report this week on what the agency was doing, but here is what we know:

Q: What exactly has the IRS apologized for?

A: The IRS says it subjected Tea Party-affiliated groups to additional scrutiny based solely on the name and stated goals of the organization. Often, those groups were asked invasive questions about their donor lists, affiliations and contacts with the media — questions not routinely asked of other groups.

Q: What prompted this?

A: The number of applications for tax-exempt social welfare organizations doubled from 2010 to 2012, to 3,400 a year. That's largely because of a surge in politically oriented groups before the 2012 presidential election and in the wake of favorable court rulings, the IRS says. In response, an IRS unit in Cincinnati began to sort politically oriented groups into a separate ""bucket"" of applications. IRS Exempt Organizations Director Lois Lerner said this was done for consistency and is not unlike what the IRS has done with special treatment of other groups that raise new tax law issues, such as credit counseling agencies and non-profit news organizations.

Q: What is the normal process for seeking tax-exempt status?

A: The organization files an application and answers a 36-item questionnaire on its structure, purpose and activities. Based on those answers, the IRS may seek additional information. An organization can skip the recognition step and simply file a tax return.

Q: Is this like an audit?

A: No. The Tea Party groups were seeking tax-exempt status even before filing a tax return. Tax-exempt groups accused of violating tax laws by directly engaging in political campaigns can have their status revoked — but that's a separate process conducted by a different IRS unit in Dallas.

Q: How many Tea Party groups were affected?

A: Lerner said about 300 groups went into a ""bucket"" of applications getting more scrutiny. About a quarter of them were groups that had ""Tea Party"" or ""Patriot"" in their names, she said. The others may have drawn scrutiny based on broader criteria that pulled out groups whose issues involved government spending or debt, or whose goals were critical of the government, according to a timeline provided to members of Congress.

Q: This happened at the IRS office in Cincinnati. Were groups in other parts of the country affected?

A: Yes. The Cincinnati office handles the intake of tax-exempt applications for all organizations in the country.

Q: When did the targeting of Tea Party groups begin? When did it end?

A: According to a timeline compiled by independent IRS investigators, the IRS first began searching for Tea Party-related groups in March 2010. The policy underwent several revisions through 2011 and 2012 and now involves only organizations with ""indicators of significant amounts of political campaign intervention.""

Q: How were the Tea Party groups harmed?

A: The additional scrutiny held up tax-exempt applications for months, although the IRS says no applications have been denied. Groups caught in this process did not receive IRS documentation, which can provide legitimacy and assist with fundraising. Some conservative groups say their rights to freedom of association were violated through invasive questioning.

Q: How has the IRS attempted to fix the problem?

A: The IRS says it has destroyed any donor lists that were improperly obtained. It says it has begun to clear out the backlog of tax-exempt applications, approving about 130 of the initial 300. About 25 groups have withdrawn their applications.

Q: Who at the IRS was involved?

A: Lerner said Friday it was ""low-level"" and ""front-line"" employees who made the initial determination. The timeline shows that Lerner herself was briefed in 2011 and that lawyers and managers from several units were involved. It's unclear when IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman — appointed by President George W. Bush to a five-year term in 2008 — first learned of the practice. Shulman stepped down in November. The acting commissioner is Steven Miller. Lerner said she never discussed the issue with the Department of the Treasury or the White House. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the White House counsel first learned of the investigation last month, and the president learned Friday.

Q: What happens next?

A: The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration says it will release its report on the matter this week. The chairmen of the tax-writing committees in the House and Senate have promised hearings, the first of which will be before the House Ways and Means Committee on Friday.

Audits Cites Ineffective Management,"“The F.B.I. is coordinating with the Justice Department to see if any laws were broken in connection with those matters related to the I.R.S.,” Mr. Holder told reporters. “Those were, I think, as everyone can agree, if not criminal, they were certainly outrageous and unacceptable, but we are examining the facts to see if there were criminal violations.”

But a matter portrayed by the I.R.S. on Friday as a little-known operation conducted in Cincinnati, largely out of the sight of Washington officials, continued to sprawl. The report by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration offered new details on the scope and duration of the I.R.S. targeting effort.

Mismanagement at the agency allowed “inappropriate criteria” for the singling out of conservative groups to be developed and stay in place for more than 18 months, starting in 2010, the report said. That resulted in “substantial delays” for groups applying for tax-exempt status, either as 501(c)(4) or 501(c)(3) organizations, and it allowed unnecessary and intrusive information like donor lists to be gathered. I.R.S. officials told the inspector general that all donor information received was later destroyed.

Of the 296 applications the inspector general reviewed, 108 were approved, 28 were withdrawn by the applicants and 160 were still open, some pending for up to 1,138 days.

In a statement Tuesday night, the I.R.S. acknowledged that “inappropriate shortcuts were used to determine which cases may be engaging in political activities.” But it said the agency had a responsibility to make sure that such organizations did not engage in impermissible political actions, and that not just conservative groups were singled out. It also said that “there was no intent to hide this issue,” but that the agency had been awaiting the inspector general’s report.

The report said that senior I.R.S. officials told inspectors that no individual or organization outside the agency influenced the criteria used to single out Tea Party or other conservative groups.

But Congressional aides looking into the matter are not convinced. One notation in a 12-page timeline of events prepared by the inspector general stood out for exploration. On Aug. 4, 2011, officials at the I.R.S.’s rulings and agreement office met with the I.R.S.’s chief counsel “so that everyone would have the latest information on the issue,” according to the inspector general."

Then something else happened. The people who had provided Chavez with his electoral mandate began to come from the hills and the barrios converging on the center in their hundreds of thousands, eventually compelling the release of Chavez, and forcing his reinstatement.

Every time some lone Republican nut from Hooterville makes a jackass statement about rape or evolution, it’s immediately ascribed as a doctrinal belief of the entire GOP and conservatives in general. But liberal resistance to science is far more organized, far more destructive and far less covered in the media.

In addition to the obvious victims, there are many more hidden ones, including the contract workers involved in the dirty clean up work at Dai-ichi and the surrounding area. There have been multiple scandals related to them not receiving all the pay they are entitled to, not being trained properly or being given all the safety equipment, and many reported cases of yakuza involvement. The Dai-ichi disaster has exposed the extent to which the nuclear industry in Japan was built upon exploiting vulnerable individuals and communities. The Fukushima region continues to suffer greatly from the stigma and fear attached to the nuclear accident. Previously one of Japan's bread-baskets, its agriculture and fishing industries have suffered considerably, as has tourism. Fear of radiation has become more damaging than radiation itself. Some farmers have committed suicide following the loss of their livelihoods, and families have been broken up with mothers taking children away from the region due to radiation fears. The Japanese people have also lost faith and trust in their politicians and bureaucrats, due to the way the crisis was handled, including the manner in which information was withheld and the public mislead. Even the fact that a meltdown occurred at Fukushima was denied for months.

Israel, I fear, is on a suicidal path: It could cease to be the democratic home of the Jewish people. This is why I greatly appreciate President Obama's decision to come to Israel despite all the serious issues he faces in America. His visit could mark the beginning of a new era in the struggle to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Because it is crucial to make the most of it, I am taking the liberty of offering four suggestions to the president as he prepares for his trip.

The downsides of extracting hydrocarbons by high-powered fracturing of petroleum-rich shale rock are well known. But fracking could not function without a lesser-known tandem industry: mining crystalline silica sand, large deposits of which lie just below the surface in areas of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Increasingly, vast, open-pit frac-sand mines blight the landscape like earth’s own acne."

Women’s attire is colorful and tailored and has all kinds of bells and whistles on it that make for much more colorful commentary. Even efforts to evade this natural discrepancy by wearing the blandest thing possible don’t always get you out of the weeds. Hillary’s pantsuits became a discussion all their own. (“I thought this was what you wore to indicate you didn’t want people to discuss what you wore,” the staid ensembles grumbled.) But that doesn’t make it right.

President Obama asked Holder last week to investigate the matter involving Fox reporter James Rosen, who in 2009 was reporting on North Korea’s efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon.



Holder “signed off on the affidavit,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told “Fox News Sunday.” “This would be a good time for a special counsel or independent counsel. ... This is clearly an overreach.”



The Justice Department search warrant stated investigators had probable cause to think Rosen had violated the federal Espionage Act and that he might have aided or abetted others or was a co-conspirator.



“James Rosen is a lot of things, but not a criminal co-conspirator,” Graham said.



The disparity about whether the Justice Department contacted Fox News about the investigation became more clear this weekend when an official for Fox News said parent company News Corp. was notified by letter in 2010 about an investigation. But Fox News was not directly notified, and the letter was never passed down to the network. Email was not included in that notification.

""While we don't take issue with the DOJ's account that they sent a notice to News Corp, we do not have a record of ever having received it,"" said a News Corp. spokesperson. ""We are looking into this matter.""

Holder has already recused himself from an investigation into the Justice Department looking into the phone records of the Associated Press, related to a May 2012 story that included information about a foiled plot in Yemen to bomb a U.S.-bound airliner.



That Holder approved the Justice Department searches appears to contradict earlier statements before Congress in which he said accessing reporters’ phone logs was “not something I’ve ever been involved in, nor would I think is a wise policy.”



Graham also called for a special counsel to investigate the IRS flagging Tea Party groups and other politically conservative-leaning organizations seeking tax-exempt status.

Later on the show, Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin disagreed with Graham, following most congressional Democrats and Republicans who want more time for their own investigations and point out a special prosecutor would be appointed by the Justice Department.

""I heard Senator Graham call for special counsel,” said Durbin, the Senate assistant majority leader. “I'm not ready to do this at this point. I'd like to know if Holder has any conflict in here beyond what we've heard when it comes to the Fox case.”

Last week, Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal was among those who argued against having a special prosecutor.

""The history of Congress with special prosecutors has not worked very well,"" he said. ""The history of it with Congress is that it went well beyond what was fully intended. The investigations really became endless and boundless, and that's the imminent danger here."""

In an Oct. 28 letter to Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.,the State Department’s Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs, Julia Frifield, refers to ""significant risks"" and ""serious concerns about having the survivors of the attack submit to additional interviews.""

Graham has been asking since last year for the FBI’s transcripts of interviews with State Department and CIA survivors who were evacuated to Germany after the Sep.11 attack on the U.S. consulate.

He and other Republicans believe the transcripts will show the survivors told the FBI it was a terrorist attack and made no mention of a video or anti-U.S. demonstration at the consulate.

This intelligence was likely available to the president, his national security team and U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, who five days after the assault blamed it on an anti-U.S. demonstration and inflammatory video.

""You can't hide behind a criminal investigation,"" Graham told reporters during a news conference on Capitol Hill. ""That's not a good reason to deny the Congress witness statements 48 hours after the attack.""

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and its Republican Chairman, Darell Issa, recently interviewed – against the Justice Department’s wishes -- two State Department security agents who have firsthand knowledge of the attack, leading one Democratic lawmaker to predict the move would create inconsistencies and complicate a trial.

""As a prosecutor, you never want your witnesses to be interviewed by multiple sources. It just lends itself to the possibility of unintentional conflicts within their statements,"" Rep.Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told Fox News.

""It concerns me that that was not a higher priority for the chairman, to make sure that we could bring these people to justice, than to carry on this political exercise.""

But waiting for a criminal prosecution and appeal to be wrapped up, according to Republicans, doesn't pass the sniff test.

""So we are going to wait three years when we had a terrorist attack, which is very different than your average criminal case that Senator Graham talked about, to get the truth and think about what we know to prevent future terrorist attacks?"" asked Sen.Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.

As Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., renewed his call for a select committee, lawmakers also cited the reporting of Fox News, followed by CBS’ “60 Minutes,” that the main Benghazi suspects have strong ties to Al Qaeda senior leadership.

At the same time, another Republican turned the tables on the media and its apparent lack of curiosity about Ambassador Chris Stevens' final days.

""Does it bother you whether or not you know why Chris Stevens was in Benghazi?"" asked Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. ""Do you know why we were the last flag flying in Benghazi after the British had left and the Red Cross had been bombed? Do you know why requests for additional security were denied?""

Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Tex.,chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security and a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry with 84 congressional signatures asking why his department was not offering a reward for tips leading to the Benghazi suspects.

The “Rewards for Justice” program, described on the State Department’s own website as a valuable tool in counter-terrorism cases, offers millions of dollars for information about suspects who are not accused of murdering Americans.

Yet there is no reward for information leading to those who murdered Stevens, Foreign Service officer Sean Smith, and former Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.

Kerry's staff refuses to discuss it. ""I don't have anything new for you on the Al Qaeda suspects from Benghazi,"" State Department spokesman Jen Psaki told Fox News. ."

Today the Senate was successful in stripping this provision out of the CR.

According to Sen Brian Schatz (D-HI)



""The Monsanto Protection Act is bad policy for the country and the State of Hawai‘i. The Senate version of the Continuing Resolution does not include this provision, effectively repealing the Monsanto Protection Act. This provision took the ability of the Secretary of Agriculture to fully exercise his regulatory power over GMOs, and compromised the role of our courts as a check on the legislative and executive systems, making it significantly more difficult for concerned citizens to present their case. I strongly urge the House not to sneak the Monsanto Protection Act back into the final version of the appropriations bill. However, if it is slipped back in, rather than letting the issue be deliberated with full transparency and public input, I will immediately introduce legislation to repeal it.""

Stripping the Monsanto Protection Act is a victory for American consumers and family farm agriculture. Corporate giveaways have no business in a bill to fund the government, and I’m pleased that the Senate stood up for accountability and transparency and against special interests. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Schatz to make sure that this damaging provision never again makes it into law.""

Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), a farmer himself said:Hawai'i has been called ""ground zero"" for GMO/Agricultural Chemicals development. Its mild climate allows two growing seasons and its small legislature is easily bought out. In fact only 10 members of the Hawai'i legislature arerecipients of GMO/Chem money.

The GMO seed companies such as Monsanto, Syngenta, Bayer, and Dupont are the biggest agricultural chemical manufacturers. Their controversial claims of GMO seeds cutting down on pesticides are exactly opposite of reality. According to Organic Consumers herbicides account for about one-third of the global pesticide market, and around 80% of GM seeds involve herbicide-resistance.

Agriculture chemicals have poisoned aquifers on Oahu and Maui.

Kaua'i now has a bill pending that would require companies like Syngenta to disclose what pesticides they are spraying. Kaua'i residents are concerned not only with existing EPA registered pesticides but the experiments with the unregistered pesticides these GMO companies are developing.

So it is no surprise that popular and progressive Sen Brian Schatz responded to his many constituent calls and helped kill the Monsanto Protection Rider.

However.

Sen Schatz is being primaried by a New Democrat Coalition corporatist, Colleen Hanabusa. She has been conspicuously quiet on the subject of the Monsanto Rider.

No wonder. Her group, the New Dems, sees biotech as the ""future of the U.S."" They successfully pushed to extend patents and give corporate welfare to biotech companies.

""New Democrats believe the federal government can promote advances in biotechnology by providing funding for basic research, ensuring the protection of intellectual property and investing in regulatory agencies such as the Patent and Trademark Office and the Federal Drug Administration. ""

Hanabusa is quoted in the latest New Dem press release urging Congress to put partisanship aside. But according to the New Dems, that means embracing the odious Simpson-Bowles recommendations that balance the budget on the backs of the poor and elderly by cutting Social Security and other safety nets.

Not one word about the New Dems' support of corporate welfare and eternal war.

Sen. Schatz kept his constituents updated on the Monsanto Rider and his (successful) efforts to remove it as well as the nonsensical provision to defund the Affordable Care Act. We heard about defunding the ACA many times from Hanabusa (always in conjunction with increasingly desperate pleas for donations) but not one word on the Monsanto Rider.

So Rep Hanabusa: Where do you stand on special deals for biotech companies? With your New Dem pals or with the people of Hawai'i?"

USA TODAY

The former Illinois congressman has admitted misusing %24750%2C000 in campaign funds

His wife%2C Sandi Jackson%2C has pleaded guilty to falsifying tax returns for six years

Jesse Jackson%27s lawyers link crime to his bipolar disorder%3B prosecutors cite %22greed and entitlement%22

WASHINGTON — Former Illinois congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. was sentenced to two and a half years in prison Wednesday for using $750,000 in campaign money for living expenses, trips and luxury goods — a stunning fall for a once-rising political star from a famous family.

Jackson and his wife, Sandi Jackson, treated campaign funds as a ""personal piggy bank,"" U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson told the Democrat, who represented Chicago's South Side for 17 years. ""There may be gray areas in campaign finance. This case did not come near to those areas.

""As a public official, you are supposed to live up to a higher standard of ethics and integrity,"" said the judge, who is no relation to the former congressman.

Sandi Jackson received a one-year prison term.

During an emotional hearing, both Jacksons tearfully admitted wrongdoing and begged the judge to consider the damage prison terms would inflict on their children, ages 13 and 9.

""I take responsibility for my actions,"" Jesse Jackson Jr. said, sobbing openly in court as his family looked on. ""I misled the American people.""

Both Jacksons received shorter prison terms than recommended by federal prosecutors, who sought to imprison him for four years and his wife for 18 months. Jesse Jackson Jr. could have several months shaved off his sentence for good behavior.

""No one is celebrating today,"" his lawyer Reid Weingarten said. ""The fall from grace is complete.""

Jackson, 48, is the son of civil rights leader and former presidential candidate, Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr.

The senior Jackson, who joined other family members in the courtroom Wednesday, said that his son's bipolar disorder had taken an enormous toll. ""A year ago, I thought we might have lost him,"" Jackson told reporters after the sentencing. ""He is still recovering.""

The sentencing ends a chapter in a years-long federal probe into the conduct of Jackson, who pleaded guilty in February to misusing campaign funds.

Court filings show Jackson used donors' money as his own, spending lavishly on luxury goods and services, including a $43,350 gold-plated men's Rolex watch, $5,687 for a ""holistic retreat"" in Martha's Vineyard and more than $5,000 on capes and fur parkas. He also used campaign funds for more commonplace expenses, such as dry cleaning and toothpaste purchased from Costco.

In court, Jackson's lawyers sought to tie his crimes to his mental condition. Weingarten called him a ""good person"" whose judgment was impaired by his bipolar disorder. He asked for leniency. ""There are not widows and orphans surrounding the courthouse wanting his head.""

Weingarten noted that lawmakers in the 1980s were permitted to use campaign money for personal expenses. ""If you took a microscope and looked at all these campaign (reports), you would find a lot of gray,"" he said.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves said the case ""strikes at the integrity of the campaign-finance system"" and deserved punishment

Prosecutors and the judge also questioned how big a role Jackson's mental health issues played in the theft of campaign funds that lasted for several years. The couple routinely used donors' money to supplement their income in ways that ""can't be chalked up to a periodic loss of control,"" said Jackson, the federal judge.

Sandi Jackson, a former Chicago alderman, pleaded guilty to falsifying to the couple's tax returns over a six-year period. Her lawyers sought to spare her prison time, saying she needed to care for her children. ""Give me her time,"" Jesse Jackson Jr. implored.

""My heart breaks every day with the pain it has caused my babies,"" Sandi Jackson said in court, her voice breaking.

""It's not the government that put your children in this position,"" the judge dryly told Sandi Jackson before ordering her to prison.

Graves, the prosecutor, said Sandi Jackson was not an unwitting accomplice to her husband's crimes. ""The facts show that she stole and that she stole a lot of money,"" he said.

Sandi Jackson used a credit card tied to her husband's campaign to pay for $171,000 in personal goods, Graves said. He ticked off a string of expenses funded with donors' contributions, including a Sub-Zero refrigerator, school fees and a trip to Walt Disney World.

The judge agreed to stagger the sentences to allow one parent to remain home with the children. Jesse Jackson Jr. will serve his time first and must report to authorities in November. Sandi Jackson will begin serving her sentence a month after her husband is released.

Jackson Jr. was first elected to Congress in a 1995 special election to replace Mel Reynolds, a Democrat who resigned after he was convicted of having sex with a teenage campaign worker.

Jackson won re-election by a wide margin last November, despite the federal investigation and his absence from both his congressional job and the campaign trail. Jackson had been on extended medical leave. He resigned from Congress several weeks after Election Day.

The judge recommended assigning the former congressman to a minimum-security federal prison camp in Montgomery, Ala., or a low-security facility near Raleigh, N.C. The Bureau of Prisons makes the final decision.

The case doesn't end with Wednesday's sentencing. Jackson still must pay $750,000 to the government. Sandi Jackson was order to pay $22,000 in restitution. That's money she took from her campaign account as a Chicago alderman and used to buy shoes, a visit to a Las Vegas spa and other personal expenses, the judge said.

Andrew Breitbart worked tirelessly to expose the Pigford fraud scheme only to have the clear evidence of manipulation by politicians and plaintiff lawyers ignored by the mainstream media. The story involved politicians and lawyers hijacking a lawsuit by black farmers against the USDA designed to make up for years of discrimination and turning it into a multi-billion dollar fraud where people claiming to have ‘attempted to farm’ were able to collect $50,000 checks with no proof. The Obama administration expanded the program for Native Americans, Hispanics, and women, using the same low “attempted to farm” standard that invited massive, undetectable fraud.

The Times piece was written by a team led by Sharon LaFraniere, who worked on the story for months and according to the article “was based on thousands of pages of court and confidential government documents, as well as interviews with dozens of claimants, lawyers, former and current government officials and others involved in the cases over the past 14 years.”

Here are some highlights from the article, including a number of details not previously reported:

Questionable Legal Moves

The Times story gives a great deal of detail about how the Obama administration certified its own settlement in the cases of the Native American, women, and Hispanic farmer settlements, sidestepping both the legal system ad Congress. Breitbart News has reported on the Obama administration’s expansion of Pigford previously, but the Times brought shocking new information to light.

For one thing, there were only a total of 91 plaintiffs actually filing suit; 10 women and 81 Latinos. This is a very small number and it certainly would have been possible to handle any actual discrimination claims on a case-by-case basis. However, the Times points out that the government was very skeptical even about those cases.

“Some of these folks have never made a loan payment in their entire history with U.S.D.A.,” Lisa A. Olson, the lead government litigator against the 81 Hispanic plaintiffs, told Judge Robertson in August 2009. “There may even be folks who are under criminal investigation.”

The Obama Administration made a choice to create a settlement mechanism on their own. The Times says “the Obama administration’s political appointees at the Justice and Agriculture Departments engineered a stunning turnabout: they committed $1.33 billion to compensate not just the 91 plaintiffs but thousands of Hispanic and female farmers who had never claimed bias in court.”

With pressure mounting from some in Congress, “The Obama administration made the ‘legally questionable’ decision to sidestep Congress and pay the woman and Hispanic farmer claims out of a special Treasury Department fund known as The Judgment Fund. “

The small number of actual cases is also significant because of the disparity in the number of actual suits and the number of claims filed so far in the cases; only ten women were actually filing suit but an incredible 24,000 have filed to get $50,000 under the settlement still active at the FarmerClaims.gov website.

Pigford Was About Buying Votes

Even the New York Times has trouble getting Department of Justice officials to speak on record on the story. The Times says, “Acting Associate Attorney General Tony West, who supervised the civil division and oversaw the handling of the cases, canceled an interview. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. also declined to comment.”

This 2008 article from the San Francisco Chronicle profiles Tony West, who was then the California finance co-chair for the Obama campaign and is described as an “Obama power broker.” West, a deep Obama campaign insider, oversaw the settlements for the Obama administration.

This is another indication that the Pigford scandal was about vote buying and elections for the politicians involved. Much of the original Pigford corruption traces to Arkansas. That was no accident but was at the behest of the man who was President when the first Pigford settlement was designed, Bill Clinton. From the Times:

Mr. Clinton asked Carol Willis, then a senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee who was known for his expertise in black voter turnout, to get involved. Mr. Willis said the president wanted to make sure his home state, Arkansas, benefited.

During the 2008 elections, the Times details how the Obama administration used Pigford for election purposes. From the Times:

..legislators from both parties, including Mr. Obama as a senator in 2007, sponsored bills to grant the late filers relief. Mr. Boyd said Mr. Obama’s support led him to throw the backing of his 109,000-member black farmers’ association behind the Obama presidential primary campaign. Hilary Shelton, the N.A.A.C.P.’s chief lobbyist, said Mr. Obama’s stance helped establish him as a defender of the concerns of rural African-American communities.

And the Times makes it clear that others felt the settlements were buying off special interests. A professor from U.C. Berkley testified for the government that there was no pattern of discrimination by the USDA against Native American farmers."

After describing the Senate Democratic proposal as not bad, but basically insufficient because it does not call for ""substantial though temporary spending increases"" which would logically follow from its own analysis, he notes of the CPC proposal that it calls for such increases, largely offsetting them by ""higher taxes on the wealthy, corporations and pollution.""

Of even greater importance, he takes apart the notion of false equivalency, that somehow the CPC budget is a ""Ryan plan of the left"" -

There are no Ryan-style magic asterisks, trillion-dollar savings that are assumed to come from unspecified sources; this is an honest proposal. And “Back to Work” rests on solid macroeconomic analysis, not the fantasy “expansionary austerity” economics — the claim that slashing spending in a depressed economy somehow promotes job growth rather than deepening the depression — that Mr. Ryan continues to espouse despite the doctrine’s total failure in Europe.

it’s refreshing to see someone break with the usual Washington notion that political “courage” means proposing that we hurt the poor while sparing the rich.

Mr. Ryan’s efforts are finally starting to get the derision they deserve, while progressives seem, at long last, to be finding their voice. Little by little, Washington’s fog of fiscal flimflam seems to be lifting.

The plan may, according to Krugman, be as equally audacious as Ryan's proposal, and therefore probably has as little chance of being enacted, but as he writesHis sense is we are unlikely to get a grand bargain, what movement there is is ""in a direction conservatives won’t like"" and thatNow if only the President were not so fixed on the notion of the Grand Bargain, as he clearly is. If only he would listen to the likes of Krugman and the CPC instead of Simpson and Bowles and Jack Lew.

The one hope we do have is that resistance from Democrats has increased enough that the President might not be able to put together majorities in either chamber of Congress in favor of a grand bargain, with Republicans firmly against raising tax rates or further closing loopholes and Democrats increasingly opposed to cutting benefits on the needy and the middle class.

It is worth noting that the amount of savings aimed for in the originally Simpson Bowles have been more than half accomplished already, and that projections of the impact of the Affordable Care Act helps seriously slow the growth of Medicare spending. Putting people to work will increase tax revenues at all levels of government, including payments into Medicare and Social Security, as well as decreasing expenditures on unemployment and Medicaid.

Of the three budget proposals out there, that of the Congressional Progressives is the one that makes the most sense, and the only one whose numbers actually work.

Too bad the Washington consensus does not yet grasp that.

It is nice that Krugman gives it appropriate credit.

And it is even nicer that he again properly labels Ryan and his proposals for what they are: fiscal flimflam

Among the answers he comes up with is the White House’s own arrogance.

Stein reviews a series of reasons why 2013 broke bad for the President. The Obamacare rollout gets top billing and unexpected events in Newtown and Syria also make the list. But at least a few people see the source of the problem as coming not from outside the White House but within it:

Mike Lux, who served as Obama’s liaison to the progressive community

during the 2008 White House transition and has been critical of the

administration since, argued that self-assuredness played a damaging

role, preventing Obama and his team from seeing problems on the horizon.

When would-be allies warned the White House about the looming dangers

of health care insurance cancelations or the potential backlash to a

Larry Summers Federal Reserve nomination, the advice was heard, but not

necessarily heeded. “I feel like the White House goes it alone too much,” said Lux. “In

advance of a battle or even in the early stages of a problem, it doesn’t

seem like they have gone out of their way to build unity and cohesion

in the party and with progressive allies.” A top progressive operative put it more bluntly: “These guys are

stunningly arrogant. They really believe that their shit doesn’t smell,

that they have all the answers. And that arrogance continues to hurt

them.”

Stein concludes that the hinge point of the bad year was Obamacare. That was the place where false promises and foreseeable problems all rushed together in a sickening crunch for the administration. After the government shutdown in October, the Republicans were polling badly and Obamacare was trending up despite the fact that the site did not work at all. Two months later, with the scope of their failure made clear, all of those gains have been reversed and then some."

Months of investigation by The New York Times, centered on extensive interviews with Libyans in Benghazi who had direct knowledge of the attack there and its context, turned up no evidence that Al Qaeda or other international terrorist groups had any role in the assault. The attack was led, instead, by fighters who had benefited directly from NATO’s extensive air power and logistics support during the uprising against Colonel Qaddafi. And contrary to claims by some members of Congress, it was fueled in large part by anger at an American-made video denigrating Islam.

Wow! What do you say? What will become of Daryl Issa? I know--- nothing because the GOP is never held accountable by the Washington press corp. In fact, I am pretty sure that the Sunday shows will invite him on so that he can talk at length about New York Times being a liberal shill for Obama.

And of course the Conserva-conspiracy theory industry will summarily dismiss because it is the New York Times. But the rest of us can know for a fact in what this article shows. Susan Rice was right. Obama was right. Now, the question is, will they ever get apologies?

Unfortunately, we know the answer to that question as well. And we also know that Hillary Clinton won't get her much deserved apology either. The Republicans would have to have a shred of decency to apologize, and a shred is just too much to ask from that clown cabal.

Anyway, congrats to the New York Times for a great piece of journalism."

Steve Scalise (R-LA) has called on President Barack Obama to fire John Podesta as his senior adviser in the wake of startling revelations about comments he has made.

In an interview with Politico for a Politico Magazine profile, Podesta compared the Republican Party to the Jonestown cult that Jim Jones led in the 1970s, of which 900 members committed mass suicide via cyanide poisoning in 1978.

“They [the Obama administration] need to focus on executive action given that they are facing a second term against a cult worthy of Jonestown in charge of one of the houses of Congress,” Podesta said of what the administration must do in dealing with the Republican controlled House.

Scalise thinks such comments should be a fireable offense. He called on Obama to take action and terminate Podesta’s employment right away.

“It’s disgraceful and telling that President Obama’s new Counselor is not only comparing the Republican Party to a cult that murdered those who disagreed with them, but is also using that comparison as an argument in support of shredding the Constitution and governing like a third-world dictator,” Scalise said in a statement provided to Breitbart News. “The American people will not stand by and allow the Obama White House to destroy the checks-and-balances defined in the Constitution that are critical to a working democracy, and neither will Congress!”

“The American people elected a divided government in Washington, and the Obama Administration would do well to respect that fact instead of undermining the will of the American people at every turn,” he continued. “President Obama ran to change the tone in Washington, and it’s time for him to live up to that promise by relieving Mr. Podesta of his official duties immediately.”

Scalise is not the only Republican upset about Podesta’s rhetoric. Rory Cooper, the spokesman for House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), said in a statement provided to Breitbart News that such comments make it difficult for House Republicans to work with the administration.

“This type of appalling and inflammatory rhetoric is a very troubling sign of how this White House plans to govern over the next three years,” Cooper said.

Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), a freshman conservative member, said in a statement provided to Breitbart News that the American people should not accept Podesta’s or the White House’s arguments for executive orders and exceeding new authority on the administration’s behalf.

“Faced with an imploding health care law built on a façade of deception, ruling class leftists like John Podesta resort to vitriolic attacks against, and demonization of, their political opponents,” DeSantis said. “This seems like an entirely baseless excuse for the President to act unilaterally in ways that exceed his constitutional authority.”"

Obama told donors the sight of Mt. Rainier illuminated by a setting sun was particularly special because it reminded him of his mother, who attended high school in the Seattle area. ""I feel the spirit of my mom,"" he said.

He also attempted to contrast himself with Republicans who control the House of Representatives, saying they are ""more focused on positioning themselves for the next election.""

""I'm not a particularly ideological person,"" he said, adding he still is passionate about giving people a fair shake, about the environment, and working for peace and national security. ""But I'm pretty pragmatic about how we get there.""

Money, star power and Hollywood awaited the president on this trip, which featured a bit of official business, but mostly fundraising for a Democratic Party eager to go on offense after a politically debilitating two months.

More On This...

Obama arrived Sunday evening in Seattle. He also planned stops in San Francisco and Los Angeles, raising money for House and Senate Democrats as well as the national party.

High-profile events on the schedule include a reception at the home of retired basketball star Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson and his wife, Cookie, in Beverly Hills, Calif., and one at the house of Marta Kauffman, co-creator of television's ""Friends.""

Accompanied by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California, Obama attended a reception and dinner Sunday at the home of former Microsoft executive Jon Shirley.

Though he professed he was not looking for the defeat of another party, he said the country needs Pelosi to be House speaker again.

The money raised — $32,400 per couple — went to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which benefits House Democrats.

""In the year before an election like this, I think the most tangible way that an incumbent president of either party, frankly, can benefit his party's prospects in congressional races is to try to help them raise money,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said earlier. ""And I would anticipate that the president's efforts on that front will continue into next year.""

The trip comes as Obama's health care law approaches a crucial Nov. 30 deadline for an improved insurance enrollment website whose catastrophic start Oct. 1 dealt a serious political blow to the White House. Also, the U.S. and other world powers just sealed a historic deal with Iran for a temporary freeze of its nuclear program.

In addition to a half-dozen fundraisers, Obama intended to use the trip to keep the heat on Congress to pass an overhaul of immigration laws. He planned to address that issue during a stop Monday at a Chinese recreation center in San Francisco, and to promote his economic agenda Tuesday at the DreamWorks Animation studio in Glendale, Calif.

In recent days White House officials have tried to draw attention back to the economy to avoid getting bogged down by the botched launch of the health care enrollment.

Lately, Obama has devoted time to raising money for the party, helping the Democratic National Committee reduce a massive 2012 debt and build up cash for House and Senate Democratic Committees.

The White House has been especially attentive to Senate Democrats to ensure that the party retains its majority in the chamber. The House is controlled by the Republican Party.

In addition to the dinner at Shirley's home, Obama also attended a Democratic National Committee event Sunday at the home of Tom Campion, co-founder of the clothing chain Zumiez. Unlike the dinner at Shirley's house, reporters were not permitted into the fundraiser.

The event attracted about 30 donors, the DNC said. Tickets also were $32,400 per couple, according to an invitation."

Pollak'],Dictatorship of Hypocrites: The Media's Crusade Against Cruz,"The liberal media have their knives out for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) after his textbook cross-examination of Secretary of Defense nominee Chuck Hagel at the latter’s confirmation hearing Jan. 31. Jane Mayer of the New Yorker seized on a speech Cruz gave three years ago in which he asserted that when he was at Harvard Law School, shortly after Barack Obama, there were twelve Marxists on the faculty and one Republican.

That, Mayer alleges, is evidence of Cruz’s innate McCarthyism–and hence, she implies, ought to discredit Cruz’s inquiries into Hagel’s beliefs and financial backing. That’s rich coming from the New Yorker‘s resident Koch-obsessive, who launched a McCarthyist assault on the Tea Party in 2010, asserting it was mere Astroturf for the “billionaire Koch brothers’ war against Obama,” and demanding more scrutiny of the Kochs’ ties to it.

Her current campaign against Cruz is a pure political vendetta–a fact she does not even try to deny. In her latest offering, she defends her sudden interest in the 2010 speech as follows: “…Cruz’s hostile questioning of Obama’s nominee for Defense Secretary, Chuck Hagel, and insinuations about Hagel’s loyalties had provided a fresh context for looking more closely at the nature of the accusations he has leveled at political opponents.”

In terms of accusations against one’s opponents, it’s hard to top Mayer’s suggestion that millions of conservative Americans are paid stooges–or Obama’s numerous attacks on opponents using false accusations and innuendo. Remember the doctors who cut out kids’ tonsils for no reason except greed? The Republican presidential nominee who just might be a felon, and may have killed a man’s wife? Few complaints from Mayer there.

In fact, Mayer gave positive coverage to the anti-Bain Capital ads that ran against Romney in Ohio. In a post-election article on Nov. 19, 2012, “Seeing Spots,” Mayer noted that the ad about a worker’s dead wife was inaccurate. She nonetheless celebrated the company that made it for another ad in the series, “Stage,” which helped “to float the image of Romney as a coldhearted fat cat” and gave Obama a decisive advantage in the polls.

Cruz was absolutely correct that there were, and are, many radicals on Harvard Law’s faculty, and few Republicans. Give the Texan a technical for hyperbole: he may have over-counted the Communist revolutionaries, and undercounted the Republicans. But Mayer turns to two dubious sources to attack Cruz’s assertion. One is Charles Fried, the former Reagan solicitor general; the other is critical legal studies guru Duncan Kennedy.

Fried was a Republican. He is far to the left of that party today. In 2008, Fried voted for Barack Obama. In 2011, in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he declared that Obamacare’s individual mandate was constitutional–even agreeing that it would be constitutional for Congress to pass a law forcing people to buy vegetables or buy a gym membership. Though it upheld Obamacare, the Supreme Court rejected that argument.

As for Kennedy, he is not a Communist, and says he never “believed in the overthrow of the U.S. Government.” Yet he believes in the undoing of much that sustains our system. of laws and institutions. For example, when I was a student, he once told me that the solution to the problem of illegal immigration from Mexico was to end the border entirely, i.e. to be one country. That would have rather radical implications for our government.

One of Kennedy’s colleagues, Roberto Unger, is a fellow member of the critical legal studies movement. He is not a Communist, but a self-described leftist revolutionary nonetheless. I took two classes with Unger while I was an undergraduate, and he attacked the American “cult of the Constitution,” arguing that the world’s present countries with a new system in which each represented a different (leftist) “moral” vision.

Several members of Harvard Law’s faculty espouse other radical left ideas. They are not card-carrying Communists, but some do see themselves as proponents of different forms of Marxist thought, and would like to see revolutionary changes in both the U.S. government and the international order. Saul Alinsky, too, was not a Communist–but he believed in the radical disruption of our political system and the redistribution of wealth.

Those views are distinguishable from formal Communism only by virtue of the fact that they do not call for a proletarian dictatorship. Our contemporary “social democrats” wish to impose such revolutionary changes through our present political system, transforming our Constitution and our society through democratic means. There are far more of such radical professors at Harvard Law School than those who defend conservative thought.

The media’s crusade against Cruz proves that in Obama’s America, it is considered far worse to accuse someone of being a Marxist than to be one. The same journalists who demand full disclosure of every penny that conservative financiers might have put into lobbying or politics now mock Cruz’s attempt to probe Hagel’s financial disclosures–or the lack thereof, since Hagel has refused to supply much of the requested information.

It is certainly of interest that a man who would lead the Pentagon would have close ties to an organization funded by the Saudi government, the Hariri family, and foreign arms dealers, among others. Had Hagel been chairman of Americans for Prosperity, Mayer would no doubt be clamoring for a full-scale investigation into the Kochs. Instead, she is leading a smear campaign against Cruz, one of the few in D.C. actually doing his job."

USA TODAY

Two years after saying President Obama had not met an uncle who faced deportation, the White House said Thursday that Obama lived briefly with him back in the 1980s.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said that Obama met Onyango Obama when he arrived in Cambridge, Mass., in the late 1980s to attend Harvard Law School; Obama stayed briefly with his uncle until his new apartment was ready.

Carney said the White House staff based its 2011 claim that the two had never met on a review of the documentary record — including Obama's memoir — and had not asked the president himself.

When the issue resurfaced this week, Carney said, ""I thought it was the right thing to do to go ask him (Obama). Nobody had asked him in the past.""

On Tuesday, an immigration judge ruled that the Kenya-born Onyango Obama could stay in the United States, saying he met the criteria for legal permanent residency.

During the hearing, Onyango Obama — the half-brother of the president's father — claimed a relationship with his famous nephew.

The president and his uncle have not stayed in touch, Carney said.

""The president has not seen Omar Obama in 20 years and has not spoken with him in roughly 10 years,"" Carney said.

Carney also repeated that the White House had ""absolutely zero"" involvement in the uncle's deportation case.

From The Boston Globe, which first reported the story:

""President Obama acknowledged on Thursday that he lived with his Kenyan uncle for a brief period in the 1980s while preparing to attend Harvard Law School, contradicting a statement more than a year ago that the White House had no record of the two ever meeting.

""Their relationship came into question on Tuesday at the deportation hearing of his uncle, Onyango Obama, in Boston immigration court. His uncle had lived in the United States illegally since the 1970s and revealed in testimony for the first time that his famous nephew had stayed at his Cambridge apartment for about three weeks. At the time, Onyango Obama was here illegally and fighting deportation.

""On Thursday, a White House official said the press office had not fully researched the relationship between the president and his uncle before telling the Globe that they had no record of the two meeting. This time, the press office asked the president directly, which they had not done in 2011."""
http://news.yahoo.com/white-house-reverses-course--says-obama-lived-with-kenyan-uncle-202020835.html,,[],"White House reverses course, says Obama lived with Kenyan uncle","The White House acknowledged Thursday that President Barack Obama lived briefly years ago with a Kenyan uncle previously targeted for deportation — after initially insisting there was no evidence they had ever met.

Why the stark turnaround? “Nobody spoke to the president” when the question first arose in 2011, press secretary Jay Carney told reporters at his daily briefing.

Instead, staff appear to have relied on one of the president’s autobiographical books.

“Back when this arose, folks looked at the record, including the president's book, and there was no evidence that they had met, there was — and that was what was conveyed,” Carney explained.

That appeared to be a reference to “Dreams From My Father,” which famously includes the warning that some people in the book are composites.

Carney also denied any improper White House meddling in the deportation procedures against the elder Obama, whom he described as “his father’s half brother.” The uncle, who has lived in the United States for 50 years, won his fight against deportation this week.

""Absolutely zero interference,"" the spokesman said.

Here’s some background from the Boston Globe:

""Onyango Obama’s immigration case raised numerous concerns about a potential conflict of interest after his arrest in August 2011 for drunken driving in Framingham. The arrest revealed his outstanding deportation orders and his relationship to the president. ""Shortly after his arrest, he told an officer, “I think I will call the White House.”

The question of the relationship between the two men arose at a recent deportation hearing focused on the uncle. Onyango ""Omar"" Obama testified that the future president had lived with him in Cambridge for three weeks.

There were reports that he had said the other day that President Obama, back when he was a law school student, had stayed with him in Cambridge. I thought it was the right thing to do to go ask him,"" Carney explained.

“The president said that he, in fact, had met Omar Obama when he moved to Cambridge for law school, and that he stayed with him for a brief period of time until his — the president's — apartment was ready,” the spokesman added.

“After that, they saw each other once every few months while the president was in Cambridge, and then, after law school, they gradually fell out of touch. The president has not seen Omar Obama in 20 years and has not spoken with him in roughly 10 years.”"

(CNN) —

In the middle of his first congressional hearing as the new head of the embattled Internal Revenue Service, Daniel Werfel was asked Monday how he would restore public trust in the agency after revelations that conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status were targeted for extra scrutiny.

“It is going to be a difficult process,” acknowledged Werfel, a career public servant appointed by President Barack Obama last month to clean up the mess that is dominating news headlines early in his second term.

Werfel described a process of identifying what happened, who was responsible and steps to ensure it can never happen again to address what Republicans depict as politically motivated harassment that abused constitutional rights of conservative groups.

’Liar’ charge a step too far for some Republicans

Democrats, while expressing outrage over the IRS targeting, reject Republican inferences that it was a broad political conspiracy reaching as high up as the White House.

In addition to the targeting uncovered by a Treasury inspector general, a second audit coming out this week described improper spending on IRS conferences to buttress GOP portrayals of big government gone wild under Obama.

The IRS spent close to $50 million on 225 conferences between 2010 and 2012, according to briefings given to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee by the inspector-general overseeing the IRS. One of those, an August 2010 meeting for 2,700 employees in Anaheim, California, cost $4 million, and the agency spent $50,000 to produce two videos that were shown at the event, including one with a “Star Trek” theme.

In a response to the new audit, obtained by a congressional source, the IRS says it has cut training costs and reduced spending on meetings by 87% since 2010.

“The expenditures related to this 2010 meeting are not reflective of the current spending environment at the IRS or the spending that has occurred over the past several years,” wrote Pamela LaRue, the agency’s chief financial officer.

But LaRue defended the need for large-scale conferences at the time. Nearly a third of managers in the division under scrutiny were inexperienced, and the agency faced added concerns about security after a Texas man crashed his plane into the IRS office in Austin, killing himself and two other people.

“Although the average cost per employee was reasonable, the IRS recognizes that a number of less significant costs warranted additional scrutiny and were not the best use of government resources,” she wrote.

IRS faces new battle on overspending

Rep. Hal Rogers, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee who sat in on his panel’s Financial Service’s subcommittee on Monday, made clear that he would assess the effectiveness and commitment by Werfel to uncover the source of the wrongdoing when considering IRS funding for next fiscal year.

“The power of the purse rests in the Congress, and we’re prepared to use that purse to get to the truth,” the Kentucky Republican said.

Two more congressional hearings are scheduled for this week as Republicans seek to keep up the pressure on Obama and Democrats over the controversies.

They follow three previous hearings by House and Senate panels, and the matter also is under investigation by the Justice Department, the Treasury inspector generals office and Werfel in his new capacity.

A former Office of Management and Budget official, Werfel took over from former IRS Commissioner Steve Miller, who resigned under pressure after news of the targeting emerged. He described himself Monday as a fixer of problems in government.

“The IRS is an agency in need right now,” Werfel said, adding that he took the job “because I thought it could be helpful.”

That didn’t impress some Republicans on the Financial Services subcommittee, who expressed frustration with the lack of answers to their main question – who ordered the targeting?

Issa: Cincinnati IRS employees say direction came from Washington

Werfel said he also was frustrated and urged patience to allow the various investigations underway to work through the process.

Both Werfel and J. Russell George, the inspector general who conducted the audit that revealed the IRS targeting, repeated past assertions that the findings so far indicated gross mismanagement rather than political malfeasance.

Read IRS watchdog’s report

Meanwhile, White House spokesman Jay Carney sought to tone down the rhetoric over an increasingly bitter dispute with congressional Republicans over the issue.

Asked by reporters about an accusation by House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa that he was a “paid liar,” Carney at first jokingly feigned ignorance, answering: “I hadn’t heard that. That’s amazing.”

As laughter erupted in the briefing room, Carney took a more serious tone.

“I am not going to get into a back-and-forth with” Issa, he said, adding that the White House focus was on finding out what “inappropriate activity” occurred, hold responsible those at fault for “inappropriate, outrageous activity” and ensure it never happens again.

It was a diplomatic effort to avoid prolonging headlines about harsh statements Sunday from Issa and a former White House official that escalated the controversy into a full-fledged Washington political imbroglio, including name-calling and references to decades-old allegations of wrongdoing.

Carney brushes off Issa remark

Appearing on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Issa said Sunday that the White House was misleading the public about the full magnitude of the IRS targeting, in which some conservative groups seeking tax exempt status were singled out for extra scrutiny.

In particular, he called Carney a “paid liar” and claimed that interviews with IRS officials in the Cincinnati office that considered requests for tax-exempt status showed that Washington officials were involved.

However, he stopped short of providing proof of his claim, saying only that further investigation would reveal “the whole truth.”

In response, former White House adviser David Plouffe, a Democratic strategist, denied any political motivation in the IRS targeting.

In a tweet posted later Sunday, Plouffe referred to Issa’s comments as “strong words from Mr Grand Theft Auto and suspected arsonist/insurance swindler.”

By the Numbers: Internal Revenue Service

The tweet also called Issa “loose ethically today,” adding a link to a story about Issa’s appearance on CNN.

Plouffe’s tweet referred to allegations from 1972 and 1982 against Issa, the former owner of a car alarm company.

In 1972, then-19-year-old Issa was arrested under suspicion of stealing a car, but charges were ultimately dropped. Issa’s brother, on the other hand, is a convicted car thief.

In 1982, the office and factory of two companies Issa had purchased – Quantum Enterprises and Steal Stopper International – caught fire.

The insurance company’s investigation found “suspicious burn patterns” and company officials noted that in the month before the fire, Issa had increased his insurance from $100,000 to $462,000. Again, no criminal charges were filed.

IRS investigation takes nasty turn

In a hearing that escalated into a boisterous public shaming of one of the country's most-feared government agencies, lawmakers took turns Friday calling outgoing IRS Commissioner Steven Miller on the carpet for his department's scandalous practice of targeting conservative groups.

Miller rebuffed attempts to extract the names of those responsible, saying he did not know. But lawmakers vowed that the tense hearing would mark only the start of a series of investigations, in which criminal activity could be probed.

Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., seemed to capture the angst against the agency toward the end of the hours-long hearing, as he described the ways its agents are capable of ruining lives.

""You can put anybody out of business that you want. ... When the IRS comes in there, you're not allowed to be shoddy,"" he said, suggesting the agency's leadership was being held to a different standard now that it is coming under scrutiny.

""This is absolutely an overreach, and this is an outrage for all Americans,"" he said.

When he finished, the committee room erupted in cheers and applause that lasted several seconds.

The hearing, though, was more than just venting.

While Democrats voiced concern that the latest scandal would be used to score ""political points,"" lawmakers on both sides of the aisle scolded the agency. And they made clear they'd be pressuring the IRS in the weeks to come on several points -- namely, who was responsible and whether lawmakers were overtly lied to last year.

On the first question, they got few answers from Miller during Friday's testimony.

But they repeatedly confronted the acting commissioner -- who was ousted from him job earlier this week -- about his and other officials' failure to disclose the program last year despite being aware of it.

""In fact, we were repeatedly told no such targeting was happening. That isn't being misled, that's lying,"" said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.

Miller seemed to frustrate lawmakers' attempts to dig deeper. He claimed, a week after the scandal broke and a year after he first learned of the practice, that he still did not know who was responsible.

""I don't have that name,"" he testified, after Rep. Dave Reichert, R-Wash., asked who was behind the program.

Miller also claimed -- over and over -- he was being honest with Congress during a hearing last year.

""You did not share the information you knew,"" Reichert charged.

""I answered all questions truthfully,"" Miller replied.

This claim was met with deep skepticism Friday. Miller acknowledged he learned of the practice during a May 3, 2012, briefing. Yet when he was asked about it at a July 25 hearing that year, he said only that some applications fell into a particular category -- and that those organizations were grouped for ""consistency"" and ""quality.""

A letter he wrote to a Republican lawmaker the month before also gave a general description of the process without acknowledging that some groups were being singled out based on words like ""Tea Party"" and ""Patriot.""

""How can we not conclude that you misled this committee?"" Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., former GOP vice presidential nominee, asked Miller.

Miller said he ""did not mislead the committee"" and stands by his answer.

Asked whether his answer was ""incomplete,"" he said again he answered ""truthfully.""

Miller objected to the term ""targeting,"" and claimed political motivations were not at play in the program, which began in 2010. But he apologized for the program and said ""foolish mistakes were made by people trying to be more efficient.""

""As acting commissioner, I want to apologize on the behalf of the Internal Revenue Service for the mistakes that we made and the poor service provided,"" Miller said. ""The affected organizations and the American public deserve better.""

The hearing is the first to examine the scandal, and will likely kick off a string of subsequent hearings and investigations. Republicans made clear that the two retirements or resignations to date would not satisfy their concerns.

Camp ripped the tax-collecting agency over the practice at the start of the hearing. ""Now we know the truth -- or at least some of it,"" he said. ""We also know that these revelations are just the tip of the iceberg. It would be a mistake to treat this as just one scandal.""

He questioned how high the scandal went, and also suggested there was other targeting of conservatives that has not yet been acknowledged by the agency. He called it part of a ""culture of cover-ups.""

""This systemic abuse cannot be fixed with just one resignation, or two,"" he said. He said the problem is not just personnel, but the size and scope of the IRS.

The inspector general who released a scathing report on the agency also testified Friday. J. Russell George -- the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration -- said his findings raised ""troubling questions"" about the agency, while claiming some of the wrongdoing was apparently done with no-to-little supervision.

But he said all three allegations against the agency turned out to be true -- that it was using ""inappropriate criteria"" to screen conservative groups, it was delaying applications and it was asking unnecessary questions.

Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., the top Democrat on the committee, said the agency's management ""completely failed the American people."" At the same time, he urged Republicans not to use the hearing to ""score political points.""

Republicans, though, expressed more concern after they learned Thursday that the IRS official who led the tax-exempt organizations unit when the targeting took place -- Sarah Hall Ingram -- has since moved over to the IRS office responsible for ObamaCare.

Miller said Friday he was the one who promoted her and called her a ""superb civil servant.""

The acknowledgement comes after the administration announced that Ingram's successor Joseph Grant -- who had only been on the job a few days -- would be retiring.

President Obama, meanwhile, maintained Thursday that he didn't know about the investigation into the IRS program until it was made public. Obama also appointed a new acting commissioner -- White House budget officer Daniel Werfel -- after the prior IRS chief announced his resignation."

Now it'll have to deal with the IRS targeting scandal potentially trailing its latest nominee for ambassador to Tanzania.

Mark Childress, deputy White House chief of staff, was announced Monday evening as President Obama's pick for the Africa post. Obama described him and several other nominees as ""dedicated and accomplished individuals.""

Childress has a lengthy and imposing resume, having served in top positions in the Justice and Health and Human Services departments, as well as in the private sector.

But Childress also was involved in the administration's behind-the-scenes strategy for disclosing the IRS scandal. His name surfaced as one of the few White House officials who were in the loop as the Treasury Department and IRS tried to figure out how to come forward with allegations that IRS officials had systematically singled out conservative groups for additional scrutiny.

Childress and others were told about the looming inspector general report by White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler after she was informed on April 24. Childress and his colleagues would have been told several weeks before the IRS went public with the scandal on May 10.

What happened between April 24 and May 10 is not entirely clear. At press briefings in late May, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said not only was Childress looped in by Ruemmler, but he also subsequently had discussions with the Treasury Department about how to release the information.

""This was part of just trying to find out when and under what circumstances this information would be released, made public,"" Carney said.

Carney indicated they discussed a couple possibilities -- IRS official Lois Lerner delivering a speech, or the acting commissioner addressing the issue during congressional testimony.

Neither of those two scenarios ended up happening. Instead, Lerner dropped the bombshell in response to a planted question at a Washington event on May 10. Former IRS Commissioner Steven Miller has since described the handling of the matter on May 10 -- namely, the use of a planted question -- as an ""incredibly bad idea.""

Carney said in late May that the White House did not know what led to that decision, indicating the White House was not involved.

An administration official also told FoxNews.com on Tuesday that Childress was not involved in any discussion about planting the question.

Though Republicans have questioned to what extent White House officials were aware of the targeting, no White House official to date has been implicated in the scandal. Disciplinary action has, so far, been contained to the IRS.

Obama announced Childress as his pick for ambassador to Tanzania shortly after returning from a visit to the African nation."

(CNN) —

For some Republicans, 2016 is 1992: Hating Hillary Clinton is chic again. Only more so, since the former secretary of state is also the partner of and potential successor to the last two Democratic presidents—Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.

Some of us believe, with good reasons, that the Republicans are “mad-dogging” Hillary Clinton with the Benghazi hearing to damage not only her presidential prospects, but also to damage President Obama’s credibility.

JUSTIN LAROSE/CNN Donna Brazile

Polls show Obama is trusted more than his Washington opponents, especially on the economy. So, to defeat his economic agenda and substitute their own, which has already lost on logic, they’ve decided to undermine Obama’s credibility and authority.

The Benghazi hearing, which House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, orchestrated and planned for months, is a classic “killing two birds with one stone” scenario for Republicans. Or maybe three: They see an opportunity to smear Obama, sabotage Clinton and fundraise like giddy televangelists.

Benghazi hearing chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, said Clinton is not a target of his committee. That doesn’t seem to jibe with statements by GOP Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, among others. And further contradicting Issa’s protestation, the National Republican Congressional Committee was boasting that its Clinton/Benghazi fundraising page was the most successful in its history.

Benghazi is a rather unseemly subject to turn into a political weapon. It’s one thing to try to drag the former secretary of state through the mud. But the Republicans are trying to drag her through blood – blood that’s tainted with partisan politics. The Republicans cut the funding for embassy security by $128 million in 2011 and $331 million in 2012. Clinton warned that doing so would be “detrimental to national security.” Republicans scoffed then, scream now.

Obama called the Benghazi hearing a circus. He’s right. It’s not a transparent, due process hearing. Democrats have complained they were excluded from much of the investigations, weren’t allowed to call witnesses or to look at documents.

As Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland and ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said Wednesday after the White House’s release of approximately 100 pages of e-mails relating to the attacks in Benghazi: “These documents undercut the reckless accusations by Republicans that the White House scrubbed the Benghazi talking points for political reasons and in fact show just the opposite—that the primary goal was to protect the FBI’s ongoing criminal investigation and our nation’s intelligence operations.”

Chaffetz: Obama has explaining to do on Benghazi

A transparent, due-process hearing would call the witnesses who would testify that the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli mistakenly believed Katibat Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi had claimed credit for the attack. The group didn’t make the claim and later denied any role. But that was an on-the-ground, in-the-moment embassy mistake. (While no friend of the United States, the Benghazi al-Sharia organization has not, so far, been implicated in terrorist activity.)

It came from mistaken identity: There were two distinct and unrelated Ansar al-Sharia militant groups in Libya. Even Fox News interviewed an expert, J. Peter Pham of the Atlantic Council, who said these groups have no formal affiliation with each other. They are grass-roots up organizations, whereas al Qaeda organizes from the top down.

It is suspected that the Ansar al-Sharia in Derna was involved in the attack in Benghazi that killed four Americans. Its leader is a former prisoner at Guantanamo who was released under the Bush administration and deported to Libya for jail. Gadhafi later released him.

In a transparent hearing we would learn that the Republicans’ chief witness, Deputy Chief of Mission Gregory Hicks, was likely, even today, in error about which Ansar al-Sharia was involved. It is the difference between a local militant militia group and professional terrorists.

Hicks clearly was referring to the Benghazi al Sharia when he testified about his concern that Ambassador Chris Stevens was taken to the hospital that the Benghazi group then guarded. But, this week the same hospital was bombed; the rival al-Shaira group in Derna, with al Qaeda links, is a reasonable suspect.

Getting the facts right matters. Getting the truth matters. Posturing for propaganda points not only misleads us, it endangers us. For whatever the Benghazi hearings are about, they’re not about learning the lessons from this tragedy and improving securities at American embassies and other facilities overseas.

They are, in fact, a partisan campaign fundraiser for the Republican Party, and not a fact-finding inquiry to help the State Department and military correct their mistakes.

Karl Rove’s American Crossroads super PAC has already taken on Hillary Clinton, spending megabucks on a 2016 attack ad that savages her judgments. Some Republicans, to their credit, can’t stomach any more from their fellow Republicans.

Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, a Republican, appeared on CBS’ “Face the Nation” and said he would have handled Benghazi just as Obama handled it. He added a flat, “No” that he did not think Hillary Clinton would be involved in any kind of a cover-up.

Bill Kristol, conservative editor and commentator, told Fox News Sunday, “I wish the Republicans would just be quiet for a while and that the partisan Republican groups that are fundraising off this would be quiet … for a while … and let’s find out what really happened.”

Amen.

Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison followed by three years probation by a federal judge in Washington on Wednesday for misusing about $750,000 in campaign funds.

Jackson's wife, Sandra, was also sentenced Wednesday. She will serve one year in prison and was ordered to pay $22,000 in restitution, after pleading guilty to a related charge of filing false tax returns. U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is not related to the Jacksons, allowed the couple to stagger their sentences so their children would have at least one parent at all times. Jackson Jr. will go to prison first, followed by Sandra.

Jackson Jr. pleaded guilty in February to using campaign funds to purchase an array of personal items, including Bruce Lee memorabilia, a $43,000 Rolex watch and a mink cashmere cape.

Jackson, the son of the civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, made an emotional plea to the judge Wednesday, wiping his eyes and blowing his nose as he asked the judge for some leniency. He apologized to his constituents and his family.

""If probation is not available to her, give me her time,"" Jackson said, referring to his wife. He said he needed to be ""as far away from everybody for a while that I could be.""

Reid Weingarten, Jackson's defense attorney, asked for an 18-month sentence for his client and argued that there were ""not widows and orphans surrounding the courthouse"" wanting Jackson's head. Weingarten said that there was a time when members of Congress could treat their campaign funds as retirement accounts. ""This is not Madoff, this is not a ponzi scheme,"" Weingarten said.

But a federal prosecutor handling the case called Jackson's fraud one of the most significant abuses of the campaign system that has ever been documented and prosecuted. The government asked for four years in prison.

U.S. District Judge Jackson said the Jacksons used the campaign as a ""personal piggybank,"" but said she was confident that ""there will be another chapter"" for Jackson Jr. But the judge said that while Jackson did not pose a threat to society, a significant jail sentence was necessary to serve as a deterrent to other politicians who might consider raiding their campaign coffers for personal gain.

""The ethical standard has got to be simply higher than unindicted,"" Judge Jackson said. She said she would have trouble explaining a probation sentence to the donors whose campaigns funds the couple misused.

Judge Jackson said that the fact that the couple had two young children did not mean that Sandra Jackson could get off with just probation.

""It is not the court that put your children in this position,"" Judge Jackson said. ""It is not the government that put your children in this position,"" she added, calling the prison sentence ""survivable.""

Jackson Jr. will have to forfeit $750,000, but Judge Jackson ruled against a government request that the Chicago Democrat additionally pay $750,000 to the defunct campaign fund. The DOJ's request, Judge Jackson said, made no sense and served no purpose, calling the plan ""impractical and unworkable"" to create a ""new campaign from scratch"" without any clear goal.

“Jesse Jackson Jr.’s journey from the halls of Congress to federal prison is a tragedy of his own making,” U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen said in a statement. “Jackson’s political potential was unlimited, but he instead chose to treat his campaign account as a personal slush fund, stealing from the people who believed in him so he could live extravagantly. He squandered his great capacity for public service through outright theft. The prison sentence imposed today should serve as a wake-up call to other public officials who believe there are no consequences for betraying the public trust.”

Jackson Jr. made brief comments to reporters and cameras waiting outside the federal courthouse.

""I still believe in the power of forgiveness. I believe in the power of redemption. Today I manned up and tried to accept responsibility for the error of my ways, and I still believe in the resurrection,"" Jackson Jr. said before boarding an awaiting SUV.

Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) suggested Sunday that the IRS' targeting of conservative groups during the 2012 presidential campaign undermines the election's credibility, accusing President Barack Obama's administration of ""blatantly lying to the American people"" and questioning whether the agency would ""deny"" health care coverage for conservatives.

“We learned that during an election, [Obama] interfered with the First Amendment rights of conservatives and tea party members by intimidating and harassing these organizations,” Bachmann, who unsuccessfully ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, said in an interview with conservative website World Net Daily. “Once again, it appears the Obama administration is blatantly lying to the American people... People can right ask questions [about] the credibility of the elections.""

On Friday, the IRS admitted to engaging in ""inappropriate"" targeting of conservative political groups during the 2012 election. Agents singled out groups with ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their applications for tax-exempt status, as well as organizations that took issue with ""how the country is being run.""

Bachmann said agency claims that no high-level officials were involved with developing the criteria for extra scrutiny are ""laughable.""

“The Obama administration wants us to believe low-level functionaries are the ones responsible for making this decision,” she said. “That is impossible, laughable. I can tell you within the IRS, the agency is very sensitive of jurisdictional authority.""

The Republican congresswoman pointed to the IRS' role in the implementation of Obama's signature health care reform law as another potential area for concern, claiming that it is ""reasonable"" to ask whether the agency will ""will deny or delay access to health care"" for conservatives.

""We learned to our horror in Benghazi it appears that every move that was made was based on politics,"" she said. “Now it appears the president was willing to use the most feared agency in the U.S. for his own political purposes.""

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) also tied the IRS scandal to the Affordable Care Act.

""[Obama] has a huge problem, because Obamacare relies very heavily on the IRS,"" Gingrich said during a Monday appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""Why would you trust the bureaucracy with your health if you can't trust the bureaucracy with your politics?"""

The resolution was introduced by Rep. Pete Olson, R-Texas, who claims Holder has committed “the offenses of lying to Congress, refusing to comply with a subpoena, and failing to fulfill his oath of office.”

Olson cites Holder’s unwillingness to cooperate during the investigation into the botched Operation “Fast and Furious, his refusal to prosecute those involved IRS targeting of conservative groups, his failure to enforce laws including the Defense of Marriage Act, and his “false testimony” about the DOJ’s monitoring of Fox News journalist James Rosen as articles that are grounds for impeachment.

“For nearly five years, Attorney General Holder has systematically deceived Congress and destroyed the credibility of the Justice Department in the eyes of the American people,” Olson said in a statement.

Olson was joined by 19 other Republican representatives in the resolution.

One House Democrat spoke out against the resolution before it was introduced Thursday, calling it “the most fundamental abuse of the impeachment power.”

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a former federal prosecutor who led the Senate in the impeachment of a federal judge in 2010, said the articles of impeachment in the resolution are simply a list of “debunked conspiracy theories.”

“It is the height of irresponsibility to use the Congress's power to impeach office holders – a power that has been used very rarely and judiciously – to settle political scores,” Schiff said. “The House Republican Leadership should disavow this misguided effort immediately; it is far more damaging to Congress and its impeachment authority than to anyone in the administration.”

There’s only one problem: both Republican and Democrat Congresspeople say that isn’t true. On Friday afternoon, the press office for Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), one of the authors of the Patriot Act, tweeted, “Obama’s claim that ‘every Member of Congress’ was briefed is FALSE.”

It wasn’t just Sensenbrenner. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) said that only certain members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees had been told about the program, and he only knew about it because he received “special permission” to be briefed after hearing about it through the grapevine. “I knew about the program,” he said on MSNBC, “because I specifically sought it out. It’s not something that’s briefed outside the Intelligence Committee.” Merkley added that the administration had ignored the law. “Clearly the administration has not followed what an ordinary person would consider to be the standard of the law here,” he said.

Merkely summed up: “when the president says all members of Congress were briefed … well, I think a very small number of Senators in Congress had full details on these programs.”

Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) said he only knew about the program after asking for a briefing under “classified circumstances.” The “average member,” he said, had no access to this information. “They don’t receive this kind of briefing.”

Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Jim Inhofe (R-OK) said they had not been briefed on the phone surveillance program, either. “Not quite!” Rep. Billy Long (R-LA) tweeted after hearing about Obama’s claim.

Obama’s claim was not a slip of the tongue. On Friday, Obama’s White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, “In December of 2009 and in February of 2011, the Department of Justice and the intelligence community provided a document to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees to be made available to all members of the House and Senate, describing the classified uses of Section 215 in detail.”

The list also includes shirts, pens, sculptures, quite a few rugs (way to think outside the box, Afghan leaders!), the occasional flavored liquor, a deluxe package of items linked to the Polish-made video-game ""Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings"" and one small sword.

The State Department’s office of the chief of protocol on Friday released the list of presents American government officials received from foreign government officials.

[Related: Search and sort all gifts to Obama, Biden and their families.]

Not to worry: The Obamas won’t be keeping the $52,695 gift from Ali Bongo Ondimba, president of the Gabonese Republic. Like most of the items bestowed on the first couple, Ondimba's gift—a “14″ blue mask sculpture by Daum, on a 10″ black and silver stand, enclosed in 34″ x 16″ x 13″ red box” is at the National Archives. The U.S. requires all such gifts to be reported and turned over to the archives or other institutions for display. These are not, in short, bribes.

From the list, it appears that the only thing Obama ""personally retained"" from his 2011 haul is the book “Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World,” by Jack Weatherford. The president received that work, which retails for $23.95 on Amazon, from his Mongolian counterpart, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj.

Next to each item is an entry entitled ""circumstances justifying acceptance."" For gifts to the Obamas, it reads: ""Non-acceptance would cause embarrassment to donor and U.S. government.""

Gifts to the first family totaled $243,970.96. Of that, items for the president himself totaled $194,125.33; those to the first couple ran $21,438.78; those to the first lady were $22,343.59; and those to daughters Malia and Sasha, $6,063.26.

Story continues

A Yahoo News review of the gifts shows no obvious thread—not like in 2004, when George W. Bush received a bunch of guns, including a $10,000 sniper's rifle, and a ""Worst-Case Survival Handbook."" But golf is a big theme for this president, and there are some standouts. The second most-pricey present appears to have come from Sergio Cabral, governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Cabral gave Obama a photograph by artist Vik Muniz entitled ""Marat (Sebastiao)."" Declared value? $40,000. (Symbolic value? Potentially priceless: Jean-Paul Marat was a radical journalist during the French Revolution. He was murdered in his bathtub.)

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk showed off his hometown pride by giving Obama a lavish package with ""Witcher 2""-themed presents and Polish vodka. Here's how the chief of protocol describes the loot:

DVD, title: “Best of the Witcher 2: Video Trailers for President Barack Obama,” distributor: Atari. Zubrowka Bison Grass Vodka. Book, title: “Blood of Elves,” by Andrzej Sapkowski. Book, title: “The Last Wish,” by Andrzej Sapkowski. Set of four 2″ x 1.5″ clear glass liqueur glasses, each has “Zubrowka” engraved in white. 13.5″ x 9.75″ x 4.5″ “Witcher 2” gift box, inside are three golden “Witcher 2” coins, a “Witcher 2” book, “Witcher 2” stickers, “Witcher 2” make your own aircraft. 5.5″ x 6.5″ x 3″ ivory-colored bust of “Witcher 2” character “Gwynbleioo,” a DVD box set of “Witcher 2” bonus DVD, Game DVD, and Game Guide. “Witcher 2” playing cards, and 5 wooden die in black sack with “Witcher 2” emblem. 11.75″ x 7″ x 5″ brown leather carrying case with handles and lock. Rec'd—5/28/2011. Est. Value—$497.08.

Then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy and French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy gave Obama the ""large, black Hermes golf accessory bag, including set of lock and key, and extra strap in bottom compartment"" valued at $7,750—but didn't stop there. Non, monsieur. On other occasions, ""Sarko"" and his wife presented Obama with a ""Lacoste white classic men's polo shirt,"" a fountain pen, ""six black glass goblets in a plastic display case"" and a 14""-tall ""blue-gray glass sculpture of Bucephalus, Alexander the Great's horse.""

And in August 2011, with Washington consumed by the debt-ceiling crisis, the Sarkozys again played to Obama's fondness for golf, giving him a ""Crystal golf statuette by Baccarat, depicting a golfer with his iron pitched over his head in the moment before striking a ball. Black Hermes golf travel bag with canvas cover and carrying strap,"" all for an estimated value of $1,650. Were they done? Nope.

In December 2011, they gave Obama a Louis Vuitton ""men's business bag"" embossed with ""B.O."" That was valued at $2,310.

The Sarkozys' generosity didn’t stop there. A Hermes beach towel, a fancy Laguiole letter opener, a reusable grocery tote bag (in case the Obamas don’t want to pay the 5-cent D.C. plastic bag tax?), “his and hers white, belted Dior bathrobes with ‘Dior’ embroidered on the breast pocket,” and one of the more amazing gifts on the list. Take it away, State Department chief of protocol:

17″ tall Plexiglas sculpture, entitled “Wrapping Flag Candy USA,” depicting an upright “Tootsie Roll” with an American flag patterned wrapper, on a 6″ x 6.75″ x 0.75″ clear Plexiglass base, accompanied by a certificate of authenticity.

If you think the good people at the chief of protocol’s office struggled with that one, check out their description of the $778 present from South Korean President Lee Myung-back and first lady Kim Yoon-ok

11″ x 14.5″ x 7″ Korean, black lacquer jewelry box with mother of pearl inlay that depicts landscapes and birds, and has bureau-style doors with turtle-shaped doorknobs on the front and a drawer below, with an inner compartment that has three smaller drawers on the left and a section for hanging necklaces on the right.

Note to members of Congress: If Obama gives you a 9.5” by 12” signed and framed photo of Denmark’s queen and its prince, he’s regifting.

The Philippines ambassador and his wife gave Obama the bamboo bicycle ($1,060). German Chancellor Angela Merkel also thought “golf!” She gave Obama a $1,400 care package comprising a “Kramski putter set, includes: 35″ HPP 340 putter with two protective club head covers, teal HPT 40 training console, HPS 30 Aim Aid set, book title: 'The Kramski Putt Philosophy.'""

You know what Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, probably didn’t hear from Obama? Anything resembling “Oh, I already have one just like it.” The emir gave Obama a “30″ circumference gold and silver base with silver statues of two wild goats and a tree with gold clock hanging from it, depicting a desert scene.”

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper seems to have been the only one to zero in on Obama’s other sports passion: basketball.

Harper gave Obama a basketball signed by the 2010-2011 Toronto Raptors.

The list also includes items to Vice President Joe Biden and other officials.

Three Senate Democrats, Jon Tester of Montana, Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Carl Levin of Michigan, each received silver Janbiyas from Dr. Rashad Mohamed Al-Alimi, the deputy prime minister for security forces of the Republic of Yemen. Janbiyas are thick, ornate knives that curve at the blade commonly worn at the belt.

BOB%3A Politicians in Washington today are too quick to use the word %22scandal.%22

CAL%3A The entire city of Washington%2C no matter which party is in the majority%2C is one big scandal.

Cal Thomas is a conservative columnist. Bob Beckel is a liberal Democratic strategist. But as longtime friends, they can often find common ground on issues that lawmakers in Washington cannot.

CAL: It's amusing to hear Washington politicians and much of the news media selectively use the word ""scandal."" They seem to be appealing to a standard for judging right and wrong that they have abandoned in most other categories.

BOB: Politicians in Washington today are too quick to use the word ""scandal."" Scandal used to refer to big things with serious consequences, things like Watergate, which brought down a sitting president. That was a big scandal. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa — a Republican, of course — has held two hearings on Benghazi, Libya, and come up with absolutely nothing except bad communication by the administration. Issa should wrap up his investigation.

CAL: Bad communication? That sounds Nixonian. Watergate was called a ""third-rate burglary"" by the Nixon White House. When Republicans are in power, Democrats constantly uncover scandals, but when Democrats are in power, scandalous behavior is dismissed by Democrats as phony. It's one of the things normal people — meaning those who don't live in Washington — hate about this town. Instead of performing their constitutional duties, politicians spend too much time (when they're not vacationing) smearing each other.

BOB: There have been plenty of Republican efforts to go to the extreme scandal zone. Impeaching Bill Clinton was a classic example. Fortunately, the Senate had enough sense to acquit Clinton, and the American people were behind him in huge numbers. Republicans just don't get that their idea of scandal is not what the average American thinks is a serious scandal.

CAL: If you ask me, the entire city of Washington — no matter which party is in the majority — is one big scandal.

BOB: You may have a point.

CAL: Applying the old standard for judging behavior, many policies and actions by members of this administration need scrutiny. Label them what you will. First and foremost is what in shorthand is now simply called ""Benghazi."" That several survivors of last year's attack on the U.S. mission have reportedly been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements and receive regular polygraph tests to ensure they don't talk to the news media and Congress is scandalous. The relatives of the dead deserve to know what happened to their loved ones, as does the public. Benghazi victim Sean Smith's mother says President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton promised her the truth, but she says she has not been told anything.

BOB: Non-disclosure and polygraph tests are standard procedures for the CIA. Darrell Issa has had everyone in the chain of command up before his committee and has not found a smoking gun. The only question that remains is who gave the final word to stand down. The idea of taking CIA operatives out of the field to testify before Congress jeopardizes them and will contribute little to what Congress already knows.

CAL: This sounds to be like a major coverup in part to ease the path of Hillary Clinton's expected run for president. It was on her watch this happened, and her dismissive ""What difference does it make?"" comment before a congressional panel is scandalous in its own right.

BOB: Cal, by 2016, the American people will have forgotten Benghazi. The idea that this was a strategy for Hillary Clinton and 2016 is absurd. Strategies like this are complicated and require numerous people to make them work. Do you really believe that if this were a strategy, it wouldn't have leaked by now? Come on. You've been here long enough to know the difference.

CAL: I've been here long enough to realize things aren't always what they at first appear to be.

BOB: I'll grant you that, but not in this case.

CAL: Other scandals include the Justice Department obtaining phone records of Associated Press reporters and editors as well as Fox News reporter James Rosen; the IRS targeting conservative groups when they applied for tax-exempt status; Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius possibly violating the Hatch Act by soliciting contributions from agencies HHS might regulate to help sign up uninsured people for ObamaCare ...

BOB: Are you finished? This is starting to resemble a filibuster.

CAL: Not yet, because the list is long and growing. There is also ""Fast and Furious,"" in which the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sent guns to Mexico in hopes of tracing them to drug cartels, only to see them used to kill a U.S. border agent; and the Pigford scandal, in which the Department of Agriculture, in an effort to compensate black farmers who had been discriminated against by the agency, paid billions in cash to thousands of additional minority and female farmers who didn't face discrimination. There's more.

BOB: Each of these has been investigated by a Republican House of Representatives. As far as I can tell, it came up with nothing that was unlawful or significant enough to remove people from office. If politicians of both parties would spend more time legislating and less time attacking each other, we would all be better off.

CAL: I agree with that in principle, Bob, but Congress has a constitutional responsibility to provide oversight of the executive branch. Not everything has to be illegal to be a scandal. Most Americans, I think, would prefer leadership that behaves responsibly with our money and with the power and privilege we entrust to them. As James Madison said, ""If men were angels, no government would be necessary."" And we know angels, whether Republicans or Democrats, are not often seen in Washington. Politicians need to be watched.

On Wednesday night, during a lecture at Loyola University Chicago, I asked Jones what he meant. He explained that while President Obama is not a socialist, he is, in fact, a “communitarian.”

After a long recapping of the first four years of the Obama’s presidency, Jones elaborated:

It’s very interesting to see him now, actually, free.

Watching this man for four years, for everything he’s done to try to reach out to the other side, and frankly neglect his base, has just been called socialism, and just been called divisive, no matter what he does.

I was happy to see him unleashed and unchained and just be able to speak from his heart.

And what he said was, similar to what I’ve been saying, there is a “New Patriotism.”

(The rest of Jones’s answer is here.)

Jones compared the president’s address to that of Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and recommended that the theater full of college students read Reagan’s “powerful” and “strong,” inaugurals, which he said were “rooted in American tradition and values,” but “unabashedly” and “unapologetically conservative.”

Following Jones’s comparison of President Obama to Ronald Reagan, the “unabashedly conservative” president, I pressed Jones further for some insight into what and who President Obama really is.

Jones replied: “He is a communitarian.” He then elaborated briefly: “I mean you always have individualism, communitarianism, as a part of the, American story, and I think we’ve overbalanced the individualistic direction and I think he’s trying to rebalance toward communitarianism.”

Later, when asked (off tape) to define “communitarian,” Jones was unable to answer or to point toward any source for a definition. He said there wasn’t really a way to look up “communitarianism.”

He did reiterate, however, that he saw communitarianism as a counterbalance to libertarianism, which he equated to “individualism.”

Jones declined an interview with Breitbart News following the lecture.

-- Jay Leno on “The Tonight Show,” July 26.

President Obama hasn’t faced reporters in a solo press conference since April, and what a busy hundred days he’s had since then.

After multiple efforts to change the discussion away from scandals and controversies that have marred the start of his second term, Obama is still facing plenty of unanswered questions about his expansion of domestic surveillance programs, abuses at the IRS and Department of Justice, and doctored talking points about an Islamist raid on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya.

FOX News pollsters inquired about the president’s “phony scandals” and found that voters disagree in great numbers.

Daily politics news delivered to your inbox: sign up for our newsletter

On the snooping by Justice Department lawyers into reporter records? 59 percent say it’s a “serious situation.” The same portion thought targeting of political groups by the IRS was serious. On recent revelations about Obama’s expansions of domestic surveillance? 69 percent disagree with the president. On the Islamist raid on the Benghazi outpost and subsequent changes to official talking points? 78 percent say it’s for real.

Obama’s effort to dismiss and diminish those concerns as “phony scandals” having failed, the president is in for a rough time (at least by his standards).

It’s no wonder, then, that the president has picked a Friday afternoon in August just ahead of his vacation to meet the press. Even considering the “members bounce” Obama gets around the green with the press corps, there’s going to be lots of difficult subjects to discuss. The plan here is to get Obama on the record and then off to Martha’s Vineyard and to do so at a moment when much of Official Washington is gone. Call this a Herb Tarlek press conference: It’s a turkey drop.

[pullquote]



Aside from going on the record about new revelations about the scandals, like where he was during the Benghazi raid, Obama will have other pressing controversies to address.

What about the growing list of logistical problems for the president’s signature health care law?

Obamacare remains ultra unpopular. The latest FOX News poll shows majorities of voters believe the law will increase their taxes (71 percent), their insurance costs (62 percent) and federal deficits (65 percent), while saying by a 2-to-1 margin that the law will decrease the quality of their own health care.

Or the deadlocked negotiations with Republicans in Congress to avert a government shutdown?

While the establishment press has been gorging itself on stories about Republican divisions over how to block spending increases and delay or defund Obama’s health law, the Democrats haven’t enunciated much on the subject other than some muted support for the president’s call for increased taxes and spending, an impossibility on par with the immediate excision of Obamacare.

Some reporters will surely oblige the president by asking about his thoughts and feelings about his standoff with Russian President Vladimir Putin over Putin’s protection of the government contractor who exposed Obama’s spy programs. But there’s too much to talk about in the realms the president wants to avoid for him to filibuster his way through.

The best hope for the White House is that much of what he says gets swallowed up by the August news sinkhole.

And Now, A Word From Charles

“I may be willing to sacrifice a little of my privacy to prevent a 9/11 that killed 3,000 people. But to contribute to a drug war that we are losing anyway is a problematic endeavor in the first place and is deeply corrupt and is not something I would want to do.”

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/02/24/Dictatorship-of-Hypocrites-The-Media-s-Crusade-Against-Cruz,2013-02-24 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],Dictatorship of Hypocrites: The Media's Crusade Against Cruz,"The liberal media have their knives out for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) after his textbook cross-examination of Secretary of Defense nominee Chuck Hagel at the latter’s confirmation hearing Jan. 31. Jane Mayer of the New Yorker seized on a speech Cruz gave three years ago in which he asserted that when he was at Harvard Law School, shortly after Barack Obama, there were twelve Marxists on the faculty and one Republican.

That, Mayer alleges, is evidence of Cruz’s innate McCarthyism–and hence, she implies, ought to discredit Cruz’s inquiries into Hagel’s beliefs and financial backing. That’s rich coming from the New Yorker‘s resident Koch-obsessive, who launched a McCarthyist assault on the Tea Party in 2010, asserting it was mere Astroturf for the “billionaire Koch brothers’ war against Obama,” and demanding more scrutiny of the Kochs’ ties to it.

Her current campaign against Cruz is a pure political vendetta–a fact she does not even try to deny. In her latest offering, she defends her sudden interest in the 2010 speech as follows: “…Cruz’s hostile questioning of Obama’s nominee for Defense Secretary, Chuck Hagel, and insinuations about Hagel’s loyalties had provided a fresh context for looking more closely at the nature of the accusations he has leveled at political opponents.”

In terms of accusations against one’s opponents, it’s hard to top Mayer’s suggestion that millions of conservative Americans are paid stooges–or Obama’s numerous attacks on opponents using false accusations and innuendo. Remember the doctors who cut out kids’ tonsils for no reason except greed? The Republican presidential nominee who just might be a felon, and may have killed a man’s wife? Few complaints from Mayer there.

In fact, Mayer gave positive coverage to the anti-Bain Capital ads that ran against Romney in Ohio. In a post-election article on Nov. 19, 2012, “Seeing Spots,” Mayer noted that the ad about a worker’s dead wife was inaccurate. She nonetheless celebrated the company that made it for another ad in the series, “Stage,” which helped “to float the image of Romney as a coldhearted fat cat” and gave Obama a decisive advantage in the polls.

Cruz was absolutely correct that there were, and are, many radicals on Harvard Law’s faculty, and few Republicans. Give the Texan a technical for hyperbole: he may have over-counted the Communist revolutionaries, and undercounted the Republicans. But Mayer turns to two dubious sources to attack Cruz’s assertion. One is Charles Fried, the former Reagan solicitor general; the other is critical legal studies guru Duncan Kennedy.

Fried was a Republican. He is far to the left of that party today. In 2008, Fried voted for Barack Obama. In 2011, in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he declared that Obamacare’s individual mandate was constitutional–even agreeing that it would be constitutional for Congress to pass a law forcing people to buy vegetables or buy a gym membership. Though it upheld Obamacare, the Supreme Court rejected that argument.

As for Kennedy, he is not a Communist, and says he never “believed in the overthrow of the U.S. Government.” Yet he believes in the undoing of much that sustains our system. of laws and institutions. For example, when I was a student, he once told me that the solution to the problem of illegal immigration from Mexico was to end the border entirely, i.e. to be one country. That would have rather radical implications for our government.

One of Kennedy’s colleagues, Roberto Unger, is a fellow member of the critical legal studies movement. He is not a Communist, but a self-described leftist revolutionary nonetheless. I took two classes with Unger while I was an undergraduate, and he attacked the American “cult of the Constitution,” arguing that the world’s present countries with a new system in which each represented a different (leftist) “moral” vision.

Several members of Harvard Law’s faculty espouse other radical left ideas. They are not card-carrying Communists, but some do see themselves as proponents of different forms of Marxist thought, and would like to see revolutionary changes in both the U.S. government and the international order. Saul Alinsky, too, was not a Communist–but he believed in the radical disruption of our political system and the redistribution of wealth.

Those views are distinguishable from formal Communism only by virtue of the fact that they do not call for a proletarian dictatorship. Our contemporary “social democrats” wish to impose such revolutionary changes through our present political system, transforming our Constitution and our society through democratic means. There are far more of such radical professors at Harvard Law School than those who defend conservative thought.

The media’s crusade against Cruz proves that in Obama’s America, it is considered far worse to accuse someone of being a Marxist than to be one. The same journalists who demand full disclosure of every penny that conservative financiers might have put into lobbying or politics now mock Cruz’s attempt to probe Hagel’s financial disclosures–or the lack thereof, since Hagel has refused to supply much of the requested information.

It is certainly of interest that a man who would lead the Pentagon would have close ties to an organization funded by the Saudi government, the Hariri family, and foreign arms dealers, among others. Had Hagel been chairman of Americans for Prosperity, Mayer would no doubt be clamoring for a full-scale investigation into the Kochs. Instead, she is leading a smear campaign against Cruz, one of the few in D.C. actually doing his job."

Davis Shared In Winning The Pulitzer Prize For Investigative Reporting In']",D.C. Council censures Marion Barry for taking cash payments from city contractors,"Marion Barry, the city’s most well-known and polarizing politician, was censured Tuesday by his D.C. Council colleagues for taking thousands of dollars in cash payments from contractors with business before the city.

The council voted 9 to 4 to strip Barry of his committee chairmanship, with some colleagues describing Barry’s lapse as another mark on the city’s dismal ethics record. In the past two years, three council members have pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges.

For Barry, the censure was the second in three years and another transgression in a checkered political career.

As mayor in 1990, Barry was convicted of cocaine possession. More recently, as a council member, tax troubles resulted in probation. He was censured and stripped of a chairmanship in 2010 for giving a council contract to a girlfriend and directing city funds to nonprofit groups he created and controlled.

After that sanction, Barry lost his leadership post for a year. This time, the earliest Barry could regain a chairmanship is 2015.

Council member Kenyan R. McDuffie (D-Ward 5), who chaired a disciplinary panel that investigated Barry’s conduct, urged the full council to support the committee’s recommendation, saying the seriousness of Barry’s violation and his record of “recidivism” merited a “swift and serious” response from the council.

McDuffie said removing Barry as chairman of the Committee on Workforce and Community Affairs would demonstrate “that a significant violation of the public trust will not be tolerated.”

Barry began a wandering defense of his actions, saying he “cooperated fully” with the panel. He then grew more defiant, questioning the council’s authority to remove his chairmanship.

Council members Vincent B. Orange (D-At Large) and Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) came to Barry’s defense, saying the Board of Ethics and Government Accountability’s decision to fine Barry $13,600 and require ethics training should have concluded the investigation.

“I in no way endorse what Mr. Barry did; he shouldn’t have done it,” Evans said. “But in this case, Mr. Barry recognized that he had done something wrong — came forward with it.”

McDuffie responded that the council “has an obligation, in fact, a duty, to police itself and its own members.”

The Washington Post reported in June that Barry had disclosed accepting two gifts last year totaling $6,800 from D.C. construction companies. D.C. law prohibits gifts from government contractors.

The city’s ethics board investigated and came to a settlement with Barry, who agreed in July to accept a censure from the board and pay a $13,600 fine. The sanction triggered the council investigation.

According to a report issued by the panel, Barry had told Keith Forney, the owner of Forney Enterprises, in early 2012 that he was “experiencing financial difficulty” related to a federal tax lien but “did not overtly ask for money.”

At least one of the cash payments, the report said, was passed from Forney to Barry during a meeting at the Stadium Club, a Northeast Washington strip club co-owned by Forney.

The panel found “insufficient evidence of a quid pro quo arrangement.” Both Barry and Forney told the panel that the payments were not in exchange for any particular act.

Orange proposed reducing the sanction against Barry, allowing him to keep his chairmanship.

Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) opposed the effort to weaken the censure and urged the council to consider how it would look to the public. “We are going to be judged. . . by how we judge a colleague’s conduct.” Mendelson also said the buck stops with Barry’s colleagues, not the ethics board formed in response to recent scandals. “We are in a better position to evaluate our own conduct than anyone else,” he said.

David Grosso (I-At Large), a member of the panel that investigated Barry, also opposed the weakened censure. He said the supposed mitigating factor that Barry disclosed the lapse himself was irrelevant.

The measure failed, 9 to 4, with Orange, Evans and Jim Graham (D-Ward 1) siding with Barry, the same vote as the final tally on censure. Imposing a censure requires a two-thirds vote of the council, or nine of 13 members.

Barry said afterward that he was “not disappointed” in the sanction. “That’s not the only thing in life, to chair a committee,” he said.

Anita Bonds (D-At Large), a longtime friend and former political aide to Barry, sat on the ethics panel and supported the sanction approved Tuesday. But she said Barry would not be marginalized without a committee post.

“He’ll find a way to blossom,” she said.

Mendelson said he would speak with his colleagues before proposing a realignment of committee responsibilities, with council action coming no sooner than Oct. 1."
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/05/14/obama-irs-actions-are-intolerable-and-inexcusable/,2013-05-14 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",Obama: IRS actions are 'intolerable and inexcusable',"8 years ago

(CNN) – President Barack Obama has directed Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to hold accountable those who made mistakes in the Internal Revenue Service's scrutiny of conservative groups.

The president released a statement Tuesday night firmly condemning the IRS' action after a report from the agency's inspector general found that the IRS used ""inappropriate criteria"" to identify potential political applications and then forwarded those applications to a team of specialists for review.



The report found that the criteria resulted in substantial delays in processing of applications and the request of unnecessary information about the groups.

Saying he's ""now had the opportunity"" to look at the report, Obama said the findings are ""intolerable and inexcusable.""

""The federal government must conduct itself in a way that's worthy of the public's trust, and that's especially true for the IRS. The IRS must apply the law in a fair and impartial way, and its employees must act with utmost integrity,"" he said. ""This report shows that some of its employees failed that test.""

Obama has ordered Lew to ensure that each of the inspector general's recommendations are implemented soon, ""so that such conduct never happens again.""

""But regardless of how this conduct was allowed to take place, the bottom line is, it was wrong. Public service is a solemn privilege,"" the president said. ""I expect everyone who serves in the federal government to hold themselves to the highest ethical and moral standards. So do the American people. And as president, I intend to make sure our public servants live up to those standards every day.""

His statement goes further than his comments on Monday about the issue, in which he said ""if"" personnel ""in fact"" did what the IRS admitted it had done, then their mistakes would be considered ""outrageous.""

The president, who has previous decried West as a “jackass” when the rapper famously upstaged Taylor Swift, was interviewed by David Blum for Kindle Singles.

In the interview, Obama spoke about the American Dream, which he opined used to include a good home, job, education and the possibility of higher education. However, he said that these days the likes of Kardashian and West had distorted the American Dream in a way that he believes negatively affects the younger generation.

“I do think what’s shifted is a notion that the wealthier you are, the more conspicuous consumption you engage in. The more successful you are, the more society should stay out of your way as you pursue the bigger house or the fancier jet or the bigger yacht,” Obama said.

“Were there things that all of us might have liked to have? Sure. But partly, I think, there also has been a shift in culture. We weren’t exposed to things we didn’t have in the same way kids these days are. There was not that window into the lifestyles of the rich and famous,” the president said. “Kids weren’t monitoring every day what Kim Kardashian was wearing, or where Kanye West was going on vacation, and thinking that somehow that was the mark of success.”

Jenner, for one, took what he said to heart.

On the Friday episode of her talk show “Kris,” the Kardashian momager, 57, addressed Obama’s quotes regarding her daughter and her daughter’s boyfriend’s affluence with co-host and E! personality Terrence Jenkins.

HOTOS: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West

That’s when Jenner put on her Oprah Winfrey hat.

“‘They’re influencing a generation of youngsters to be obsessed with wealth and celebrity,’” mama bear said, interpreting Obama’s statements.

Kardashian, 32, and West, 36, famously spent $11 million on a 10,000-square-foot home in Bel-Air in January while Kardashian was pregnant. But Kardashian and her daughter North, who was born June 15, is currently residing at her mother’s sprawling Hidden Hills home while she and West tear down and custom rebuild their mansion. They’re reportedly gutting it and taking the Italian-style villa to up to 14,000 square feet.

“It’s really great that people aspire to get a great job... but I wasn’t aware that you could only set the bar so high and that we could only dream so big,” Jenner said after reading the president’s quotes. “I was taught: Dream big, work hard and you could have whatever you wanted.”

The American Dream, ladies and gentleman, as told by the Kardashians.

“I bet the president has some friends with 10,000-square-foot houses and you probably wouldn’t mind going over there, Mr. President while you were asking them to have a party for you when you were campaigning for dollars to run for president,” Jenner said, referring to high-netting, star-studded fundraising parties thrown for him by the likes of A-listers George Clooney and Sarah Jessica Parker.

Jenner said that she thought that it was “kind of remarkable in and of itself” that the president even mentioned her overexposed kin in the first place, yet she still continued.

“I find it so odd that he’s picking on Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. Well, Kanye West, first of all, doesn’t go on vacation. Ever,” Jenner said. “And Kim Kardashian is the hardest-working young lady in the world. She never sleeps, she never stops, she never slows down and works so hard for what she’s got.”

PHOTOS: Kim Kardashian’s relationships and flings

Indeed, Kardashian, the daughter of late O.J. Simpson defense lawyer Robert Kardashian, rose to fame following the bombshell appearance of a homemade sex tape made with R&B singer Ray J. She and her family have worked to move away from that initial notoriety by building a media empire through fashion, cosmetics and their juggernaut reality TV series “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” and its many spinoffs. (Jenner also made the point that they were doing their part to keep the unemployment rate low, saying “KUWTK” alone employs “hundreds and hundreds of people.”)

The enormous family has remained a mainstay in the public eye (and on this particular blog) because of their glitzy lifestyle and accessibility on television and social media, constantly addressing fans and sharing big moments in their private lives. Cases in point, eldest sister Kourtney Kardashian televised part of the birth of her first child and Khloe Kardashian’s whirlwind wedding to ball player Lamar Odom and Kim Kardashian’s nuptials to ball player Kris Humphries were both documented and broadcast as E! special events.

The media maelstrom following Kim Kardashian’s 72-day marriage and extended divorce proceedings from Humphries somewhat tarnished the brand, but Kim’s candid take on the topic and perpetual projects swiftly brushed family scandals under a very luxurious rug. Kardashian’s subsequent romance with the vainglorious “I am a God” rapper was seen as a supernova in the pop culture zeitgeist.

Surely, young America (and E!'s target demographic) paid attention then as it continues to pay attention now. Which brings us back to Jenner talking about Obama.

“I started thinking about her 10,000-square-foot house,” Jenner said. “I thought, wow, her job affords her to live in a 10,000-square-foot house. And I think, if I’m not mistaken, that Mr. President’s job affords him to live in a 55,000-square-foot house. So basically my house would fit in his entry.”

“I just don’t think it’s such a bad thing to want to be our best and do our best and have nice things.”

Perhaps.

But the mainstream cachet this family yields should be questioned now and again. If Kardashian sticking out her tongue in a three-second video could make a flurry of headlines this past week, perhaps we’ve been grossly under-estimating the influence of this American dynasty.

The additional guidelines created by the agency were part of a timeline, obtained by Fox News, from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, which is looking into the controversial IRS practice. IRS officials apologized Friday for the scrutiny, but new information suggests senior leaders were apprised of the effort as early as 2011 despite public denials from the top.

Republican lawmakers have vowed to investigate and hold hearings, calling the revelations deeply troubling.

""The conclusion that the IRS came to is that they did have agents who were engaged in intimidation of political groups,"" Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers told ""Fox News Sunday.""

The House Ways and Means Committee plans to hold a hearing Friday, Fox News has learned. A top Democrat -- Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus -- also said Monday that his committee would launch a ""full investigation"" into the matter.

""These actions by the IRS are an outrageous abuse of power and a breach of the public's trust. Targeting groups based on their political views is not only inappropriate but it is intolerable,"" the Montana Democrat said in a statement. ""Americans expect the IRS to do its job without passion or prejudice. We need to get to the bottom of what happened here. ... The IRS will now be the ones put under additional scrutiny.""

President Obama weighed in as well, saying at a press conference Monday that if the reports are true, ""then that's outrageous and there's no place for it -- and they have to be held fully accountable.""

Obama said he first found out about the practice on Friday. He said that if agents behaved in a partisan fashion, ""I've got no patience with it. I will not tolerate it.""

The internal IG timeline shows a unit in the agency was looking at Tea Party and ""patriot"" groups dating back to early 2010. But it shows that list of criteria drastically expanding by the time a June 2011 briefing was held. It then included groups focused on government spending, government debt, taxes, and education on ways to ""make America a better place to live."" It even flagged groups whose file included criticism of ""how the country is being run.""

By early 2012, the criteria were updated to include organizations involved in ""limiting/expanding government,"" education on the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and social economic reform.

Taken together, the findings of the IG and the initial admissions by the IRS Friday are fueling complaints from Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Evidence that the IRS was flagging such groups in 2011 was included in a draft inspector general's report obtained Saturday by Fox News and other news organizations and expected to be released in full later this week.

That information seemingly contradicts public statements by IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman, who told congressional investigators in March 2011 that specific groups were not being targeted.

Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins on Sunday also called the IRS activities chilling and said she was disappointed that President Obama had not condemned the actions.

""This is truly outrageous and it contributes to the profound distrust that the American people have in government,"" Collins told CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""It is absolutely chilling that the IRS was singling out conservative groups for extra review. And I think that it's very disappointing that the president hasn't personally condemned this.""

At about the same time, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney released a statement saying: ""If the inspector general finds that there were any rules broken or that conduct of government officials did not meet the standards required of them, the president expects that swift and appropriate steps will be taken to address any misconduct.""

Michigan Republican Rep. Dave Camp, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said Friday his committee will hold a hearing on the issue.

The IRS said Friday that it was sorry for what it called the ""inappropriate"" targeting of the conservative groups during the 2012 elections.

Lois G. Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt organizations, said the practice was initiated by low-level workers in Cincinnati and was not motivated by political bias.

But on June 29, 2011, Lerner found out that such groups were being targeted, according to the inspector general's report.

She was told at a meeting that groups with ""Tea Party,"" ""Patriot"" or ""9/12 Project"" in their names were being flagged for additional and often burdensome scrutiny, the report states.

The 9/12 Project is a group started by conservative TV personality Glenn Beck.

Collins also said she does not believe the activity was limited to ""a couple of rogue IRS employees.""

""After all,"" she added, ""groups with `progressive' in their names were not targeted similarly.""

Over the years, Vice President Biden has shown he has an interesting way with words.

When President Obama signed his signature Affordable Care Act into law, the microphones caught an exuberant Biden tossing an expletive to describe the magnitude of the moment. In remarks honoring Ireland's Prime Minister Brian Cowen, he said the premier's mother had passed away, when she was very much alive. And during this campaign season, Biden raised Republican ire when he told a largely African-American audience in Virginia that Mitt Romney and the Republican party are going ""to put y'all back in chains.""

Earlier today, Biden delivered another cringe-worthy moment as he posed for photos with newly sworn-in senators and their families.

When a photographer told the husband of Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., to drop his hands to his sides, Biden chimed in, ""Spread your legs: You're going to be frisked."" The vice president then explained, ""You say that to somebody in North Dakota, they think it's a frisk.""

""They think you're in trouble, right?"" he asked Heitkamp's husband, Darwin Lange.

Lange shrugged at the awkward moment, while Heitkamp laughed through the short photo session

""I'm a little too formal, I know,"" Biden added.

Throughout the photo shoot with lawmakers, Biden—a veteran of the upper chamber—was jovial with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, and he took extra moments to chat up the mothers and children of the newly-minted senators.

He joked with a fit relative of Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., that he could help him work on his ""pecks."" With the family of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, he was quick with a joke when the senator's toddler fussed as the vice president held her.

""It's a Democrat, I know,"" Biden cooed."

The Arizona Republic

Zirbel has written two self-published books on the assassination

He believes Lyndon B. Johnson and his associates in Texas were behind killing

Zirbel says public beginning to lose interest in assassination

PHOENIX -- LBJ did it.

He didn't pull the trigger, but he was in the thick of the conspiracy, according to a Scottsdale attorney who has written two books on the subject.

President John F. Kennedy was shot dead in Dallas 50 years ago Friday, and the attorney is certain that Lee Harvey Oswald's only involvement was as the fall guy.

On a recent morning, Craig Zirbel is sitting at a nondescript office in the Scottsdale Airpark, behind a desk that he says once belonged to Joseph McCarthy, the Wisconsin senator famous for his claims that Communists had infiltrated the government.

Zirbel has written two books on the Kennedy assassination, and, McCarthyesque government conspiracies aside, he says the public has but two choices on deciding what to believe about that November day: Either Lee Harvey Oswald, a man with no motive did it, or another theory must be devised.

A majority of people, according to polls, believe the conspiracy idea and have for a long time.

Zirbel delivers his conclusions with enthusiasm, waving his arms and raising his voice.

""I don't believe Oswald pulled the trigger,"" Zirbel says.

The attorney has been interested in the assassination for a long time.

Zirbel was in third grade when Kennedy was killed. He got a copy of the Warren Commission report on the assassination a year later, shortly after it was published. He says he did not understand much of it at the time, but he maintained his interest over the years.

The report, based on an investigation by a select government committee, concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy. That has been the official finding ever since.

But that has not stopped conspiracy theories from persisting.

Zirbel has self-published two books on the subject, ""The Texas Connection"" in 1991 and ""The Final Chapter on the Assassination of John F. Kennedy"" in 2010. The titles have been well-received by some people, criticized by others — typical of the contentious and eccentric world of Kennedy conspiracy theorists.

One of them, political strategist Roger Stone, is the author of ""The Man Who Killed Kennedy: The Case against LBJ,"" which came out this year.

""Craig Zirbel did some of the earliest and most important seminal work on LBJ's involvement in the murder of JFK,"" Stone said in an email. ""I have used his book, 'The Texas Connection,' with attribution. I have tried to build on the solid foundation built by Zirbel.""

Not all assassination buffs agree. It is easy to find numerous commentators who believe Zirbel misinterpreted some of the data.

The title of the book gives away Zirbel's position: that Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and his associates in Texas were behind the assassination.

If Oswald did not pull the trigger — and Zirbel provides a list of reasons he believes he did not — then the explanation becomes more elusive.

Those who have interest in the case know the scenarios:

-- The Central Intelligence Agency, perhaps upset by changes in the agency that followed the failed Bay of Pigs invasion aimed at ousting Fidel Castro from leadership in Cuba.

-- The Mafia, arguably because of law-enforcement moves against organized crime by the Kennedy administration.

-- Anti-Castro Cuban exile groups, upset by the Bay of Pigs failure, perhaps working closely with the previous two groups.

-- Others, including the military industrial complex, a government agency such as the FBI, Southern segregationists, the Soviet Union or American conservatives.

Zirbel makes the case that Johnson, and only Johnson, had the motive, the means and the opportunity to mount a conspiracy against the president.

The motive: political gain. There were political differences, personal issues, Johnson's involvement in several scandals and his desire to become president before he got too old.

The opportunity: Kennedy's visit to LBJ's home turf in Texas. Johnson and his associates controlled many of the trip's details.

The means: shots by multiple gunmen firing from the direction of the now infamous grassy knoll. Hired perhaps by Johnson associates in the oil business, who had ties to the Mafia, Zirbel insists, there were at least two shooters.

He also emphasizes that as president, Johnson had the means to block any serious investigation.

And Oswald? His movements, his statements and his background make no sense if he was the lone gunman, Zirbel says. Even the site of the fatal shots was out of whack: Oswald would have had a much easier target several seconds earlier, as the motorcade slowed to turn twice, Zirbel notes.

It's the awkward turns, rather than the otherwise direct route the motorcade took, that strikes Zirbel.

""It's the thing that blows my mind away,"" he says. ""It's the first time a route ever was changed from what the Secret Service had established.""

The revised route took the motorcade directly past the Texas School Book Depository building and Dealey Plaza, site of the grassy knoll, from which many theorists believe the shots were fired.

Zirbel says John Connally, then Texas governor, had insisted upon the arrangement. Connally was an ally of Johnson. He, in fact, lost a fight over motorcade seating arrangements, was forced to ride with Kennedy and was wounded in the shooting.

Zirbel also points to statements by two known participants in his conspiracy: Oswald, who shouted, ""I'm a patsy!"" to nearby reporters at the Dallas jail, and Oswald's killer, Jack Ruby, who was quoted as saying, ""If you knew the truth, you'd be amazed.""

But it has been 50 years, and no conclusive evidence has emerged. Zirbel says the public is beginning to lose interest in the assassination. He says he never had interest in the ""minutae,"" and is losing interest generally.

He has begun to sell off his assassination memorabilia, including his replica of the car the president was riding in that fateful day. Media calls have slowed down, too, bumping back up only because of the significance of the anniversary.

He still wants the public to see the case for what it is.

""All I want to get out,"" he says, ""is that there was no lone assassin, and there was a conspiracy.""

He and his like-minded investigators in the field have to be gratified with their efforts, although the numbers have slipped over the last decade.

According to a recent survey from the Associated Press, conducted in mid-April, 59 percent of Americans think multiple people were involved in a conspiracy to kill the president, while 24 percent think Oswald acted alone, and 16 percent are unsure. A 2003 Gallup poll found that 75 percent of Americans felt there was a conspiracy.

The Oswald-acted-alone results, meanwhile, are the highest since the period three years after the assassination, when 36 percent said one man was responsible for Kennedy's death."
http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/08/20/diagnosis-for-disaster-obamanesia-and-fuhgeddaboudit-president/,2013-08-20 00:00:00,['Jon Kraushar'],Diagnosis for disaster: Obamanesia and a fuhgeddaboudit President,"Near the end of the 2012 election campaign, President Obama accused Mitt Romney of “at least Stage 3 Romnesia”-- which the President described as, “If you can't seem to remember the policies on your website or the promises you've been making over the six years you've been running for president, if you can't even remember what you said last week, don't worry.”

Well, Mr. President, look in the mirror for the faults in yourself that you attributed to Mr. Romney. According to the online Urban Dictionary, “Obamanesia” is, “A questionable commander in chief's partial or total loss of memory regarding the actual sequences of events in an attempt to not take responsibility for them. It is the opposite of Truman's famous phrase: ‘The Buck Stops Here!’ It is a strategy in politics where the one in power attempts to attribute to another person or group the responsibility for one's own lack of leadership or mistakes. Made famous by Barack Hussein Obama's denial of certain emails regarding the Libya incident 2012; after being caught with his pants down, he later tried to pin it on Hillary Clinton.”

A partial list of the president’s acts of “Obamanesia” include:

ObamaCare. The President’s mother of all health care reforms has turned into the mulligan of all health care reforms. Worrying that ObamaCare will hurt Democrats in the 2014 elections, the President keeps amending and delaying it, ignoring his constitutional obligation to fully implement and enforce a law he already signed.

The more we learn about ObamaCare from sources, including the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the more we learn how it will damage job creation (especially full-time jobs) and business growth, cost way more than advertised, grant special exemptions (e.g. to Congress), deny us the choices we were promised to keep our health care plans and doctors, raise taxes, increase our wait time for medical treatments while eroding the quality of care, and cause doctors and hospitals to cut back, or eliminate, services.

[pullquote]

In a recent Fox News poll of American voters, 57 percent said the way ObamaCare is being rolled out is “a joke,” 63 percent said the law needs to be changed, 71 percent believed ObamaCare will increase their taxes, 62 percent believe it will increase the cost of their premiums and 65 percent believe implementing the law will add to the federal deficit. Gallup and Rasmussen Reports polls show similar negativity by American voters concerning ObamaCare’s future impact on their families and the country.

But in his August 17 radio address, the President continued to blame Republicans regarding ObamaCare, rather than accept personal responsibility for the law’s flaws. He said, “A lot of Republicans seem to believe that if they can gum up the works and make this law fail, they’ll somehow be sticking it to me. But they’d just be sticking it to you.”

(Mis)handling of the economy. In a recent Gallup poll of American adults, just 35 percent give the President thumbs up on his leadership regarding the economy. On Townhall.com, columnist Katie Pavlich writes, “While Obama claims America is ‘back,’ 50 million people are on food stamps and 23 million people are unemployed. After claiming the country was on the right track economically, Obama proceeded to blame Republicans for ‘distractions’ and ‘phony’ scandals coming out of Washington.”

Lack of candor on a range of matters. In an ABC/Washington Post poll (in English and Spanish) of American adults, “. . . a vast 74-20 percent see the IRS’ behavior (targeting conservatives) as inappropriate, with most feeling that way strongly -- and 56 percent see it as a deliberate attempt to harass conservative organizations, not a mere administrative error.” The poll also found that “. . . on the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, last fall, suspicions of a coverup rise to a majority, 55 percent. And in this case, only a third of Americans are persuaded that the Obama administration is disclosing honestly what it knows about what occurred.”

Another poll discovery: “Americans by 54-38 percent say they think the government is doing more to threaten the rights of average Americans than to protect those rights. Americans by 69-29 percent in this poll say they’re concerned that in trying to protect classified information the federal government will improperly intrude on the freedom of the press.”

When the President claims that criticisms of him and his policies are partisan and bogus, his attitude can be summed up by another Urban Dictionary definition: of “fuhgeddaboudit.”

1. Forget about it -- the issue is not worth the time, energy, mental effort, or emotional resources.

2. Definitively ""no.""

3. The subject is unequivocally excellent; further thought and analysis are unnecessary.

Is a president with “Obamanesia” who says “fuhgeddaboudit” serving the best interests of the country? Polls indicate no."

(CNN) - After the emergence of photographs showing Secretary of State John Kerry on his 76-foot yacht “Isabel” on Nantucket Sound on Thursday, the State Department issued an embarrassing correction Friday morning, back-tracking and acknowledging that the Secretary was in fact on the yacht on Wednesday, the day the Egyptian military staged a coup against democratically-elected Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy.

Originally, State Department officials were quick to deny a Wednesday tweet from CBS News’ Mosheh Oinounou that: “A @CBSThisMorning producer just spotted Secretary of State Kerry on yacht in the Nantucket Boat Basin. No response when she shouted ‘Morsi.’”

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki issued a statement Wednesday saying “any report or tweet that he was on a boat is completely inaccurate.”

“Since his plane touched down in Washington at 4 am, Secretary Kerry was working all day and on the phone dealing with the crisis in Egypt,” Psaki said. “He participated in the White House meeting with the President by secure phone and was and is in non-stop contact with foreign leaders, and his senior team in Washington and Cairo.”

But overnight, photographs emerged showing Kerry on “Isabel” and taking in some kayaking on Thursday.

The New York Daily News just published some of them.

On Friday morning, Psaki issued a second statement, acknowledging that Kerry was “briefly on his boat on Wednesday.”



Kerry again swamped by nautical controversy

She went on to say that “Secretary Kerry worked around the clock all day including participating in the President’s meeting with his national security council, and calls with Norwegian Foreign Minister Eade, Qatari Foreign Minister al-Attiyah, Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu, Egyptian Constitution Party President ElBaradei and five calls Ambassador Patterson on that day alone and since then he continued to make calls to leaders including Emirati Foreign Minister bin Zayed, Prime Minister Netanyahu and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr.”

An administration official added that none of those calls happened while Kerry was on his boat."

-- Jay Leno on “The Tonight Show,” July 26.

President Obama hasn’t faced reporters in a solo press conference since April, and what a busy hundred days he’s had since then.

After multiple efforts to change the discussion away from scandals and controversies that have marred the start of his second term, Obama is still facing plenty of unanswered questions about his expansion of domestic surveillance programs, abuses at the IRS and Department of Justice, and doctored talking points about an Islamist raid on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya.

FOX News pollsters inquired about the president’s “phony scandals” and found that voters disagree in great numbers.

Daily politics news delivered to your inbox: sign up for our newsletter

On the snooping by Justice Department lawyers into reporter records? 59 percent say it’s a “serious situation.” The same portion thought targeting of political groups by the IRS was serious. On recent revelations about Obama’s expansions of domestic surveillance? 69 percent disagree with the president. On the Islamist raid on the Benghazi outpost and subsequent changes to official talking points? 78 percent say it’s for real.

Obama’s effort to dismiss and diminish those concerns as “phony scandals” having failed, the president is in for a rough time (at least by his standards).

It’s no wonder, then, that the president has picked a Friday afternoon in August just ahead of his vacation to meet the press. Even considering the “members bounce” Obama gets around the green with the press corps, there’s going to be lots of difficult subjects to discuss. The plan here is to get Obama on the record and then off to Martha’s Vineyard and to do so at a moment when much of Official Washington is gone. Call this a Herb Tarlek press conference: It’s a turkey drop.

[pullquote]



Aside from going on the record about new revelations about the scandals, like where he was during the Benghazi raid, Obama will have other pressing controversies to address.

What about the growing list of logistical problems for the president’s signature health care law?

Obamacare remains ultra unpopular. The latest FOX News poll shows majorities of voters believe the law will increase their taxes (71 percent), their insurance costs (62 percent) and federal deficits (65 percent), while saying by a 2-to-1 margin that the law will decrease the quality of their own health care.

Or the deadlocked negotiations with Republicans in Congress to avert a government shutdown?

While the establishment press has been gorging itself on stories about Republican divisions over how to block spending increases and delay or defund Obama’s health law, the Democrats haven’t enunciated much on the subject other than some muted support for the president’s call for increased taxes and spending, an impossibility on par with the immediate excision of Obamacare.

Some reporters will surely oblige the president by asking about his thoughts and feelings about his standoff with Russian President Vladimir Putin over Putin’s protection of the government contractor who exposed Obama’s spy programs. But there’s too much to talk about in the realms the president wants to avoid for him to filibuster his way through.

The best hope for the White House is that much of what he says gets swallowed up by the August news sinkhole.

And Now, A Word From Charles

“I may be willing to sacrifice a little of my privacy to prevent a 9/11 that killed 3,000 people. But to contribute to a drug war that we are losing anyway is a problematic endeavor in the first place and is deeply corrupt and is not something I would want to do.”

“President Obama had another tough week in a second term filled with bad news and blunders — and he’s only 10 weeks in,” Curl wrote. “While the White House suddenly decided to drop its budget Friday in an effort to control the news, there was no covering up the disastrous jobless numbers: 90 million Americans out of the workforce, the highest level since 1979; another 663,000 joining the ranks of the long-term unemployed; a measly 88,000 jobs ‘created.'”

Curl points out though that, while those economic numbers are catastrophic for this administration, “what seems stuck in the craw of a lot of you readers out there” was his column from the week before “on the Obamas’ 1 percent lifestyle — the endless ski and beach vacations for the couple and their daughters, Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s nights in London and Paris that cost you more than $1 million, even the president’s 118th round of golf while in office.”

Most mainstream media outlets completely ignored the report, first broken by Breitbart News, that first daughters Sasha and Malia were vacationing in the Bahamas at the luxurious Atlantis resort for Spring Break. The story starkly exemplified that President Obama decided Secret Service should be used for that vacation and not for ordinary kids’ tours of the White House. To top matters off, for what Curl calls the Obama family’s “royal lifestyle,” Sasha and Malia sprung from the Bahamas to ritzy Sun Valley, Idaho mid-Spring Break week to get in some skiing before heading back to school.

Curl quoted many of his readers, who wrote to him expressing outrage at the way the first family handles themselves–and taxpayer resources–while most other Americans continue hurting economically.

Curl said, too, that Obama’s decision this past week “to forgo 5 percent of his salary” is not any “coincidence.”"
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/07/obama-drone-strikes_n_2830174.html,2013-03-07 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Reporter'],"Obama Has No Authority For Drone Strikes Against Americans On U.S. Soil, White House Says","WASHINGTON -- White House press secretary Jay Carney on Thursday tried to put to rest a simmering debate over President Barack Obama's drone policy, stating in clear terms that the president doesn't have the legal authority to, hypothetically, order drone strikes on Americans on U.S. soil.

During his daily briefing, Carney read aloud a short letter that went out Thursday afternoon from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who waged a 13-hour filibuster on Wednesday over Obama's secret use of drones to carry out targeted killings. Throughout the effort, Paul, along with a dozen other Republican senators, demanded to know whether Obama believed he had the right to order drone strikes on U.S. citizens on U.S soil.

Carney said the answer is no.

""It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: 'Does the president have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?,'"" Carney read aloud. ""The answer to that question is no.""

The administration sparked a furor over the matter earlier this week when, in another letter to Paul, Holder said the administration could technically use military force to kill an American on U.S. soil in an ""extraordinary circumstance"" but has ""no intention of doing so."" Republican outrage peaked with Paul's hours-long filibuster of John Brennan's Senate confirmation to the CIA. The White House stayed mum throughout the filibuster, as did most Senate Democrats.

Carney said Holder's latest letter should ease the ""great deal of confusion"" over the president's authority over drones in the United States, which is ultimately regulated by the Constitution.

""The president has not and would not use drone strikes against Americans citizens on American soil,"" Carney said. ""The legal authorities that exist to use lethal force are bound by, constrained by, the law and the Constitution. The issue here isn't the technology .... Whether it's a drone strike or a gun shot, the law and the Constitution apply in the same way.""

Paul said later that Holder's letter had satisfied his concerns and that he was prepared to let Brennan's nomination vote proceed.

""Hooray!"" Paul said on Fox News, where he learned of the letter and its contents. ""For 13 hours yesterday, we asked him that question. So there is a result and a victory. Under duress, and under public humiliation, the White House will respond and do the right thing.""

Shortly after, Paul said during a CNN appearance that he is ""quite happy"" with Holder's response, and that he only wished it didn't take so long to get an answer.

""I'm disappointed it took a month and a half and a root canal to get it,"" he said.

I am no fan Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA), who chaired yesterday's congressional hearing, or of Senator Lindsay Graham (R-SC), who dramatically claimed the hearing's revelations would be ""every bit as damaging as Watergate."" Congress has muddled the question of whether Hicks is a whistleblower by politicizing Hicks' testimony to the Nth degree, but remove it from the politicization, and the question of whether or not he is a whistleblower is not complicated.

According to the facts reported, Hicks meets the legal definition of a whistleblower.

Contrary to the government's common claims about who is and is not a whistleblower, the government does not get to make that determination. One becomes a whistleblower by operation of law by making a disclosure that reasonably evidences gross waste, fraud, abuse of power, mismanagement, illegality or a danger to health and public safety.

Hicks' testimony disclosed what reasonably evidences abuse of power (misleading the public about the attacks), mismanagement (in responding to the attacks), and danger to health in public safety (his assertions that the U.S. could have sent rescue teams earlier). He also suffered two forms of classic whistleblower retaliation: a demotion and negative performance review."

Pollak'],"White House 'Prison': The Obamas Love the Perks, Hate the Office","First Lady Michelle Obama has raised eyebrows by likening life in the White House to life in a “really nice prison.” Ms. Obama was speaking at the African First Ladies Summit in Tanzania, where she is traveling with President Barack Obama and their daughters. Former First Lady Laura Bush was also in attendance.

It was not the first time that Ms. Obama has complained about life in the White House–which has afforded her the opportunity to travel with her husband on a $60-$100 million trip to Africa, as well as to vacation in Spain and other exotic locales with a large entourage, all the while enjoying Secret Service protection.

President Obama himself has expressed similar sentiments. A mere two weeks after taking office in 2009, he and Ms. Obama escaped to a school in Washington, D.C., explaining: “We were just tired of being in the White House.” The president also plays golf with great frequency, and takes many vacations–alone and with family.

Ms. Obama’s remarks were particularly striking, coming just days after she and her children joined President Obama on a tour of the Robben Island prison facility where Nelson Mandela had been held for two decades. Following the visit, President Obama said that he and his family were “deeply humbled” by their experience.

In his 2012 book The Amateur: Barack Obama in the White House, author Ed Klein said of Obama: “”We come to know a strange kind of politician, one who derives no joy from the cut and thrust of politics, but who clings to the narcissistic life of the presidency.”

It is responsibility, not just politics, that Obama avoids.

Obama’s Africa tour sums up his absentee presidency perfectly. He tries to emulate world figures like Nelson Mandela; he is driven in a motorcade down Barack Obama Drive in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; he gives speeches declaring that he will not meddle in African affairs, as if Libya–and the past four years–never happened.

And yet, even as he takes his family on tours of historic sites and extols the virtues of the African Union, a member of that Union–Egypt–is being rocked by the largest political demonstrations in the history of the world, Obama has had little to say.

The Obamas certainly love the perks of the presidency. But they hate the office."

Editor’s Note: Ken Boehm is chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, based in Falls Church, Virginia. Watch CNN’s “The Truth about the IRS Scandal” this week on “Erin Burnett OutFront,” at 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET.

(CNN) —

America can handle the truth. Even if that truth could include a coverup at the powerful IRS.

The IRS mission statement pledges to “enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all.”

But public scrutiny has revealed details indicating a level of politicization totally at odds with that.

Look at the two eye-opening developments that have happened at the IRS since May: An acting IRS commissioner resigned, and another powerful IRS official refused to answer questions before Congress, pleading the Fifth Amendment.

Whatever is going on, there is only one way to proceed, and that is a professional and thorough investigation.

National Legal and Policy Center Ken Boehm

For people who haven’t been following a lot of this, let me quickly get you up to speed:

The IRS inspector general released a report on May 14 describing how the agency had inappropriately targeted tea party and conservative groups that had applied for tax-exempt status.

Then the IRS put these groups through extra reviews, substantial delays and burdensome requests for information.

The reaction was immediate. The next day, President Barack Obama announced that the acting IRS commissioner was resigning.

That doesn’t exactly happen every day.

Obama went on to say, “I will not tolerate this kind of behavior in any agency, but especially in the IRS, given the power that it has and the reach that it has into all of our lives.”

After that shocking disclosure, several things happened:

• Senate and House committees launched investigations into the scandal.

• The FBI began a criminal investigation.

• The IRS inspector general expanded its ongoing investigation.

• IRS official Lois Lerner exercised her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination by refusing to answer questions before Congress.

Some interesting developments emerged from all that.

For one, the original claim during IRS testimony – that the scandal was the result of a couple of “rogue IRS agents” in the agency’s Cincinnati field office – didn’t hold water.

It turned out that, according to frontline IRS agents in Cincinnati interviewed by House Oversight committee investigators, the Washington IRS office had played a key role in the handling of the tea party applications.

Retired IRS lawyer Carter Hull disclosed in testimony that IRS Counsel William Wilkins was one of his supervisors in the targeting of conservative groups. (The IRS has denied Wilkins’ involvement in the targeting of specific groups.)

The inspector general’s report found that Wilkins’ office had sent the exempt organizations determination unit on April 24, 2012, “additional comments on the draft guidance” for considering applications of tea party groups for tax-exempt status (PDF).

Read the inspector general’s report

The connections between Wilkins’ office and the inappropriate profiling of conservative groups are especially noteworthy because there are only two appointees of the president at the IRS: the commissioner and the chief counsel.

Cynics may view this controversy as typical when the House is in the hands of a different party than the president, but guess what?

The Democrat-controlled Senate’s Finance Committee has also weighed in.

That committee has called for three things: a hearing, an investigation and a request to the IRS for documents.

Montana Democrat Sen. Max Baucus, the committee chairman, stated bluntly, “Targeting groups based on their political views is not only inappropriate, it is intolerable, unacceptable and cannot be allowed.”

Baucus promised a bipartisan investigation and has been true to his word. When the first week of August arrived, Baucus and his GOP counterpart, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, said the IRS failed to provide “most of the information requested by the Committee.”

New details reshape IRS targeting scandal

As chairman of the ethics watchdog group National Legal and Policy Center, I had filed a complaint with the IRS in May 2011 showing that a purported charity called the Barack H. Obama Foundation – named for the father of President Obama and run by his half-brother, Malik Obama – had been raising funds in the U.S. by falsely claiming to be an IRS-approved charitable group.

I submitted proof that the foundation was not tax-deductible and had never even applied for that status despite the fact that it had been fundraising for about three years.

In fact, one of the foundation’s directors admitted that an IRS application had never been submitted.

There was compelling evidence suggesting that the foundation was raising money on the Internet by misrepresenting itself as being IRS-approved when it really wasn’t.

Suddenly, the foundation rushed an application to the IRS in late May 2011.

In the short span of about a month, Lerner – the same person who took the Fifth Amendment rather than testify before Congress – gave the Obama Foundation its tax-deductible status.

And, the IRS made that status retroactive for three years.

Even more curious, several of the forms submitted by Malik Obama were stamped as being received by the IRS in July 2011. That’s one month after Lerner approved the group’s new tax status.

The administration says there’s no political basis for the IRS actions. If that’s true, then it has nothing to lose. Ken Boehm, chairman, National Legal and Policy Center

Generally, the approval process for charitable groups seeking tax-deductible status takes longer than it does for groups that merely want to be tax-exempt, such as most of the tea party groups.

In any case, there’s a good chance this scandal could last a while.

Anyone who follows Washington scandals knows that investigations can take months, sometimes years.

Consider Watergate.

That story broke during the presidential campaign of 1972. The president’s press secretary dismissed it as a third-rate burglary. The investigation was slow because there was an active pushback from the Nixon administration and the people being investigated. The end finally came in August 1974, when President Nixon resigned.

’Enemies list’ won’t be tolerated, says GOP lawmaker

Was there a coverup here, like there was in the Watergate scandal? I have no idea.

But it could easily be argued that there are a lot of signs pointing in that direction: Multiple investigations were cut off; document processing was delayed; a key official took the Fifth Amendment.

McConnell says Obama administration marked by ‘culture of intimidation’

When the issue involves the integrity of an institution as powerful as the IRS, the media and the public are entitled to a thorough, professional investigation.

Anything less leads an already cynical public to become even more cynical. If it comes to the appointment of a special prosecutor, that, I believe, should be reserved as a last resort.

The administration says there’s no political basis for the IRS actions. If that’s true, then it has nothing to lose. Sometimes, though, the truth hurts. But don’t worry. Whatever happens, America can handle it.

Jeremiah Wright — the controversial former pastor to President Barack Obama — was indicted today in an expanding federal probe of a state grant tied to a former suburban police chief.



Jeri Wright of Hazel Crest is accused of helping former Country Club Hills Police Chief Regina Evans convert fake paychecks from Evans’ nonprofit to Evans’ personal use, allegedly hiding money that was supposed to be used to train minority and female workers in the building trades.



Federal prosecutors in the Illinois’ central district say Jeri Wright received about $28,000 in grant-tied paychecks in 2009, but $20,000 of that was deposited back into accounts controlled by Evans. Prosecutors also say Wright then lied to officers and a grand jury.



The charges emerge about a year after Evans was charged with fraud in relation to a $1.25 million job training grant awarded to her nonprofit, We Are Our Brothers Keeper.

Evans and her husband are accused of siphoning money from the grant to pay friends and relatives and cover the mortgage on their landmark New Regal Theater on Chicago’s South Side — a venue they said they were trying to restore to its former glory as a cultural hub for the struggling area.



Evans, also a former Chicago police lieutenant, resigned as Country Club Hills police chief in 2011. Evans, through an attorney, has said she didn’t do anything wrong.



Jeri Wright, 47, faces two counts of money laundering, two counts of making false statements to officers and seven counts of giving false grand jury testimony. She couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.



An attorney for Evans confirmed Jeri Wright is the daughter of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, the pastor emeritus of the south side Trinity United Church of Christ, which Obama attended.

The Martin Bashir resignation was a consequence of one of his ‘Clear The Air’ segments. In that segment he was less than kind to Sarah Palin.

Martin Bashir was reacting to Sarah Palin comparing the deficit and Obamacare to slavery. Many on the Right have resorted to equate Obamacare and the deficit to a form of slavery. For descendants of slaves that comparison is obscene. For those empathetic to those affected by the institution of slavery, the comparison is obscene.

Martin Bashir graphically illustrated in his segment a few of the hundreds of dehumanizing events that were imposed on slaves. Sarah Palin had said that “Our free stuff today is being paid for today by taking money from our children and borrowing from China. When that note comes due … it is going to be like slavery when that note is due.”

Martin Bashir response was snarky and graphic. He had had enough. “Given her well established reputation as a world class idiot, it’s hardly surprising that she should choose to mention slavery in a way that is abominable to anyone who knows anything about its barbaric history,” he said.

Martin Bashir then recounted the writings in the diary of Thomas Thistlewood, the son of a tenant farmer. In his diary Thistlewood detailed the “cruel and brutal” punishment inflicted on his slaves. One such brutality involved forcing one slave to defecate in another slave’s mouth. Another cruelty was rubbing salt, pepper, and lime juice into a slave’s wound from flogging.

Martin Bashir then ends his segment saying, ""When Mrs. Palin invokes slavery, she doesn't just prove her rank ignorance. She confirms if anyone truly qualified for a dose of discipline from Thomas Thistlewood, she would be the outstanding candidate.""

Martin Bashir apologized for the segment. It seemed this was not enough for most. His statements continued to haunt him and MSNBC. Martin Bashir decided to resign today. His email follows.



After making an on-air apology, I asked for permission to take some additional time out around the Thanksgiving holiday. Upon further reflection, and after meeting with the President of MSNBC, I have tendered my resignation. It is my sincere hope that all of my colleagues, at this special network, will be allowed to focus on the issues that matter without the distraction of myself or my ill-judged comments. I deeply regret what was said, will endeavor to work hard at making constructive contributions in the future and will always have a deep appreciation for our viewers – who are the smartest, most compassionate and discerning of all television audiences. I would also wish to express deepest gratitude to my immediate colleagues, and our contributors, all of whom have given so much of themselves to our broadcast.

Both the Right and the Left displayed a false sense of indignation over Martin Bashir’s comments. The Right continues to lie, make racist, sexist, misogynistic comments on a daily basis. There is rarely consensus to chop the head of the ones inflicting these ills.

Martin Bashir made a rhetorical statement that was absolutely in line with the liberties and false equivalences Sarah Palin and the Right have been expounding. For that he would not be forgiven. Martin Bashir’s resignation is another Right Wing win over a spineless Left.

A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

“Contrary to what the mayor apparently thinks, this is not going away,” said Mr. Gloria, a Democrat. “Fewer people than ever respect him, meaning he cannot get anything done. The city has run better without him here; he should give us that opportunity permanently by resigning. The Council will continue to question him and his decisions and try to get this city back on track like San Diegans deserve.”

Since he was elected mayor last year, and for decades while he was in Congress, Mr. Filner built a reputation for liberal politics and personal abrasiveness. But there had been no public accusations like those plaguing him now. He was known to keep up a relentless public schedule, appearing on the nightly news at every opportunity. But when the accusations began, he became much less visible. While he was away, his top aide said she had the locks on his office changed to ensure he would not have access, though his office did put out a news release detailing the $120,000 in small business grants he apparently approved.

As local news reports have detailed the accusations — from the “Filner headlock,” in which the mayor gripped a woman so that she could not escape, to asking a 67-year-old part-time City Hall worker if she thought he was able to “go for eight hours straight” — the city has been the source of a stream of late-night jokes.

Mark Cafferty, executive director of San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation, said, “Every conversation I have with people who are thinking of doing business here — whether they are in another part of the country or another part of the world even — starts and ends with the jokes from Conan O’Brien.”"

(CNN) —

Tavis Smiley: Bitter, party of one.

What else can you say about an accomplished but jaded black scholar who continues to behave like a Twitter troll when it comes to President Obama? Why does he unfairly criticize Obama? Could it be because of a bruised ego?

It may have started back in February 2008.

Smiley, an author, media personality and leading voice in the black community, invited then-Sen. Barack Obama to speak at his “State of the Black Union” forum in New Orleans. Obama declined, opting instead to campaign because he was locked in a tough primary with Sen. Hillary Clinton, who did attend the forum.

ESPN LZ Granderson

In his place, Obama offered to send his wife, Michelle. Anyone who has seen the first lady speak knows this is hardly a consolation prize.

Smiley said no thanks.

Obama sent a letter, reiterating the importance of the forum, and asked Smiley to reconsider.

He didn’t.

And thus, the rift.

In 2011, Smiley was on C-Span claiming that Obama was “the first president in my professional career that hasn’t invited me to the White House.” Though truth be told, I’m not prone to inviting people who diss my better half over to the house either.

Not that I’m suggesting Smiley shouldn’t be able to interview or criticize the president.

In fact, I have challenged some of President Obama’s policies and decisions for years in my columns, on TV and over radio. But I’ve always tried to do so in context. So, for those of you enamored with Smiley’s recent criticism of the president’s remarks about race, which he described as “weak as pre-sweetened Kool-Aid,” remember it’s all about context.

In this case, the context includes their bumpy history.

Same goes for Smiley’s partner-in-whine, Cornel West, who was so upset that he received one ticket to the 2009 inauguration instead of the requested three that afterward he compared Obama to Machiavelli.

Before ticket-gate, West went on the trail for Obama.

After the incident, West went off on Obama.

Last year, West called the Democratic president a “Rockefeller Republican in blackface” while supposedly on an awareness tour with Smiley to talk about poverty. The idea behind the initiative was a noble one. Unfortunately, when they weren’t talking about the poor, they would throw random haymakers at the president, like West’s “blackface” remark.

As a result, media coverage spent more time focused on the jabs than on ways to lift the poor out of poverty.

This week, West called Obama a “global George Zimmerman” in an interview with Democracy Now. Also while a guest on Smiley’s radio show, the Princeton University professor said that MSNBC host and Obama supporter, the Rev. Al Sharpton, “probably deep down wants to be critical of the president, but he can’t because he’s still on the Obama plantation.”

West also insinuated that other blacks who aren’t as critical of the president as he and Smiley are also residents of this so-called plantation.

Perhaps we should make that: Bitter, party of two.

In fairness, it is hard to prove that the vitriol the pair spews in Obama’s way all stems from perceived snubs from a few years ago. But the timing of it all is curious. And the personal attacks – West once said Obama was afraid of “free black men” – make it difficult to believe yesteryear’s leftovers are not still on today’s menu.

Now, I do believe poverty is the least talked about major issue we have in this country. And it seemed like the entire 2012 general election was focused on the rich and declining middle class, with little to no talk about where the middle class was declining to.

West and Smiley’s criticism of Obama for this omission is reasonable, especially since silence on this issue has a big impact on the black community.

A recent study released by Harvard University shows how difficult it is for people born in the lower 5% to reach the top 5%. In some parts of the country, the chances of moving up the income ladder are as high as 35%. But in regions with a large black population, such as near Charlotte, North Carolina; Memphis, Tennessee, and Atlanta, it is as low as 4%.

To be born in poverty and then die in poverty is an American nightmare. So I applaud West and Smiley for using their platform to draw attention to the often overlooked problem.

But if they’re motivated by personal grievances, shame on them for displaying their pettiness while touting important policy critiques.

First of all, it’s self-serving.

Second, it’s obvious. Earlier this year Tom Joyner, who once featured Smiley on his syndicated radio show but parted ways with him after his unjust attacks on Obama in 2008, said, “Tavis is fascinated with his own legacy, and that’s not good. He wants more than anything to be remembered the way Dr. King was, and to somehow make that kind of mark on the world.”

Translation: It’s all about Smiley.

When Obama didn’t accept the invitation to speak at Smiley’s forum in 2008, Smiley interpreted it as an affront to his influence in the black community. When Obama opted not to attend in 2009 – although he did address the crowd via video conference – that was the proverbial final straw.

Smiley and West have been aggressively attacking the president, sandwiching legitimate concerns about poverty in between over-the-top comments that far too often detract from what they claim is their primary focus – helping poor black people. Their comments may grab headlines and land them on Sunday morning talk shows, but how have they engaged with the administration in finding solutions on poverty?

Instead, Smiley and West appear to be two egocentric men who believe they alone are the face of black intellectualism. And any black talking heads who don’t side with them have, in West’s words, “sold their souls.”

Welcome to the ivory tower version of black on black crime.

Again, I’m all for fairly criticizing the man in the White House. But it feels that West and Smiley are more upset that Obama didn’t kiss their rings before he walked through the door than about anything he’s done since he got inside.

A former Chicago-area executive is blowing the whistle in the latest case to showcase what is derisively known as the ""Illinois way"" -- politicians' practice of doing business by dishing out favors to friends who contribute generously to their campaigns.

This time, a top-ranking Democrat has been implicated. The case involves Illinois' most powerful Democratic leader -- state House Speaker Michael Madigan -- and the former head of the Chicago area's commuter rail service, Metra. In a rare move earlier this week, Metra's ex-CEO Alex Clifford came forward publicly to reveal specific details about how he says he was forced out of his lucrative job after refusing to cave to political pressure.

Clifford, who was hired from California in 2001, testified during a recent Regional Transportation Authority board meeting in Chicago. For two hours he spoke openly about what he calls serious ""ethical and moral character flaws"" from people who practice the ""Illinois way"" of doing business, including Madigan.

Clifford claims Madigan specifically wanted a pay raise for a Metra employee, Patrick Ward, who has been a generous contributor to Madigan's campaign, according to state records. Clifford testified: ""What is it that he (Ward) was doing so great and so different than other employees at Metra who have gone three years without a pay raise that would make this person special?""

Clifford ultimately rejected the request. In a statement, Madigan acknowledged sending a ""recommendation to Metra senior staff that Mr. Ward be considered for a salary adjustment. ... When notified Mr. Clifford had concerns about the appearance of the recommendation coming from my office, I withdrew the request.""

During a trip to the state Capitol in Springfield, Clifford says he was asked by Democratic state lawmaker Rep. Luis Arroyo to consider hiring somebody the Latino caucus sends him. Clifford says he told Arroyo ""we have a process. Times are different today at Metra than they were under my predecessor. Every applicant, every employee will come in through the front door.""

Clifford went on to point fingers at those who intentionally ""railroaded"" him into a poor performance evaluation which led to the end of his contract -- specifically Metra Chairman Brad O'Hallaron and another Metra board member. When Clifford approached O'Hallaron about his upcoming contract he claims O'Hallaron responded, ""but we're just dating."" Then said, ""I need to get a meeting with Mr. Madigan and I need to find out what kind of damage you've caused to our potential for future funding.""

When it was his turn to testify, O'Hallaron denied Clifford's accusations. O'Hallaron told the RTA board: ""If as alleged by Clifford I was seeking to protect Speaker Madigan, why would I take his allegations immediately over to the OEIG (Office of Executive Inspector General) if I thought there was pressure from Speaker Madigan? It just doesn't make sense.""

Clifford did not get the necessary votes to renew his contract earlier this year, but he left Metra with a $700,000 severance deal that some have characterized as ""hush money"" to keep Clifford quiet after threatening a lawsuit. Clifford denies that claim and says the money was ""100 percent about my ability to get a job and how I've been damaged.""

Metra announced on Friday that it plans to hire a well-known former federal prosecutor in Chicago to perform an independent investigation into Clifford's allegations and make recommendations concerning Metra's hiring and contract policies. Metra's board of directors must approve the hiring at a special meeting on Monday.

The man who oversees Illinois' government watchdog group says even though there was no illegal activity involved with the Metra scandal, the case has lawmakers squirming a bit more than usual.

""This is a very big deal, this is the first time in anyone's memory that Speaker Madigan has been implicated so directly in the workings of a public agency,"" Better Government Association President Andy Shaw said. ""Madigan and hundreds if not thousands (of politicians) do this every day. We just don't hear about it very often, because it happens behind closed doors.""

Shaw admits any hope for changing this type of behavior has to come from voters. ""This is only going to change in one of two ways. People coming out to vote and deciding who represents them. And secondly when a groundswell of public outrage forces public officials to impose higher ethics standards upon themselves.""

Illinois' history with questionable political ethics is rich. The state practically became the poster child for corruption during the criminal trial of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Blagojevich attempted to sell off Barack Obama's coveted U.S. Senate seat in return for hefty campaign donations referencing it in the now infamous phone call saying, ""I've got this thing and it's f------ golden and I'm not giving it up for f------ nothing.""

Blagojevich is currently serving out his 14-year sentence in federal prison in Colorado."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/20/jfk-assassination-gary-hart_n_4302598.html,2013-11-20 00:00:00,"['Managing Editor', 'The Worldpost', 'Former Washington Bureau Chief']",Senator Who Investigated JFK Assassination: 'American Journalism Never Followed Up On That Story',"WASHINGTON -- As the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's death nears, former presidential candidate Gary Hart, a member of the Senate committee that investigated JFK's assassination, said that the press had failed in its responsibility to investigate the truth behind his killing.

Hart served on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Agencies, known as the Church committee, after chairman Frank Church. He recalled that while the committee was investigating the connection between the assassination, the Mafia and plots against Cuban President Fidel Castro, two of the three main figures involved were also killed.

""It's amazing to me that American journalism never followed up on that story very much, because if you found out who killed those two guys, you might have some really interesting information on your hands,"" Hart, who served as a Democratic senator from Colorado for two terms, told HuffPost in a recent interview.

There were ""all kinds of leads"" -- had reporters followed them, he said. ""I went down to Miami when [Johnny] Roselli was killed and talked to this Dade County sheriff from the Miami Police Department, and they showed me pictures of him being fished out of the water in the barrel and how he'd been killed -- nightmarish stuff. And [Momo Salvatore] Giancana was killed in his own basement with six bullet holes in his throat with a Chicago police car and an FBI car outside his house,"" he recounted.

According to CIA documents released in 2007, the agency hired Johnny Roselli, a high-ranking mobster, to eliminate Fidel Castro, offering to pay him $150,000. Roselli reportedly declined the money and worked with former FBI agent Robert A. Maheu; Giancana, Al Capone's Chicago mob successor; and Santo Trafficante Jr., a mobster involved in Cuban operations, to unsuccessfully poison Castro with pills. Roselli disappeared soon after testifying before the Church committee, and his body was found inside an oil drum near North Miami Beach. Giancana was found dead at his Chicago home before he could testify to the Church committee.

While alive, Giancana and Roselli also reportedly communicated with Kennedy. In a 1988 interview with People Magazine, Judith Campbell Exner claimed she had an affair with the president, and that during that relationship she served as a courier between the president and Roselli and Giancana. The president's brother, Robert Kennedy -- then-attorney general -- called for an investigation on Giancana.

The deaths of Roselli and Giancana in 1975 and 1976 occurred amid the Church committee's ongoing investigations surrounding Kennedy's assassination. That coincidence, Hart said, was suspicious enough to warrant press attention, and he was surprised that the press didn't jump on the story.

""I was always amazed in that particular instance of the CIA-Mafia connection and the Cuban connection 12 years -- coming up 12 years -- after Kennedy was killed that somebody didn't go after that story,"" he said. ""New York Times, Washington Post; anybody. And they didn't. They reported the deaths and that was it, and the strange quirky coincidence, you know, but nothing more.""

For Hart, the uncanny series of events roughly 12 years after Kennedy's death was less of a coincidence than an indication that people -- including Giancana -- knew more than they were letting on.

""You don't have to be a genius to believe that they knew something about the coincidence of events -- Cuba, Mafia, CIA and Kennedy -- that somebody didn't want that out in the public 12 years later,"" Hart said.

At a time when his Church committee was uncovering plots against the Cuban president and the CIA's use of the Mafia in those plots, Hart was privy to other peculiarities as well.

According to Hart, the Warren Commission -- the presidential commission charged with investigating Kennedy's assassination that concluded Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone -- remained unaware of the connections between Cuba, the CIA, the Mafia and Kennedy. Only then-CIA director Allen Dulles, who was on the commission, knew, according to Hart, but Dulles said nothing to the other members.

Hart also heard from William Robert Plumlee -- a former CIA contract pilot who gave classified testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then chaired by John Kerry, in the '90s -- about how he believed Kennedy was really killed. Plumlee told Hart that he'd flown a plane to Texas days before the president's assassination and had later come to believe that several people on board were connected to the murder. A report by TV producer Robert Vernon claimed that Plumlee testified that the flight -- with Roselli on board -- was an attempt to thwart the Kennedy assassination.

Hart tried to uncover the truth about the Kennedy assassination and the ""big unanswered questions."" He said he worked with fellow Church committee member and former Sen. Richard Schweiker (R-Penn.), but ultimately ran out of resources and leads. During an ill-fated presidential bid in the 1980s, Hart vowed he'd reopen the Kennedy investigation if elected. In retrospect, he said it ""was probably a stupid thing to do,"" citing death threats he received.

Fifty years later, the danger of digging into cases such as Kennedy's assassination is not lost on Hart. In his chiding of the press and its failure to seize the opportunity to reveal the truth about Kennedy's death, he admits that revealing such a truth -- even as a journalist -- could have dire consequences.

""You risk your life because whoever killed these two guys is still out there,"" Hart said."

Council censures Marion Barry for taking cash payments from city contractors,"Marion Barry, the city’s most well-known and polarizing politician, was censured Tuesday by his D.C. Council colleagues for taking thousands of dollars in cash payments from contractors with business before the city.

The council voted 9 to 4 to strip Barry of his committee chairmanship, with some colleagues describing Barry’s lapse as another mark on the city’s dismal ethics record. In the past two years, three council members have pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges.

For Barry, the censure was the second in three years and another transgression in a checkered political career.

As mayor in 1990, Barry was convicted of cocaine possession. More recently, as a council member, tax troubles resulted in probation. He was censured and stripped of a chairmanship in 2010 for giving a council contract to a girlfriend and directing city funds to nonprofit groups he created and controlled.

After that sanction, Barry lost his leadership post for a year. This time, the earliest Barry could regain a chairmanship is 2015.

McDuffie (D-Ward 5), who chaired a disciplinary panel that investigated Barry’s conduct, urged the full council to support the committee’s recommendation, saying the seriousness of Barry’s violation and his record of “recidivism” merited a “swift and serious” response from the council.

McDuffie said removing Barry as chairman of the Committee on Workforce and Community Affairs would demonstrate “that a significant violation of the public trust will not be tolerated.”

Barry began a wandering defense of his actions, saying he “cooperated fully” with the panel. He then grew more defiant, questioning the council’s authority to remove his chairmanship.

Council members Vincent B. Orange (D-At Large) and Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) came to Barry’s defense, saying the Board of Ethics and Government Accountability’s decision to fine Barry $13,600 and require ethics training should have concluded the investigation.

“I in no way endorse what Mr. Barry did; he shouldn’t have done it,” Evans said. “But in this case, Mr. Barry recognized that he had done something wrong — came forward with it.”

McDuffie responded that the council “has an obligation, in fact, a duty, to police itself and its own members.”

The Washington Post reported in June that Barry had disclosed accepting two gifts last year totaling $6,800 from D.C. construction companies. D.C. law prohibits gifts from government contractors.

The city’s ethics board investigated and came to a settlement with Barry, who agreed in July to accept a censure from the board and pay a $13,600 fine. The sanction triggered the council investigation.

According to a report issued by the panel, Barry had told Keith Forney, the owner of Forney Enterprises, in early 2012 that he was “experiencing financial difficulty” related to a federal tax lien but “did not overtly ask for money.”

At least one of the cash payments, the report said, was passed from Forney to Barry during a meeting at the Stadium Club, a Northeast Washington strip club co-owned by Forney.

The panel found “insufficient evidence of a quid pro quo arrangement.” Both Barry and Forney told the panel that the payments were not in exchange for any particular act.

Orange proposed reducing the sanction against Barry, allowing him to keep his chairmanship.

Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) opposed the effort to weaken the censure and urged the council to consider how it would look to the public. “We are going to be judged. . . by how we judge a colleague’s conduct.” Mendelson also said the buck stops with Barry’s colleagues, not the ethics board formed in response to recent scandals. “We are in a better position to evaluate our own conduct than anyone else,” he said.

David Grosso (I-At Large), a member of the panel that investigated Barry, also opposed the weakened censure. He said the supposed mitigating factor that Barry disclosed the lapse himself was irrelevant.

The measure failed, 9 to 4, with Orange, Evans and Jim Graham (D-Ward 1) siding with Barry, the same vote as the final tally on censure. Imposing a censure requires a two-thirds vote of the council, or nine of 13 members.

Barry said afterward that he was “not disappointed” in the sanction. “That’s not the only thing in life, to chair a committee,” he said.

Anita Bonds (D-At Large), a longtime friend and former political aide to Barry, sat on the ethics panel and supported the sanction approved Tuesday. But she said Barry would not be marginalized without a committee post.

“He’ll find a way to blossom,” she said.

Mendelson said he would speak with his colleagues before proposing a realignment of committee responsibilities, with council action coming no sooner than Oct. 1."

Release a budget with cuts to Social Security. The base pushes back: Um, we're Democrats. We don't cut Social Security! President Barack Obama gets defensive: But it's the Republicans' idea! Except that the Republicans didn't include Social Security cuts in their crazy draconian budget. Why? Because only a moron would step on that third rail. Re-read step #1. Republicans begin 2014 campaign, charging that Democrats want to cut Social Security.

Nobody could've predicted this, except everyone:

If there's any silver lining in this debacle, it's that it'll allow congressional Democrats the opportunity to distance themselves from this bumbling White House.

Unfortunately, they have to distance themselves from the party's leader, never a fun place for a politician to be. See 2006. And 2010.

What's craziest about this whole fiasco is how shellshocked the White House appears about it. It's as if they expected to be greeted with rose petals for ""making the tough choices"" or whatever bullshit they want to call it today."

To be sure, many will claim it is not the salaciousness of the pictures and graphically sexual tweets of Carlos Danger (Anthony Weiner’s Twitter name) that is driving this story. Many will say that it is the lies about his online behavior that keeps this story in the 24/7 news lineup. That is simply hogwash. America is a country that has been trained to be sexually puritanical in discourse while sexually liberal behind closed doors or by implication in music, videos and movies.

This applies to the common man and politicians alike. Most by now are aware that from FDR to Kennedy, sexual escapades were common. In the case of President Clinton, those that verbally attacked him for the Monica Lewinsky ""sex scandal"" were themselves guilty of similar or worst sexual escapades (puritanical in condemnation while sexually liberal).

It is unsettling that the New York Times thought it had the right to suggest that Anthony Weiner leave the mayoral race inasmuch as they never suggested that Giuliani or Clinton resign for their ""sexual misdeeds."" What is even more disconcerting is the mainstream media’s 24/7obsession with the story. Their righteous indignation for what is so far a fantasy; a virtual sexual affair as they probe with psychological analysis, moral analysis, with a dose of excoriation is uncalled for.

The media would do much better if they had concentrated on Wiener's fitness to be mayor based on his qualifications relative to other mayors. Does he display the passion and political knowledge to be the head of a city of over 8 million people? Is any other mayoral candidate more qualified? Judging Weiner based on his discovered sexual proclivities while not doing so for all the other candidates is reason enough to stick with only his qualifications.

The reality is that there is a real scandal. The real scandal isn’t about Weiner however. It is about a derelict mainstream media. While an excessive amount of time is being spent on a virtual sexual scandal, there are many issues that materially affect the working middle class that go unreported.

More on Anthony Weiner and the New York City mayoral race below the fold."

(CNN) - In the wake of controversies plaguing the Obama administration, a White House senior adviser admitted Sunday there is a ""healthy skepticism"" about government. But he argued it's up to Republicans to decide how much Washington will focus on the scandals.

""Are Republicans going to continue to work with the president ... or are they going to use this as a reason to not act at all?"" Dan Pfeiffer asked on CNN's ""State of the Union.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

New poll numbers Sunday indicate the president is weathering the storm, with his approval rating holding at 53%, according to the CNN/ORC International survey out Sunday. His rating stood at 51% in April.

As the administration enters another week of congressional hearings over the controversies, Pfeiffer said the president plans to push forward by staying on message about his agenda, which includes improving the economy and working toward immigration reform.

White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough instructed his team not to spend more than 10% of their time on the controversies, a Democrat aware of McDonough's remarks confirmed to CNN.

Asked on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" if that meant the White House wasn't taking the scandals seriously, Pfeiffer said, ""Oh, no. Absolutely not.""

""There are some very serious issues here, particularly the IRS, where there was inexecusable conduct that needs to be fixed and that's going to happen,"" he continued.

Pfeiffer frequently pivoted to Republicans during his multiple talk show appearances Sunday, saying the GOP is getting distracted by hyping up some of the controversies out of political motivation.

""We've seen this playbook from the Republicans before,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""What they want to do when they're lacking a positive agenda is try to drag Washington into a swamp of partisan fishing expeditions, trumped-up hearings and false allegations. We're not going to let that happen. The president's got business to do for the American people.""

The administration has taken heat over a recent report from the Internal Revenue Service inspector general that revealed the agency had been targeting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status since 2010. Two top IRS officials announced last week they were leaving their posts after the president called the agency's actions ""inexecusable.""

Pfeiffer maintained that the president was not aware of the targeting until the news media grabbed hold of the story a few days before the report came out earlier this month. However, in the last week, IRS officials have said they notified Treasury Department officials that they were conducting the review months before the report came out.

Asked why the White House or top Treasury officials didn't get involved sooner, Pfeiffer argued no one wanted to get in the way.

""Here's the cardinal rule: You do not interfere in an independent investigation,"" he told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley.

Congress has also ramped up renewed scrutiny over the White House's handling of last year's terror attack against a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, which left four Americans dead.

Responding to criticism over how erroneous talking points were drafted - which were used by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice just days after the attack - the White House last week released more than 100 pages of e-mails to show how it worked with State Department and CIA officials to craft the messaging, which later turned out to be inaccurate.

Asked if the president was aware of the drafting of the talking points as the editing process was taking place, Pfeiffer said on CNN that ""of the many things the president gets involved in, talking points for Sunday shows is not one of them.""

Pfeiffer argued the release of the emails will hopefully put the matter to rest and remove Rice from the GOP firing zone.

""Frankly I think that many of the Republicans who have been talking about this, now that they have seen the emails, owes Ambassador Rice an apology for the things they said about her in the wake of the attack,"" he said on ABC's ""This Week.""

He's giving as many as eight speeches over the next couple months, with one on infrastructure in Florida on Thursday. In his speech in Illinois, Obama made clear why he was doing it. It takes two to legislate, and the House of Representatives refuses to budge. The risk Obama faces is that Americans don't really seem to want to dance, either. 2013 is no 2012.

RELATED: Obama's Favorite Word: 'Frustration'

Over the weekend, the president's advisors started pitching Wednesday's speech at Knox College. On Sunday, Politico reported, Obama's communications chief Dan Pfeiffer sent an email to White House reporters with subject line, ""I don't normally do this.""

Hey everyone, I don't usually write emails like this … But I just finished reading the draft of a speech the President plans to deliver on Wednesday, and I want to explain why it's one worth checking out.

Perhaps that draft speech differed from the one that was delivered, but the verdict on the speech itself was largely that it trod well-worn ground. The Washington Post put it well: ""You could be forgiven if you thought you had heard President Obama’s speech on the economy today before. Because you have. For most of the 2012 campaign."" Which, as we pointed out, was part of the point: get people refocused on Obama's campaign goals.

With a heavy dose of bashing Republican obstructionism. If the thinking is that an appeal to the people can somehow stir Republicans to action, it's not clear how a rehash of 2012 arguments at a lower temperature will do the trick. Even in the best of times, as Jonathan Chait wrote in May, the ability of a president to bend the world to his will is limited. Doing it with the same rhetoric, lower approval ratings, and less attention seems like a doomed proposition.

And with a weakened campaign infrastructure. Organizing For Action, meant to provide the sort of off-year infrastructure that Obama enjoyed during his reelection, has struggled to find its feet. This August, the group plans to launch a series of actions meant to spur Obama's slumbering base into action. As the group's own map shows, however, its strength is largely in areas that already support the president and his agenda. A few OFA actions and an Obama speech seems unlikely to convince voters in Mississippi to rail against their Congressmembers.

RELATED: Everyone Still Really Hates Congress, but Democrats Can Make the GOP Look Good

Politico's Glenn Thrush and Carrie Budoff Brown think part of the idea is just to re-energize Obama himself.

Obama has embarked on this week’s series of policy speeches to improve his own ambiguous frame of mind and take a comforting spin in the way-back machine, like a veteran chart-topper revisiting smaller, friendlier haunts on a comeback tour.

It's not clear what this means. That the Obama who sold out Shea in 2012 will play CBGB in 2013 just to stay fresh? Who knows. If the president thinks it will take a few shows at a suburban Houlihan's to get the cobwebs off, this permanent campaign thing may not work out that well.

Obama is giving another speech today, by the way. The Hill explains:

President Obama will push for new infrastructure projects and investments as he hits the road again Thursday, traveling this time to Jacksonville, Fla., for his third consecutive speech on the economy. … The White House chose the port as the site of the speech because it is home to two projects — a container terminal and a rail yard — that the administration expedited last year as part of a broader infrastructure push.

Perhaps this is the speech that can do the trick, can energize the people to force the House into action on the president's priorities. But don't be surprised if it, too, sounds familiar. After all, the president has made similar infrastructures pitches before. Like in March. In Florida.

He Joined The Network In September', 'Is Based Out Of Washington']",BENGHAZI: Names of ‘whistle-blower’ witnesses revealed,"Their identities have been a well-guarded secret, known only to their high-powered lawyers and a handful of House lawmakers and staff. But now Fox News has learned the names of the self-described Benghazi “whistle-blowers” who are set to testify before a widely anticipated congressional hearing on Wednesday.

Appearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will be three career State Department officials: Gregory N. Hicks, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya at the time of the Benghazi terrorist attacks; Mark I. Thompson, a former Marine and now the deputy coordinator for Operations in the agency’s Counterterrorism Bureau; and Eric Nordstrom, a diplomatic security officer who was the regional security officer in Libya, the top security officer in the country in the months leading up to the attacks.

U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya.

At the time of Stevens' death, Hicks became the highest-ranking American diplomat in Libya.

Nordstrom previously testified before the oversight committee, which is chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., in October 2012. Of the three witnesses, he is the only one who does not consider himself a whistle-blower. At last fall's hearing, however, Nordstrom made headlines by detailing for lawmakers the series of requests that he, Ambassador Stevens, and others had made for enhanced security at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in the period preceding the attacks, requests mostly rejected by State Department superiors.

More On This... How Bad Was Benghazi Botch?

""For me the Taliban is on the inside of the [State Department] building,"" Nordstrom testified, angry over inadequate staffing at a time when the threat environment in Benghazi was deteriorating,

The other two witnesses have not been heard from publicly before.

Hicks is a veteran Foreign Service officer whose overseas postings have also included Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican and committee member, said Hicks was in Tripoli at 9:40 p.m. local time when he received one of Stevens’ earliest phone calls amid the crisis.

“We’re under attack! We’re under attack!” the ambassador reportedly shouted into his cellphone at Hicks.

Chaffetz, who subsequently debriefed Hicks, also said the deputy “immediately called into Washington to trigger all the mechanisms” for an inter-agency response.

“The real-life trauma that [Hicks] went through,” Chaffetz recalled to Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren, “I mean, I really felt it in his voice. It was hard to listen to. He’s gone through a lot, but he did a great job.”

According to the State Department website, Thompson “advises senior leadership on operational counterterrorism matters, and ensures that the United States can rapidly respond to global terrorism crises.”

Five years before the Benghazi attacks, he lectured at a symposium hosted by the University of Central Florida and titled “The Global Terrorism Challenge: Answers to Key Questions.”

Joe diGenova, a former U.S. attorney, and wife Victoria Toensing, a former chief counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee -- Republicans -- disclosed this week that in their private practice in the nation’s capital, they now represent pro bono two career State Department employees who regard themselves as “whistle-blowers” and would be testifying before Issa’s committee at its next Benghazi hearing, on May 8.

The lawyers said their clients believe their accounts of Benghazi were spurned by the Accountability Review board (ARB), the official investigative body convened by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to review the terrorist attacks, and that the two employees have faced threats and intimidation from as-yet-unnamed superiors.

“I'm not talking generally, I'm talking specifically about Benghazi -- that people have been threatened,” Toensing told Fox News on Wednesday. “And not just the State Department; people have been threatened at the CIA. ... It's frightening. ...They're taking career people and making them well aware that their careers will be over.”

DiGenova told Fox News on Thursday, by way of describing his and Toensing’s respective clients: “There were people who were material witnesses, who wanted to talk to [the ARB], and they were not allowed to talk to them.

“The people that we are representing are career civil servants...people who have served the country overseas…in dangerous positions all over the world, have risked their lives and only want to tell the truth.”"

USA TODAY

John Podesta was just named as a new senior-level adviser to President Obama last week, but he's already ruffling Republican feathers.

In a profile published late Tuesday by Politico Magazine, Podesta is quoted comparing Republicans to the infamous cult led by Jim Jones, who was responsible for the 1978 cyanide poisoning of more than 900 of his followers in Guyana.

""They need to focus on executive action given that they are facing a second term against a cult worthy of Jonestown in charge of one of the houses of Congress,"" said Podesta of what Obama's White House team faces. Jonestown was the informal name of the settlement founded by Jones and his American followers.

On Wednesday, Podesta apologized for his impolitic comment.

""In an old interview, my snark got in front of my judgment. I apologize to Speaker Boehner, whom I have always respected,"" Podesta posted on his Twitter account.

The Jonestown incident marked one of the most horrific mass killings in American history.

Rep. Leo Ryan, D-Calif., who had traveled to the settlement after receiving alarming reports of conditions there from constituents, was shot dead by cult members as the congressman's delegation readied to fly out of Guyana with some members of the cult who wanted to leave. Current Rep. Jackie Speier, who was then an aide to Ryan, was wounded in the incident.

The author of the profile, Glenn Thrush, writes Podesta made the comment in an interview in the fall before Obama recruited the former Clinton administration chief of staff to join his team.

Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Republican House Speaker John Boehner, took offense with the Podesta comment.

""If this is the attitude of the new White House, it's hard to see how the president gets anything done again,"" Buck said.

Jenny Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, called Podesta's comments ""despicable.""

""Any man who is so historically ignorant as to compare millions of Americans who cherish freedom with the macabre and mass suicide at Jonestown is unqualified to hold any position of authority,"" she said. ""We recommend Mr. Podesta read a book on basic American history."""
http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-06-30/news/ct-met-jesse-jackson-disability-0630-20130630_1_jesse-jackson-jr-payments-south-side-democrat,2013-06-30 00:00:00,"['Katherine Skiba', 'Chicago Tribune Reporter']","Jesse Jackson Jr. is receiving Social Security, federal retirement system payments","— A disclosure by former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.'s lawyers is prompting questions about what federal payments the ex-congressman is receiving as he awaits sentencing Wednesday for misusing $750,000 in campaign cash.

In a court filing this month, defense lawyers said vaguely that Jackson has no income ""other than Social Security payments and Federal Employee Retirement System payments.""

His lawyers did not answer questions from the Tribune about the payments, but the newspaper found Jackson may be eligible for federal disability payments of as much as $8,700 a month — or 60 percent of his congressional pay.

The South Side Democrat reportedly has bipolar disorder. He pleaded guilty to a lengthy spending spree involving misusing about $750,000 in campaign cash. He quit Congress in November, amid an FBI and Internal Revenue Service probe, and struck a plea deal with prosecutors in February.

Jackson, 48, is too young to receive retirement benefits from Social Security. He would have to be at least 62.

His age and his tenure in Congress — almost 17 years — are short of the mark for a standard retirement annuity from the Federal Employees Retirement System, or FERS. Members of Congress can collect a pension from FERS starting at age 50 if they have completed 20 years of service, or at any age after 25 years of service, according to the Congressional Research Service.

But Jackson appears eligible for another FERS program that pays out ""disability retirement"" payments.

Under program rules, potential payments in the first year would total $8,700 a month — or $104,400 a year. The potential payments would drop to $69,600 annually in subsequent years.

Any payments are subject to income taxes, according to officials at the federal Office of Personnel Management. Citing privacy rules, OPM officials would not talk about Jackson Jr. but provided general information about FERS benefits.

Under the rules, whatever FERS ""disability retirement"" benefits a lawmaker receives are adjusted downward if he or she begins collecting Security Social disability payments.

Government agencies contacted by the Tribune would not confirm that Jackson is receiving disability money. One official who declined to discuss the matter called Jackson a ""private citizen."" Others cited privacy laws. But no expert consulted by the Tribune offered an alternative theory of what the payments might be, other than disability payments.

Prosecutors want Jackson Jr. sent to prison for four years. Defense lawyers are asking for leniency, saying he could not get suitable mental health care in prison.

Defense lawyers, in their general description of Jackson Jr.'s income, said the federal payments would be ""suspended"" if he goes to prison.

The notion that a disgraced lawmaker, staring at a possible prison term after a spending binge with campaign cash, might be collecting hefty benefits rankles some experts.

David Autor, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has written about the unsustainable explosion in disability rolls in the U.S., said the idea of a ""recently shamed-out-of-office congressman applying for public benefits"" was ""sheer chutzpah.""

Bipolar disorder is a serious impairment, Autor said, but he did not think most people with the condition applied for disability benefits since the illness is ""reasonably treatable with modern psycho pharmaceuticals.""

According to Cornell economist Richard Burkhauser, Social Security Disability Insurance rolls in the U.S. climbed from 1.2 million people in 1967 to 8.8 million in 2012 — more than a seven-fold hike.

If Jackson Jr. is collecting disability benefits, it comes in an era in which Congress has sought to rein in members who run seriously afoul of the law by taking away their pension benefits.

Separate reform measures were passed in 2007 and 2012, and Jackson Jr. voted for both of them.

Those laws, according to OPM, call for stripping both FERS pension and disability benefits upon a felon's ""final conviction"" for one of several specified offenses. ""Final conviction"" means the time for an appeal has lapsed or appeals were lost.

Craig Holman, an official with Public Citizen, a watchdog group, helped write the legislation to strip pensions from lawmakers convicted of abusing the public trust. ""I suspect Congress never even considered something like disability payments,"" he said.

When asked about the prospect of Jackson Jr. pocketing disability payments now, Holman said: ""It would seem to run contrary to the spirit of the law.""

Brittney Manchester, of the Office of Personnel Management, provided a citation from federal law on how a federal lawmaker is deemed eligible for retirement disability:

OPM would not discuss Jackson Jr. without a signed waiver from him. His lawyers did not respond to a Tribune request for a waiver.

Jackson Jr., the son of civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr., last earned $174,000 in office. He resigned soon after winning re-election Nov. 6 to a two-year term. Before stepping down, he had been on a medical leave of absence from Congress for more than five months, undergoing periods of treatment in Arizona and Minnesota.

Jackson's wife, Sandi, 49, a former Chicago alderman, also will be sentenced Wednesday in federal court. She, too, pleaded guilty to a felony offense, filing false tax returns.

In her case, she admitted failing to report to the IRS about $600,000 in the couple's income as the two used campaign donations to buy a Rolex watch and other luxury goods, furniture, appliances, vacations and collector's items.

Prosecutors want staggered prison terms for the couple — 18 months for her and four years for him — so their children, ages 9 and 13, would not be without a parent.

She is asking to be put on probation, while prosecutors urge that she go to prison first, then Jackson Jr. The ex-congressman has said through his lawyers that he'd like to serve his term first."

http://news.yahoo.com/gop-leaders-impeachment-talk-premature-211834512.html,,[],GOP leaders say impeachment talk premature,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — The Republican National Committee chairman and a leading conservative, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, urged caution Monday for Republican critics calling for President Barack Obama's impeachment, but would not rule out impeachment altogether as new details emerged about the White House's role in the developing scandal at the Internal Revenue Service.

""There's a few chapters before we get to the last one. So it's up to us to connect the dots first,"" RNC chairman Reince Priebus told reporters when asked about impeachment ahead of a New Hampshire GOP fundraiser.

Some conservatives have compared recent IRS wrongdoing to the Watergate scandal, and Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., last week raised the prospect of impeachment.

""There isn't a weekend that hasn't gone by that someone says to me, 'Michele, what in the world are you all waiting for in Congress? Why aren't you impeaching the president? He's been making unconstitutional actions since he came into office,'"" Bachmann said during a Washington news conference with tea party leaders.

Paul, a tea party favorite who is considering a 2016 presidential bid, said such rhetoric is premature.

""We need to figure out the truth of what happened before we go anywhere else,"" Paul said, standing at Priebus' side.

The Internal Revenue Service has acknowledged inappropriate scrutiny of tea party groups applying for tax-exempt status ahead of the last election.

White House chief of staff Denis McDonough and other senior presidential advisers knew in late April that an upcoming report was likely to find that IRS employees had targeted conservative political groups. The White House said McDonough and the other advisers did not tell Obama about the impending report, leaving him to learn the results from news reports later.

The issue has given conservatives a new rallying cry following a disappointing 2012 election cycle. But some GOP leaders worry their criticism could backfire if it appears their attacks appear too politically motived.

Story continues

While striking a moderate tone on impeachment, Paul said Monday that it ""stretches credulity"" to think no one else in the Obama administration knew about the misconduct.

""For goodness sake, somebody's got to be fired, if not go to prison,"" he said in an evening speech to roughly 500 New Hampshire Republicans gathered in the state capital.

Priebus blamed Obama for creating a culture of political ""guerrilla warfare"" that allowed politics to infiltrate the IRS.

""I think this is just the beginning. It's certainly not the end,"" Priebus said. ""And I'm sure there's going to be a lot more to it. We'll see how far it goes. We'll see how high it goes, too."""

President Obama would like to think the authorization comes from the congressional war authorization rather than the Constitution itself. Whatever. The key here is that the right’s distinction between criminal law and war powers and the constitutional protections afforded to U.S. citizens in our homeland and the absence of the same for enemy combatants (including Americans who take up arms against their countrymen) has been reaffirmed again and again. Guantanamo is still open. Khalid Sheik Mohammed was not tried in a New York courtroom. And the president drops bombs on the heads of many terrorists. It is good that we have cleared up any confusion about “shredding the Constitution” and such.

USA TODAY

At least 18 women have accused the mayor of inappropriate behavior

Filner has been sued by former aide for sexual harassment and faces a recall attempt

He recently underwent therapy

San Diego Mayor Bob Filner reportedly will resign as part of a deal to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit, according to news media reports

The Los Angeles Times, NBC News 7 and ABC in San Diego quoted unnamed sources saying the embattled mayor will step down after the proposed settlement is discussed at a closed-door City Council session Friday. The sources were granted anonymity by the news outlets because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

An attorney for Filner, James Payne, released a statement acknowledging a tentative agreement with the city but said he could not comment or disclose details.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed by City Attorney Jan Goldsmith, who said the City Council has to review and vote on the details.

In exchange for Filner's resignation, the city will reportedly pay ""some, if not all"" of Filner's share of damages awarded in the lawsuit, according to the Los Angeles Times story. The article cites unnamed sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.

At least 18 women have come forward to accuse the mayor, a Democrat and former member of Congress, of inappropriate behavior such as groping and unwanted kissing. He has apologized for his behavior and recently went through two weeks of therapy.

Attorney Gloria Allred, who represents Filner accuser Irene McCormack Jackson in the lawsuit, said Thursday that she and her client have not signed off on any details agreed to between the mayor and the city of San Diego.

Allred stressed that taxpayer money should not be used to help Filner pay any current or future legal bills or for ""any payment to him whatsoever.""

""I would like to see a resignation without conditions and without taxpayers being forced to make a gift of public funds to him in order for him to resign,"" Allred said at a news conference, adding that if the deal between Filner and the city involved only his resignation there would be no need for the council to approve the terms.

Steve Erie, University of California-San Diego political science professor who participated in writing the city's charter, said any agreement that gets the mayor to resign would likely involve covering his legal costs. He said the city already does that in cases of misconduct by other municipal workers including police.

He called Allred's latest comments ""grandstanding'' and said such objections to an agreement with Filner could prolong efforts to get him to leave office. Erie said the city's only real leverage in getting the mayor to leave voluntarily is financial.

""He doesn't have deep pockets,"" Erie said. ""Plus if he hasn't resigned by now, you have to remove the financial risk to get him to resign. Anything that makes that harder, like Allred's statement, I find deeply troubling.''

The council agreed last month not to pay Filner's legal bills and voted to sue him to recover any costs the city incurs as a result of the sexual harassment lawsuit.

Council member Kevin Faulconer, who was part of the mediation talks, said he was trying to balance protecting taxpayers with ending the drama over the embattled mayor.

""I joined these mediation discussions to ensure the city gets the best deal possible for taxpayers,'' he said. ""We must put this civic dysfunction behind us and return to providing city services to San Diegans.""

Allred and her client, along with representatives of the city, took part in the first of three days of mediation presided over by a retired federal judge this week. Filner, his attorneys, representatives of the city and two council members also participated in the mediation.

A petition drive to recall the mayor began recently, and organizers have vowed they will not stop collecting signatures unless Filner, elected in November, leaves office. Filner has rebuffed repeated calls to step aside from his colleagues on the City Council as well as from top Democrats, such as national party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and both of California's U.S. senators.

Dianne York, a San Diego businesswoman, became the 18th woman to accuse Filner when she came forward this week. She said the mayor put his hands on her buttocks during a photo opportunity this year.

McCormack Jackson, Filner's former communication director, filed her lawsuit in July accusing Filner of inappropriate behavior. In the court documents, she described being drawn into a virtual ""head lock"" with the mayor as he suggested they have sex.

Filner, 70, served in Congress for 10 terms until he became the first Democrat elected to lead San Diego in 20 years.

What is surprising is how sloppy and irresponsible it was. Then again given that this man’s irresponsibility in unnecessarily delaying voting on a Continuing Resolution to keep the government running, it should be expected.

During Ted Cruz faux-libuster he referenced John Connelly, a 22 year old Rutgers University student. Cruz said,

John Connelly thought he was on the right track in life. The son of a New Jersey auto mechanic, he was the first in his family to go to college when he enrolled in Rutgers in 2009,” … “Four years later, the 22-year-old found himself $21,000 in debt, without a permanent job and sleeping on friends' couches in New Jersey and Brooklyn. [Source]

Turns out Cruz or one of his aides did a botch job in their research and took Connelly out of context based on a Wall Street Journal article in which he was mentioned.

John Connelly thought he was right on track in life. The son of a New Jersey auto mechanic, he was the first in his family to go to college when he enrolled at Rutgers in 2009. Four years later, the 22-year-old found himself $21,000 in debt, without a permanent job and sleeping on friends' couches in New Jersey and Brooklyn. ""I hear a lot of stuff that people in my generation aren't buying cars or houses, and I'm a step beyond that—I can't even pay rent on time,"" Mr. Connelly says. ""I have a hard time planning 10 years in the future when I can hardly plan three months in the future."" At Rutgers, Mr. Connelly was an honors student and president of the student assembly. But wary of taking on more debt, he ended up withdrawing from school with three credits to go until graduation. After a summer spent living with friends while working a temporary job at a Brooklyn nonprofit, he found a grant that allowed him to re-enroll in school this fall. But he still doesn't know what he'll do when he graduates at the end of the semester. ""I kind of did everything I was quote-unquote 'supposed' to be doing,"" he says. [Source]

Cruz should have done more research as Connelly’s beliefs are diametrically opposed to those of Cruz and his immoral sect.

In fact, he grew up in a working-class union household and describes his politics as “left of most of the people in the Democratic Party on social and economic issues.” He thinks a single-payer system would be preferable to the Affordable Care Act but appreciates the provisions of the law that have helped him out already. His father’s union-provided health insurance still covers him, thanks to the provision of the ACA that allows children to stay on their parents’ plan until the age of 26. Private insurers are no longer allowed to deny his younger sister coverage, even though she suffers from a seizure disorder that qualifies as a pre-existing condition. [Source]

John Connelly was interviewed by Ed Schultz on Friday. He thinks it is bizarre that Cruz is blaming President Obama and the Affordable Care Act for his plight. He said his story is likely the worst story Cruz could have used for his free market dystopia as his is a poster family benefitting from Obamacare. His sister has a pre-existing condition and he is able to remain on his fathers union insurance because he is not yet 26 years old.

Connelly said what is holding students back has nothing to do with Obamacare. He said both he and his generation were grossly misrepresented by Cruz to push his agenda. His closing statement was a zinger. He said if his example is the best example Cruz could come up with of people suffering under Obamacare, then Obamacare is in fact a sweet deal. Check out the interview below.

Cruz and his party more so than any other party or organization are infamous for using truthful tidbits and surrounding them with untruthful narratives. They generally get no pushback from the traditional media. After-all, according to some of the ‘most respected journalists’, it is not their job to validate truth from these Right Wing lying hacks.

Bush’s second term, the Washington Post wrote that Bush’s frequent trips to his Texas ranch symbolized “a lackadaisical approach to the world’s most important day job” and gleefully noted that Bush was intent on setting the record for being on “vacation”–or away from Washington, D.C.–for the most number of days of any president.

But when President Barack Obama vacations in Hawaii, sets up a fantasy golf vacation for himself with Butch Harmon and Tiger Woods, averages more than a vacation a month in 2013 while purporting to be a man of the people and demanding the rich pay their fair share, and playing sequester politics by shutting down White House tours, the mainstream media is silent.

And while Bush spent more time outside of Washington than Obama, it is also worth nothing that nearly all of Bush’s vacations were trips back to his Texas ranch or family vacation homes in Maine.

The Post, in 2005, conceded that Bush’s vacations–unlike Obama’s–were not lavish and he did not “make time for fun.”

“Bush rarely takes the type of vacation one would consider exotic — or, to some, even appealing,” the Post wrote. “His notion of relaxation is chopping cedar on his ranch or mountain biking through rough terrain, all in 100-degree-plus temperatures in dusty Texas where crickets are known to roast on the summer pavement. He seems to relish the idea of exposing aides and reporters to the hothouse environment.”

Obama, on the other hand, has traveled to Hawaii every winter. The Obama daughters are vacationing at the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas this week with a full Secret Service detail, as Breitbart News reported, even as the White House claimed they could not afford to pay Secret Service agents to continue the popular White House tours for other students who are on their spring vacations in Washington, D.C.

The Obamas have gone to Martha’s Vineyard multiple times while the country was in recession and Americans were struggling to find jobs. Michelle Obama has taken a whirlwind trip to Spain and a ski trip to Aspen.

Obama took 13 vacations in his first term, which spanned all or part of 83 days. But they have been much more lavish than Bush’s. His annual vacations to Hawaii alone have cost taxpayers at least $20 million during his first term. In 2011 alone, Michelle Obama may have cost taxpayers $10 million on vacations herself. Obama’s fantasy golf outing this year cost local law enforcement in Florida a reported $78, 205.

Bush was content to work from home during his vacations. And for doing so, the mainstream media tagged him as lazy and disinterested. The Obamas gallivant around, making plenty of “time for fun,” and the mainstream media does not call them out for wasting taxpayer dollars or even for the terrible “optics.”"

No matter how boring and unimaginative you are, no matter how many facts you get wrong — all your cronies are always right there to back you up.

Jonathan Alter is a tiresome, washed-up leftist whose latest book — the title of which I forget — isn’t selling so well and didn’t do so well in the facts department. In other words, it has been an embarrassment of Joe McGinniss

proportions. And yet, over the past couple of weeks, Alter’s media comrades have attempted to come to his rescue to try to pump sales by any means necessary.

Earlier this week, The Huffington Post and Politico’s Dylan Byers both humiliated themselves with their transparently desperate attempts to help Alter out. And now it appears to be the Washington Post’s turn.

You would think that the sting of humiliation that comes with whiffing on the four biggest stories of the Obama presidency might result in something of a wake-up call for the financially troubled Post. But, as if to prove you can’t teach an old Palace Guard new tricks, yesterday the Post poured its bandwidth and investigative resources into… The Tale of the Fox News Supply Closet.

You see, in order to sell his book — other than groveling like a punk

— Alter salted his love letter to Obama with the kinds of tidbits he knew his fellow Obama-worshipping, Fox News-hating media pals would love: a bunch of nonsense about how Roger Ailes — one of the most successful network executives in history — is some kind of paranoid freak — you know, like Ted Turner.

Among a litany of over a dozen falsehoods about Ailes, Alter claimed that the Fox News chief is so paranoid about wiretaps (doesn’t sound so paranoid today!) that he “once worked out of a supply closet.” Ailes outright denied the claim to Politico, saying, “It’s completely false and silly. In fact, I had no idea we have a supply closet.”

Well, that obviously set off alarm bells at the same astute Washington Post that missed the IRS, AP, Verizon, and Benghazi scandals. And the result Friday was an in-depth, source-driven, 500-word investigative report into whether or not there are supply closets within the Fox News HQ.

No, I am not kidding.

And while it is fun to laugh this stuff off, you have to look at the The Matrix of what is really going on — which is pure character assassination.

Unlike the shriveling Post, Roger Ailes and Fox News are not only wildly succeeding in a media environment where almost everyone else is faltering, but they have been acting like real journalists in the fine tradition of what we saw from the Post during Watergate.

Unlike the Post, Fox News is not whiffing at these scandals or guarding The State’s palace. Instead, they are digging, asking tough questions, pressing for answers, breaking news, and letting Power know that there is at least one real watchdog among the many lapdogs.

But all Fox News and Ailes get in return is to find themselves being investigated and held accountable by a mainstream media — that not only refuse to do the same to the current administration, but are trying to prevent that from happening to the administration.

Mr. Filner is the first Democrat elected mayor here in 20 years, and he has championed liberal positions in dealing with labor, the environment and civil rights issues.

“I am devastated,” said Lorena Gonzalez, a state assemblywoman who was secretary-treasurer of the San Diego labor council that pumped close to $2 million into his race. “Until this happened last week, I would have told you we have the most progressive big-city mayor in America. We worked incredibly hard.”

Ms. Gonzalez, after initially saying the decision on whether the mayor should quit should be left to the women affected, changed her mind after talking to two more women who she said worked in his office and described in chilling detail advances, including linking job advancement to sexual favors.

“Before that I had heard about his boorish behavior, generational behavior,” she said. “Inappropriate. But I had not heard anything to make me think he was unfit to be mayor.”

Mr. Filner did not respond to a request for an interview.

The episode threatens to further taint the history of a city that is no stranger to scandal. Richard M. Murphy, a Republican mayor, was forced out of office in 2005 in the midst of a pension-underfunding crisis that led San Diego to earn the nickname Enron-by-the-Sea.

Mr. Filner is finding little support among Democrats as he tries to hold his ground here. Several Democrats, even while applauding his politics, said the dearth of support was testimony to the reputation of a man known for bringing his abrasive manner from Washington, where he was charged with assault and battery of an airline employee after he tried to force his way into a secure area of Dulles airport to grab his bag, here to San Diego. (He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in the airport incident.)

“Mayor Filner has lost the confidence of San Diegans to lead,” said Representative Susan A. Davis, a Democrat from San Diego. “He has taken advantage of the trust the voters placed in him and lost both the promise and capacity to ignite positive change. His behavior, if not illegal, is reprehensible.”"

Story highlights John Avlon: It's telling and sad that IRS workers were on lookout for ""patriot"" groups ""Patriot"" is a word whose meaning has been corrupted by extremists, he says Avlon: Past decade has seen exploding number of ""patriot"" paramilitary groups

Editor’s Note: John Avlon, a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast, is the author of “Independent Nation” and “Wingnuts.” He won the National Society of Newspaper Columnists’ award for best online column in 2012.

(CNN) —

On Memorial Day, we honor those patriots who gave “the last full measure of devotion” – in Abraham Lincoln’s words – and died defending our freedom and union.

But this Memorial Day is partly clouded by the resurgence of partisan scandal in Washington. At the IRS, employees filtered through the exploding number of tax exemption applications by politically associated organizations by being on the lookout for groups that had the name “Tea Party” and “Patriot” in their name. This was improper, illegal, unethical and outrageous.

But hold on – when did the word “patriot” become a partisan pejorative? How did such a bipartisan positive word get identified as a sign of hyperpartisan politics?

Newsweek John Avlon

It’s actually an interesting story.

Over the past few years, you might have noticed more than few political fundraising e-mails addressing you as “Fellow Patriot.” They ain’t from the ACLU. They tend to be from conservative activist groups, and there is more than a little self-congratulation in their tribal identifier.

The idea, of course, is that their fellow travelers on the right side of the aisle are the “real” patriots – related to Sarah Palin’s “Real Americans” – defenders of a political faith and traditional way of life under attack by liberals, Democrats, demographics and above all, President Barack Obama.

The fact that many of these self-styled superpatriots seem to hate their twice-elected president is itself a sign of just how dumb the false dualities that dominate our politics can be.

But it’s nothing new. Like so many themes in our politics, there are echoes of the past in our present debates. Going back to at least the virulently anti-Catholic “Know-Nothing” Party of the 1800s, conservative populists have always styled themselves as superpatriots whose commitment to our country outpaces their neighbors and especially our country’s newest arrivals.

There has always been an anxiety – most recently articulated by Pat Buchanan and Anne Coulter – that immigration will change the complexion and cultural character of our country. It has always been ultimately exposed as xenophobia poising as patriotism.

Three of my grandparents arrived to the United States more or less a century ago from Southern Europe, and they were derided as “garlic eaters” and far worse by some earlier immigrants, but welcomed with open arms by many more. Their achievement of the American Dream is why I proudly count myself as an almost cheesy patriot of the Norman Rockwell variety.

But history teaches us to be wary of people who lord their patriotism over others and use it to divide rather than unite.

The precursors to some of today’s more cultish conservative groups emerged during post-war anxiety about the legitimate threat of communism and the McCarthy-ite excesses that flowed out of that era’s right wing politics. The us-against-them, “enemy within” rhetoric of the John Birch Society endures today in the polemics of Glenn Beck, Alex Jones and others.

The early growth of self-styled paramilitary groups began in the early 1960s during the presidency of John F. Kennedy – a committed Cold Warrior, but not incidentally a Catholic and a Democrat.

The “Minutemen” were one such group who thrived off survivalist drills and a supposed plan to “confiscate all private firearms by the end of 1965.”

We hear similar strains of fearmongering today in the attempts to block the universal gun background check bill. Notably, the Minutemen’s founder, Robert Bolivar DePugh, briefly tried to form a political party called – you guessed it – The Patriot Party. They fell into some discredit when DePugh’s followers were implicated in a half-baked plot to attack the United Nations.

At the time, former President Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, felt compelled to weigh in by saying, “I don’t think the United States needs Super-Patriots. … We need patriotism, honestly practiced by all of us and we don’t need these people [who pretend to be] more patriotic than you or anybody else.”

Ike’s advice was good then and now.

He had the credibility that comes from leading our troops in World War II. Nobody with half a brain was going to accuse him of being anything less than a full-fledged patriot (which didn’t stop the founder of the John Birch Society from accusing him of being a Soviet agent just as Obama is called a Muslim Marxist by some today.)

Over the past decade, we’ve seen the explosive growth of paramilitary style “patriot” groups – to more than 1,000 according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. This dynamic definitely didn’t help the word “patriot” recover its bipartisan bona fides. Neither did the impulse of some on the far left since the late 1960s to denigrate patriotism and military service as signs of what they call American imperialism.

The fact that the word “patriot” was used as a filter by IRS workers is a sign of the persistence of culture wars in our politics, perhaps more prevalent now than ever because of the rise of partisan media.

It is a deep breach of the trust that the IRS has struggled to rebuild since the audit scandals of the Nixon administration. And it is a particular irony that the completely inappropriate partisan filter they used will no doubt actually impede investigations of what might ultimately be revealed to be a more widespread scandal – the illegal abuse of tax-free status by partisan political groups. But the damage has been done.

When the word “patriot” becomes a pejorative, it is a sign of how much our shared civic faith has been denigrated by the rise of hyperpartisan politics.

The very emotion that should unite us all as Americans is too often used as a wedge to divide us. On this Memorial Day, that’s worth reflection and a determination to do better as one small way of honoring those whose sacrifice makes all our bitter political battles seem small and self-indulgent.

Mayor Vincent C. Gray stepped away from his role as scandal-scarred leader and into the spotlight as agitator in chief against the federal shutdown during a dramatic confrontation on the Capitol steps Wednesday with Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid.

It was a new public posture for an embattled mayor whose 2010 campaign remains under federal investigation — but who is now fighting to keep the District government in business by exempting it from the ongoing shutdown.

“Sir, we are not a department of the government,” the mayor told Reid after concluding his news event and then crashing another about 50 yards away, where Reid and other Senate Democrats were talking to reporters. “We’re simply trying to be able to spend our own money.”

Reid (Nev.) responded defensively in front of a bank of cameras and reporters: “I’m on your side. Don’t screw it up, okay? Don’t screw it up.”

The tension came after the Republican-controlled House voted last week to pass a bill allowing the District to use its locally raised tax funds to maintain operations until Dec. 15. Democrats, including Reid and President Obama, have held fast in opposition to piecemeal funding bills, saying Republicans must come to a deal to fund the entire government, not just favored segments.

Caption Nearly half of the lawmakers have refused or donated their shutdown salaries, with many regarding it unseemly to collect a paycheck while their actions deprived more than 800,000 Americans of theirs. But some lawmakers have been vocal about their plans to keep their pay. Here are a few. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) Murray spokesman Matt McAlvanah said the senator previously supported a measure that would have suspended all lawmakers’ pay during any such shutdown. That measure passed the Senate but was never taken up by the House. “She continues to support that approach,” McAlvanah told the Associated Press.

But the national Democrats’ posture against a stand-alone District funding bill has stoked the flames of the city’s long-standing gripes about its treatment at the hands of Congress, which controls all District appropriations, even those related to locally generated tax receipts. It has placed leaders of the overwhelmingly Democratic city at odds with national politicians from their party, who have generally supported local priorities in the past but have on occasion sacrificed the city’s interests in national political fights.

The moment also raised new questions about Gray’s political future. He must decide in coming weeks whether he will seek a second term in 2014; his impassioned defense of the District on Wednesday offered new evidence that he continues to consider an electoral bid despite the ongoing federal corruption investigation into his 2010 campaign. Gray has not been charged and has denied any wrongdoing in the investigation, which centers on a D.C. businessman who allegedly funded a half-million-dollar shadow campaign on the mayor’s behalf.

The shutdown, meanwhile, gives the media — and the mayor — something else to talk about.

To manage the crisis — during which the District is unable to spend its roughly $6 billion in yearly local revenue — Gray and the D.C. government have tapped a $144 million contingency cash reserve fund to keep its 32,000 employees on the job since the federal shutdown took effect Oct. 1. But the city has frozen many of its outgoing payments to conserve the contingency account, which is expected to be exhausted sometime next week.

At their own news conference on the Capitol grounds Wednesday, Gray and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) highlighted the partisan contradictions while detailing the drastic effect of the cash crunch on the D.C. government — including schools, health care, services for the disabled and programs for senior citizens.

“Democrats, at this critical moment, have abandoned their long-held principles,” Norton said, calling it “shameful . . . to hold the city’s local funds hostage to make a federal point.”

In a particular jab at Democrats, the event featured remarks from Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who called on Reid and his allies to pass a D.C. funding bill — and at one point alluded to a favored bit of tea party rhetoric.

Issa commented that he couldn’t help but notice that the city’s license plates say “Taxation Without Representation,” then added, “Perhaps they should say, ‘Federal government, don’t tread on me’ instead.”

Gray thanked Issa for his support and told a supportive crowd of hundreds to push Democrats to “act now” on a D.C. funding bill. As soon as the event wrapped up, Gray walked over to the separate event being held by Senate Democrats on the east steps of the Capitol.

Gray cut his way through a bank of TV cameras and walked up to Reid and began speaking with him as senators from Maryland and Virginia explained to reporters the economic hardship facing the two states bordering the nation’s capital.

Democratic Sens. Benjamin L. Cardin (Md.) and Timothy M. Kaine (Va.), in particular, had to raise their voices to be heard over ralliers who had attended Gray’s event and then turned their attention toward the senators, yelling chants of “Free D.C.!”

Reid took questions from reporters, including one about whether the Senate would vote on a D.C. funding measure. “Talk to the Republicans. They’re the ones objecting,” Reid said.

With cameras rolling, Gray, standing a few paces to Reid’s right, stared at the Senate leader. As the news conference concluded and Reid began to walk back into the Capitol, Gray approached the Senate leader again and offered his remarks, prompting the “Don’t screw it up” comment.

Local television reporters began shouting at Reid: “What does ‘Don’t screw it up’ mean?”

Reid ignored them and, surrounded by aides and security guards, walked away, at one point telling reporters that “of course” he supports giving the District the budgetary flexibility needed to continue operating during the partial shutdown.

Gray said afterward that the encounter had been entirely unplanned and that he did not know that Senate Democrats would be having a media event.

Norton left a few minutes later after being approached by Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.), who was heard saying, “We’ve got your back.”

After Reid left the steps, Gray got into a heated exchange with Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who attempted to explain the Hill Democrats’ position to him.

“We’ve got to open up this government for all the good people in D.C., Maryland, Virginia,” she said.

Gray replied: “We’re just asking to spend our own money — our own money, not the federal money.”"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/28/white-house-denies-staffer-threatened-watergate-journalist-woodward/,2013-02-28 00:00:00,[],"Former Clinton aide, columnist joins Woodward in claiming White House threat","Another member of the Washington political media stepped forward Thursday to claim he was threatened by the Obama White House, shortly after the White House denied reports that an adviser threatened famed Watergate journalist Bob Woodward.

The latest claim comes from Lanny Davis, who served as counsel to former President Bill Clinton and later went on to write a column for The Washington Times. In a radio interview on WMAL, Davis said that a ""senior Obama White House official"" once called his editor at the Times and said that if the paper continued to run his columns, ""his reporters would lose their credentials.""

Davis said he ""couldn't imagine why this call was made"" since he's an Obama supporter.

But he called the alleged threat ""unfortunate.""

The account comes after Woodward claimed Wednesday night that a White House aide sent him an email saying he would ""regret"" his recent reporting on the sequester battle. The aide was not identified, but an official familiar with the exchange told Fox News it was National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling -- the tone of the email was rather mixed, as it also included an apology. That was after Woodward wrote a column this past weekend claiming Obama was trying to re-write history -- regarding not only whose idea the sequester was, but also how it would take effect.

Woodward wrote that based on his reporting earlier in the budget battle, the president was trying to move the goalposts by trying to replace the sequester with a mix of tax hikes and spending cuts -- instead of solely spending cuts.

After Politico reported late Wednesday that Woodward was coming forward to claim he was threatened, a White House aide denied the claim.

""Of course no threat was intended,"" wrote the White House aide. ""As Mr. Woodward noted, the email from the aide was sent to apologize for voices being raised in their previous conversation. The note suggested that Mr. Woodward would regret the observation he made regarding the sequester because that observation was inaccurate, nothing more. And Mr. Woodward responded to this aide's email in a friendly manner.""

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Thursday that Woodward and Obama's advisers merely ""had a factual disagreement that I think we stand by.""

He stressed that it's clear nobody was threatening anybody, and that the tone was ""respectful.""

According to Politico, Woodward said he was ""yelled at"" by an Obama aide over his weekend column in the Post. Then, he said he received a page-long email from the aide -- apparently Sperling -- that said: ""I apologize for raising my voice in our conversation today. ... You're focusing on a few specific trees that give a very wrong impression of the forest. But perhaps we will just not see eye to eye here. ... I think you will regret staking out that claim.""

Animosity between Woodward and the Obama team is rising, as the journalist has repeatedly needled the administration on its sequester talking points. His reporting bolstered claims that the sequester idea originated at the White House. And this week, he called the administration's handling of the cuts ""madness.""

Former Obama adviser David Plouffe tweeted Wednesday: ""Watching Woodward last 2 days is like imagining my idol Mike Schmidt facing live pitching again. Perfection gained once is rarely repeated.""
