http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/opinion/krugman-the-obamacare-shock.html,2013-05-27 00:00:00,['Paul Krugman'],The Obamacare Shock - The New York Times,"The Affordable Care Act, a k a Obamacare, goes fully into effect at the beginning of next year, and predictions of disaster are being heard far and wide. There will be an administrative “train wreck,” we’re told; consumers will face a terrible shock. Republicans, one hears, are already counting on the law’s troubles to give them a big electoral advantage.

No doubt there will be problems, as there are with any large new government initiative, and in this case, we have the added complication that many Republican governors and legislators are doing all they can to sabotage reform. Yet important new evidence — especially from California, the law’s most important test case — suggests that the real Obamacare shock will be one of unexpected success.

Before I can explain what the news means, I need to make a crucial point: Obamacare is a deeply conservative reform, not in a political sense (although it was originally a Republican proposal) but in terms of leaving most people’s health care unaffected. Americans who receive health insurance from their employers, Medicare or Medicaid — which is to say, the vast majority of those who have any kind of health insurance at all — will see almost no changes when the law goes into effect.

There are, however, millions of Americans who don’t receive insurance either from their employers or from government programs. They can get insurance only by buying it on their own, and many of them are effectively shut out of that market. In some states, like California, insurers reject applicants with past medical problems. In others, like New York, insurers can’t reject applicants, and must offer similar coverage regardless of personal medical history (“community rating”); unfortunately, this leads to a situation in which premiums are very high because only those with current health problems sign up, while healthy people take the risk of going uninsured."

If there were problems, the president predicted, they would be “glitches.”

And he said, “If you like the plan you have, you can keep it.”

Such claims have come back to haunt the president and his allies less than a month into the launch of the online insurance marketplaces at the heart of his healthcare legislation. With the federal website hobbled by bad design and thousands of policyholders receiving cancellation notices, Obama’s promises are not being met — prompting charges of deception from some Republicans and concessions from some allies that elements of the law were oversold.

The fallout is only the latest chapter in this White House’s three-year struggle to sell the public on the Affordable Care Act, which could come to define the president’s legacy. Since signing it into law, the president has variously defended it, promoted it, simplified it and hyped it. But polling shows he has never fully sold, nor educated, the public on the vast new government healthcare program.

Publicly, the White House continued Tuesday to defend the president’s pre-launch salesmanship.

“The purpose here wasn’t to do anything beyond encourage people to make themselves aware of the options available to them,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said.

Behind closed doors, some officials who worked on the rollout say they wish they’d left themselves a little wiggle room. They could have done more to play up ways to sign up other than through the website, such as the call centers, said one official, requesting anonymity to discuss the planning process.

After taking heat from allies for not finding a crisp way to explain the complex law, the White House tried to boil it down to its simplest elements, the official said, and some nuance was inevitably lost.

The first administration official to testify before Congress on the matter apologized Tuesday, saying, “the website has not worked as well as it should.”

“This initial experience has not lived up to our expectations or the expectations of the American people, and it is not acceptable,” Marilyn Tavenner, the head of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told the House Ways and Means Committee.

Tavenner’s agency oversaw the development of the site, intended to link consumers with affordable private health insurance plans that meet standards outlined in the 2010 law. Tavenner vowed that the site would be running smoothly by the end of November, in time for consumers to enroll before the new year.

But for the first time since the Oct. 1 launch, criticism of the administration moved well beyond the website’s technical troubles. Hundreds of thousands of people who buy insurance on the individual market have received notices that their policies will be canceled or amended — and their premiums on new policies could rise.

PHOTOS: The battle over Obamacare

The notices are a result of provisions in the law that created new minimum requirements for health insurance coverage sold in the individual market. Under the Affordable Care Act, policies sold or renewed after Jan. 1 must cover maternity care and mental health. They cannot deny coverage because of preexisting conditions, or charge higher premiums based on gender. Plans that don’t meet such standards are grandfathered in — but only if they were bought before the law was signed in March 2010 and have not changed since that time.

For experts, these adjustments were a long-expected outcome of the law’s attempt to regulate a market that some argue offered shoddy coverage and kept premiums low by discriminating against sick people. Roughly 5% of the population — or about 15 million people — buy plans on the individual market.

“It was always expected that once the clock struck midnight on Dec. 31, that the rules of the game in the individual insurance market would change, and that meant that policies sold under the old rules could no longer be offered,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president and health policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Although experts on the law expected the changes for that slice of Americans, the White House and the president continued to insist otherwise.

In June 2012, the president made that his first point in comments on the Supreme Court’s decision affirming the law. “First, if you’re one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance — this law will only make it more secure and more affordable,” he said.

Critics pounced on the comments Tuesday, accusing the White House and administration officials of deceiving the public about the law.

Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) grilled Tavenner on the issue.

“The whitehouse.gov website says, if you want to keep the health insurance that you’ve got, you can keep it, and now they’re being told they can’t. That’s a lie,” the Illinois Republican said.

The White House noted that the vast majority of insured people, who get insurance through their employer or through Medicare or Medicaid, will not see any changes to their plans. Officials also argued that insurers have some leeway in how and when they alter the plans to meet the new standards. Many are offering new policies and also informing consumers that they may be eligible for subsidies through healthcare.gov.

“They want to keep these people enrolled,” said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group.

Still, the issue is likely to continue, particularly as the website troubles keep the White House from countering the criticism with signs of successful enrollment on a large scale.

And Democratic allies acknowledged that the president could be more careful with his pitch.

The president’s statement about keeping insurance was “not precise enough,” House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) told reporters Tuesday.

“I don’t think the message was wrong. I think the message was accurate. It was not precise enough … [it] should have been caveated with ‘assuming you have a policy that in fact does do what the bill is designed to do.’”

Sen. Joe Manchin, a frequent Democratic critic of the law, said the administration’s “don’t worry” mantra has worn thin: “Well, people back in West Virginia are worried now.”

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/20/Harry-Reid-s-Obamacare-Act-What-s-Good-for-Thee-is-Not-Good-for-Me,2013-09-20 00:00:00,['Michael Patrick Leahy'],Harry Reid's Obamacare Act: 'What's Good for Thee is Not Good for Me',"On Tuesday Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) indicated on the floor of the Senate he was “open to having a vote” on Senator David Vitter’s (R-LA) amendment to eliminate the Obamacare exemption for members of Congress, according to a Breitbart source on Capitol Hill. Today, however, he and his Democratic colleagues are singing a different tune, and the lyrics come straight from that timeless phrase used by hypocrites throughout American history: “What’s good for thee is not good for me.”

In early September, Reid defended the exemption to Obamacare granted to members of Congress and their staffers by the Office of Personnel and Management on August 7. As Heritage’s The Foundry pointed out, “there is no statutory authority, either in Obamacare or in Title V of the U.S Code, for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to make government insurance contributions on behalf of federal employees to any plan other than an FEHBP plan.”

But when Vitter introduced his No Washington Exemption from Obamacare Amendment on September 12, Reid was forced to make a decision on whether it should be brought to a vote. As Majority Leader of the Senate, Reid exercises power by determining what bills will come to a vote in committees and before the full Senate.

Reid has indicated from the outset that he opposes Vitter’s amendment, but he has attempted to maintain the public fiction that the amendment would receive the same treatment as any amendment proposed by any member of the Senate.

Despite significant evidence to the contrary, Reid continues to insist that the Congressional exemption authorized by the Office of Personnel Management is contained within the law. But on Tuesday, Vitter called the Congressional Obamacare exemption “flat out against the law,” and that exposure of Reid’s blatant hypocrisy may have been too much for the Majority Leader to take.

When Senate Democrats subsequently prevented Vitter’s amendment from coming to a vote, Vitter took to the floor of the Senate and delivered a statement that called Reid out on his hypocrisy. “After freaking out last Thursday with threats and bribery, this week Harry Reid said he’s fine with an up-or-down vote on my No Washington Exemption from Obamacare Amendment. I guess that was just a weak attempt at disguising his fear about losing his special exemption,” he said.

According to a statement issued by his office on Thursday, “Vitter’s amendment would reverse and clarify the decision by the Office of Personnel and Management (OPM) on Obamacare. The legislation will require that all Members of Congress, the President, Vice President, and all political appointees in the Administration must purchase their health insurance on the Obamacare Exchange without the help of taxpayer-funded subsidies. Congressional staff would be prohibited from receiving any contribution greater than what they would receive if they were not employed by a congressional office.”

Tea party stalwart Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) are co-sponsors of the Vitter amendment, along with Senators Mike Enzi (R-WY), Dean Heller (R-V), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Jim Inhofe (R-OK)."

WASHINGTON -- Contrary to the cliché, there are second acts in politics. They just don’t usually come two months after the first.



On Nov. 30, the Obama administration will have a second chance to showcase its capacity to administer a website and oversee health care reform. Senior officials in the administration are quick to insist that the date is merely a point on a calendar, not a moment when a switch is suddenly flipped and all the problems surrounding Obamacare disappear.



But as a political matter, they also understand the scrutiny that comes after Nov. 30 will be heightened, and the stakes a bit higher. More than one administration official over the course of reporting this article said they fully expect that the first time a consumer encounters an error message on the website on Dec. 1, it will be used as a cudgel by the critics. Senate aides, meanwhile, say it's unclear how long a leash up-for-reelection Democrats would give the president should problems persist. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) may not be able to keep legislation reforming the Affordable Care Act off the floor absent major, tangible improvements.

And so, as they enter , White House aides and ideological allies are taking steps to avoid repeating the disastrous first one.

""We are better prepared because the site is a better site,"" said one senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss post-Nov. 30 plans. ""We have visibility into the site, what’s happening with it, how many consumers are coming. It is vastly improved. It will allow us to adapt our tactics and tools to reach consumers in real time. And now, people all across the country have enrolled and we will continue to make sure their stories are told. It is different when you have lots of people enrolled as opposed to day one, when you had some people trying to enroll and who were stuck.""

On a technological level, the administration is far ahead of where it stood on Oct. 1 -- an important but hardly remarkable feat considering how bad things were two months ago. Medicare spokeswoman Julie Bataille said that as of the end of November, approximately 50,000 users will be able to use HealthCare.gov concurrently, which will be the equivalent of more than 800,000 during a day.

If user interest exceeds those numbers, the administration has set up “a customer-friendly queuing system which would notify you when to come back to the site and sort of be first in line,” Jeff Zients, President Barack Obama’s point man for rebuilding the website, told reporters in a Tuesday roundtable.

The White House also hired a general contractor to set up a command center in Columbia, Md., that functions as a 24/7 monitoring and incident response team. The center, which is staffed by 25 people with different areas of expertise in web technology, will work with the White House to troubleshoot and react to incidents that may occur on healthcare.gov, in real-time.

The better the website works, the logic goes, the easier it will be to manage the politics. But even so, the White House is also making administrative adjustments to HealthCare.gov in order to avoid a repeat the agony of those early October days.

One (perhaps the only) unforeseen benefit of the website's disastrous rollout was that interest didn't wane as much as expected over the course of October. In addition to the stream of consumers looking to buy insurance, people wanted to see what the fuss was about -- like drivers who can't help looking at the car wreck across the freeway. So the administrators of the site got a healthy sense of when traffic peaks (around lunchtime) and when it lulls (the weekend). Looking forward, that data will allow them to help keep the number of visits to the site relatively steady.

Hoping to manage Nov. 30th expectations, the administration has already told private insurers to hold back on advertising the exchanges, worrying that heavy traffic could overwhelm the servers. Allies in the progressive community, meanwhile, say they've been told to wait for word from the administration before sending out sign-up alerts to their email lists.

Already, there has been evidence of some success in micromanaging the traffic flow. According to a 39-page “recess toolkit” put together by the White House for Democrats on the Hill, which was shared by an aide with The Huffington Post, the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services was able to invite back, in clusters, nearly 275,000 consumers who had problems during the account creation process in early October. Of those who returned to the site, 92 percent successfully created an account on HealthCare.gov.

Another Democratic Hill aide said the White House is expected to step up its consumer education and outreach in early December, particularly focusing on the 18-to-35-year-old demographic. Next week, for instance, the White House is planning a youth summit to ensure that young leaders understand the benefits of the health care law and help get the word out among their peers. That comes on top of the administration’s ongoing efforts to enlist athletes and celebrities to engage with youth on the law’s benefits.

The White House is also trying to make it easier for Democratic lawmakers to go on offense this time around. In addition to the sending them home for the Thanksgiving recess with a 54-page packet of Affordable Care Act sign-up “success stories,” broken down by all 50 states, administration officials are encouraging Democrats to talk about a new report released by the White House Council of Economic Advisors showing how Obamacare is helping to slow health care costs, in turn helping the economy.

Despite these steps, Democrats in and out of office have a hard time evincing much confidence that the political troubles caused by health care reform will dissipate quickly. Some are hopeful but not yet sold that the administration can successfully manage the next few months after being stunned by the ineptitude they exhibited around the website's launch.

""The website is getting better but it's not fixed,"" said one Democratic lawmaker. ""Don't even get me started on talking points. They should use the time they spend writing useless talking points fixing the website.""

Even the administration acknowledges that success on Dec. 1 means that the website will function for some 80 percent of users. And with 20 percent still in the dark, critical focus will continue -- a scary proposition for many Democrats. One party operative who works on health care reform said that it remains a mystery as to how to respond to accusations that the president misled the public when he pledged that people could keep their insurance plans if they liked them.

""If there are good talking points around that, I haven't heard them,"" the operative said.

Several other operatives, when interviewed for this piece, marveled at how the administration ""lost"" traditional media allies during the October rollout.

Winning them back has proven difficult, though the White House is far better prepared for the media wars now than it was on Oct. 1. A Democratic aide familiar with White House strategy said the administration has given assurances that it will have a beefed-up, rapid-response operation to address new attacks or incorrect stories. They certainly have more manpower.



""You have to remember what happened on Oct. 1,"" said the health care reform operative. ""There was a government shutdown. All the people who would have been part of the rapid response team were furloughed. That lasted for 16 days.""

During the early weeks of October, nearly all the White House staffers chiefly responsible for pushing back against bad press and spreading good health care news were off the job. Eric Schultz, a White press official who worked during the shutdown and has health care reform under his portfolio, was so preoccupied with the shutdown that he was seen running the president's remarks to the podium -- a task usually reserved for a junior staffer.

""The shutdown wasn’t the root cause of the problem,"" commented one administration official, ""but it sure as hell didn’t help.""

According to the poll (pdf), which surveyed American adults between Nov. 18-20 with a margin of error of ±3.5 points:

Most Americans believe Obamacare's current problems will be solved. 54 percent say they believe current problems will be fixed, compared with 43 percent who say they won't be. Most Americans believe it's too early to judge whether Obamacare is a success or failure. A total of 53 percent think it is too early to say whether Obamacare is a success or failure. A total of 39 percent think it's a failure and 8 percent already think it is a success. Most Americans do not support conservative critiques of Obamacare. According to the poll, 41 percent of Americans think Obamacare is too liberal, slightly more than 40 percent who support Obamacare. But 14 percent think it's not liberal enough.

As you might expect, the poll's crosstabs show that most Republicans are certain Obamacare can't be fixed and has already failed, but outside of the GOP universe, people aren't merely open to Obamacare, they are optimistic about its prospects and want it to work.

Obviously, it doesn't matter how open or optimistic the public is if the Obama administration can't ultimately deliver on the promise of Obamacare, but if they do, most Americans are on their side. Republicans have bet everything on failure. If they lose that bet, it will be an absolute political nightmare for them—and it should be."

When it comes to medical care, men always get the short end of the long end of the scope. You see, folks, up until now, health insurance in America has always struck a delicate balance. Women paid higher premiums than men, and in return, men paid less. (audience laughter) The system worked. But now, folks, all that's changing.



STEVE DOOCY (8/27/2013): Obamacare will have men and women paying the same amount for health care, but since women live longer and have babies, shouldn't they pay more? DR. JANE HUGHES (9/24/2013): Under the new law, they're including essential health benefits. And those essential health benefits include maternity, pediatric dental and vision, contraceptive services, and free birth control pills — none of which a young man needs or wants.

Did you catch that? Under Obamacare, men will pay the same amount as women, and yet we still don't get to pass a cantaloupe with toenails through our genitals. (audience laughter)

Fox Business host and Madame Tussauds' wax figure of himself John Stossel reminds us why the ladies should pay more.



JOHN STOSSEL (10/31/2013): You ought to be able to charge people who use the services more, more! ... Women go to the doctor much more often than men. Maybe they're smarter, or maybe they're hypochondriacs. They live longer, who knows?

Yeah, ladies, ladies, come on. No, ladies, ladies love going to the doctor. Who knows why? Maybe they're pretending they're extras on Grey's Anatomy, I don't know. They're suckers for that stuff.

And Fox News chief urologist Dr. David Samadi gives us a real world example of the ladies' doctor addiction.

DAVID SAMADI: Exactly. And you? Last week. GRETCHEN CARLSON: I've had Lyme disease for the last 10 days, so.... DR. DAVID SAMADI: That's what happens. So you're basically paying for her.

It's not fair. And folks, it's no wonder the brown-haired guy who's not Steve Doocy won't go to the doctor, he hates wearing that cone.

And folks, he's not alone. The Fox doc explained the obvious reason why all men always go to the doctor less.



DR. DAVID SAMADI (8/27/2013): We're using the health care system much less. You know, also, our bodies are completely different. ... We only have the prostate. Women have the breasts, they have the ovaries, they have the uterus. They get checked in every part.

USA TODAY

President Obama's extraordinary mea culpa news conference Thursday was about more than making a fix in a provision of the Affordable Care Act.

It was about turning around a downward slide that could threaten the future of his presidency.

For more than three years, congressional Republicans have flailed at the Affordable Care Act with limited success. Now, in the space of six weeks, the administration's own missteps — the botched roll-out of the federal exchange website and the broken promises over consumers being able to keep insurance plans they like — have significantly eroded confidence in Obama's signature legislative achievement and Democratic unity behind it.

What's more, with a string of apologies and some uncomfortable admissions, Obama Thursday fueled questions about his administration's competence and his own leadership, the most fundamental of presidential characteristics.

""There have been times where I thought we got, you know, slapped around a little bit unjustly. This one's deserved, all right? It's on us,"" he said at one point. At another: ""I do make apologies for not having executed better over the last several months."" And one more: ""We fumbled the roll-out on this health care law.""

He said he would delay for a year provisions in the health care law that required insurance companies to end policies that didn't have minimum coverage standards. But the insurance industry warned that step could raise premiums for everyone and state insurance commissioners questioned whether it was even feasible at this late date.

And the revolt on Capitol Hill didn't seem to abate. House Republicans plan to vote Friday on a bill the White House opposes that would allow Americans to keep existing health care plans through 2014. Some Senate Democrats said they hoped to continue with plans for a similar measure.

""What's happened in recent weeks is, I think, a dagger aimed at the heart of Obama's presidency,"" says presidential scholar William Galston of the Brookings Institution, a veteran of the Clinton White House. ""I say that not only because of the centrality of health care reform to the administration's agenda and to his legacy but also because it has posed a direct challenge to his standing as president in the eyes of the American people.""

Obama's approval-disapproval rating was at 42%-52% in the daily Gallup Poll Thursday, in the neighborhood of George W. Bush at this point in his second term and well below the standing of Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan. For the first time in his presidency, a majority of Americans said Obama was not a strong and decisive leader.

Approval of the Affordable Care Act also may be dropping fast. Just a few weeks ago, 44% approved of the law, 47% disapproved. Now just 40% approve and 55% disapprove, the worst in at least a year.

Surely only dire circumstances could have convinced the candidate once known as ""no-drama Obama"" to announce a policy change and then field questions for almost an hour in the White House press room. Not a person given to public introspection or apology, his tone was contrite and even confessional at times.

To be sure, presidents have recovered from serious setbacks before. Reagan faced tough hearings over the Iran-contra scandal but finished his second term with a tax code overhaul and breakthrough agreements with the Soviet Union. Clinton survived impeachment. A booming economy and a falling jobless rate could do a lot to restore Obama's reputation.

If things go as the White House hopes, the HealthCare.gov website will be operating well by the end of this month. By the end of next March, when the sign-up period is scheduled to end, many of those consumers now concerned about losing their current plans will be persuaded that they're better off with a new one.

At the moment, however, the Obamacare landscape is sufficiently rocky that when a reporter asked about about stalled negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, it seemed to be almost a relief.

Time to go on offense, Mr. President.

The Affordable Care Act was designed to make sure all Americans had a certain level of insurance. But TPM has learned that USHealth Group is actively telling consumers that they don't need that minimum level. In fact, company representatives are telling people they'd be better off without it. And the company may be just one player in a larger industry trend, where companies see non-ACA compliant plans, like the so-called fixed benefit coverage marketed by USHealth Group, as a business opportunity. Health care industry analysts have long derided the kinds of non-insurance health care coverage products the company is selling as ""junk insurance."" ""They were not intended to be health insurance,"" Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Health Policy Institute at Georgetown University, told TPM, speaking about fixed benefit plans. ""They were intended to be what are called income replacement policies. ... But over the years, these things have kind of morphed. And for many people, unfortunately, mainly because they come with a cheaper sticker price, they are marketed as and treated as health insurance. Even though the coverage is really crappy."" USHealth Group's pitch is three-fold, according to accounts provided to TPM by Mortimer and another prospective customer. First, it says, it is a misconception that everyone needs ACA-compliant insurance. Second, USHealth Group plans are cheaper than ACA-compliant policies, even after customers pay the tax penalty for failing to comply with the ACA's individual mandate. Third, Obamacare is scary.

Democrats should not be panicking over the relatively tiny number of people losing their junk health insurance plans. They should be loudly and continuously beating up on the insurance companies using Obamacare to trick people into buying new ones. Case in point: USHealth Group What USHealth Group isn't telling would-be customers, what they are, is that these fixed benefit coverage plans, in which the company reimburses customers a fixed amount of money for medical services, don't comply with the law. These plans aren't outlawed by Obamacare, but they don't meet the requirements for coverage. That means that people buying them are just wasting their money, because they will also have to get real coverage and if they don't, they'll have to pay a penalty. They also won't have any coverage if they get sick. One of these kinds of plans, Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation said, is ""not health insurance, in the sense it's going to protect you in any way from going broke.""

Other, only slightly less dastardly, insurers are misleading their customers, canceling policies that otherwise would have been grandfathered in order to get people into new ones that they can charge more for, and not informing customers about their options on the exchanges. The president's administration fix would at least require insurers who do cancel plans to inform people of their options.

It's not too late for Democrats, including President Obama, to go on offense against the insurance companies that are making the roll-out of Obamacare that much more difficult. Obama has met Republicans partway with his ""fix"" for policy cancellations. Now's the time to say enough, and to start reminding people about what insurance companies do and why they made this law so necessary in the first place."

Aside from scrambling to fix the broken HealthCare.gov website, the administration is now trying to deal with the millions of Americans who have received cancellation notices. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the president's team is trying to figure out a way to offer relief to some of those policyholders.

The statement comes after former President Clinton, in an interview with the site Ozy.com, said Obama should live up to his promise to Americans that if they like their health plans, they can keep them.

""So I personally believe, even if it takes a change to the law, the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got,"" Clinton said.

Asked Tuesday if Obama agreed, Carney said: ""The answer's yes.""

More On This...

Carney referred to Obama's comments to NBC News last week, when the president apologized for the cancellation notices and said the administration was looking at a ""range of options"" to address the issue.

But Carney spoke in additional detail on Tuesday, saying the president's team is specifically trying to help those Americans who have been forced off their plans into more expensive coverage which they might struggle to afford.

""The president has tasked his team with looking at a range of options, as he said, to make sure that nobody is put in a position where their plans have been canceled and they can't afford a better plan, even though they'd like to have a better plan,"" Carney said.

It's unclear, though, how the administration could go about doing that. Insurance companies are the ones canceling policies -- due to new requirements under the health care overhaul -- and would likely have to be involved in any effort to restore coverage.

Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman with America's Health Insurance Plans, told FoxNews.com that all the myriad plans to reverse or stop the cancellation notices raise questions about how that would be achieved. He said in many cases, changes to existing policies have already been filed with state regulators and consumers have been notified.

""That's a lot to go back and unwind,"" he said, noting that any modified health plans would have to be reviewed and approved by state regulators.

""That typical process takes many months,"" he said.

The insurance industry generally does not support any delay in the implementation of the ObamaCare insurance mandates, out of concern that a delay would deprive them of much-needed customers at a time when they're dealing with the cost of additional coverage requirements.

But any effort to overhaul the cancellations might require an extended timeframe.

Separately, House Republicans, as well as some Senate Democrats, are planning legislation that would allow people losing their current coverage to keep their plans.

A Senate bill introduced by Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu that would ensure Americans could keep their current health insurance plans was co-sponsored Tuesday by longtime Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.

In his interview Tuesday, Clinton defended the health care law as a whole, but explained how the broken promise on health coverage can hurt young people. He relayed the story of a young man who said his individual market plan was canceled and replaced with one whose premiums were twice as high. Though his deductibles and co-pays were lower, that savings is only realized if he gets sick, Clinton explained.

Obama, in explaining the cancellation notices, has clarified that under ObamaCare, policies could be canceled if they had been altered in any way since the passage of the law.

That nuance was not included in the president's initial explanations.

The administration argues that while some are losing their current coverage, those plans will be replaced by better-quality insurance. The flip side is that they could be more expensive."

Now, in the ten weeks since the launch of Healthcare.gov, the ill-trained Navigators have put Americans’ sensitive health and tax information at risk.

Breitbart News has obtained a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee report on the Obamacare Navigators that will be released Monday. It has found that Obamacare Navigators have been giving Americans misinformation and, in some cases, actively encouraging enrollees to commit fraud in order to raise their subsidies. To complicate matters further, there is no way for Americans to find out whether their Navigators are properly certified.

Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said at a Congressional hearing that it was “possible” for convicted felons to become Navigators. The report, titled Risks of Fraud and Misinformation with ObamaCare Outreach Campaign: How Navigator and Assister Program Mismanagement Endangers Consumers, concludes that is only one of many worries Americans should have about Navigators.

The Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), and HHS actually learned that “poorly-trained Navigators gave consumers incorrect information about the health care exchanges, violated HHS rules and procedures, and even encouraged applicants to commit tax fraud in some instances.” Moreover, this was learned from various news reports due to the complete lack of any internal oversight.

On November 21, the Obama administration briefed the Committee. Those in attendance included Gary Cohen, the Deputy Administrator and Director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), and Mandy Cohen, Director of the Consumer Support Group at CCIIO.

The Committee report concluded that “documents call into question the effectiveness of the Navigator program and the Obama administration’s ability to safeguard consumer information.” HHS’s mismanagement of the Navigator and Assister programs “induces fraudulent behavior and poses real threats to the safety of consumers’ personally identifiable information, such as one’s social security number, yearly income, and other sensitive tax information,” the report found.

The report also discovered that Obamacare Navigators have “encouraged consumers to commit tax fraud by underreporting income in order to qualify for ObamaCare’s health insurance subsidies.” Some have “assisted applicants before completing their 5 to 20 hour online training course, and others took custody of paper applications and mailed them for the applicant, violating the rule that applicants must mail in the application themselves.”

For instance, the Committee found:

Navigators from the Urban League of Dallas were captured on video encouraging applicants to lie on their health insurance application so the applicants could qualify for tax subsidies. Navigators were also recorded advising an applicant to lie about her smoking habits to obtain a lower monthly premium. It was later discovered that two of the so-called Navigators involved in the incident were assisting consumers with their applications even though they had not completed their training and certification requirements.

One self-identified Navigator gave a television interview in which she told viewers blatantly incorrect information–that applicants’ credit scores could impact their eligibility for certain plans. It later came to light that the woman was not a certified Navigator but rather a volunteer with a Navigator organization.

Mountain Project, Inc., a Navigator organization in North Carolina, has been collecting and mailing paper applications on behalf of applicants, in violation of Navigator rules and procedures.

The report found that HHS officials responsible for the Navigator program did not learn of the aforementioned incidents from internal oversight procedures, but rather from news reports.

Yet the Obama administration still does not plan to implement a “secret shopper” program to monitor Navigators. HHS officials have put together “webinars” for Navigators, but they are voluntary and do not cover specific details.

The report also found that because the Obama administration did not warn Navigators that there could be problems with the HealthCare.Gov website, “Navigators were essentially useless” when the website crashed and had problems. To make matters worse, notes from an October 11, 2013 meeting state that the Navigators were encouraging potential enrollees to use paper applications they knew may not bring applicants quicker results “to protect their reputations as people in the communities who can help.”

The Committee found that this “push towards the use of paper applications further increases security risks, since health insurance exchange applications contain personally identifiable information such as the applicant’s full name, social security number, the names and social security numbers of everyone in the applicant’s household, and income for every member of the household.”

The report also concluded that Navigators were also unprepared to handle situations in which consumers mentioned unreported income because the Obama administration did not even anticipate such situations. Gary Cohen, the director of the agency overseeing the Navigators, previously stated, “this could be one of the areas where it is a little beyond the ability of your average Navigator,” when asked whether Navigators knew how to deal with Americans who may be engaging in tax fraud or intending to under-report income.

Though Cohen “admitted there is a need for better training on the issue through the ongoing education process” and did not rule out “requiring Navigators to report tax fraud in the future,” the Obama administration “has not taken the necessary steps to prevent this type of tax fraud.” The report found that Navigators have not even been provided with a document on how to handle potential tax fraud issues that may arise.

Navigators, the report also found, “lack guidance about how to comply with the Voting Rights Act, which requires that federal government applications provide the opportunity for applicants to indicate their interest in registering to vote.”

And though Cohen told the Committee staff that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “[keep] a list of certified Navigators, which, as of mid-November, numbered 2,500 individuals,” the list is private, which means Americans do not have a way to know if their Navigators are actually even certified. That also allows Navigator organizations to “misrepresent the qualifications of an individual who is associated with that organization but is not a certified Navigator,” the committee found.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/31/Half-Of-Obamacare-Enrollees-Have-Yet-To-Pay,2013-12-31 00:00:00,['Wynton Hall'],Half of Obamacare 'Enrollees' Have Yet to Pay,"Half of the people who have signed up for Obamacare in 17 states have not activated their health insurance plans by making their first premium payment, a trend that threatens to further embarrass and frustrate President Barack Obama and the highly unpopular Obamacare program.

Health insurance plans purchased through Obamacare only kick in once a customer pays their first month’s premium. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that “only about half of enrollees billed for plans offered by more than 100 insurers in 17 states had paid their first month’s premium,” according to Benaissance chief strategy officer Mark Waterstraat, whose firm serves as a third-party billing company for insurers. Another insurer, Scott & White Health Plan, told the Journal that only 35% of its enrollees have paid for the plans they applied for.

The Obama administration remains far behind its 7 million enrollment target but has recently celebrated what it calls two million Obamacare “enrollments.” Yet that figure merely reflects the number of applications submitted, not the number of paying customers who have turned on their plans by actually paying for coverage. Whether insurers in the other 33 states are experiencing nonpayment rates in the 35% to 50% range is presently unknown. If those rates extended nationally, they would mean the Obama administration’s claim that it has enrolled two million people in Obamacare would plunge to just 700,000 to one million.

Even progressive groups like the left-leaning journalism group ProPublica say the emergence of an Obamacare nonpayment gap raises “the prospect that actual enrollment will be far lower than the figures HHS [Health and Human Services] is releasing.”

Part of the problem may be the costs of the plans offered through Obamacare. A recent USA Today analysis found that over half of all counties in the 34 states on the federal HealthCare.gov exchange “lack even a bronze plan that’s affordable by the government’s own definition.”

“There is also a lot of worrying going on over people making payments,” industry consultant Robert Laszewski told ProPublica.

Experts say that first-time insurance buyers may not fully understand the duties and responsibilities that come with ownership. A recent study published in the Journal of Health Economics found that only 14% of individuals who have health coverage could correctly answer all four of four basic questions about health insurance, including understanding what a “deductible” and “copay” mean. If comprehension levels are that low for those who already have insurance, analysts worry what that might mean for first-time insurance purchasers, especially for a program as complex as Obamacare.

Persistence of the Obamacare nonpayment trend would pose serious challenges for the Obama administration’s ability to hit its goal of seven million paying customers by the end of March.

According to the latest CNN poll, support for Obamacare is now at a record low 35%.

Obamacare will cost U.S. taxpayers $2.6 trillion over the next ten years."
http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/30/politics/obamacare-white-house-pressure/,2013-10-30 00:00:00,"['Drew Griffin', 'Chris Frates', 'Cnn Special Investigations Unit']",Sources: White House told insurance execs to keep quiet on Obamacare,"Story highlights Insurance company executives say they got calls from White House after speaking out A trade group leader says the Obama administration ""is exerting massive pressure"" A White House spokesman calls the accusation ""preposterous and inaccurate""

(CNN) —

White House officials have pressured insurance industry executives to keep quiet amid mounting criticism over Obamacare’s rollout, insurance industry sources told CNN.

Sebelius: ‘I apologize, I’m accountable’ for Obamacare website flaws

After insurance officials publicly criticized the implementation, White House staffers contacted insurers to express their displeasure, industry insiders said.

Multiple sources declined to speak publicly about the push back because they fear retribution.

But Bob Laszewski, who heads a consulting firm for big insurance companies, did talk on the record.

“The White House is exerting massive pressure on the industry, including the trade associations, to keep quiet,” he said.

Laszewski, who’s been a vocal critic of Obamacare, said he’s been asked by insurance executives to speak out because they feel defenseless against an administration that is regulating their business – and a big customer.

Government-backed plans accounted for about half of health care policies last year, a number that is expected to grow over the years.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the idea that administration officials are trying to silence insurance industry insiders is “preposterous and inaccurate.” He added that Laszewski has been a vocal critic of health care reform for two decades.

“Plus, it ignores the fact that every day insurance companies are out talking about the law – in large part because they are trying to reach millions of new customers who will now have new affordable insurance options available from providers through the new Market Places,” Carney said.

Obama and his top advisers have acknowledged problems with the health care website.

On Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was the latest administration official to apologize for the bungled rollout.

Yet she and other officials continue to argue that once they are fully up and running, the insurance exchanges will benefit Americans.

But Obama also has been accused of breaking his promise that people who like their current plans can keep them. Insurers have begun discontinuing policies that don’t meet Obamacare’s beefed up coverage requirements.

Laszewski said insurance company officials are embarrassed that they have to cancel plans and force people into more robust, and possibly more expensive, coverage.

Keep your plan? Maybe not

Insurers, he said, warned the White House that the regulations would lead to discontinued policies.

“One of the things I think is clear here is the Obama administration has no trust in anything the health insurance industry is telling them about how to run a health plan,” Laszewski said.

The White House called the subpoena ""unfortunate and unnecessary"" and said that Park was busy fixing the website. The White House earlier had said he was willing to appear voluntarily in December. ""We had hoped the committee would work with us to find an alternative date to give Todd time to focus on the immediate task at hand: getting the website fixed,"" said Rick Weiss, a spokesman for the White House Office of Science and Technology. ""We are reviewing the subpoena and will respond as appropriate,"" Weiss said. Darrell Issa, the California Republican who chairs the committee, told Park that he was the only administration witness at the November 13 hearing who was ""unwilling to appear voluntarily"" and noted that he had taken time out to give an interview to the New York Times in early October. ""Millions of Americans have lost their health insurance,"" Issa wrote in a letter to Park. ""They deserve your sworn testimony before their elected representatives about what went wrong - not simply the media outlets that White House officials have deemed an appropriate use of your time,"" he said. PARK: 'NOT GOING ANYWHERE' The HealthCare.gov website, which launched October 1, was meant to be an easy way for Americans to shop for health insurance and see whether they were eligible for subsidies under President Barack Obama's signature healthcare program. But it has been plagued by myriad technical woes, and contractors and outside experts have been working around the clock to try to make it work by the end of November so that Americans have enough time to sign up for insurance before deadlines in the law. On Friday, Jeffrey Zients, the White House official charged to oversee the fixes, said the website is improving but is still ""a long way from where it needs to be. A successful healthcare IT developer before joining the Obama administration, Park has been part of the scramble to repair the website. Earlier on Friday, the White House had scolded Issa for failing to justify why the hearing with Park could not be slated for December. ""There will be ample time to analyze why the technology behind the website did not perform well initially, and whether there are any lessons learned for federal IT acquisition policy that Congress may want to address,"" said Donna Pignatelli, assistant director for legislative affairs for the Office of Science and Technology Policy in a letter to Issa. ""Mr. Park is not going anywhere,"" Pigantelli had said. (Additional reporting By Karey Van Hall; Editing by Ken Wills)"

On Monday, the crush of consumers prompted the Obama administration to put thousands of applicants on hold and push back another key enrollment deadline to Tuesday. This unexpected move came despite weeks of computer fixes aimed at improving the troubled HealthCare.gov website.

Even in California and other states where enrollment was running more smoothly, plenty of consumers were experiencing snags.

Anibal Manzano, 56, left a clinic in downtown Los Angeles on Monday without signing up because enrollment counselors were stymied by computer delays with the California enrollment system.

The pet groomer said he has never had insurance and wanted to get coverage for himself and his wife. “I’ll come back next week and see if that works out,” he said.

California officials said some technical headaches were inevitable, but the state website was working well enough to have enabled more than 400,000 people to enroll in private health plans as of Sunday. Nearly 30,000 people were picking out coverage daily, not counting thousands more Medi-Cal enrollees.

“The Affordable Care Act is taking off in California, and that bodes well for the nation,” said Peter Lee, executive director of the Covered California exchange. “It’s exciting to see a state coming together and say: ‘Let’s make the Affordable Care Act work. Let’s put politics aside.’”

Even with the late surge, national enrollment in private health plans remains well short of the administration’s goal of roughly 3 million by year end. Federal officials didn’t release new figures Monday.

President Obama said last week that more than half a million Americans had enrolled so far in December using the federal website. That would bring the total enrollment in health plans to more than 1 million as of Friday, including both federal and state-run exchanges. Nationwide, an additional 800,000 people had been deemed eligible for the law’s expanded version of Medicaid through November.

Strong enrollment is crucial, particularly among young and healthier policyholders, to keep insurance premiums affordable in the government-run marketplaces and to fulfill Obama’s goal of dramatically reducing the number of uninsured nationwide.

“It has been a terrible three months for getting this underway. It’s been a real tragedy,” said Timothy Jost, a health policy expert and law professor at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va. “But I think we are turning the corner and things will go a lot more smoothly for the next three months.”

Across the country over the weekend, hundreds of thousands of consumers went online or visited enrollment events to meet a Monday deadline for coverage starting Jan. 1.

Applications will be taken through March 31, when the six-month enrollment window closes. Coverage generally takes effect within a few weeks of signing up.

As the deadline approached, federal officials said, the HealthCare.gov site used by residents of 36 states received 1.2 million visits over the weekend and more than 1 million by late afternoon Monday.

By midday Monday, the federal officials activated a queuing system designed to relieve pressure on the site. Julie Bataille, an administration spokeswoman, said that more than 60,000 visitors had submitted their e-mail addresses to be notified when the site was less busy.

Federal officials and their contractors spent weeks retooling HealthCare.gov after a disastrous launch in October.

In light of the bottlenecks, administration officials extended by 24 hours the deadline to sign up for coverage that will become effective Jan. 1. The White House described the postponement as merely a stop-gap to make sure that no one who is online by midnight Monday would be excluded.

“Anticipating high demand, which we indeed saw starting early [Monday] morning, and the fact that consumers may be enrolling from multiple time zones, we have taken steps to make sure that those who tried to enroll today but had delays due to high traffic have a fail-safe,” Bataille said.

Critics of the healthcare law, however, say the latest deadline shift represents another failure by the Obama administration. And many insurers and consumer advocates have bristled at the ever-changing rules that they said sow even more confusion among the public about a complex healthcare overhaul.

“How can anyone make healthcare decisions today knowing that the law may be unilaterally changed again tomorrow?” House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said last week.

Several state-run exchanges, such as those in California, New York and Kentucky, have been reporting robust enrollment, while states that rely on the federal site have lagged far behind.

But enrollment counselors in California said the state website was slow or unresponsive Monday, often making an application take up to two hours to finish. Wait times to state call centers stretched beyond an hour in some cases, according to Covered California.

Gil Alcala, a state-certified insurance agent in Covina, said he worried about 25 applicants possibly falling through the cracks because the Covered California website wouldn’t let him input data from their paper applications Monday.

“The website is freezing and then I get an error notification,” Alcala said. “They need to push this deadline back again. This is terrible.”

California officials said they were sticking with the Dec. 23 deadline, but they vowed to help anyone who starts an application Monday to get coverage starting Jan. 1.

“We will help people get across the finish line who have started an application [Monday],” Lee said. “If you have made a good-faith effort to get started, you can finish it [Tuesday].”

Los Angeles resident Jeff Norman, 54, tried to beat the deadline and applied last week for Medicaid coverage. But he said he still hadn’t received confirmation of insurance starting Jan. 1. His current coverage through Anthem Blue Cross is being canceled Dec. 31 because it didn’t meet all the requirements of the healthcare law.

Norman needs regular physical therapy on his aching hip and leg, he said. “If I want to get medical services at the beginning of January,” he said, “I don’t know what will happen.”

Story highlights Dean Obeidallah says the administration has done a poor job of explaining Obamacare He says the plan has many popular features, but the public doesn't fully understand it A failure to explain has left room for Republicans to distort it, he says Obeidallah: Administration has belatedly moved to tout the benefits of Obamacare

(CNN) —

Can someone please explain to me the details of Obamacare? And when I say “someone,” I’m looking at you, President Obama – or at least members of your administration.

I can’t fathom how Obama, one of the best orators of modern-day politics, could be such a poor advocate for what’s arguably the crowning legislative achievement of his administration. I can assure you that if there were a law named after me – such as “Obeidallahcare” or “Deanaid” – I would be crisscrossing the country explaining it so people would understand and support it.

Sure, most of us get the broad strokes of the Affordable Care Act commonly known as Obamacare: the individual mandate, coverage for the uninsured, children on parents’ policy until 26, carriers cannot deny you coverage or charge you more due to a pre-existing condition. But the law is close to 1,000 pages and will spur hundreds, if not thousands, of regulations. What else does the law offer, and how will Americans be able to gain access to its benefits?

Will Obamacare help primary care?

Dean Obeidallah

We hear about state health insurance exchanges going into effect in October, but in the same breath we hear that many governors won’t implement them. We hear about the individual mandate obligating everyone to buy health insurance by 2014 or face a penalty, but then we hear the Obama administration has delayed the requirement that employers with more than 50 employees be required to provide health coverage until 2015.

It’s remarkable that there’s such confusion surrounding a piece of legislation signed into law more than three years ago – in March 2010. And I’m far from alone on this. A poll in April found that 40% of Americans didn’t even know if Obamacare is still in effect, which translates into roughly 130 million Americans not even knowing if the law still exists, let alone understanding the details of it.

Even more concerning is that a recent poll of doctors found by a wide margin that they are “not at all familiar” with how certain key provisions of the law will be implemented. And astoundingly, it appears that Democratic members of Congress don’t even fully grasp how Obamacare will be put into effect. That point was made crystal clear when Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, one of the early champions of the law, recently labeled the rollout of Obamacare “a huge train wreck coming down.” In response, Obama’s chief of staff has been spending time over the past three months giving presentations to Democrats in Congress so they can better understand the law.

Who loses out under Obamacare?

What’s even more surprising is that Obama has allowed the void of information from his end to be filled almost unchallenged by Republicans, who have been actively working to define the law in the worst possible terms. Unless Obama is mimicking the rope-a-dope fighting strategy made famous by Muhammad Ali, his administration’s outreach to the public on Obamacare has been an abysmal failure.

The consequence of Obama ceding the battlefield can be seen in a new poll that found 54% of Americans disapprove of the law and a record-high 39% want Congress to repeal it. The poll also found just 13% of Americans say the health care law will personally “help me,” but 38% believe the law will personally “hurt me.”

Maybe it was these poll numbers or perhaps being pushed by members of his own party, but it seems that Obama is finally aware of the public relations nightmare and possible policy failure staring him in the face. The administration has recently started organizing faith-based and community groups to help get out the word. The federal government just launched a multimillion-dollar campaign to educate people about coverage options under Obamacare.

It has even secured the support of the people at the Funny or Die comedy website to produce videos with well-known comedic actors explaining Obamacare – because nothing says “comedy gold” like a law about health insurance.

Obama meets with celebs who want to promote Obamacare

But why didn’t Obama utilize his great communication skills to explain this law to us sooner? Why hasn’t he traveled across the country waging something akin to his election campaign to sell his program?

And it’s not like Obama doesn’t see the value in taking his ideas directly to the American public to build support. Indeed, we saw Obama use this very tactic last week as he kicked off the first of a series of speeches regarding his proposals to strengthen and grow the economy. The president did mention Obamacare in that speech, pointing out that “the states that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down. Just last week, New York announced that premiums for consumers who buy their insurance in these online marketplaces will be at least 50% less than what they pay today.”

And what’s even more bizarre is that polls show strong support for many key provisions of Obamacare. The president could have (and should have) been touting these popular parts of the law for years, given that 61% of Americans favor allowing children to stay on the policy until they are 26 and 82% like the ban on insurance carriers from denying coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.

Could it be that Obama isn’t waging such a campaign because even he can’t explain this mammoth program in a way that will attract support? Is it possible that the president’s idealistic dream of what Obamacare was intended to be has been replaced three years later by an administrative nightmare?

The real reason why the Obama administration has remained largely invisible as Republicans have pummeled Obamacare may never truly be known. But it’s clear that Obamacare needs a massive infusion of PR care if it is going to succeed.

Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) wasn’t sure. The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee’s health subcommittee referred on Wednesday to criticism that “Republicans are trying for the 38th or 39th time to repeal Obamacare.”

Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) observed that “my good friend, the chairman, couldn’t even reference exactly how many times they’ve tried to repeal it.”

But let’s not pick on Brady. All the tallies fall well short of the actual number of times Congress has voted to repeal all or part of Obamacare. It has done that — are you sitting down? — 67 times.

According to The Washington Post’s fact checker, Glenn Kessler, there were 37 votes to scale back Obamacare before Wednesday’s two votes in the House. But those 39 don’t include the Senate, where Reid’s office has documented 28 votes, all but a couple in the form of Republican amendments. This might explain the new findings that Congress is holding more votes than ever but passing fewer bills.

Wednesday’s 66th and 67th attempts went much like the previous 65, except for a mid-debate recess so that lawmakers could have their official photograph taken on the House floor.

“This bill is unraveling before us,” exulted Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).

Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Tex.) reported that “the train is not coming off the rails; it’s already off the rails.”

On the Democratic side, Rep. John Dingell (Mich.) responded by saying, “Einstein observed that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again with the full expectation that the results are going to be different.” Actually, the quote is probably apocryphal — but Einstein didn’t live to see the 113th Congress.

The proposals on the floor Wednesday were relatively mild: One codified the delay in the law’s employer mandate already announced by the Obama administration, and one extended the delay to the individual mandate. And Republicans weren’t entirely logical or consistent in advancing these proposals. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.) accused the Obama administration of ushering in “socialism,” while Brady argued the contradictory position that the White House is “just listening to the voices of business” and ignoring “Joe Six-pack.”

But Republican lawmakers were clear about one thing: The tally of attempts will continue to rise.

“Postponing the two mandates are only the latest steps to repeal Obamacare,” Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.) said on the floor.

Rep. Luke Messer (Ind.) explained that “each day this law is delayed gives us more time to seek its total repeal.”

The overkill isn’t irrational. As The Post’s Sarah Kliff noted, research shows that people resist regulations more vigorously if they think the requirements will eventually be repealed. “If it’s 37, 38, 39, I don’t care,” Rep. Rich Nugent (R-Fla.) said this week. “If we do it 100 times, sooner or later we’ll get it right.”

And so Republicans continue to tee up the repeal votes — far more than anybody realized.

“Thirty, 40 times we’re talking about repealing it,” protested Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.).

Or was it, as Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) posited, “the 38th time”?

“I kind of lost track,” confessed Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.).

It’s okay, Congressman. So did everyone else.

Shear'],Health Law Rollout’s Stumbles Draw Parallels to Bush’s Hurricane Response,"WASHINGTON — Barack Obama won the presidency by exploiting a political environment that devoured George W. Bush in a second term plagued by sinking credibility, failed legislative battles, fractured world relations and revolts inside his own party.

President Obama is now threatened by a similar toxic mix. The disastrous rollout of his health care law not only threatens the rest of his agenda but also raises questions about his competence in the same way that the Bush administration’s botched response to Hurricane Katrina undermined any semblance of Republican efficiency.

But unlike Mr. Bush, who faced confrontational but occasionally cooperative Democrats, Mr. Obama is battling a Republican opposition that has refused to open the door to any legislative fixes to the health care law and has blocked him at virtually every turn. A contrite-sounding Mr. Obama repeatedly blamed himself on Thursday for the failed health care rollout, which he acknowledged had thrust difficult burdens on his political allies and hurt Americans’ trust in him.

“It’s legitimate for them to expect me to have to win back some credibility on this health care law in particular and on a whole range of these issues in general,” Mr. Obama said. The president did not admit to misleading people about whether they could keep their insurance, but again expressed regret that his assurances turned out to be wrong."

Capitol Hill Democrats are splintering, regularly undermining President Obama's tacit demand that they stay united in the bill's defense. What the party wouldn't give for it to be one month ago.

On this day in October the roles were flipped. The Obamacare website was a mess and there were reports of people losing their existing coverage, but the big story was the shutdown. Democrats stood quietly, arm-in-arm, watching the Republican Party trip all over itself, Three Stooges-style. Now, the alliterative mantra of ""Democrats in disarray"" is back, and the Republicans are starting to lock arms.

The news from Gallup is particularly bad for the Affordable Care Act. Late last month, opinion of the bill was about evenly split, with 44 percent of Americans supporting it and 47 percent opposing — a 3-point difference. Since, that difference has quintupled, with only 40 percent of the country supporting the bill and 55 percent opposing. ""Currently, 73% of Democrats, 39% of independents, and 8% of Republicans approve of the healthcare law,"" Gallup writes, noting the particularly bad news: opinion has dropped among all parties, including Democrats. Meanwhile, the number of people saying that health care is the country's biggest problem has gone up 7 points since last month — though ""dissatisfaction with government"" continues to lead the way.

RELATED: How Democrats Are Trying to Fix, But Not Criticize, Obamacare

MSNBC's Benjy Sarlin points out that Obama has regularly seen stiff opposition to his policy proposals. But Obamacare, for several reasons, poses a much more severe risk.

This time the challenge is much more tangible. Either the exchange works or it doesn’t. Either people getting cancellation notices can find acceptable, affordable coverage or they can’t. There’s no messaging substitute for success on either front.

Story continues

So Democrats, who The Daily Beast' Michael Tomasky notes aren't exactly known for holding strong in the face of adversity, are starting to go sideways. Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu introduced a bill that would allow people to keep their existing health care plans. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin has announced his support for that bill, telling Morning Joe that Obamacare has ""more than a roll-out problem. There is a product problem."" Landrieu faces a difficult reelection challenge next year, and Manchin represents an increasingly conservative state, but they aren't the only ones to bail. Even party-line adherents like California Sen. Dianne Feinstein are calling for some sort of legislative response.

We noted earlier this week why such a fix is tricky, threatening the economics that are supposed to make Obamacare work for the private sector. At New York, Jonathan Chait outlines why such changes are tricky. But politics has a habit of getting in the way of (both parties') best-laid plans. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told participants in The Atlantic's Washington Ideas Forum on Thursday morning that she expected an announcement from the president in support of a fix at some point today.

RELATED: Some Democrats Back Delay of Obamacare Mandate, Enrollment May Be Extended

Michigan Rep. Fred Upton has introduced a bill in the House that, like Landrieu's, would allow people to keep their plans, but only for a period of two years. If both pass, there could be a conference committee to work out a compromise. The Republicans could say that they'd helped Americans worried about coverage — but, as The Atlantic's Molly Ball points out, inadvertently take ownership over the program, perhaps even saving it from political backlash. It's not a possibility Democrats are embracing: Pelosi called the Upton vote the 46th vote for repeal, and the administration opposes the Upton bill, saying that it undermines ""the central promise of the Affordable Care Act.""

In general, though, the Republicans are just trying to clear all of their members from the tracks as the Obamacare train rumbles haphazardly along. Politico suggests that the party found ""political gold"" in the issue — as long as it holds its natural inclination to overreach in check.

RELATED: How Real Live Young People Feel About the Obamacare Outreach Effort

They will pass Obamacare-related bills when opportunities arise — like [Upton's] this week — but Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) neatly encapsulated the party’s emerging strategy: “We should be just like a doctor and do no harm.” “Obamacare is the gift that keeps on giving,” a senior House aide said on condition of anonymity. “We just need to keep out of the way.”

If that's the strategy, this bit of news from the Washington Examiner can't be welcome: ""Ted Cruz previews new plan to repeal and replace Obamacare."" Cruz, of course, initiated the government shutdown at the beginning of October that put the Republicans on defense for several weeks and deeply undermined their popularity. The party greatly prefers the position they're in this month.

Follow Her On Twitter']",Celebrities who promoted ObamaCare now quiet in wake of website debacle,"In the heady days after the October 1 launch of the Affordable Care Act -- better known as ObamaCare -- Lady Gaga, Amy Poehler, Nina Dobrev, Rosario Dawson, Sarah Silverman, Olivia Wilde, Alicia Keys, Jennifer Hudson, Pearl Jam, Lance Bass, John Legend, Alyssa Milano and Kerry Washington joined the President to encourage Americans to #getcovered.

Since then, technical glitches and website snafus have so marred the ObamaCare website that the team who built it has been called to testify before Congress on Thursday. But there will be no celebrities flanking them on Capitol Hill, as the stars that helped launch the initiative are now being advised to walk away.

One well-placed Hollywood agent told FOX411 that while Obama and ObamaCare are separate issues, and that you can support one without the other, public relations teams across the industry are cautioning their clients to now lay off the latter. Even Oprah Winfrey, one of the President’s most influential mouthpieces during his first election, reportedly refused to get on-board and lend a hand.

“Hollywood has gone from pushing #getcovered to heading for cover,” Dan Gainor, VP of Business and Culture at the Media Research Center told FOX411. “Stars like Lady Gaga and Sarah Silverman pushed their ObamaCare propaganda to more than 67 million fans on social media. But don’t expect them to be honest about the situation.”

Georgia attorney Patrick Millsaps, who served as chief of staff of Newt Gingrich’s 2012 presidential campaign and manages several Hollywood names, said celebrities, like most public figures, know where to draw the line.

“They are starting to realize they too were sold a bill of goods and aren’t going to be accomplices in a continued fraud,” he said. “This is an easy decision for a manager – you can’t let your client promote a crappy product.”

“Many of my Hollywood friends still believe in this guy,” Millsaps added. “But I think their faith is being tested.”

Publicist Ronn Torossian of 5WPR agreed. “When things go wrong, naturally celebrities won’t want to be outspoken. But don’t expect them to be quiet for long,” he said. “They will stand up again as soon as President Obama asks them to.”

Enter Scarlett Johansson. One of President Obama’s best celebrity friends (she revealed during his campaign that the two were text buddies), Johansson has lent her voice to a Planned Parenthood message that’s played when calls are placed to some of their health centers. “Did you know you may be able to enroll in new, more affordable health insurance plans?” Johansson asks before directing callers to a Planned Parenthood section on the new Affordable Care Act website.

Whether callers can get through to that web address is, obviously, another issue."

Not the same thing.

The disastrous rollout of [President Obama's] health care law not only threatens the rest of his agenda but also raises questions about his competence in the same way that the Bush administration’s botched response to Hurricane Katrina undermined any semblance of Republican efficiency.

Obamacare's rollout does not involve an American city underwater. There are no bodies in the streets. Rather, a website is not working well and a set of mostly crappy insurance plans are being canceled, with insurance companies taking the Affordable Care Act as their excuse for canceling some decent policies, after years of canceling decent policies without that excuse. The Affordable Care Act is an attempt to fix a big problem—tens of millions of Americans without health insurance and many more paying more than they can afford or finding out that what they've been paying for won't cover them if they really need it. Parts of its rollout have been botched, but, with six weeks left before the insurance plans go into effect and with months before the end of the open enrollment period, 106,000 people have signed up for insurance and 396,000 people have become eligible for Medicaid. So what we're looking at is a law designed to help people not helping them as much as hoped, not a failure to respond with urgency, competence, or compassion to a massive natural disaster.

The' Michael Shear, demonstrating how if Republicans repeat a talking point enough times, they can get reporters to write it up as if it's a fact, not a Republican talking point:Whereas if the rollout had gone smoothly, House Republicans would be passing comprehensive immigration reform right this minute. But about that Katrina comparison. Let's review two key differences:

Of course Republicans want to compare Obamacare to Katrina. After first denying that Katrina was a political disaster for them, they switched gears to trying to use it for political advantage against Democrats, and have been looking for something they can stick with the name ""Obama's Katrina"" for years. Previous ""Obama's Katrina"" attempts have included the Haiti earthquake, Benghazi and the IRS, Hurricane Sandy, the BP oil spill, and at least half a dozen other things. It's a knee-jerk reaction by now—for Republicans. New York Times reporters shouldn't participate in it. It's not like there aren't ways to say ""the Obama administration screwed up"" without invoking a generation-shaping disaster, after all."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/20/Obamacare-Individual-Mandate-Fix-is-Illegal-Again,2013-12-20 00:00:00,['Ken Klukowski'],Obama Illegaly Delays Obamacare Individual Mandate for Some,"President Barack Obama has illegally suspended the single most important provision of Obamacare, the infamous Individual Mandate, for some Americans.

On Dec. 19, the president declared a change to the Individual Mandate, a provision that led to the first lawsuit in American history where a majority of the states in this nation (26 out of 50) sued the federal government over the constitutionality of a federal law, resulting in a historic Supreme Court decision that conservative lawyers and scholars roundly condemn insofar as it upheld the Individual Mandate as a massive tax by a 5-4 vote.

The Obama administration’s disastrous rollout of Obamacare has been a textbook illustration of the manifest incompetence of government to run the American healthcare system, from the humiliating website difficulties to the eye-popping costs of skyrocketing monthly insurance premiums and deductibles. The White House explains that it would be unfair under these circumstances to penalize Americans who attempt to obtain insurance through the Obamacare exchanges but are unable to do so.

Therefore the president has declared a “hardship exemption” for Americans encountering those difficulties. There will be a grace period for at least part of 2014. The White House has not specified a firm date of when this exemption will definitely end, or how they will be able to distinguish with certainty people who earnestly tried to obtain insurance versus those who are gaming the system.

But this exemption, like those that came before it, is illegal. The language of ACA’s Section 1501 is to impose a truly-mandatory Individual Mandate. Conservatives insist that even if all the provisions in the ACA are applied, the system will not work financially. But even liberals admit that if the Individual Mandate is not in force, then you do not bring in enough revenue from young, healthy adults to pay for the staggering cost of the massive new entitlements and programs that the ACA creates. Without the Individual Mandate, you get a “death spiral” of growing deficits that will render health insurance companies insolvent and deprive healthcare providers of payment for their life-saving treatments.

In Section 1513 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the Employer Mandate (the requirement for companies employing 50+ people) specifies that this requirement for employers to offer insurance goes into effect Jan. 1, 2014. When Obama announced over the summer that he was suspending that requirement until 2015, he said he has the power to “tweak” a law so long as that tweaking “doesn’t go to the essence of the law.”

That’s dead wrong under the U.S. Constitution. Ironically, it would not apply here anyway, since some of these provisions like the Individual Mandate and the Employer Mandate are two of the most important provisions of the entire ACA and are essential to the ACA’s core operations. However, even if they were insignificant provisions, the Constitution does not permit a president to change a single semicolon of a federal law by himself.

Under Article I of the Constitution, every law must either pass the House, the Senate, and be signed by the president, or if the president vetoes the bill instead of signing it, then it must pass the House and Senate a second time, by a two-thirds super-majority vote in each chamber. That is the only process by which federal law can be made. Everything else is illegal.

Many laws authorize top administrative officials to develop regulations carrying the force of law to implement some provision in the law. Other laws contain provisions that empower executive-branch officials to suspend or modify certain legal requirements, usually for a fixed period of time and only after certain conditions are met, such as completing a study that discovers facts that are relevant to the law’s operations. This power is delegated by the terms of the statute, where the federal law-making body–Congress–votes to include such an option in a law.

That is not the case with these parts of Obamacare. The changes in the law that President Obama has announced, such as telling insurers in Nov. 2013 that they could continue offering canceled policies, have been unilateral changes to mandatory terms in the federal law passed by Congress. These are provisions where Congress did not allow Obama or any of his Cabinet secretaries any discretion or options. They are requirements that bind the government and the private sector.

So not only is Obamacare bad policy, but now another aspect of this program is illegal.

http://news.yahoo.com/u-healthcare-gov-website-faces-tests-traffic-builds-050514927--sector.html,,[],Retooled Obamacare website traffic surges but problems remain,"By David Morgan and Lewis Krauskopf (Reuters) - A surge of visitors clogged the U.S. government's revamped healthcare insurance shopping website on Monday, signaling that President Barack Obama's administration has a way to go in fixing the portal that showcases his signature domestic policy. Facing its first big test since officials proclaimed over the weekend that they had met their deadline to make HealthCare.gov run smoothly for the ""vast majority"" of users, the site performed markedly better than it did during its disastrous launch two months ago - but was still short of the crisply running insurance marketplace Obama once touted. By 5:30 p.m. EST, the website had logged 750,000 visitors, the White House said, nearly the 800,000 daily users the refurbished site is supposed to be able to handle. In states such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Texas and North Carolina, the rush of traffic led to the deployment of a new feature on the site - a waiting page that said there were ""a lot of visitors right now,"" and put people in line to be serviced, usually within minutes. By Monday evening, officials reported that the site was running smoothly, with no waiting. That was significant progress for a website that has become the face of one of the biggest crises of Obama's administration, one that has undermined the Democratic president's promotion of an activist government and threatened to become a drag on Democrats in next year's elections, when control of Congress will be at stake. But HealthCare.gov's hiccups on Monday fueled questions about whether it will be able to enroll several million uninsured and under-insured Americans in private coverage by the end of March. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was passed in 2010. More immediately, the website will be pushed further by waves of visitors seeking to sign up for insurance by December 23, the deadline to get coverage that begins January 1. For all of the efforts by tech specialists to improve the site, officials still are scrambling to repair and install functions on the ""back end"" of the Obamacare system that are needed to finalize enrollments with insurers. That could create another headache for the administration starting in January, if the enrollments for some who sign up for coverage via the website are not finalized before their coverage is supposed to begin. ""The real challenges remain, and that's downstream,"" said Rick Howard, research director for the technology consultant Gartner. ""The real error rate will be in the billing transactions and how accurate the billing information is and how accurate the premium calculation is."" The administration said that in meetings with insurers and healthcare officials this week, it will refocus attention on the functions needed to handle insurance payments, including federal subsidies for low-income consumers buying coverage. Without those functions working properly, HealthCare.gov and websites for 14 state-run marketplaces could have difficulty operating in 2014. America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, has said because of the system's administrative shortcomings, some insurers are receiving inaccurate or duplicative information about enrollees. At the White House on Monday, Obama spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged that ""the work is not done"" on the website. Carney added that the waiting page that some visitors saw was created in part because officials knew that Monday would put a strain on the system. ""We absolutely anticipated that on this day in particular, because it is the first workday after the deadline we set ... to make sure that the website was functioning effectively for the vast majority of users, we would see a surge in visitors,"" Carney said. ENCOURAGING NUMBERS For the White House and supporters of Obamacare, the encouraging news on Monday was that the pace of enrollments in healthcare programs has increased dramatically since October 1, when the administration's enthusiastic launch of HealthCare.gov was quickly tempered by problems with the website that allowed few people to enroll. Preliminary government data indicated that about 100,000 people choose a health plan through HealthCare.gov during November, as officials and tech specialists scrambled to improve the site's capacity, according to a source familiar with the issue. In October, only about 27,000 had enrolled via the site. The federally run HealthCare.gov site handles enrollments for 36 states. The 14 other states and Washington, D.C., have their own exchanges under Obamacare. The state-run exchanges have had fewer technical problems and generally are in states that are most enthusiastic about Obamacare, so their enrollments figures have been relatively high, including 80,000 in California and 50,000 in New York. Official November data will be released in two weeks. But if the November estimate for HealthCare.gov enrollments is correct, it means at least 290,000 people have signed up for private insurance through the Obamacare exchanges. That is still far short of the administration's projection in September that nearly 500,000 people would sign up through the insurance marketplaces in the first month, according to documents obtained by congressional investigators. Ultimately, 7 million Americans were expected to sign up for private health insurance offered through the online marketplaces for 2014, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The website's issues have put that goal in doubt, and administration officials have begun playing down the importance of getting 7 million enrollees in Obamacare for 2014. On Monday, Carney emphasized that the CBO, not the White House, that produced that estimate for total enrollment. ENROLLMENT PUSH Nonprofit groups helping consumers enroll in Obamacare coverage said Monday they were encouraged by the improvements to HealthCare.gov and are starting new efforts to boost enrollment. AIDS Alabama, which had been relying largely on paper applications to sign people up until last week, noticed major improvement in the website, said Lauren Banks, the group's director of policy and advocacy. Banks said the website was still not working perfectly - the organization noticed a glitch last week that seemed to produce incorrect information about tax subsidies for low-income enrollees. Jill Hanken, who runs an Obamacare enrollment program at the Virginia Poverty Law Center, said, ""We're hearing more success stories"" about the website. ""I think things have turned the corner.""

He says they must be doing it for purely political reasons. That sound you hear is the fire alarm going off in the White House.

Shortly after the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Obamacare) was signed into law on Mar. 23, 2010, the administration announced that the massive Title VIII of the law–the CLASS Act that would set up a national system of elderly case–would never be implemented, because the Obama administration cannot find any way either to implement the system or to pay for it.

Over the past three years, the Obama administration has been issuing “waivers” for various ACA requirements regarding how much companies must pay out in health care benefits to employees, because many low-wage employers like McDonald’s couldn’t meet those requirements, and would have to cancel all health care benefits for those employees. (It should also be noted that the “waivers” are unlawful, because the ACA imposes that requirement on employers and does not allow the government to waive them.)

A year ago, the Supreme Court struck down as a violation of the Tenth Amendment the mandatory expansion of Medicaid in all 50 states, making it entirely optional. The White House started scrambling when half the states in the nation refused to go along with this unaffordable and unmanageable expansion of government health care.

Also a year ago, the IRS issued a new regulation saying that the massive subsidies that taxpayers would have to pay on health care policies purchased from state-run government exchanges in all 50 states would also apply to policies purchased on an exchange run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, because it became clear that many states would not participate in that government-run model either. (In fact, 34 states have refused to set up exchanges, and the IRS’s regulation is being challenged in court as illegal.)

Then two weeks ago, the Treasury Department announced that for the first year it is in effect (2014), the IRS would not enforce the Employer Mandate requiring large employers to provide healthcare to employees. The system was ready to implode and deprive millions of Americans of both health care and work hours (forcing many employers to cut hours to 29/week for full-time employees), and the IRS could not develop an effective reporting or enforcement system. (Like the “waivers” above, this too is illegal.)

And just this week, HHS announced that the massive state exchange system may be put off a year as well. It was supposed to start on Oct. 1, 2013, and is having so many severe problems that it too cannot start when the ACA says it must.

Yet with all that, Obama says that the ACA is working great, and those who deny it must have sinister political motives. (Set aside the fact that now some of the ACA’s biggest critics are major unions like AFL-CIO and the Teamsters, normally Obama’s biggest allies and without whose zealous support the ACA would never have passed Congress.)

It’s like George Orwell’s 1984. The government literally could say 2+2=5, and no one would call them on it. If a conservative leader said such things, the media would call for his head. But when a liberal does it, they ignore it. (Or if you’re MSNBC, you applaud his “courage” and might offer him a TV show to anchor.)

If any private citizen said such things, we’d have a one-word label for him: “liar.” But most people in this country rightly show great respect for the institution of the presidency that we don’t use such terms (unless they’re committed liberals and the president happens to be a conservative Republican–in which case you can call him anything you want). Instead, we say he’s “got his facts wrong” or he’s using “fuzzy math,” or some other such softer statement.

So using such a word would be disrespectful, and we won’t do it here. But if the smoke detectors go off at the White House, there’s no need to call the fire department. The smoke is because President Obama’s pants are on fire.

The bottom line is that Cavallaro’s assertion that “there’s nothing affordable about the Affordable Care Act,” as she put it Tuesday on NBC Channel 4, is the product of her own misunderstandings, abetted by a passel of uninformed and incurious news reporters.

It requires her to pay a deductible of $5,000 a year and limits her out-of-pocket costs to $8,500 a year. Her plan also limits her to two doctor visits a year, for which she shoulders a copay of $40 each. After that, she pays the whole cost of subsequent visits.

This fits the very definition of a nonconforming plan under Obamacare. The deductible and out-of-pocket maximums are too high, the provisions for doctor visits too skimpy.

As for a replacement plan, she says she was quoted $478 a month by her insurance broker, but that’s a lot more than she’ll really be paying. Cavallaro told me she hasn’t checked the website of Covered California, the state’s health plan exchange, herself. I did so while we talked.

Here’s what I found. I won’t divulge her current income, which is personal, but this year it qualifies her for a hefty federal premium subsidy.

At her age, she’s eligible for a good “silver” plan for $333 a month after the subsidy -- $40 a month more than she’s paying now. But the plan is much better than her current plan -- the deductible is $2,000, not $5,000. The maximum out-of-pocket expense is $6,350, not $8,500. Her co-pays would be $45 for a primary care visit and $65 for a specialty visit -- but all visits would be covered, not just two.

Is that better than her current plan? Yes, by a mile.

If she wanted to pay less, Cavallaro could opt for lesser coverage in a “bronze” plan. She could buy one from the California exchange for as little as $194 a month. From Anthem, it’s $256, or $444 a year less than she’s paying now. That buys her a $5,000 deductible (the same as she’s paying today) but the out-of-pocket limit is lower, $6,350. Office visits would be $60 for primary care and $70 for specialties, but again with no limit on the number of visits. Factor in the premium savings, and it’s hard to deny that she’s still ahead.

Cavallaro told me a couple of things that are worth considering. First, what she likes about her current plan is that she can go to any doctor of her choice and any hospital. That’s not entirely true, because her current plan with Anthem does favor a network. Plainly, however, it’s broad enough to serve her purposes. She’s concerned that the new plans will offer smaller networks, which is probably true, though it’s not necessarily true that the new networks will exclude her favorite doctors, hospitals or prescription formularies.

She also mentioned that her annual income fluctuates. It can be substantially lower, or substantially higher, than it is this year. What if next year she earns too much to qualify for the subsidy? Also a fair point -- at her current income, the subsidy is worth more than $200 a month to her. But that’s not the same as saying that “there’s nothing affordable about the Affordable Care Act,” because at her current income, the act is vastly more affordable to her than what she’s paying now.

When she told Channel 4 that “for the first time in my whole life, I will be without insurance,” it’s hard to understand what she was talking about. (Channel 4 didn’t ask.) Better plans than she has now are available for her to purchase today, some of them for less money.

The sad truth is that Cavallaro has been very poorly served by the health insurance industry and the news media. It seems that Anthem didn’t adequately explain her options for 2014 when it disclosed that her current plan is being canceled. If her insurance brokers told her what she says they did, they failed her. And the reporters who interviewed her without getting all the facts produced inexcusably shoddy work -- from Maria Bartiromo on down. They not only did her a disservice, but failed the rest of us too."

They will try to use the debt ceiling - and Obama's request to raise it - as leverage, as they did in 2011.But if the final days of this Congress were indicative of things to come, Republicans will have a rough time effectively using their majority in the House against Obama, who even Republicans acknowledge is at the top of his game following the Democrat's re-election in November.The fiscal cliff battle to avert steep tax hikes and spending cuts that were due to kick in at the start of this year proved gut-wrenching for Republicans.Obama's demand for a tax hike on the rich challenged a core principle that has guided Republicans for decades: No new taxes. Ever.Yet, late on New Year's night, 85 Republicans in the House did just that, voting to raise income taxes on household income of more than $450,000 a year."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/08/David-Gergen-GAI-Report-Indictment-of-Obama-White-House-Operation-Bordering-on-Malfeasance,2013-12-08 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],David Gergen: Report on Obamacare Prep Shows 'No One in Charge' of White House,"A veteran Washington adviser who has worked for four Presidents on both sides of the political aisle said that the stunning Government Accountability Report that found President Barack Obama has not had a one-on-one meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius since the passage of Obamacare over three years ago is an indictment of the entire White House operation and shows that the Obama administration has bordered on “malfeasance.”

“I have no doubt the White House is right, that Secretary Sebelius was in several group meetings with the president about health care,” Gergen caveated, “but the whole point is, there was nobody in charge in the administration.”

Appearing on CNN’s Newsroom program Saturday night was David Gergen, a known Washington “fixer.” Some veteran Washington observers have even suggested that Obama should bring Gergen in to help manage the Obamacare rollout crisis. He was asked by CNN Anchor Deborah Feyerick about the GAI report.

Feyerick cited a report from “an outfit called the Government Accountability Institute [that] finds the president and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius held just a single one-on-one meeting after Obamacare was signed into law over three years ago.”

“I don’t think this is simply sloppiness on the part of the White House,” Gergen said. “What seems to me is there’s a case of near malfeasance here.”

Gergen, who has served as Director of Speechwriting for the Nixon White House, Director of Communications for both Presidents Ford and Reagan, and then as a senior advisor to President Bill Clinton, is intimately familiar with how the White House operates. In addition, he normally takes a “neutral” position on most matters and often gives those in power the benefit of doubt.

But Gergen emphasized that the GAI report concerning the lack of meetings between Sebelius and Obama raises troubling issues about the conduct of affairs in the Obama White House.

Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer unveiled the report on Wednesday on Fox News’s Hannity and Breitbart News.

As Breitbart News has reported, Schweizer said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare.

“In the case of President Obama, if you look at his calendar, there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all,” Schweizer said on Hannity.

Feyerick, the CNN host, added that the White House had attacked the report, “Jay Carney [is] saying that the report’s misleading and based on a ridiculously false premise, those are his words David Gergen, what do you think about this?”

Gergen responded by saying the GAI report was a big deal and should not be dismissed. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Obama and Sebelius meet “regularly” but their meetings were not recored on the visitors logs. Schweizer had previously noted that GAI also looked at White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House, it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” And he noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meeting off the books, Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.

Gergen faulted the White House for this lack of contact and condemned the whole White House operation.

“The fact that he was not meeting with her one-on-one, I think, frankly, is not so much an indictment of her but of the White House operation,” he said.

Gergen said that “at the same time three years pass with no one-on-one meetings according to this Politico article. The president had 277 one-on-one meetings with other members of his cabinet.” Gergen referenced Schweizer’s Politico article in which he mentioned that, “perhaps the insular White House team wanted to distance the president from the bureaucratic process in the hopes of granting him a halo of deniability if the launch failed.” Schweizer also noted “the lack of meetings reinforces the severity of what the New York Times describes as the ‘deeply dysfunctional relationship between the Department of Health and Human Services and its technology contractors, and tensions between the White House chief of staff and senior health department officials.'”

Feyerick, the CNN host, added, that if health care reform “was so important to the president, you would think that there was a lot more one-on-one interaction especially on something that’s so critical to him and his policy.” Princeton Professor Julian Zelizer, who was also on the panel, did not respond directly to the details of the GAI report, only to say that “we have to be careful because as the White House said, that [report] does come from a conservative organization.”

The Government Accountability Institute, though, is a nonpartisan organization and its mission is to “investigate and expose crony capitalism, misuse of taxpayer monies and other governmental corruption or malfeasance.” GAI, headed by Schweizer, has written several reports in recent years and has been criticized by both the Obama White House and House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH)."

Shear'],Health Law Rollout’s Stumbles Draw Parallels to Bush’s Hurricane Response,"WASHINGTON — Barack Obama won the presidency by exploiting a political environment that devoured George W. Bush in a second term plagued by sinking credibility, failed legislative battles, fractured world relations and revolts inside his own party.

President Obama is now threatened by a similar toxic mix. The disastrous rollout of his health care law not only threatens the rest of his agenda but also raises questions about his competence in the same way that the Bush administration’s botched response to Hurricane Katrina undermined any semblance of Republican efficiency.

But unlike Mr. Bush, who faced confrontational but occasionally cooperative Democrats, Mr. Obama is battling a Republican opposition that has refused to open the door to any legislative fixes to the health care law and has blocked him at virtually every turn. A contrite-sounding Mr. Obama repeatedly blamed himself on Thursday for the failed health care rollout, which he acknowledged had thrust difficult burdens on his political allies and hurt Americans’ trust in him.

“It’s legitimate for them to expect me to have to win back some credibility on this health care law in particular and on a whole range of these issues in general,” Mr. Obama said. The president did not admit to misleading people about whether they could keep their insurance, but again expressed regret that his assurances turned out to be wrong."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/20/news/economy/obamacare-penalty/index.html,2013-09-20 00:00:00,['Tami Luhby'],I'm paying the Obamacare penalty,"Can't afford the premiums. Don't need health insurance. Won't support Obamacare.

These are some of the reasons why CNNMoney readers say they'll opt to pay a penalty for not having health insurance in 2014, rather than sign up for a policy in the state-based exchanges or through their companies.

""I would love to have insurance, but we just don't have the money,"" said Sandra Czop, 58, of Bloomingdale, Ill. ""We need that $100 to put food on the table. We have no money to put gas in the car.""

Czop, a mortgage loan officer whose business is down 60% and whose husband is unemployed, summed up the sentiments of many readers. Though subsidies are available to those earning less than 400% of the poverty level, the premiums are still too high for many Americans.

Have questions on Obamacare? Join our Facebook chat on Friday.

For 2014, the penalty is either $95 per adult or 1% of family income, whichever results in a larger fine. (Income is defined as total income above the filing threshold, which is $10,000 for an individual and $20,000 for a family in 2013.) That's still a lot less than premiums, which are generally $200 to $300 a month on average for a silver plan.

So a person making $50,000 would not be eligible for a subsidy and would pay full price -- typically around $2,400 to $3,600 a year in premiums -- for a plan. If he declined to get insurance, he would only be subject to a $400 penalty for the year.

A couple earning that amount would receive a roughly $1,300 subsidy, leaving them to pay about $4,750 in premiums for the year. But that compares to a $300 penalty.

For some folks, health insurance just isn't a good deal. Take Jessica Birge, 29, who is studying nursing and works as a medical assistant. Her job gives her $100 a month for medical expenses, though she does have dental and vision coverage through her employer. But she doesn't have a lot of medical expenses since she rarely goes to the doctor, opting instead to go to a local clinic for her annual exams.

Though she knows she needs insurance in case she gets into an accident, she doesn't think Obamacare is very affordable.

""I don't really want to pay a penalty, but it's more economical for me to pay $300 a year [in fines] than $200 to $300 a month for insurance I don't use,"" said Birge, acknowledging she may get insurance in several years, when the penalties get more onerous.

Some people are opting to remain uninsured, even though they have access to coverage on the job. Since they don't go to the doctor much, they just prefer to pay for their health care out of pocket.

Christie Egeston, 35, could get insurance at her lab job, but instead she puts money into the flexible spending account at work to cover her yearly checkup.

""I don't really feel I need health insurance,"" said Egeston, who lives in Avondale Estates, Ga. ""If the penalty is less than what I'm paying for the year in insurance, it balances out.""

And, of course, there are people who will not sign up for Obamacare because they fundamentally oppose the idea of a health insurance requirement. That's the camp Jim Moore of Denver falls into.

""I'm just so opposed to the legislation and Obama's big government agenda,"" said Moore, 62, a contract certified public accountant. ""There's no way I'm giving my health care records to the government. I and many people need to make a statement."""

What are his constituents going to think when they realize he's been lying to them about Obamacare?

LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A middle-aged man in a red golf shirt shuffles up to a small folding table with gold trim, in a booth adorned with a flotilla of helium balloons, where government workers at the Kentucky State Fair are hawking the virtues of Kynect, the state’s health benefit exchange established by Obamacare. The man is impressed. ""This beats Obamacare I hope,"" he mutters to one of the workers. ""Do I burst his bubble?"" wonders Reina Diaz-Dempsey, overseeing the operation. She doesn't. If he signs up, it's a win-win, whether he knows he's been ensnared by Obamacare or not.

The polling has been around for a while: if you ask people about the various provisions of Obamacare, they love it; if you ask them about Obamacare, they hate it. Now that the program is about to kick off, that's being confirmed on the ground . In Kentucky.That's absolutely why Republicans are frantic to try to find a way to stop Obamacare from starting. As the message about its benefits get out, as people sign up and start receiving those benefits, they're going to forget all about being scared of it and they're going to like it.

But it's not a slam-dunk, and the public education effort is key because Republican lies have taken hold with plenty of people. Erin Hoven, an outreach worker with Kentucky Voices for Health, and her efforts to do outreach and education on Obamacare faces those lies—repeated regularly by both of the state's Republican senators, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul—at every turn.



A woman Hoben had been working with in Hazard called her recently to tell her that the tea party had urged her not to enroll because the exchange wasn’t happening. [Hoben] went door to door with a free lunch program in Laurel County. She met a mother in a trailer, she recalls, who believed she was going to jail if she didn't sign up for insurance. What startled Hoben was that the mother seemed to just erroneously accept the potential jail time as a fact of life. ""I quickly explained to her that was not going to happen,"" Hoben says.

Will these people believe it when Hoben or others tell them that none of this stuff is true? Not until they see the lies be disproved and they see it start working. That gives Republicans in the states one more chance to defeat Obamacare: sabotage it at the state level in its implementation, like in the states where the new health care navigators , community workers hired under the law to help people navigate the new system, are being hindered by onerous new requirements and regulations.

Because the worst thing in the world for Republicans is having more people get affordable health care."

The Obama administration confirmed Monday that Michelle Snyder, the No. 2 official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is leaving her post. The departure was announced by CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner.

Though Republicans, and some Democrats, have been calling for heads to roll over the botched launch of the program, and particularly HealthCare.gov, it's unclear whether Snyder's resignation at this point was already planned.

Tavenner claimed that Snyder originally was preparing to leave a year ago but ""characteristically chose to postpone her retirement from federal service at my request to help me with the challenges facing CMS in 2013.""

The statement from Tavenner included no criticism of Snyder's performance over the past year. She praised her ""41 years of outstanding public service.""

Tavenner added: ""While the agency is losing a key member of its leadership team, we should celebrate Michelle's dedication to a mission that provides vital health care services to tens of millions of our fellow Americans through the Medicare and Medicaid programs.""

While Snyder is not a well-known official, her name surfaced in connection with the botched rollout during an Oct. 30 hearing. At the time, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius revealed that Snyder -- as chief operating officer -- was in charge of the launch. But then, under questioning from Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Sebelius tried to shoulder the blame.

""Michelle Snyder is the one responsible for this debacle?"" Blackburn asked.

""Well, excuse me, Congresswoman,"" Sebelius answered. ""Michelle Snyder is not responsible for the debacle. Hold me accountable for the debacle. I'm responsible.""

Despite widespread technical problems and meager enrollment at the outset, the administration announced that the number of enrollees through the health care site has surpassed 1 million. The administration still has a long way to go to reach its target of, along with state-based exchanges, 7 million by the end of March."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/12/Mike-Lee-on-GAI-Findings-Inexcusable-Unpardonable,2013-12-12 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],Mike Lee: Lack of Meetings Between Obama and Sebelius ‘Inexcusable’,"On Wednesday, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said it was “inexcusable” and “unpardonable” that President Barack Obama did not meet one-on-one with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius since Obamacare passed over three years ago.

On Fox News’s Hannity, host Sean Hannity referenced the shocking Government Accountability Institute report when asking Lee whether he knew if Sebelius has met with Obama in one-on-one meetings.

“Not to my knowledge,” Lee answered, before saying, “this is inexcusable” and “absolutely unpardonable.”

Lee, who was the architect of the strategy to defund Obamacare and one of the fiercest opponents of the healthcare overhaul, continued by saying “there was this little oversight in the launching of this significant an enterprise” and Obamacare is “so much more than about the website.” Lee said ultimately Obamacare is about the “fundamental unfairness and unworkability of the law.”

At a House subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, Sebelius was flustered when asked to give specific evidence that she and Obama have met “regularly.” Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA), who is on the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, exclusively told Breitbart News that he will ask Sebelius for specific dates of those alleged meetings.

The White House and the Health and Human Services Department have claimed Obama and Sebelius meet “regularly,” but have not provided any firm dates except for an alleged meeting last Thursday, which was a day after the GAI report was released. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said there are many meetings between Obama and cabinet secretaries that are not on the public record.

When Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer broke the GAI report on Fox News’s Hannity last Wednesday, though, he mentioned that GAI examined the White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House, it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” He noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meetings off the books, Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.

The Government Accountability Institute report found that since Obamacare was signed into law on March 23, 2010, Obama met with “various Cabinet secretaries a total of 277 times,” but his presidential schedule did not “document a single one-on-one meeting” with Sebelius. There was “one instance of Secretary Sebelius meeting jointly with the President and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner.”

According to the White House schedule, Obama “met with secretaries from the Departments of Defense, State, and Treasury for 263 (95%) out of his 277 face-to-face meetings.” Obama also had meetings with “secretaries from the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security, Interior, Labor, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs… [including] two meetings with the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus (not an official Cabinet level post).”

Schweizer had previously said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare.

“In the case of President Obama, if you look at his calendar, there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all,” Schweizer said on Hannity on Wednesday."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-briefed-spring-widespread-website-problems-214659604--sector.html,,[],Obama was briefed in spring on widespread website problems,"By Roberta Rampton and David Morgan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, who has portrayed himself as surprised by technical problems with the government's new health care website, was briefed last spring on a detailed consultant's report that warned of system failure, White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Tuesday. Carney said the president's familiarity with the report and recommendations by McKinsey & Co did not contradict previous statements from the White House that described Obama as surprised by the scope of flaws in HealthCare.gov since it opened for people to enroll for insurance coverage on October 1. Obama was told the problems identified by McKinsey were being addressed, Carney said. After reeling from technical problems at its website for more than six weeks, the Obama administration on Tuesday also said that it is still months away from completing the back end of the system, including functions needed to finalize federal subsidies for consumers who buy health plans. Administration officials said the complicated information technology system's financial management function would not be completed until mid-January, weeks after the first enrollees are scheduled to begin receiving benefits under the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 as Obama's signature domestic policy. Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), played down the January timeframe, saying the financial management functions are not among the high priority fixes aimed at ensuring a smooth operation for consumers to shop, enroll in coverage and make their first month's premium payment. But the ability of the administration to deliver federal premium tax credits as partial premium payments for qualifying consumers is a vital segment of the function of the new online marketplace. Also not due until January are functions involving risk adjustments for insurers and the monthly reconciliation of enrollment data. The McKinsey report, released Monday night by a Republican-controlled House of Representatives committee, is the most detailed analysis made public to date of the difficulties the site was facing late in its development. It warned the government of the potential for system failure that could make the health care exchanges inaccessible to consumers trying to buy insurance through them, suggesting that there was not enough time before October to make all the repairs. Release of the report by the Republican chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee was part of a broad effort by Republicans to discredit the health care program and to portray the Obama administration as incompetent in implementing the health care law. DEMOCRATS JOINING CRITICISM Democrats are increasingly joining the chorus of criticism. Representative Elijah Cummings, a senior Democrat and ally of Obama, called on Tuesday for a White House shakeup over the handling of the rollout of the healthcare law, commonly called Obamacare. The website is an online exchange that allows consumers to shop for coverage under the law, which mandated that Americans have health insurance and created new marketplaces to buy and sell policies. In a separate House hearing, Republicans portrayed the website as not only broken but not secure for personal information of consumers. Three security experts testified that HealthCare.gov was so insecure for consumers that they believed it should be shut down until fixed. Obama administration officials responded that the site was safe. The rollout of Obama's signature domestic policy has hurt the popularity of the initiative, but the decline has been fairly modest, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Monday. Forty-one percent of Americans expressed support for Obamacare in a survey conducted from Thursday to Monday. That was down 3 percentage points from a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken from September 27 to October 1. Opposition to the healthcare law stood at 59 percent in the latest poll, versus 56 percent in the earlier survey. (Additional reporting by Caren Bohan; Editing by Fred Barbash and Grant McCool)"

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-fights-to-recapture-health-care-initiative-035746716.html,,[],Obama fights to recapture health care initiative,"After an initial phase of shell-shocked damage control, President Barack Obama’s efforts to save his signature health care law — and with it his second term and his place in U.S. history — are taking on an aggressive tone.

“Let’s face it, a lot of us didn’t realize that passing the law was the easy part,” Obama told scores of supporters late Monday at a posh Washington hotel.

The new approach — emphasizing Affordable Care Act benefits that are already in effect and don’t require navigating a botched website, promoting the law’s success stories, blaming Republicans and the news media in equal measure for the bad news — also comes with a renewed focus on issues that helped unite the winning coalition of his 2012 re-election campaign.

The president has stepped up calls for Congress to pass, by year’s end, legislation overhauling America’s immigration policy. On Tuesday, he’ll meet with top executives to make the argument that doing so would help the economy.

And the Democratic-held Senate voted 61-30 late Monday to advance a bill to outlaw workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation, with seven Republicans breaking ranks to side with the majority. “Common sense,” Obama told activists backing his Organizing for Action group at the St. Regis Hotel.

Amid headlines screaming out Obamacare’s setbacks, White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Monday that the president’s “No. 1 priority has and will be economic progress.”

That's two issues that rally pivotal segments of the public behind the Democratic position, while dividing Republicans, and one that remains atop the list of voter concerns. Is the president in campaign mode one year after his re-election and one year before the 2014 midterms?

“I just promise that in November of 2013 I haven't had a single conversation about 2014,” Carney insisted Monday.

Riiiiiiight. The White House has said that the president will travel to Dallas on Wednesday for an event with health care volunteers — and then fundraising for the Democratic Senate campaign fund. On Friday, after a stop in New Orleans to discuss export growth, Obama will head to Miami for more Democratic fundraisers.

Story continues

And somehow neither the president nor Vice President Joe Biden mentioned the Affordable Care Act directly when they headlined separate rallies for Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe on Sunday and Monday. His GOP opponent, Ken Cuccinelli, has bet his chances for an upset win on opposition to the health care law.

But for the first time in its brief history, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s fate isn’t up to congressional arm-twisters, or White House negotiators or even the voters. It’s up to a phalanx of experts (affectionately dubbed “the nerds” by some in the West Wing) doing surprisingly literal damage control, trying to fix HealthCare.gov

Democrats and Republicans alike say that repairing the site by the administration’s self-imposed early December deadline could dramatically reshape the Obamacare battlefield.

“It comes down to the website, which has really been a manifestation of people’s fears. It validates people’s concerns about the law,” a top aide to a Democratic senator up for re-election in 2014 told Yahoo News.

“The best thing that could happen for us is for the fix to be good enough, the enrollment drive good enough, that it makes what happened in the last two months seem like it never happened,” said the aide, speaking anonymously to discuss the situation candidly. “We need this law to work.”

After that, Democrats say, the law could benefit from steadily growing numbers of Americans getting benefits.

But “this fix, the website, the enrollment drive that comes next, it has got to dwarf what came before, make it look like a campaign for elementary school class treasurer,” the Democratic aide said.

“I won’t say that fixing the website two months after it launched is a huge victory, but the website was an obvious, easily understood failure we had nothing to do with,” one Republican congressional aide told Yahoo News. “We’ll still push on the job losses and the ‘if you like your plan, you can keep it.’”

Republicans have seized on Obama’s refrain as evidence of dishonesty. Major news outlets have highlighted the many thousands of people losing their existing health care coverage because it does not meet the law’s more generous requirements.

On Monday, Obama himself tried to retroactively add a little fine print. “What we said was, you could keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law was passed,” he told supporters.

That was in the legislation — plans that existed before it became law (and remained unchanged) were grandfathered in. New plans or those that underwent modifications had to adhere to the ACA’s tougher standards.



The White House points out that plans disappeared all the time before the Affordable Care Act — and that many of those vanishing now offer precious little actual coverage. Obama aides also underline that the higher cost of options provided under the new law reflect more generous benefits, while emphasizing that many Americans will qualify for subsidies to make it easier to buy health insurance.

But those qualifiers weren’t in Obama’s public campaigning.

“Nobody is changing what you’ve got if you’re happy with it,” the president said the day he signed the measure into law. “If you like your doctor you will be able to keep your doctor.”

The White House also has deployed more standard weapons — an array of what it calls “fact checks,” positive anecdotes to counter the (frequently dubious) horror stories, and links to positive coverage.

Outreach to worried congressional Democrats has been uneven. After the problem-plagued Oct. 1 rollout, it wasn’t until Oct. 30 that all Senate Democratic offices received their first White House-drafted talking points — a delay one Democratic leadership aide blamed on the two-week government shutdown.

(UPDATE: Another Senate Democratic leadership aide wrote in to dispute that account, saying that all Senate Democratic offices “were provided with message guidance and talking points consistently, both from the White House and HHS [Department of Health and Human Services], throughout October.”)

At the same time, the administration has held at least 20 briefings this year for lawmakers of both parties, and 10 more for staff.

“These briefings, were both offered proactively to and done at the request of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, and are in addition to regular, constant outreach conducted at the staff level between White House staffers and Hill staffers on a daily basis,” said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. “They also are in addition to four meetings the president himself had in early October with House Democrats, House Republicans, Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans. “

Obama aides have taken the president’s lead and adopted a freshly combative tone — but that may be in part because they know things will get worse before they get better.

In mid-November, the administration is due to release the number of Americans who have successfully enrolled in health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act.

Even with day-by-day improvements to HealthCare.gov, administration officials expect that number to be low, touching off a fresh round of criticisms.

“We're only one month into a six-month open enrollment period,” Obama said Monday. “It’s not as if this is a one-day sale or something. So we've just got to keep on working.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/tough-week-white-house-buys-time-obamacare-website-100139041--sector.html,,[],"After tough week, White House buys time for Obamacare website fix","By Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama promised on Saturday that his troubled healthcare website was just weeks away from a cure as he struggled to convince Americans he is on top of what has become a self-inflicted wound to his signature first-term achievement. His administration unveiled a plan on Friday to make Obamacare insurance marketplaces on healthcare.gov - a website riddled with error messages, long delays and bugs - work better by the end of November. It was the end to an embarrassing week where Obama discovered he had overshot on an Oct 1. promise of a website that would make shopping for health insurance as easy as buying ""a plane ticket on Kayak or a TV on Amazon."" ""As you may have heard, the site isn't working the way it's supposed to yet,"" Obama said in his weekly Saturday address - an understatement after days of reports of people being shut out of the system. ""In the coming weeks, we are going to get it working as smoothly as it's supposed to,"" he added. Obama had stood firm against Republican attempts to defund or delay the healthcare law, known popularly as Obamacare - efforts that led to a 16-day government shutdown this month. He and his top officials had warned publicly before October 1 that there could be ""glitches,"" but the White House has been scrambling to control the damage from a rollout that was far worse than expected. The depth of the design flaws has raised questions about why the Obama administration was so insistent on starting the enrollments on October 1 when the system was clearly not ready - and laid bare the president's mistake in raising expectations about how good the website was going to be. ""Either they made assumptions that were too optimistic and were caught off guard, or they knew that the difficulties would be greater than the public understood, but chose not to say so,"" said Bill Galston, a Brookings Institution expert who was a domestic policy adviser to Democratic President Bill Clinton. ""It may be some of both."" CRISIS MANAGEMENT 101 Obama adviser Jeffrey Zients, appointed on Tuesday to figure out how to manage the complicated fixes for the website, was an unannounced participant on a conference call with health reporters on Friday afternoon. Zients gave a deadline, although he cautioned there was a lot of work to do. ""By the end of November, healthcare.gov will work smoothly for the vast majority of users,"" he said. Borrowing from the lexicon of homebuilders, Zients said he had hired a ""general contractor"" to manage the many contractors on the project, and developed a ""punch list"" of dozens of problems to address. The message followed classic corporate crisis management strategy, said Peter LaMotte, a senior vice president at Levick, a firm that devises communications strategies for large corporations and organizations. ""State the facts, be clear, be transparent, and then shut up,"" LaMotte said. ""That is what we often recommend to our clients."" That deadline buys the administration and tech experts time to iron out the bugs in the website before millions of Americans give up trying to use it, LaMotte said. But he added, ""People are going to hold you to that date."" Norm Ornstein, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said the date was ""comforting"" because it came from Zients, who is known for being a ""straight shooter"" with private-sector management expertise. ""He's not making it up. It does not serve his interests to pick a date without a clue as to whether you can make it,"" Ornstein said, noting Zients would become Obama's top economic adviser at the White House on January 1. ""His credibility is at stake here,"" Ornstein said. POLITICAL BREATHING ROOM Republicans are using the problems to push for a delay to the requirement that Americans buy insurance by March 31. ""Despite hundreds of millions of taxpayers dollars invested, the website still does not work for most,"" Fred Upton, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in the Republican reply to Obama's Saturday address. Upton's panel will grill Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at a hearing next week. Zients' Friday announcement will take some pressure off Sebelius in the hearing, said John Ullyot, who works on crisis communications as a managing director at High Lantern Group. But Ullyot, a former Senate Republican aide, said the plan would have had more punch had it been presented earlier in the week by the ""much louder megaphone"" of either Sebelius or Obama. ""They had a full week of drip, drip, drip in the media, and you never want to have that,"" he said. Once the website is fixed, officials will face another communications challenge. They will need to concentrate on luring back to the site those people who gave up trying to access it in the initial phases, said a former Obama administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""I think that people are going to like the site and sign up for it. The problem is once a user has a bad experience at a website, they're not usually going to want to go back to it,"" the official said.

COVID-19 has claimed the life of another New Brunswicker, pushing the total number of COVID-related deaths in the province to 38, Public Health announced Monday, along with 15 new cases. A person in their 90s in the Edmundston region, Zone 4, has died ""as a result of COVID-19,"" according to a news release. The person resided at Pavillon Beau-Lieu, a special care home in Grand Falls, where there's an outbreak involving the variant first reported in South Africa. Health Minister Dorothy Shephard said she is saddened by the news. ""I join all New Brunswickers in sharing sincere condolences with this person's loved ones during this difficult time,"" she said in a statement. On Sunday, Public Health announced another resident of the special care home, someone in their 80s, had died in hospital ""as a result of COVID-19."" With the 15 new cases, there are now 142 active cases of respiratory disease in the province. Six people are in hospital, including two in intensive care. The breakdown of the new cases is as follows: Moncton region, Zone 1: one case: A person 30 to 39 This case is a contact of a previously confirmed case. Saint John region, Zone 2: three cases: A person 30 to 39 A person 40 to 49 A person 50 to 59 One case is under investigation, one case is travel-related and the other is a contact of a previously confirmed case.

New Brunswick has had 1,954 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started just over a year ago. There have been 1,773 recoveries so far. A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

http://news.yahoo.com/obamacare-%e2%80%98success-story--says-she-can-t-afford-new-health-plan-225839697.html,,[],Obamacare ‘success story’ says she can’t afford new health plan,"A single mom from Washington State who was cited by President Obama as an Affordable Care Act success story now says she’ll go uninsured and calls the program a “treadmill of bureaucracy.”

Washington State Wire reports that Jessica Sanford, 48, discovered that she is no longer eligible for a large subsidy that would have lowered her monthly premium to $169 per month. Instead, Sanford would now be forced to pay nearly four times as much, $621, for coverage.

Sanford told the paper she believes the government should shut down the entire healthcare.gov site until the site’s issues are resolved. “In my opinion they ought to shut it down and just get all of it straightened out.”

That's a complete 180 from what Sanford thought she was signing up for last month when Obama touted her as an Affordable Care Act success story.

During a White House Rose Garden ceremony on Oct. 21, Obama read an email from Sanford in which she thanks the president for offering her help in obtaining a low-cost, high-quality coverage plan.

""I recently received a letter from a woman named Jessica Sanford in Washington state,” Obama said. “And here's what she wrote: 'I am a single mom, no child support, self-employed. And I haven't had insurance for 15 years because it's too expensive. I was crying the other day when I signed up, so much stress lifted.' ""

Sanford works as a court reporter and says she makes just under $50,000 a year. Her 14-year-old son requires a monthly prescription that is expensive because it must come from a compounded pharmacy. She said she thought the originally promised $452 monthly premium subsidy would help her close the financial gap.

“To think I would finally be covered if anything happened – I was so relieved,” she told the Washington Wire.

However, CNN reports that in the days following Obama's Rose Garden ceremony Sanford received a letter telling her that her tax credit had been taken away, meaning she won’t be able to afford coverage. Officials reportedly told her that they made a mistake in calculating her benefits. Sanford is reportedly one of 8,000 people in Washington State who have received letters informing them that their promised subsidies have been reduced or removed.

“This is it. I'm not getting insurance,"" Sanford told CNN. ""That's where it stands right now unless they fix it.""

A representative from Washington State’s HealthPlanFinder said they are looking into Sanford’s case and will try to help her find a more affordable plan."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/17/OFA-Debuts-Video-Teaching-Parents-How-To-Inject-Obamacare-Into-Christmas-Dinner,2013-12-17 00:00:00,['Frances Martel'],OFA Video Teaches Parents How to Inject Obamacare into Christmas Dinner,"Just a week before young adults return home for the end of year holidays, Organizing for America is debuting a video imploring parents to interrupt their time with their children to promote the benefits of Obamacare in a last-ditch attempt to ease millennial dissatisfaction with President Obama.

The video, debuting on BarackObama.com and promoted through various social media, arrives on the eve of a joint President and First Lady event designed to target mothers of uninsured millennials as they arrive home for their holidays.

In the clip, a mother and father call their son, presumably about to drive home for Christmas dinner, and warn him that they have something “very important” to talk to him about. The son spends the entire drive home fretting about the worst case scenario (“Your father and I are moving in with you!”) and inexplicably expecting arbitrary pop culture references (“I am the one who knocks!“). The “reveal” that the parents want to talk about health insurance is predictable, as is the fact that the son is, above all, relieved. “That’s it?” he asks.

The ad, titled “Get Ready To Have The Talk,” plays like an ’80s anti-drug PSA, urging parents to use the holidays as a stage for an intervention to stop something unhealthy in their children’s lives. The fact that it happens at the dinner itself (though the accompanying Twitter graphic shows the actor playing the son mid-hot chocolate later in the night) instructs parents to directly address the Obama administration’s agenda in the middle of what, for many celebrating the night, is a religious celebration devoid of political meaning.

The targeted advertising appears to be a last-minute attempt to reverse devastating trends in the Affordable Care Act’s and the President’s nosedive in the public opinion polls as the year wanes and HealthCare.gov continues to fail millions. A Harvard Institute of Politics poll released this month shows 57% of young Americans ages 18-29 disapprove of the ACA and 52% would support removing the President from office. The targeting of parents also appears to be a direct reaction to dwindling support for Obamacare among white women.

Apparently, the White House hopes changing mothers’ minds will cause a trickle down effect that reaches the young uninsured. Or, at least, that is what Democrats should hope the White House is doing, because the video demonstrates a prodigious lack of understanding of youth culture today.

It makes sense. Young people today were not the young people of five years ago–the young people who truly believed in President Obama–and to the White House, it seems that all these new young people do is quote Breaking Bad at each other in their plaid onesies. It’s a Hail Mary pass from an administration that was previously unstoppable in reaching out to young Americans, one perhaps that is their only move after HealthCare.gov failed so extraordinarily that Ezra Klein wondered aloud why someone in the administration hasn’t been fired over it.

We’ll have to wait until next week to see just how many parents take this advice, but the outlook doesn’t seem to be so bright if this is the last PR resort."

John Cornyn -- citing Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' recent admission that felons potentially could become ObamaCare navigators as well as new undercover video showing questionable behavior by these officials -- called Monday for the program to be halted.

Cornyn ripped the program after conservative activist James O'Keefe released a new video that appears to depict ObamaCare navigators, in Cornyn's home state of Texas, encouraging applicants to fib on their applications.

""This behavior is unacceptable, and is yet another broken piece of a deeply flawed system. The Obama administration should stop this program immediately,"" Cornyn said in a statement. ""Texans should not be purposefully misled and more importantly, their privacy should not be put at risk.""

The ""navigators"" are workers who are supposed to help people sign up for health care coverage under the new health law.

Reports continue to roll in about problems with the program, after a group formed from the ruins of ACORN announced earlier this year it was getting in on the sign-up effort.

The United Labor Unions Council Local 100, a New Orleans-based nonprofit, said in September it would take part in a multi-state ""navigator"" drive to help people enroll in President Obama's health care plan. The labor council was established by ACORN founder Wade Rathke after his larger group was broken up amid scandal in 2009.

The video from O'Keefe, who played a big role in dismantling ACORN, adds to the concern.

The newly released video from O'Keefe's Project Veritas are similar to past sting operations his group has conducted, including against ACORN. Using hidden-camera footage, the latest shows actors posing as ObamaCare applicants -- and unsuspecting navigators giving questionable advice.

In one, workers with a community center in Irving, Texas, are shown telling one actor that he shouldn't reveal anything about smoking, because it could jack up his premiums.

""You lie, because your premiums will be higher,"" one says.

Another chimes in, ""Don't tell them that.""

In another video, from a National Urban League office in Dallas, an actor is told not to declare income he has earned on the side because it could cause problems with the government.

""Don't get yourself in trouble by declaring it now,"" one worker says.

""Yeah, it didn't happen,"" another says.

""Our organization has taken immediate steps to address the actions of the identified employees and investigate the full context of what occurred in our Dallas and Irving offices,"" a statement released by The Urban League of Greater Dallas said.

""In addition, we support actions by the Department of Health & Human Services to decertify the three Navigators-in-training featured in the video, and The Urban League of Greater Dallas has suspended these employees until further notice,"" the statement said.

O'Keefe's group says it will release more videos of its ""ObamaCare investigations"" in the coming weeks that will show fraud and abuse in the system.

""This investigation shows just how vulnerable Obamacare is to fraud,"" O'Keefe said in a statement."

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama apologized Thursday to those Americans whose insurance plans are being canceled due to the federal health law he championed even though he said repeatedly they could keep their coverage if they liked.

“I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,” he told NBC News in an exclusive interview.

“We’ve got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and we are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this,” he added.

Obama’s comments come days after he attempted to clarify what he meant when he assured Americans in previous years that they would be able to keep their plans under the Affordable Care Act, a controversy that is prompting legislation in Congress to address it.

Obama further alters ‘you can keep your plan’ pledge

Republicans have hammered Obama over the promise since insurers began discontinuing coverage for some of the 12 million Americans who buy individual policies on the private market that don’t meet Obamacare requirements for more comprehensive care.

GOP moves past troubled Obamacare website

Insurance companies appear to be doing this for a variety of reasons; some are pulling all their plans from certain states where they have fewer subscribers in order to save money.

In many cases, affected policyholders are being squeezed. They either don’t qualify for subsidies to lower the cost of new premiums or they may have to pay more in the health care exchange marketplace.

When Obama says he’s looking to fix it, he primarily means steps that can be taken administratively, senior administration officials said.

Some experts suggest one possible approach would be to ask insurers to delay the cancellation of plans and extend them into the New Year so that people are not left without insurance. That has been done, for example, in the state of California.

But House Speaker John Boehner said an Obama apology was in order and said the Republican-led House had its own plan in mind.

“What Americans want to hear is that the President is going to keep his promise. That’s why the House will vote next week to allow anyone with a health care plan they like to keep it,” Boehner said. “If the President is sincerely sorry that he misled the American people, the very least he can do is support this bipartisan effort. Otherwise, this apology doesn’t amount to anything.”

The administration eventually knew that many policies would be changed by the insurance carriers after Obamacare was introduced, and the associated political uproar since its October 1 online rollout has also angered Democrats and fueled Republican efforts to extend related controversies onto the campaign trail.

Vulnerable Senate Democrats voice concerns

In 2010, the Health and Human Services Department estimated that 40% to 67% of individual plans would eventually lose their “grandfathered” status, which only was conferred if a plan was purchased before the health care law was approved in 2010.

Although Obama said the “buck stops” with him on Obamacare problems to date – including the rocky rollout of the website – he still was resolute that his initiative to provide coverage for the uninsured and better coverage for many others would be better for the country.

“Most of the folks who … got these cancellation letters, they’ll be able to get better care at the same cost or cheaper in these new marketplaces,” Obama said, also noting that “we have to make sure” people do not feel as if they’ve been betrayed by an effort carried out with their best interests in mind.

“They’ll have more choice, they’ll have more competition. They’re part of a bigger pool. The insurance companies are going to be hungry for their business. So the majority of folks will end up being better off,” he said.

Key elements of the health law prohibit discrimination for pre-existing conditions and require new plans cover maternity care, mental health and other areas. The program was developed to put comprehensive care within reach of millions of uninsured Americans.

About 95% of legal U.S. residents receive health insurance through private employers or the federal government, the Obama administration says. But more than 48 million Americans don’t have any coverage.

Debunking 4 Obamacare myths: Both sides get it wrong

Obama’s apology comes a week after similar refrains were made by Vice President Joe Biden and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius regarding the botched Obamacare online rollout.

Five things we learned from Obamacare records

WH: Chief tech officer too busy for congressional testimony

Asked if he thinks Americans will be able to trust what he says in the future, Obama said he thinks he’ll ultimately be “judged on whether” Obamacare is better for Americans overall.

“When you try to do something big like make our health care system better … there are going to be problems along the way, even if ultimately what you’re doing is going to make a whole lot of people better off, and I hope that people will look at the end product and they’re going to be able to look back and say, you know what, we now have protections we didn’t have before,” he said.

In the NBC interview, Obama reiterated the administration’s line that he’s “confident” a “majority of people” will be able to use the website and apply for insurance by November 30. But he did not say whether he would push back the March 31 deadline to enroll or the penalty for those who do not purchase insurance.

Obamacare depends on younger, healthier Americans to buy into the program and pay premiums to offset costs for covering older people who need more health care. Those without insurance who do not sign up for a plan face a fine.

What else could go wrong with Obamacare?

A Gallup poll conducted just over a week ago showed 36% of Americans said they didn’t think that in the long run the Affordable Care Act would make much of a difference to their family’s health care situation. Just over a third said the health care law would make matters worse, and one in four said that Obamacare would make things better.

Opinion: Here’s the truth about Obamacare

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/09/obamacare-delays-show-law-is-unworkable,2013-07-09 00:00:00,"['Rep. Aaron Schock', 'R-Il']",ObamaCare Delays Show Law Is Unworkable,"Before the dust settled on the news that the Obama Administration was delaying the intrusive employer mandate until 2015, a new 606-page regulation was issued on Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services stating it would now rely on self-reported income and employment verification in the state-run exchanges under ObamaCare. In other words, a welcome mat for fraud.

This is another startling development which is becoming part of a larger theme as ObamaCare is rolled out to the public. It is clear that the Affordable Care Act is unworkable. For those like myself who opposed it from the start, we saw the writing on the wall early on as President Obama’s signature health care legislation was rammed through the halls of Congress. If only then-Speaker Pelosi had insisted that her party read the legislation before passing it, maybe some of this would have come to light earlier on. While the eventual passage of the legislation was certain under Democrat control of Congress, maybe some Democrats now sounding the alarm about the devastating impact of the legislation would have done so sooner if they had read it while it was still a bill, not only after it became law.

As of now, ObamaCare is $1 trillion over budget; I say “as of now” because it’s almost certain that with the elimination of the anti-fraud measures the cost will further skyrocket, and there are examples to back up this theory.

In January, the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services began an effort to remove ineligible people from the state’s Medicaid rolls. The initial audit concluded that of the first 20,500 recipients screened, it was recommended 13,709 be removed from eligibility. The Chicago Tribune reports that “since 2000, Illinois Medicaid rolls have doubled, from fewer than 1.4 million people to nearly 2.8 million, or more than 1 in 5 Illinoisans.” In part because of the rising Medicaid rolls, the state’s backlog of unpaid bills is expected to grow to $21 billion by fiscal year 2018.

States are fascinating laboratories of democracy that can provide brilliant blueprints for other states and the federal government to follow. However, states can also serve as flashing red lights when plans go wrong. Illinois is a great example of how a lack of anti-fraud measures can drain a state’s coffers. As President Obama’s home state, he would be wise to take notice.

President Reagan famously said “trust but verify.” In light of the notion that the U.S. health care system makes up one-eighth of the economy, it’s my hope that this administration will grasp hold of this sensible advice."

Washington (CNN) – House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Sunday neither she nor President Barack Obama misled the American people when they said, during the run-up to the passage of Obamacare, that people could keep their health insurance plans.

Pelosi clarified their remarks, saying they only meant people could keep their plans if they had already signed up before Obama signed the bill in 2010.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='gregclarycnn']

""(Obama is) gracious and he's taking responsibility,” Pelosi said on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” “But that doesn't mean there's anything in the law that said if you like what you had before 2010, you couldn't keep it.""

The Affordable Care Act allows for people to keep their health plans if they had signed up before the bill was enacted - but not after.

Fact Check: If you liked your health plan, you can keep your health plan

The president repeatedly said during the campaign for health care reform that if people liked their insurance plans they could keep them.

Following many health plan cancellation notices – a million in California alone – Obama told the American people Thursday he’s responsible for not having been clear.

“I completely get how upsetting this can be for a lot of Americans, particularly after assurances they heard from me that if they had a plan that they liked, they could keep it. And to those Americans, I hear you loud and clear,” Obama said.

The President offered a short-term fix, allowing people who have had plans canceled to remain on them for an additional year.

On Friday, the House passed a bill, with bipartisan support, allowing people to stay on their plans permanently. It’s unclear whether that bill will have a chance to move forward or if Obama might even veto it if it passed in the Senate.

The fumbling – Obama’s word - rollout of Obamacare may take a toll on Democratic prospects in next year’s midterm elections, even though the party came out on top in opinion polls following a government shutdown last month. That shutdown now seems like a distant memory.

""I don't think you can tell what will happen next year, but I will tell you this: Democrats stand tall in support of the Affordable Care Act,” Pelosi said.

“What's important about it is that the American people get served, not who gets re-elected.”"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/11/fundraising-from-hhs-secretary-draws-scrutiny/,2013-05-11 00:00:00,[],Fundraising push from Sebelius draws scrutiny from key GOP senator,"Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' recent push to encourage health care executives and nonprofit organizations to make donations to organizations working to implement ObamaCare is drawing criticism from a key Senate Republican who questions whether she has a conflict of interest.

HHS spokesman Jason Young confirms that Sebelius in recent weeks has asked various charitable foundations, businesses executives, churches and doctors to make financial contributions to nonprofit organizations, such as Enroll America, that are helping to implement President Obama's health care overhaul.

Young said there is a special section within the Public Health Services Act that allows the HHS secretary to solicit financial support for nonprofit organizations conducting public health work. He said most of the solicitations have occurred through telephone calls, but in some speeches as well.

""For the last several months, the secretary has been working with a full range of stakeholders who share in the mission of getting Americans the help they need and deserve,"" Young said. ""We have always worked with outside groups and the efforts now ramping up are just one more part of that work.""

The fundraising pitches were first reported by the Washington Post. Young said Sebelius made no fundraising request of entities regulated by HSS, such as drug companies, hospitals or insurers.

Some lawmakers and advocacy groups have voiced concerns in recent weeks that many consumers will have a hard time navigating the health coverage options available to them next year as a mix of government programs and tax credits for private insurance kicks in.

The administration has recently announced it would be directing $200 million to states, private groups and local health centers so that they can hire workers who can help consumers pick the insurance plan best for them. The fundraising pitches appear to be another step along those lines. Beginning Oct. 1, people can start signing up for coverage through new state and federal health exchanges.

But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said that soliciting money from health care executives is absurd.

""Moving forward, I will be seeking more information from the administration about these actions to help better understand whether there are conflicts of interest and if it violated federal law,"" Hatch said.

Hatch's criticism comes as House Republicans plan yet another vote to try to repeal ObamaCare.

In his remarks at a Mother's Day-themed event at the White House on Friday, Obama said his signature health care law ""is here to stay.""

""There's a lot that this law is already doing for Americans with insurance,"" the president said. ""There's a lot more that's going to happen for folks who don't have insurance.""

State officials said the Covered California website got 645,000 hits during the first day of enrollment, far fewer than the 5 million it reported Tuesday.

The state exchange had cited the 5 million figure as a sign of strong consumer interest and a major reason people had so much difficulty using its $313-million online enrollment system.

Dana Howard, a spokesman for Covered California, said the error was the result of internal miscommunication.

“Someone misspoke and thought it was indeed 5 million hits. That was incorrect,” he said.

Full coverage: Obamacare rolls out

Howard said the revised Web traffic still represents a huge response. He said the number of unique online visitors Tuesday was 514,000 and the state received 19,000 calls.

Meantime, Californians were still running into computer problems and long hold times during the second day of enrollment under the federal healthcare law.

Those glitches have prompted Covered California to shut down its online enrollment system twice.

First, the state took it down from 9 p.m. Tuesday until 7 a.m. Wednesday to make technical fixes. Then Covered California took enrollment offline for two hours Wednesday morning because information on health plans wasn’t loading properly, according to the state.

These problems could frustrate consumers and hamper enrollment efforts. California is trying to sign up more than 2 million people through next year, the most of any state.

Some consumers said they were able to create an account on the state’s website at www.coveredca.com, but the system crashed after that.

People calling for information continued to face wait times of 30 minutes or more. Some call-center representatives at the exchange told people they were having trouble accessing the state system themselves, further slowing down the enrollment process.

State officials say they are taking steps to remedy these service issues. California has about 300 people answering calls now, and it plans to add an additional 150 employees next month at a call center opening in Fresno.

Supporters of the healthcare law said there’s still time to iron out problems before coverage takes effect Jan. 1 on these new exchange plans. Enrollment runs through March 31.

Obamacare Q&A: Explaining your options



Insurers limiting doctors, hospitals in new exchange market



Demand is strong as Obamacare enrollment starts in California"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/24/Cummings-Previews-Democrats-Script-for-Obamacare-Hearings,2013-10-24 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],Cummings Previews Democrats' Script for Obamacare Hearings,"As the first hearings on the failed implementation of Obamacare begin Thursday, with the testimony of the healthcare.gov contractors before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Democrats have already developed their strategy for blunting Republican criticism. They will a) assert that repairs are being made; b) attack critics for “politicizing” the problems; and c) demand the GOP join efforts to support the law.

Along the way, Democrats will cling mightily to the straw man upon which they relied throughout 2009-2010 during the debate over the law: namely, that if you oppose Obamacare you are opposed to providing health care to the working poor, to those with pre-existing conditions, to the temporarily unemployed. They will cover the foreseeable failure of a policy that has already hurt millions with the glory of noble intentions.

Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, previewed the Democrats’ strategy on Oct. 22, in an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN’s The Situation Room. Cummings made clear that his party will try to deflect criticism of Obamacare by casting it as the latest example of alleged Republican overreach on Obama administration scandals:

BLITZER: I know you must be very frustrated. Were you surprised to learn that apparently no one was really in charge of this Web site rollout, even though they had a couple years to plan for it? CUMMINGS: Yes, a bit surprised. But Wolf, what we’ve got to concentrate now on is making sure that the Web site works. And I’m hoping that Republicans and Democrats will see this not as a partisan issue, but as one that we have to make work for all the American people. Failure is just not an option…. Keep in mind, Republicans have spent the last few years trying to repeal it over 45 times, trying to defund it, trying to delay it. And so I have not seen a lot of effort on their part to make the law better but simply to destroy it. So that’s the kind of issue that I’m working with, Wolf, on my committee. I’ve got to make sure that we all work together to make sure that the law works for millions upon millions of Americans who need health care…. I think what I’m seeing now is the same play and the same scene all over again. We saw the chairman make strong allegations which were inaccurate with regard to Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. And only to find out that those allegations were simply not accurate and had no basis of fact. So it makes my job a little tougher.

Note that the country has yet to learn the truth of what happened in Benghazi, Fast and Furious, and the IRS scandal. In every case, Cummings has tried to prevent oversight, not to facilitate it. He acknowledges some failures in the administration, and expresses some minimal outrage, but then tries to cast Republicans as witch-hunters rather than trying to hold the executive accountable. Expect more of the same on Obamacare."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/20/Obamacare-Individual-Mandate-Fix-is-Illegal-Again,2013-12-20 00:00:00,['Ken Klukowski'],Obama Illegaly Delays Obamacare Individual Mandate for Some,"President Barack Obama has illegally suspended the single most important provision of Obamacare, the infamous Individual Mandate, for some Americans.

On Dec. 19, the president declared a change to the Individual Mandate, a provision that led to the first lawsuit in American history where a majority of the states in this nation (26 out of 50) sued the federal government over the constitutionality of a federal law, resulting in a historic Supreme Court decision that conservative lawyers and scholars roundly condemn insofar as it upheld the Individual Mandate as a massive tax by a 5-4 vote.

The Obama administration’s disastrous rollout of Obamacare has been a textbook illustration of the manifest incompetence of government to run the American healthcare system, from the humiliating website difficulties to the eye-popping costs of skyrocketing monthly insurance premiums and deductibles. The White House explains that it would be unfair under these circumstances to penalize Americans who attempt to obtain insurance through the Obamacare exchanges but are unable to do so.

Therefore the president has declared a “hardship exemption” for Americans encountering those difficulties. There will be a grace period for at least part of 2014. The White House has not specified a firm date of when this exemption will definitely end, or how they will be able to distinguish with certainty people who earnestly tried to obtain insurance versus those who are gaming the system.

But this exemption, like those that came before it, is illegal. The language of ACA’s Section 1501 is to impose a truly-mandatory Individual Mandate. Conservatives insist that even if all the provisions in the ACA are applied, the system will not work financially. But even liberals admit that if the Individual Mandate is not in force, then you do not bring in enough revenue from young, healthy adults to pay for the staggering cost of the massive new entitlements and programs that the ACA creates. Without the Individual Mandate, you get a “death spiral” of growing deficits that will render health insurance companies insolvent and deprive healthcare providers of payment for their life-saving treatments.

In Section 1513 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the Employer Mandate (the requirement for companies employing 50+ people) specifies that this requirement for employers to offer insurance goes into effect Jan. 1, 2014. When Obama announced over the summer that he was suspending that requirement until 2015, he said he has the power to “tweak” a law so long as that tweaking “doesn’t go to the essence of the law.”

That’s dead wrong under the U.S. Constitution. Ironically, it would not apply here anyway, since some of these provisions like the Individual Mandate and the Employer Mandate are two of the most important provisions of the entire ACA and are essential to the ACA’s core operations. However, even if they were insignificant provisions, the Constitution does not permit a president to change a single semicolon of a federal law by himself.

Under Article I of the Constitution, every law must either pass the House, the Senate, and be signed by the president, or if the president vetoes the bill instead of signing it, then it must pass the House and Senate a second time, by a two-thirds super-majority vote in each chamber. That is the only process by which federal law can be made. Everything else is illegal.

Many laws authorize top administrative officials to develop regulations carrying the force of law to implement some provision in the law. Other laws contain provisions that empower executive-branch officials to suspend or modify certain legal requirements, usually for a fixed period of time and only after certain conditions are met, such as completing a study that discovers facts that are relevant to the law’s operations. This power is delegated by the terms of the statute, where the federal law-making body–Congress–votes to include such an option in a law.

That is not the case with these parts of Obamacare. The changes in the law that President Obama has announced, such as telling insurers in Nov. 2013 that they could continue offering canceled policies, have been unilateral changes to mandatory terms in the federal law passed by Congress. These are provisions where Congress did not allow Obama or any of his Cabinet secretaries any discretion or options. They are requirements that bind the government and the private sector.

So not only is Obamacare bad policy, but now another aspect of this program is illegal.

The White House has been rocked back on their heels not just by the rollout problems of HealthCare.gov (which is now actually working), but also by these Scammy ""Cancellation Letters"". But now the charlatans behind the curtain are finally being revealed.

Donna received the letter canceling her insurance plan on Sept. 16. Her insurance company, LifeWise of Washington, told her that they'd identified a new plan for her. If she did nothing, she'd be covered. A 56-year-old Seattle resident with a 57-year-old husband and 15-year-old daughter, Donna had been looking forward to the savings that the Affordable Care Act had to offer. But that's not what she found. Instead, she'd be paying an additional $300 a month for coverage. The letter made no mention of the health insurance marketplace that would soon open in Washington, where she could shop for competitive plans, and only an oblique reference to financial help that she might qualify for, if she made the effort to call and find out. Otherwise, she'd be automatically rolled over to a new plan -- and, as the letter said, ""If you're happy with this plan, do nothing."" If Donna had done nothing, she would have ended up spending about $1,000 more a month for insurance than she will now that she went to the marketplace, picked the best plan for her family and accessed tax credits at the heart of the health care reform law. ""The info that we were sent by LifeWise was totally bogus. Why the heck did they try to screw us?"" Donna said. ""People who are afraid of the ACA should be much more afraid of the insurance companies who will exploit their fear and end up overcharging them."" Donna is not alone.

No, she's not alone. It's not clear how widespread this practice has been, but some State insurance commissioners are starting to notice. In Kentucky, Insurance Provider Humana was fined $65,000 for sending out misleading letters.

The Kentucky Department of Insurance has fined Humana $65,430 because it offered policyholders an unapproved opportunity to amend their insurance as part of a letter that regulators have called “misleading.” The department investigated letters sent in August to 6,543 individual plan policyholders in Kentucky. The letters said they needed to renew their plans for 2014 within 30 days or choose a more expensive option that complies with the Affordable Care Act. But regulators last month called the letters misleading, arguing they did not make sufficiently clear that policyholders could compare and choose competing plans on the state’s health insurance exchanges, which open on Oct. 1, and for which they could be eligible for federal subsidies.

Let's follow this logically, if the letters were sent in August and required a response within 30 days - it essentially forced the policy holders to choose the worse possible option before the Oct 1st launch of their State Exchange. That is a classic ""High Pressure"" sales tactic. ""Buy NOW or you'll miss out. SALE ENDING SOON"" - when in fact, there was no legitimate reason to push people make a decision in that 30 day window other than to prevent them from shopping on the Exchange. Read the Human Letter. 2,200 people actually did respond within that 30 period, but Kentucy regulators after finding they had been deceived by Humana released them from that agreement and allowed them to go ahead and shop for a better plan on the marketplace. Then they fined Humana for their attempted Scam.

[Kentucky Insurance Commissioner Sharon] Clark gave the example of a single mother with children who was urged to sign up for a Humana plan with a monthly premium of $719.86. That price is higher than any comparable plan for sale on the state's insurance marketplace, Clark said -- not to mention that the mother might have qualified for tax subsidies to help pay for it if she went through the marketplace, as Donna did.

So the next time you hear or read about how ObamaCare has caused someone to lose their inexpensive plan only to be forced to choose a much more expensive one. Don't Believe It. As Adm. Akbar would say: It's. A. Trap! Vyan

8:42 AM PT: To be fair, as VcLib pointed out in the comments not every plan was automatically Grandfathered. There were these restrictions via https://www.healthcare.gov/....

All health plans must:

.End lifetime limits on coverage

.End arbitrary cancellations of health coverage

.Cover adult children up to age 26

.Provide a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC), a short, easy-to-understand summary of what a plan covers and costs

.Hold insurance companies accountable to spend your premiums on health care, not administrative costs and bonuses Grandfathered plans DON'T have to:

.Cover preventive care for free

.Guarantee your right to appeal

.Protect your choice of doctors and access to emergency care .Be held accountable through Rate Review for excessive premium increases In addition to the above, grandfathered individual health insurance plans (the kind you buy yourself, not the kind you get from an employer) don't have to: .End yearly limits on coverage .Cover you if you have a pre-existing health condition

So if you had a plan that had a lifetime cap, didn't cover your children until they were 26, could be arbitrarily cancelled and didn't spend 80-85% of your premiums on your care - that plan would have to be updated or replaced. If you had a plan like that, and for some reason liked it then you were always going to have to make an adjustment to a plan that doesn't suck anymore. The question is, would you be able to shop for the best possible option or would you stay with the options given by your current provider? These letters show that some providers tried to corral their clients into staying and accepting a much higher rate - blaming the ACA for it - and therefore scaring them away from the Exchange Marketplace. We've been hearing that the reason these plans were more expensive is because they had to cover preventive care (Limbaugh had a field-day with that one last week), but as shown above the Grandfathered Plans Didn't. It's a scam, it's all a scam.

10:13 AM PT: One more issue on Grandfathered Plans via the Comments

Plans could acquire grandfathered status by adding those features to the existing ones, they did not have to already have them in place. Some of the elements, like the ""no lifetime cap"" one, were phased in over time, and therefore explicitly allowed adjustment of benefits in an existing plan. Coverage of children under 26 is not likely to be a feature that many plans had in early 2010, yet clearly insurance plans have added this feature. My current coverage has grandfathered status. It had some of these features, like no lifetime cap, other benefits have been added or modified to comply with the grandfathering requirements.

So, you got that? Grandfathered Plans are not written in unbendable, unbreakable Adamantium, they can and have been amended since 2010. They don't have to meet all the requirements of the ACA, just a few of them and have to have existed since before the law was passed and signed - That's All.

So let's go back and revisit ""If you like your plan, you can keep it"" as being flawed or wrong. It's NOT. Instead of amending the plans to meet minimum grandfather requirements they are being Shutdown By the Insurance Industries Choice, not by ObamaCare.

1:34 PM PT: One final point that puts the LIE to the claim that these plans couldn't meet the Grandfathered requirements is the fact that There's Nothing New Required of Grandfathered Plans This Year.

The Lifting of the Lifetime Spending Cap has been phased in since 2010.

The law restricts and phases out the annual dollar limits that all job-related plans, and individual health insurance plans issued after March 23, 2010, can put on most covered health benefits. Specifically, the law says that none of these plans can set an annual dollar limit lower than:

$750,000: for a plan year or policy year starting on or after September 23, 2010 but before September 23, 2011.

$1.25 million: for a plan year or policy year starting on or after September 23, 2011 but before September 23, 2012.

$2 million: for a plan year or policy year starting on or after September 23, 2012 but before January 1, 2014. No annual dollar limits are allowed on most covered benefits beginning January 1, 2014.

It's not like the ACA suddenly requires old insurance plans to do something this year, that they weren't essentially required to do last year - other than PAY peoples claims.

Similarly the ability to keep your children on your family plan isn't new, that was established in 2010.

ffective for Plan or Policy Years Beginning On or After September 23, 2010. Secretary Kathleen Sebelius called on leading insurance companies to begin covering young adults voluntarily before the implementation date required by the Affordable Care Act (which is plan or policy years beginning on or after September 23rd). Early implementation would avoid gaps in coverage for new college graduates and other young adults and save on insurance company administrative costs of dis-enrolling and re-enrolling them between May 2010 and September 23, 2010. Over 65 companies have responded to this call saying they will voluntarily continue coverage for young adults who graduate or age off their parents' insurance before the implementation deadline.

Lastly the requirement to spend at least 80% of your premiums on care and not administrative costs has already been in effect, that's why people have been getting rebate checks.

A new provision of the Affordable Care Act — called the Medical Loss Ratio, or the “80/20″ provision — could mean some Americans will see a rebate from their health insurance companies tomorrow. The provision is aimed at holding health insurance companies accountable for how they spend the money collected through premiums. It compares the dollars they spend on health care costs vs. other overhead costs — like marketing, salaries and administrative expenses.

Grandfathered plans don't have to cover pre-existing conditions. Grandfathered plans don't have to provide free preventive care services. (High Co-Pays and Deductibles can remain) Grandfathered plans can still limit yearly coverage (in the individual market).

In short, there is no New Special Expensive OBAMACARE Requirement on existing Grandfathered plans other the fact that the lifetime cap has gone from $2 Million to Infinite and they can't arbitrarily CANCEL your insurance between renewal periods. They can only do it at the end of you plan year, which is exactly what they're doing - simply because they can, not because Obamacare put some onerous expensive requirement on them.

Just about everything they were required by the ACA to do this year, they had to do LAST YEAR, and the year before that. Even more than when I first wrote this diary now believe these ""ObamaCare Cancellations"" are a SCAM."

USA TODAY

Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., says it's time for Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to resign for ""gross incompetence"" over the rocky start to a centerpiece of President Obama's health care law.

It's not unusual for a GOP senator to call on a member of a Democratic Cabinet to resign, or vice versa. But when the senator and the Cabinet secretary hail from the same state, their families have long been friends, and the senator supported the secretary's confirmation, that's noteworthy.

Sebelius and the Obama administration are taking a lot of blows over the new online health insurance exchanges that launched Oct. 1. Roberts has long been a critic of the health care law, and the computer glitches that have marred the rollout of the online exchanges are his last straw.

""Everything we warned about has come to pass,"" Roberts said in a statement that was especially critical of Sebelius' much-mocked appearance on The Daily Showwith Jon Stewart. ""They can see Obamacare has failed them. We need a secretary who can admit when enough is enough.""

Sebelius, a former governor of Kansas, defended the administration's launch of the health insurance exchanges. People have complained about long delays to sign up or not being able to do so at all because the Healthcare.gov website crashes. ""Nobody wants Americans to have to wait to sign up,"" she wrote in an op-ed column for USA TODAY. ""Engineers are working day and night to make upgrades. We're adding more servers to enable the system to handle larger loads. And we're upgrading our software as well to make the system more efficient and enable it to handle higher volumes.""

Roberts said at Sebelius' confirmation hearing in 2009 that they enjoyed a ""special relationship."" He was a congressional aide to Keith Sebelius, the secretary's father-in-law, and considers him his ""godfather"" in politics.

Updated 1:20 a.m. ET, 11/19/2013 – This is updated from an earlier version, adding more details.

(CNN)- Washington state resident Jessica Sanford was bursting with pride when President Obama mentioned her story during a Rose Garden event on health care reform last month at the White House.

""Who wouldn't?"" Sanford asks. ""I'm a nobody really to have him mention my story.""



Back in October, Sanford had written a letter to the White House to share her good news. The 48-year-old single mother of a teenage son diagnosed with ADHD had just purchased what she considered to be affordable insurance on the Washington state exchange.

""I was ecstatic. I couldn't wait to call the doctor for an appointment on January 2nd,"" Sanford told CNN about the feeling she had when she first enrolled.

Her heartfelt letter made it to the President's hands and then into his October 21 speech.

""'I was crying the other day when I signed up. So much stress lifted.'"" Obama said, reading from Sanford's letter.

The president said Sanford's story was proof, despite the technical problems with the healthcare.gov website, that the Affordable Care Act was working.

""That's what the Affordable Care Act is all about. The point is, the essence of the law - the health insurance that's available to people - is working just fine,"" Obama said.

But then, after Obama mentioned her story, Sanford started having problems. Sanford said she received another letter informing her the Washington state health exchange had miscalculated her eligibility for a tax credit.

In other words, her monthly insurance bill had shot up from $198 a month (she had initially said $169 a month to the White House but she switched plans) to $280 a month for the same ""gold"" plan offered by the state exchange.

Sanford said she was frustrated with the state's error. But she decided to purchase the new plan and thought everything was fine.

It wasn't fine. Last week, Sanford received another letter from the Washington state exchange, stating there had been another problem, a ""system error"" that resulted in some ""applicants to qualify for higher than allowed health insurance premium tax credits.""

The letter said the state exchange was ""disappointed to have discovered this issue"" and apologized.

The result was a higher quote, which Sanford said was for $390 per month for a ""silver"" plan with a higher deductible. Still too expensive

A cheaper ""bronze"" plan, Sanford said, came in at $324 per month, but also with a high deductible - also not in her budget.

Then another letter from the state exchange with even worse news.

""Your household has been determined eligible for a Federal Tax Credit of $0.00 to help cover the cost of your monthly health insurance premium payments,"" the latest letter said.

""I had a good cry,"" Sanford said about her reaction to the latest news from the state.

As a self-employed court reporter, the new quote was simply out of her range.

""This is it. I'm not getting insurance,"" Sanford told CNN. ""That's where it stands right now unless they fix it.""

Sanford, an Obama supporter who voted for the president twice, is careful to say she blames the state of Washington's online marketplace for the mixed signals and not the White House.

She is sorry Obama mentioned her during the October 21 speech.

""I feel awful about it. I support (the Affordable Care Act),"" Sanford said.

But the messy rollout in the other Washington, the nation's capital, was not far from her mind.

""What the hell? Why is it the same story as the federal government?"" Sanford says in disgust with the Washington state exchange. ""They didn't have it ready.""

""They screwed up,"" she added.

Sanford reiterated her frustration in a post to the Washington HealthPlanFinder's Facebook page last Friday.

""Wow. You guys really screwed me over,"" Sanford wrote. ""Now I have been priced out and will not be able to afford the plans you offer. But, I get to pay $95 and up for not having health insurance. I am so incredibly disappointed and saddened. You majorly screwed up.""

In response, a HealthplanFinder posting tried to direct Sanford to a broker for help.

""Jessica, we are very sad and disappointed that the tax credit miscalculation affected you so heavily,"" the comment read, suggesting she try to find a new plan on the site. Sanford responded on Facebook the issue was affordability.

Bethany Frey, a spokeswoman for Washington HealthPlanFinder told CNN on Monday night, ""I'm already looking into this with our client specialist team. I'll let you know what I hear."""

For instance, today the White House informed the media that between Sunday and Friday, Healthcare.gov enjoyed 3.7 million visits.

We have also been told that the site’s error rate was .077 percent, the response time averaged under a second, and a whopping (and improbable) 93% of consumers did come back later after they were asked to due to the site being too busy.

As The Hill points out, though, that data is all hollow happy talk that tells us nothing about what really matters. What the White House refuses to disclose, or claims it doesn’t yet have the data to disclose, just happens to be the information that will tell us if ObamaCare is or is not working:

The Obama administration is selectively releasing data and metrics on ObamaCare to bolster its case that the rollout is going better in the month of December.

Tidbits of information from federal health officials — especially figures that show improvements at HealthCare.gov — have become a key tool in the effort to “reboot” the law in the eyes of the public.

But the limited nature of the releases has created conflict with the media and put the spotlight on outstanding areas of concern for the rollout, such as the enrollment site’s back end.

The White House has blithely changed the definition of the world “enrollee” to someone who has not yet enrolled, but has only selected an insurance plan and placed it into a shopping cart. Studies show that the abandonment rate for shopping carts is 67%.

Up until now, though, the media have breathlessly reported “enrollment” numbers spoon-fed to them by the White House without doing any of their own independent reporting to find out how many have actually enrolled. Maybe those days are coming to an end.

The Hill points out the other vital metrics the White House has thus far not released:

Since late October, federal health officials have touted traffic to the site, error rates and page load times almost daily in an effort to illustrate positive changes.

Enrollment figures are only discussed monthly, and leaked sign-up numbers are not confirmed. Vital information for judging the growing risk pools, such as applicants’ ages, goes undiscussed.

The administration appears to have largely chosen data over anecdotes as the most powerful way to communicate site improvements to the media.

The metrics released are difficult to independently verify, but provide easy headlines and talking points for anxious supporters of the Affordable Care Act, including congressional Democrats.

Another area where the White House has dissembled rather than been forthcoming involves the number of meetings between Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and President Obama during the three years after the passage of ObamaCare. A Government Accountability Institute study finds only a single meeting between the two recorded on any White House calendar or log. Friday, Jay Carney would only say that the two met frequently, but provided no details.

While we are sure to be hit with all kinds of selective data leaks before the end of the year that are only meant to make ObamaCare look successful, The Hill reports that a number that will not be released until the end of the year is a breakdown of those who are truly enrolled — in other words, those who have actually paid for a premium.

The fact that the White House always has positive data that sounds good but means nothing, but never the data that matters, has raised the suspicions of the American people from the beginning. It is good to know now, that after two-plus months of this Administration Hustle, the media has apparently had enough.

(CNN) —

Saturday marks the Obama administration’s self-imposed deadline to fix the troubled HealthCare.gov website, for most people at least.

Deadline Day: Will Obamacare website work?

It caps a frenzied, two-month race by computer programmers and contractors sprinkled throughout the D.C. suburbs on both sides of the beltway in Maryland and Virginia.

The overall scene in response to the botched rollout of the online portal conveys a “war-room” urgency with “ruthless prioritization,” many moving parts, grinding work, briefings, phone-bridges, and of course, plenty of take-out food.

Operations are overseen from a command center in Columbia, Maryland. That’s where contractor QSSI has spearheaded the effort with help from some Web heavyweights.

John Engates, the Chief Technology Officer at Rackspace.com, was an early critic of the website given a behind-the-scenes tour of the effort to fix it.

“I think it’s going to work,” Engates said on CNN’s “The Lead.”

But Luke Chung, president of Virginia-based software developer FMS Inc., called the administration’s prediction the site would work at 80% capacity on or around November 30 an impractical threshold in the software world.

The site, which was taken down for overnight maintenance ahead of Saturday’s deadline, is the lynchpin of Obamacare and is meant to be used by 36 states to enroll millions of Americans into health insurance now required by federal law.

Fourteen states have their own exchange sites and those, by and large, have fared better than HealthCare.gov, which was marred by crashes and other problems upon its launch October 1, embarrassing President Barack Obama, who championed the law known as Obamacare.

What happened in October?

The first thing to figure out was what went wrong – in brief.

“Not all websites are created equal,” Steven Van Roekel, the nation’s chief information officer and a former personal assistant to Bill Gates who helped roll out Windows XP, told reporters on Tuesday at a White House briefing.

Unlike a site like CNN.com, which he said is only to be viewed, or even an e-commerce site, which takes orders, HealthCare.gov is meant to be seamlessly multi-faceted.

A single user’s experience, unbeknownst to them, could require real-time information from the social security administration, DHS, the IRS and Veterans Affairs.

Fixing it on Obama’s orders was ultimately left to Jeffrey Zients, the management consultant and entrepreneur and former and future White House official.

He assembled a team, which includes Van Roekel and other experts, to oversee the overhaul being done by QSSI, other contractors and programmers.

High intensity approach

Zients conducted Tuesday’s White House briefing for reporters at a clipped pace and with the no nonsense tone of a tour guide in a hurry.

The session included a teleconference with the team from QSSI in Maryland – they couldn’t spare the time to make the trip into Washington – and programmers who drove into town from Tyson’s Corner in Virginia, where most of the software work is being done.

Seeking to confound the public view of the site as an epic failure of Presidential management, Zients and the contractors described a hive of trouble-shooters huddled at twice-daily conference calls and on a round-the-clock open phone line to respond as quickly as possible to problems.

“The point of these calls is we don’t have an hour or a minute to waste and therefore, we need to make sure that there is ruthless prioritization at all times as to what matters most, that there’s real-time reaction if something unexpected happened, someone hit a roadblock on a fix – so what are we going to do about that bug and how are we going to address that bug, and you get the best minds on the problems right away,” said Zients.

At a satellite office of QSSI in Virginia, insiders described to CNN’s Brianna Keilar a scene of programmers in marathon code-writing sessions and surrounded by stale Chinese food and half-eaten pizzas.

Back-end concern

One result of Zients’ prioritization? A focus over the past two months on the experience for users who want to sign up for insurance. That approach could have a consequence.

Insurers have reported receiving duplicative and at times faulty information on the back end of the site, which raises questions about whether some people who think they’re signing up for insurance will actually have it on January 1.

Insurers: Site glitches persist

Indeed, much of the system supporting HealthCare.gov - the back end for making payments and interacting with insurance companies – still needs to be built.

But so far, it has been the difficulty for Americans trying to sign up for coverage in the first place that has partly damaged public perception of the law.

Obamacare site fix: 5 things to look for

So the programmers and the contractors pay constant attention to real-time site metrics provided by services like Chartbeat, which is used to measure exactly how many people are on the site at any given time.

A quickly flashed screen grab during the technical briefing at the White House showed there were 15,687 users on HealthCare.gov at one point. The aim is to have the site capable of hosting 50,000 at any given time and up to 800,000 per day.

That was the goal for the site back on October 1 when repeated crashes seemed to keep most everyone trying to access the site from viewing insurance options.

After hardware upgrades installed November 23 and 24 to improve capacity and after software programmers spent the past two months addressing other hiccups, supporters of the law hope the website will function as intended.

Awash in metrics

They are awash in detailed metrics at the Maryland command center. In addition to Chartbeat, another web-based program measures response times; a spike on the graph can indicate serious problems. A third measures how far each and every user makes it through the enrollment process.

Don’t look for any of that data after the deadline this weekend, however. Specifics are still closely guarded details.

“We will continue to update you on metrics and user experience and our success rates as we go forward,” said Zients.

Joe Barton (R-TX) tore into the ObamaCare contractors for a hidden line of source code that secretly surrenders the ObamaCare applicant’s right to privacy. It was yet another damning revelation about the snoopiest White House ever, and by Friday, CNN’s Carol Costello was in full attack mode using misinformation to push back for the Administration.

Costello invited Barton on her Friday morning show, and after Barton reiterated his concern over ObamaCare’s secret and deceptive disclaimer, Costello dug in:

Well, I’ve been wondering about that. The only health-related question the website asks of you is whether you smoke. It doesn’t ask any other question. So what specifically are you talking about? What specific information would you share on this website that you wouldn’t normally share?

Before we get to Barton’s very specific answer, I have to interrupt to point out how stunningly ignorant Costello’s question is. First off, even if she was correct about the smoking question being the only health-related question, it is still a health-related question, and therefore a violation of HIPAA. Secondly, my understanding of HIPAA is that it not only protects your medical information, but also your personal information. And as someone who actually has gone through the ObamaCare application process, I can testify (and did here in detail) that the site asks a number of personal questions I “wouldn’t normally share.”

Regardless, why is this secret disclaimer not a big deal to a supposed journalist? We are talking about the federal government slipping in a line of code that will sucker millions into surrendering their privacy rights altogether, not just what qualifies under HIPAA.

But Costello is stuck on her White House talking points that claim HIPAA only covers medical information and the smoking question is no big deal.

Well, watch what happens next: Barton lists three more medical-related questions the ObamaCare website asks: your current insurance plan and its policy number, your mental and physical condition, and whether or not you are pregnant.

And what is Costello’s response? Does she say, “Oh, I didn’t know that. If you are correct, that is a problem.”

Nope. She just babbles on with her talking points as though she didn’t hear Barton answer her question with damning specifics:

USA TODAY

Up to 75%25 of those with individual insurance could have policies canceled%2C experts say

Administration has said a certain percentage of individuals will lose existing policies

Law sets minimum standards for policies

Millions of Americans are getting their health insurance canceled under the Affordable Care Act and the Obama administration has known for about three years that this would happen, NBC News is reporting.

About 50% to 75% of 14 million consumers who buy health insurance individually will receive a ""cancellation"" letter or its equivalent in the next year because their current policies don't meet the standards laid out by the new law, the news organization reports, citing four sources deeply involved in ACA.

Of those who will be forced to buy new insurance, many will face huge price increases, NBC reports.

Initially, the administration stipulated that policies in effect as of March 23, 2010, could be ""grandfathered"" or kept even if they don't meet the requirements of the new law. Later, the Department of Health and Human Services wrote regulations that narrowed that provision to dictate that if any part of those policies, such as co-pay or benefits, had substantially changed since then, they would not longer be grandfathered in.

NBC alleges the administration knew that up to 67% of customers on the individual market could have their policies canceled, but instead, President Obama said as recently as in 2012, ""If (you) already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance.""

The White House told NBC that people whose policies will be canceled will, in most cases, be automatically shifted to plans with better protections.

""Nothing in the Affordable Care Act forces people out of their health plans,"" White House spokeswoman Jessica Santillo told the news organization.

White House spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged that some plans would not meet the new minimum standards and would ""not qualify for the Affordable Care Act."""

Washington (CNN) – The No. 3 House Democrat on Sunday blamed a culture of sound bites for President Barack Obama's reneged promise that Americans would be able to keep their existing health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act.

""And this is a sound bite that the President probably needed to take some more time to explain to the American people,"" Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union with Candy Crowley.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

After millions of people received cancellation notices for their health plans, Obama faced considerable pushback over his promise to Americans that the new health care reform would not affect those who are already happy with their insurance policies.

""If you like your health insurance, you can keep it,"" Obama repeatedly told Americans when selling his signature piece of legislation.

After that turned out not to be the case, Obama on Thursday announced his administration would allow insurance companies to extend those canceled policies for a year.

Clyburn, the House assistant Democratic leader, said Obama relied too heavily on a sound bite-friendly selling point, rather than spelling out that he was only referring to plans in place before the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010 and hadn't changed since.

Fact Check: If you liked your health plan, you can keep your health plan

""One of the things in Washington that I dislike more than anything else is when people say to me, 'If you're explaining it, you're losing it.' I don't like that at all. I really believe the American people are deserving of explanations,"" he said, also blaming the media for not fully explaining the new legislation.

With recent polls showing the President is considered less trustworthy than in the past, Obama on Thursday said he expects he'll need to regain Americans' faith after the rocky rollout of HealthCare.gov and his broken promise about existing plans.

Clyburn said he was confident Obama can do so.

""Paradise lost, paradise regained. When you lose something you can find it again,"" he said. ""The President admitted that he expects to be held responsible for regaining the Americans' trust, and I think he will.""

But that lie has only been replaced with another: the lie that these cancellations will be limited to the 5% of Americans in the individual marketplace — when the truth is that these cancellations have only just begun.

Over at National Review, in a piece appropriately titled “Lying About Lies,” Michael Tanner reports that the same ObamaCare formula currently wiping out the individual market is about to rain hell on the employer-based market. The result will be that tens of millions of policies will be wiped out.

This is a secret that is and always has been hiding in plain sight.

As far back as last March, the media dutifully reported that the CBO reported that these cancellations were coming. So the media knew Obama was lying during the campaign but never said a word to spread this truth — oh, except to call Mitt Romney a liar for telling the truth.

All these Democrats and members of the elite media now pretending they don’t or didn’t know… Please.

Just as the media knew Obama was lying about people in the individual market being able to keep their insurance, the media also know that the same apocalypse looms for the employer-based market. It is not conservatives making this estimate, it is the Congressional Budget Office. [emphasis mine]

But the same conditions that are causing the cancellation of individual policies will eventually result in the cancellation of millions of employment-based policies as well. The only reason that hasn’t happened yet is that the employer mandate was postponed for a year, so employer plans don’t yet have to be ACA-compliant. But they will. Even the Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as 20 million workers will lose their current employer-sponsored plans. Combine that with those losing individual plans, and more than 30 million Americans cannot keep their current insurance.

ObamaCare’s latest trick is the “junk plan hustle.” Over and over, we keep hearing about how our White House overlords are doing Americans a favor by canceling the insurance they like and replacing it with “appropriate” health plans. But most of those plans are not junk plans. That is just another lie the White House is telling, and the media are letting them get away with it.

The media know the White House is lying about this junk plan nonsense because the ObamaCare guidelines for what isn’t a “junk plan” only includes 2% of the policies currently in existence.

According to HealthPocket, a health-insurance consulting firm, fewer than 2 percent of individual plans on offer today meet all ACA requirements. The most frequent reason for noncompliance was not a failure to cover hospitalization, as the administration has suggested, but not providing pediatric care, including vision and dental care for children. A worthwhile benefit, perhaps, but if you are childless, it’s hard to see how lacking such a benefit makes your policy subpar.

This is why other serious think tanks believe that before this nightmare is over, up to 93 million people could lose the insurance Obama promised they could keep.

In order to buy time, Obama, Democrats, and the media are trying to con the American people into believing that the rolling ObamaCare catastrophe is compartmentalized to just 5% of the population. This conspiracy of silence is all about trying to contain through a lie of omission what is a legitimate reason for the public to panic as soon as they realize that … they are next.

Obama is not sorry for lying. And the media are not sorry for covering up that lie for three years.

The phase we are in now is nothing more than a 2.0 version of that exact same lie.

That is both the good news and the bad news for Republicans who are hoping to use Obamacare as their prime attack point in the 2014 congressional elections.

For the GOP, continuing glitches in the online delivery system for the new national healthcare market reinforce the argument that the Obama administration has tried to do too much, too fast without really understanding the enormity of the job. That is the upside for Republicans. The downside is that there is obviously a demand for the product Obamacare is trying to deliver and, by the time the election rolls around, millions of voters may have forgotten the website bugs. Instead, they may be pleased that healthcare coverage is no longer out of reach for them and they will not want to see it taken away by a Republican Congress.

Conversely, there are a large number of voters who are not especially happy with the healthcare reforms. Many people who buy their own health insurance have been told their old policies are being discontinued and they must buy a more expensive alternative. Others have found their new insurance does not allow them to continue with the same medical care provider. They are upset now; will they still be angry next November?

My friend Mark might be. He is one of those who is seeing his healthcare rates spike. Mark got a letter from his insurance company a few weeks ago stating that, because of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, the cost of his coverage would almost triple. He went online to look for a better deal in the marketplace but could not find a plan that offered any savings. Then, a few days ago, his insurance company sent another letter announcing they had miscalculated; his rate was still going up, but not by nearly as much.

Mark’s conclusion, fair or not, echoes the suspicion many people have: The insurance companies are using Obamacare as an excuse to jack up rates and increase their profits.

On the other side of the ledger, there’s a young man I know named Daniel. He is a college student, too old to be on his parents’ plan, too lacking in income to buy his own coverage -- until now. Sunday, Dan signed up online. It took him just 45 minutes (he could have done it in under a half hour if he had not needed to track down an elusive number connected to his student loans). Lucky for him he is in a state with a smoothly operating exchange. Even luckier, he now has healthcare coverage and, because of his income level, does not have to pay a cent.

The rough reality is that people like Mark are paying more so that people like Daniel can get the healthcare they could not afford before Obamacare kicked in. Plenty of folks, especially Republicans, would insist this is not fair. But consider what the alternative has been.

A couple of years ago, Daniel suffered an appendicitis attack. Fortunately, he was rushed to a hospital and got immediate, expert care. He also got a bill for $30,000 that he could not pay. So, as hospitals have done for many years when giving care to those who could not afford insurance, they waived the huge fee and recouped the loss by billing other patients and their insurance companies at excessive rates.

Will that change now that nearly everyone will be insured? Will costs come down and benefit everyone? Will the complexities of the new healthcare system continue to be a source of glitches, goof ups and aggravation or will it all smooth out over time? Will Americans understand that those of us who are healthy and better off financially have always subsidized the cost of caring for those who are ill and poor and that this new system is an attempt to rationalize that process?

Since those questions and many more have yet to be answered, no one can really say if Republicans will be able to ride the anti-Obamacare bandwagon to victory next fall. By betting against universal healthcare, they might just as easily prove to be big losers."

In the early afternoon, many visitors were greeted with a message saying the site had a lot of visitors and asked people to wait. By about 2 pm, the site appeared to be operating normally and users were directed to log in or create an account.

Earlier in the day, applicants to healthcare.gov found a message saying that the system was down for scheduled maintenance. Visitors were advised to try again later or enter their email address to receive notice when the site is working again.

The exchange's tech team encountered an error during routine maintenance on Thursday night, said Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services. Repairs began at 10 a.m. Friday and were estimated to take two to three hours.

The outage came shortly before President Obama was set to hold a news conference before leaving for vacation.

And it came at a very inopportune time for the rollout of Obamacare. Americans in the states using the federal exchange have until the end of Monday to pick a plan on healthcare.gov to be eligible for coverage beginning Jan. 1.

The administration has said that those who encounter problems signing up can qualify for a special enrollment period, but it has not provided details on how it would work.

As 2013 draws to a close, administration officials are scrambling to smooth over remaining Obamacare problems.

Late Thursday, the White House announced that individual policy holders who received termination notices could qualify for a hardship exemption and buy catastrophic plans on the exchanges. And, after pressure from the administration, insurers announced applicants could pay their first month's premiums as late as Jan. 10 and receive coverage retroactive to Jan. 1.

Not considered in the 2011 selection process was the history of numerous executives at CGI Federal, who had come from another company that had mishandled at least 20 other government ­information technology projects more than a decade ago. But federal officials were not required to examine that long-term track record, which included a highly publicized failure to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers.

By 2011, CGI Federal already had been cleared to do government work at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency overseeing the rollout of the new health-care law.

The company had been included in a pool of pre-screened, approved contractors in 2007, during the George W. Bush administration, and only firms in that pool were later allowed to bid for the Affordable Care Act work. It was at that earlier time that the problems at American Management Systems, the Fairfax County IT contractor acquired by CGI, would have figured into the assessment of CGI Federal, contracting experts say.

In hindsight, one former CMS official said, the AMS record “could well have knocked [CGI Federal] out of the competition, and probably should have.”

View Graphic A look at the consumer's route through the HealthCare.gov website and the potential failure points.

In light of the bungled launch of the health-care Web site, critics have repeatedly asked how CGI Federal got the contract, and there has been widespread speculation on online news sites and blogs that the firm was selected because of political ties to the Obama administration.

But a review of internal documents and interviews with former and current federal officials show that the selection process was walled off from politics.

Career officials at CMS, working out of an obscure Baltimore-based contracting office, focused in 2011 on the proposals submitted by four bidders, examining technical competency and cost while giving relatively little attention to past performance. Since 2007, CGI Federal had won 17 other CMS jobs under the pre-screened contract, worth several hundred million dollars.

The review of CGI Federal concluded there was “no evidence of performance risk,” according to a CMS document, portions of which were read to The Washington Post by a person familiar with the contracting process.

CGI Federal won the $93 million contract, now worth $293 million, in September 2011.

At the time of the earlier selection process in 2007, CGI Federal was still relatively new to federal contracting. It had grown out of CGI Group’s acquisition in 2004 of AMS, which had a recent history of troubled projects, including a Philadelphia school computer system that sent paychecks to dead people and a Mississippi tax system so dysfunctional that a jury awarded a $474 million verdict against the firm.

Three former CMS officials said in recent interviews that the AMS problems should have raised red flags.

“Should CMS have recognized that ‘Okay, here’s CGI Federal. It’s a new company, but, oh, my God, it looks a lot like the AMS from yesterday’?” asked one former CMS official familiar with the contracting process who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures. “Yes. I would consider that dropping the ball.’’

Tasha Bradley, a CMS spokeswoman, said in a statement that the agency “adheres by a long-

established contracting process where expert, career contracting officials evaluate and award contracts based on criteria outlined in the contract solicitation, including past performance, technical expertise and proposed contract value.”

CMS declined to comment on specific questions about how closely CGI Federal’s past performance was evaluated and whether that review looked at AMS.

Former AMS executives have defended that company’s performance, and CGI officials have rejected any comparison with AMS’s earlier failures.

CGI Federal has also defended its work on HealthCare.gov, despite an October launch that White House officials have acknowledged was disastrous. Federal officials have faulted the company’s performance, saying it missed deadlines, understaffed the job and overstated its progress.

People familiar with the project have said it was also hampered by administration mismanagement, fierce Republican opposition and political sensitivities that delayed policy and regulatory decisions.

The federal online marketplace that is selling health plans in 36 states under the 2010 health-care law has been functioning better in recent weeks, but officials are still working to fix lingering problems, including errors in enrollment records sent to insurance companies. CGI Federal remains intimately involved in the project, writing computer code in attempts to fix various aspects of the system.

Linda Odorisio, CGI’s vice president for global communications, said the company “continues to work closely with CMS and all of its vendor partners to deliver continuous enhancements in system performance and the user experience” on the Web site.

She added that CGI Federal “contributed to the significant improvements made to the system over the last two months, resulting in more than half a million Americans enrolling in just the first three weeks of December.”

Umbrella contract

In December 2006, CMS put out a request for proposals. The agency said it was seeking “world-class IT services” to improve and maintain the massive systems that run Medicare and Medicaid, according to contracting documents. Thirty-one bidders responded, including CGI Federal.

CMS used a procurement method that has become increasingly common over the past decade. The agency first awarded an umbrella contract to a group of firms, and those firms were then eligible to bid on future IT work. Experts say this saves the government time because it shortens the subsequent bid process.

In evaluating the bids, CMS was to scrutinize each company’s performance on previous contracts, according to an internal agency document obtained by The Post. The document described a “risk assessment” of cost control, on-time delivery and other factors.

Federal law requires that past performance be considered for all federal contracts worth more than $150,000, with limited exceptions. Federal regulations also say CMS should have considered the record of “predecessor companies,” such as AMS. Several former officials familiar with the 2007 selection said no concerns about CGI Federal were raised inside the agency.

AMS projects had run into trouble at the federal level and in at least 12 states, according to government audit reports, interviews and news accounts. The purchase of AMS was CGI’s entree into the U.S. government market, and AMS executives flocked to CGI Federal. Today, more than 100 former AMS employees are senior executives or consultants working for CGI in the Washington area.

One former CMS official said the agency especially should have examined the most publicized AMS failure, an effort to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers. AMS was fired in 2001 by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board after going $60 million over budget, writing computer code that turned out to be useless and never delivering a workable system, according to government reports.

AMS had settled lawsuits arising from the project in 2003. “That should have stood out,’’ the former official said.

CGI Federal was ultimately chosen for an umbrella contract, worth up to $4 billion in future work, along with 15 other firms, including Lockheed Martin and IBM.

While it is unclear whether agency officials examined the AMS track record, former CMS officials said it probably would not have made much difference, because past performance has long been an overlooked component of federal contracting.

Deadline pressure

In the summer of 2011, the Obama administration was racing to figure out who would build the Affordable Care Act’s all-important Web site. “Time is of the essence,” said an internal CMS draft request for proposals, dated June 24, 2011.

With deadlines looming, officials limited the bidders to the winners of the 2007 umbrella contract. “There was very great time pressure,” recalled a former CMS official familiar with the process. “The feeling was we had a lot of big IT powerhouses and they knew our work.’’

Four firms applied: IBM, Computer Sciences Corp., Quality Software Services and CGI Federal.

As is tradition, the selection process was strictly sheltered from political considerations and political appointees at CMS or elsewhere in the administration, according to numerous former and current CMS employees.

“I deliberately stayed out of contracting,’’ said Leslie Norwalk, the agency’s acting administrator under President George W. Bush. “If that had changed, I would have heard rumblings.’’

Agency documents show that a career contracting officer, in the CMS Office of Acquisition and Grants Management, was in charge of awarding the contract for the Web site. The selection process focused on bidders’ business and technical proposals, which described the proposed cost, hardware and software required, proposed infrastructure design, security requirements, and key personnel.

The companies’ past performance was not a priority. The CMS document listed it as the second least important of seven technical evaluation factors. And the review would look only at past work under the 2007 umbrella contract, the document said.

While the review found no performance risk for CGI Federal, agency officials had not always been satisfied with the company’s work. In 2010, CMS rejected CGI Federal’s bid under the umbrella contract to perform work on four health IT systems, in part citing unspecified performance issues in carrying out an earlier contract, according to a Government Accountability Office ruling. CGI Federal protested the CMS decision, but the GAO upheld it.

And the review did not take into account problems that several other CGI projects had encountered, including years of delay and system failures on a state computer system in Hawaii. State auditors in 2010 partially faulted another CGI subsidiary, CGI Technologies and Solutions, for those issues.

CGI says its overall work is high-quality and nearly always on time and on budget, and the company has also had many successes. In the past two years, CGI Federal has been awarded contracts with at least 25 federal agencies.

Documents and interviews show that CGI Federal was selected because of what was deemed to be the company’s technical prowess, even though the price of the firm’s proposal was higher than that of at least of one competitor."

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, obtained the tally from meeting notes compiled by officials inside the “war room” at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which was overseeing the rollout of the insurance marketplace.

The White House has declined to say how many people have signed up in the new health insurance marketplace, and Kathleen Sebelius, the Department of Health and Human Services secretary, testified this week that her department has not been able to collect accurate data.

Department spokeswoman Joanne Peters said late Thursday that the documents released by the committee “appear to be notes. They do not include official enrollment statistics.”

The department plans to release enrollment statistics “on a monthly basis” once reliable information is available, Peters said. “We are focused on providing reliable and accurate information and we do not have that at this time.... We have always anticipated that the pace of enrollment will increase throughout the enrollment period,” she said.

Issa’s committee obtained the documents after requesting them from the contractors developing the website for the administration. The committee subpoenaed Sebelius on Thursday for additional documents, including those related to attempted and completed enrollments.

The administration said Thursday that dozens of computer engineers from top technology firms have been brought in as part of its “tech surge” to help fix the problems with the site.

The website where Americans can shop for health insurance is central to the new healthcare law, which mandates that all individuals carry policies by March 2014 or face a penalty. Since the site’s troubles became clear, officials have also noted that insurance can be sought over the phone or in person at facilities helping to usher in the program.

According to the notes obtained by Issa’s committee, six enrollments happened on Oct. 1. On the next day, there were 248. Officials hope to enroll 7 million people for coverage next year.

Obama stood behind his signature law this week, reminding Americans of the benefits, including provisions that prohibit companies from denying coverage for people with preexisting medical conditions.

In a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Sebelius apologized for botched debut, taking responsibility as the administration scrambles to get the site running properly. The administration has promised to have the site running smoothly by the end of the month.

(CNN) —

Saturday marks the Obama administration’s self-imposed deadline to fix the troubled HealthCare.gov website, for most people at least.

Deadline Day: Will Obamacare website work?

It caps a frenzied, two-month race by computer programmers and contractors sprinkled throughout the D.C. suburbs on both sides of the beltway in Maryland and Virginia.

The overall scene in response to the botched rollout of the online portal conveys a “war-room” urgency with “ruthless prioritization,” many moving parts, grinding work, briefings, phone-bridges, and of course, plenty of take-out food.

Operations are overseen from a command center in Columbia, Maryland. That’s where contractor QSSI has spearheaded the effort with help from some Web heavyweights.

John Engates, the Chief Technology Officer at Rackspace.com, was an early critic of the website given a behind-the-scenes tour of the effort to fix it.

“I think it’s going to work,” Engates said on CNN’s “The Lead.”

But Luke Chung, president of Virginia-based software developer FMS Inc., called the administration’s prediction the site would work at 80% capacity on or around November 30 an impractical threshold in the software world.

The site, which was taken down for overnight maintenance ahead of Saturday’s deadline, is the lynchpin of Obamacare and is meant to be used by 36 states to enroll millions of Americans into health insurance now required by federal law.

Fourteen states have their own exchange sites and those, by and large, have fared better than HealthCare.gov, which was marred by crashes and other problems upon its launch October 1, embarrassing President Barack Obama, who championed the law known as Obamacare.

What happened in October?

The first thing to figure out was what went wrong – in brief.

“Not all websites are created equal,” Steven Van Roekel, the nation’s chief information officer and a former personal assistant to Bill Gates who helped roll out Windows XP, told reporters on Tuesday at a White House briefing.

Unlike a site like CNN.com, which he said is only to be viewed, or even an e-commerce site, which takes orders, HealthCare.gov is meant to be seamlessly multi-faceted.

A single user’s experience, unbeknownst to them, could require real-time information from the social security administration, DHS, the IRS and Veterans Affairs.

Fixing it on Obama’s orders was ultimately left to Jeffrey Zients, the management consultant and entrepreneur and former and future White House official.

He assembled a team, which includes Van Roekel and other experts, to oversee the overhaul being done by QSSI, other contractors and programmers.

High intensity approach

Zients conducted Tuesday’s White House briefing for reporters at a clipped pace and with the no nonsense tone of a tour guide in a hurry.

The session included a teleconference with the team from QSSI in Maryland – they couldn’t spare the time to make the trip into Washington – and programmers who drove into town from Tyson’s Corner in Virginia, where most of the software work is being done.

Seeking to confound the public view of the site as an epic failure of Presidential management, Zients and the contractors described a hive of trouble-shooters huddled at twice-daily conference calls and on a round-the-clock open phone line to respond as quickly as possible to problems.

“The point of these calls is we don’t have an hour or a minute to waste and therefore, we need to make sure that there is ruthless prioritization at all times as to what matters most, that there’s real-time reaction if something unexpected happened, someone hit a roadblock on a fix – so what are we going to do about that bug and how are we going to address that bug, and you get the best minds on the problems right away,” said Zients.

At a satellite office of QSSI in Virginia, insiders described to CNN’s Brianna Keilar a scene of programmers in marathon code-writing sessions and surrounded by stale Chinese food and half-eaten pizzas.

Back-end concern

One result of Zients’ prioritization? A focus over the past two months on the experience for users who want to sign up for insurance. That approach could have a consequence.

Insurers have reported receiving duplicative and at times faulty information on the back end of the site, which raises questions about whether some people who think they’re signing up for insurance will actually have it on January 1.

Insurers: Site glitches persist

Indeed, much of the system supporting HealthCare.gov - the back end for making payments and interacting with insurance companies – still needs to be built.

But so far, it has been the difficulty for Americans trying to sign up for coverage in the first place that has partly damaged public perception of the law.

Obamacare site fix: 5 things to look for

So the programmers and the contractors pay constant attention to real-time site metrics provided by services like Chartbeat, which is used to measure exactly how many people are on the site at any given time.

A quickly flashed screen grab during the technical briefing at the White House showed there were 15,687 users on HealthCare.gov at one point. The aim is to have the site capable of hosting 50,000 at any given time and up to 800,000 per day.

That was the goal for the site back on October 1 when repeated crashes seemed to keep most everyone trying to access the site from viewing insurance options.

After hardware upgrades installed November 23 and 24 to improve capacity and after software programmers spent the past two months addressing other hiccups, supporters of the law hope the website will function as intended.

Awash in metrics

They are awash in detailed metrics at the Maryland command center. In addition to Chartbeat, another web-based program measures response times; a spike on the graph can indicate serious problems. A third measures how far each and every user makes it through the enrollment process.

Don’t look for any of that data after the deadline this weekend, however. Specifics are still closely guarded details.

“We will continue to update you on metrics and user experience and our success rates as we go forward,” said Zients.

The Honorable Darrell E. Issa

Chairman

Committee on Oversight and Government Reform

U.S. House of Representatives

Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

Yesterday, you went on national television and made extremely serious allegations against U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, essentially accusing them of lying to the American people about the Healthcare.gov website. You then used these alleged falsehoods to justify your threat to subpoena Mr. Park to force him to appear before the Committee next week to answer your allegations. Based on information obtained by the Committee a full week ago, however, it appears that your attacks against Mr. Park and Mr. Carney are unfounded and that your statements yesterday either misunderstood or mischaracterized the information the Committee obtained. In either case, I believe it is important to correct the public record, and I request that you apologize to these officials for the unsubstantiated accusations against them.

Unfounded Accusations Against Mr. Park and Mr. Carney

Yesterday, you launched a public attack against Mr. Park and Mr. Carney, accusing them of intentionally making false statements about the number of users that were anticipated for the Healthcare.gov website.

You issued a press release with the highly inflammatory and misleading headline, “ACA Testing Bulletin: HealthCare.gov Could Only Handle 1,100 Users Day Before Launch.”[1] As evidence for your claim, you released a single document prepared by Quality Software Services, Inc. that “lists the testing status and results for various parts of the Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM).” You quoted from this document the following statement about a “stress test” conducted on only one testing environment:

Ran performance testing overnight in IMP1B environment. Working with CGI to tune the FFM environment to be able to handle maximum load. Currently we are able to reach 1100 users before response time gets too high. CGI is making changes to configuration.[2]

Based on this text, you jumped to the conclusion that the day before the website launch, the full system was able to handle only 1,100 users, and your allegation was repeated by multiple press outlets.[3] You then argued that this document contradicts previous statements by Mr. Park and Mr. Carney. For example, you cited a statement made by Mr. Park on October 6, 2013, in which he explained that officials planned for HealthCare.gov to draw approximately 60,000 simultaneous users.

After issuing your press release, you went on national television and accused Mr. Park and Mr. Carney of misleading the American people. During an interview with Fox News, you made the following accusations:

Jay Carney is paid to say things that aren’t so. But in this case, Todd Park and other people who knew the facts, who had to know the facts. And the facts were from documents we received from lead contractors that they slowed down to an unacceptable level at 1,100 users. Well, in fact, Todd Park was telling us that at 60,000 was the target, and at 250,000 they just couldn’t handle it. The truth was their goal wasn’t, according to documents, wasn’t even 60,000. Their goal was 10,000. They reached 1,100.[4]



You then used these alleged falsehoods to demand that Mr. Park appear before the Committee at a hearing next Wednesday to answer your accusations. During the same Fox interview, you attempted to justify your demand by stating:

We’re going to have Todd Park and a number of other political appointees who were part of this pattern of interference and false statements related to this site. And we are going to try to get to the bottom of why politics went ahead of best practices and good technology. Something the American people expect, that didn’t happen in this case. And it’s the tip of iceberg, that we’re worried about, is if they are willing to put politics into a website, what will they put into your health care?[5]

You also sent a letter to Mr. Park warning that you would issue a subpoena compelling his presence if he does not submit to your demand voluntarily.[6] Your letter completely ignored a previous offer for Mr. Park to brief the Committee in the next several weeks and testify in early December so he would not be pulled away from his current work on improving the Healthcare.gov website during this critical time.[7]

Information Obtained by the Committee Contradicts Accusations

Based on information obtained by the Committee, it appears that you fundamentally misunderstood or mischaracterized the document you released to the press yesterday and that your accusations against Mr. Park and Mr. Carney are wholly unfounded. You appear to be conflating the results of a much smaller testing environment with final production testing of the system at full capacity. As the document you released states, the 1,100 user figure was conducted for the “IMP1B environment,” a testing environment that was only a sample size rather than the full FFM production environment.

The estimates for the full FFM website environment were considerably higher. We know this from the transcribed interview of Henry Chao, the Deputy Chief Information Officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which Committee staff conducted on November 1, 2013. During his interview, Mr. Chao explained—in response to detailed questioning from your staff—that officials estimated that up to 58,000 virtual users could get through the full FFM production website application, which is almost precisely the figure cited by Mr. Park.

For example, your staff had this exchange with Mr. Chao:

Q: On July 19th, 2 days after the committee’s hearing in which you testified, you provided a briefing for the committee. Do you recall this?

A: Yes.

Q: At the briefing, you told committee staff that the system was designed to handle 50,000 concurrent users. Is it accurate that the system was designed to handle 50,000 concurrent users?

A: For the FFM, it is. I’m not trying to—

Q: When you say “FFM,” you mean?

A: The marketplace, the online application.[8]

Mr. Chao also addressed how the results of “stress tests” were used to extrapolate to the full FFM production system:

Q: Prior to October 1st, did CMS conduct any stress tests for HealthCare.gov?

A: Yes. “Stress test” is actually sometimes used synonymously with “performance testing.” Because in performance testing, you introduce number of virtual users, right? Two hundred, 500, 1,000. You know, you’re trying to introduce as many as you can handle in the performance testing environment to see where the breakpoint is. And then, once you achieve that breakpoint, then you extrapolate, you know, from that how many concurrent users, how many concurrent sessions. Because you don’t have a performance testing environment that equals 100 percent the production environment.[9]



Finally, your staff asked repeatedly how many users were expected to get through the full FFM production environment based on the testing conducted:

Q: So how many concurrent users—what’s the maximum number of concurrent users that the system could handle in a test prior to the October 1st launch?

A: The extrapolated figure that we came up with—because in the last remaining weeks, we threw some additional resources of capacity. The test was somewhere around—it was somewhere between 48,000 and 58,000, what we call, virtual users. They’re not real live people in there. They’re accounts that are set up, you know, doing different things in the system. …

Q: And you said that 48,000 to 58,000 virtual users could get through the allocation

A: Inside the FFM application, the online application for enrollment.[10]

Conclusion

This is not the first time you have accused a White House official of being a “paid liar,” a practice that several of your Republican colleagues have condemned.[11] Given that your staff participated in Mr. Chao’s transcribed interview last week—before you issued your press release and conducted your television interview—it is unclear why you did not disclose the information Mr. Chao provided, but instead chose to accuse Mr. Park and Mr. Carney of misleading the American people.

It is evident that the testing conducted for Healthcare.gov was inadequate, particularly considering the very high demand experienced in the first days after the website became operational, and I believe Congress can play a key role in conducting responsible oversight to ensure that millions of Americans obtain the health insurance coverage they deserve. But it is reckless and highly irresponsible to make unsubstantiated public allegations by taking information out of context, especially when the Committee has information in its possession that directly contradicts these unfounded allegations.

Rather than rush to issue a subpoena to Mr. Park based on these unsubstantiated allegations, which could impair efforts to improve the website, I propose that we accept the offer to receive a briefing from Mr. Park this month and that we schedule an additional hearing in December to obtain his full testimony. I sincerely hope that we can proceed in a thoughtful and bipartisan manner as we continue to review this issue.

Sincerely,

And he admitted it’s a mess.



The latest fix, Obama says, is an update on Healthcare.gov telling people how they can buy insurance ""the old-fashioned way — offline.""

“So you'll find information about how to talk to a specialist who can help you apply over the phone or to receive a downloadable application you can fill out yourself and mail in,” Obama said.

His administration has been tight-lipped on just what the problems are with the website, which was originally billed as something resembling Travelocity for health insurance — a place online where people could go to compare one plan to another and get a price.

But experts point out that HealthCare.gov was never that simple. While most in the industry are confident that Obama can keep his promise to eventually fix the site, they say there are multiple places where things may have gone wrong.

“Buying a health plan is a lot more complicated than buying a flight,"" says Brandon Cruz, president of GoHealth, a private health insurance marketplace. “When you’re buying a health plan, you need to know all the doctors in the network, what you deductible will be, what your co-insurance will be. And the terminology is so foreign.”

Customizing is complicated

Not only that, but an airline seat is a fairly generic commodity. Health insurance is personal, says Caroline Pearson, a vice president at consulting firm Avalere Health. “What’s available for purchase and the price they are going to offer to you for is completely customized on an individual basis,” she says.



“So in order to give people an accurate shopping experience with accurate pricing, you had to enter a lot of personal information about where you live, your income, the size of your family, and then the government has to verify that data. There’s been a lot of up-front electronic verification, which seems to be where a lot of the website snafus occurred.”

The consensus: the federal website has tried to offer too much, too fast, to too many people.

The federal government is running websites for 36 states that didn’t want to do their own, or couldn't manage it right away. Each state has its own insurance regulations, and each has its own list of providers offering plans — from 16 different insurance companies in New York, to just one for people in some counties in West Virginia.

Before you can even begin to shop, the website has to know what county you live in. And it needs to check your income to make sure you shouldn’t be on Medicaid instead, and to check to see if you qualify for a federal subsidy and if so, how much it would be.

Oh, and it has to check with the Department of Homeland Security to make sure you really are a legal resident — all this while you’re staring at the screen, waiting.

States let users window-shop

Pearson says some of the 15 states offering their own websites — Kentucky is an example — have sped up things for users by letting them window-shop first. ""Many of the state websites, though not all, elected to simplify the process and allow you to shop without creating a login and submitting all your personal information,” she says.



At first, the Obama administration blamed the website hangups on a crush of new users. That's no surprise as the White House says nearly 20 million people have visited the site so far and 500,000 have started the application process.

But Obama has now admitted it was worse than this and says he has “the best and the brightest” working to fix it.



Cruz says there are lots of places where the site could be hanging up. “I don’t think the code was bug-free when the time came to launch,” he says. “If the code’s not written properly, you can have bottlenecks.”

Databases — and there are lots of them on the federal website — are one big potential blockage. “If everyone’s trying to access the database at the same time, it locks up,” Cruz says.

They’re usually designed to freeze while someone is putting information in, so that the next person to access it has the most up-to-date information. To use the Travelocity analogy, think about choosing your seat on a flight. You’d want to be sure someone didn’t snatch the seat you wanted at the same time you were on there.



It's not as simple as adding servers

Simply adding servers — a computer or system of computers that increases capacity — won’t help if there’s a bottleneck that keeps people from even reaching the server, Cruz points out.



Many experts have said the government did not test the system thoroughly enough before launch. And having literally millions of people jump onto a new website on the very first day is a recipe for a mess, says Chet Wisniewski, senior security adviser for IT security firm Sophos Inc.

“When you think about Twitter, only a few thousand people knew about it, then tens of thousands of people. And after a year, when everybody was using it, Twitter started to break,” Wisniewski says.

The Pew Research Center reports that 14 percent of adults report having visited an exchange, and another 23 percent say they intend to.

Cruz and Pearson think the problems are fixable. So does Tom Scully, who was administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), from 2001 to 2004 and who now is a healthcare expert at law firm Alston & Bird.

Although much criticism has focused on a Canadian firm, CGI Group, that did some of the work for the federal government, Scully says the administration probably should have contracted out even more of the work. CMS was never equipped to do the work in-house, he says.

“They are just slow-moving, bureaucratic, lovely people,” Scully said. ""It's just not a core competency of CMS.""

The agency likely feared it would be impossible for a company outside the federal government to get the cooperation it would need with the internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration and other federal departments, Scully says.

Will the phones be just as slow — or slower?

And, by the way, says Pearson, sending people to the phone might not be effective, either.



“People have had a hard time getting through on the phone,"" she says. “There have been really long waits on the call center.”

Avalere staffers have tried, she says. “We have spoken to the call center several times. They haven’t been volunteering to help us enroll,” she said.

Maybe that will be one of the improvements that Obama has promised, she said.

And sending in too many of the “best and the brightest’ might not be the right fix, either, software experts note. They often cite Brook’s Law, which holds that adding people to a project slows it down.

""It's not like a construction project, or an auto assembly line, where more hands on deck mean more results,"" said Bob Sullivan, a technology and consumer expert and author of “The Plateau Effect: Getting from Stuck to Success. ”With software, adding people at the end of a project to fix things that are broken or unfinished, can actually do more harm than good.""

(CNN) - Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was already having a rough week when she was presented with an unwelcome gift at an event in Memphis on Friday.

After being grilled on Capitol Hill and receiving subpoenas from one congressional committee, Sebelius was wrapping up her week at an outreach event when Tennessee state Sen. Brian Kelsey approached her with a copy of the book ""Web Sites for Dummies,"" according to Memphis' The Daily News, which captured the moment on camera.

The secretary's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Sebelius was in Tennessee to promote the Affordable Care Act and explain how her department is working to fix the botched insurance exchange website, HealthCare.gov.

""Clearly we did not do enough end-to-end testing,"" admitted Sebelius, though she defended the market itself, saying, ""The market is ready. We have competitive plans in every market in this country.""

""We have brought in a lot of technology experts to help make sure that we have all the eyes and ears on the problems and the puzzle, “Sebelius added.

On Wednesday, Sebelius apologized for the flawed website when she testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. President Obama has thus far resisted calls from congressional Republicans to fire Sebelius."

President Obama addresses supporters at Planned Parenthood conference

Obama tells crowd he will fight attempts to restrict abortion rights and other services for women

Also says he will defend Planned Parenthood against proposed funding cuts

President Obama told Planned Parenthood on Friday he will fight various efforts to restrict women's access to abortion, contraceptives and other services.

""When it comes to a women's health, no politician should get to decide what's best for you,"" Obama told delegates at a Planned Parenthood national conference in Washington. ""The only person who should get to make decisions about your health is you.""

Obama also reassured the group he would block efforts by congressional Republicans to shut off their funding, saying that many women see Planned Parenthood as their primary source of health care.

""Planned Parenthood is not going anywhere,"" Obama said. ""It's not going anywhere today, it's not going anywhere tomorrow.""

Some congressional Republicans say Planned Parenthood should not receive federal funding because it promotes abortion.

Obama did not use the word ""abortion"" during his remarks, but said the ""right to choose"" has long been upheld by courts.

Women voters provided heavy support to Obama in both of his election victories, and the president spent most of his speech defending women's rights, particularly in the area of health care.

Citing efforts in some states to restrict access to certain services, including abortion, Obama said it looks like some lawmakers want to turn back the clock to the 1950s.

Women's autonomy is one of the concepts behind the new health care law, Obama said, and he urged Planned Parenthood delegates to spread the word about how the new law works."

Now, in the ten weeks since the launch of Healthcare.gov, the ill-trained Navigators have put Americans’ sensitive health and tax information at risk.

Breitbart News has obtained a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee report on the Obamacare Navigators that will be released Monday. It has found that Obamacare Navigators have been giving Americans misinformation and, in some cases, actively encouraging enrollees to commit fraud in order to raise their subsidies. To complicate matters further, there is no way for Americans to find out whether their Navigators are properly certified.

Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said at a Congressional hearing that it was “possible” for convicted felons to become Navigators. The report, titled Risks of Fraud and Misinformation with ObamaCare Outreach Campaign: How Navigator and Assister Program Mismanagement Endangers Consumers, concludes that is only one of many worries Americans should have about Navigators.

The Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), and HHS actually learned that “poorly-trained Navigators gave consumers incorrect information about the health care exchanges, violated HHS rules and procedures, and even encouraged applicants to commit tax fraud in some instances.” Moreover, this was learned from various news reports due to the complete lack of any internal oversight.

On November 21, the Obama administration briefed the Committee. Those in attendance included Gary Cohen, the Deputy Administrator and Director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), and Mandy Cohen, Director of the Consumer Support Group at CCIIO.

The Committee report concluded that “documents call into question the effectiveness of the Navigator program and the Obama administration’s ability to safeguard consumer information.” HHS’s mismanagement of the Navigator and Assister programs “induces fraudulent behavior and poses real threats to the safety of consumers’ personally identifiable information, such as one’s social security number, yearly income, and other sensitive tax information,” the report found.

The report also discovered that Obamacare Navigators have “encouraged consumers to commit tax fraud by underreporting income in order to qualify for ObamaCare’s health insurance subsidies.” Some have “assisted applicants before completing their 5 to 20 hour online training course, and others took custody of paper applications and mailed them for the applicant, violating the rule that applicants must mail in the application themselves.”

For instance, the Committee found:

Navigators from the Urban League of Dallas were captured on video encouraging applicants to lie on their health insurance application so the applicants could qualify for tax subsidies. Navigators were also recorded advising an applicant to lie about her smoking habits to obtain a lower monthly premium. It was later discovered that two of the so-called Navigators involved in the incident were assisting consumers with their applications even though they had not completed their training and certification requirements.

One self-identified Navigator gave a television interview in which she told viewers blatantly incorrect information–that applicants’ credit scores could impact their eligibility for certain plans. It later came to light that the woman was not a certified Navigator but rather a volunteer with a Navigator organization.

Mountain Project, Inc., a Navigator organization in North Carolina, has been collecting and mailing paper applications on behalf of applicants, in violation of Navigator rules and procedures.

The report found that HHS officials responsible for the Navigator program did not learn of the aforementioned incidents from internal oversight procedures, but rather from news reports.

Yet the Obama administration still does not plan to implement a “secret shopper” program to monitor Navigators. HHS officials have put together “webinars” for Navigators, but they are voluntary and do not cover specific details.

The report also found that because the Obama administration did not warn Navigators that there could be problems with the HealthCare.Gov website, “Navigators were essentially useless” when the website crashed and had problems. To make matters worse, notes from an October 11, 2013 meeting state that the Navigators were encouraging potential enrollees to use paper applications they knew may not bring applicants quicker results “to protect their reputations as people in the communities who can help.”

The Committee found that this “push towards the use of paper applications further increases security risks, since health insurance exchange applications contain personally identifiable information such as the applicant’s full name, social security number, the names and social security numbers of everyone in the applicant’s household, and income for every member of the household.”

The report also concluded that Navigators were also unprepared to handle situations in which consumers mentioned unreported income because the Obama administration did not even anticipate such situations. Gary Cohen, the director of the agency overseeing the Navigators, previously stated, “this could be one of the areas where it is a little beyond the ability of your average Navigator,” when asked whether Navigators knew how to deal with Americans who may be engaging in tax fraud or intending to under-report income.

Though Cohen “admitted there is a need for better training on the issue through the ongoing education process” and did not rule out “requiring Navigators to report tax fraud in the future,” the Obama administration “has not taken the necessary steps to prevent this type of tax fraud.” The report found that Navigators have not even been provided with a document on how to handle potential tax fraud issues that may arise.

Navigators, the report also found, “lack guidance about how to comply with the Voting Rights Act, which requires that federal government applications provide the opportunity for applicants to indicate their interest in registering to vote.”

And though Cohen told the Committee staff that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “[keep] a list of certified Navigators, which, as of mid-November, numbered 2,500 individuals,” the list is private, which means Americans do not have a way to know if their Navigators are actually even certified. That also allows Navigator organizations to “misrepresent the qualifications of an individual who is associated with that organization but is not a certified Navigator,” the committee found.

Obama administration officials held a closed-door briefing for Democrats in the House of Representatives and a private session with insurance company executives to discuss efforts to fix the Healthcare.gov website. Republican critics in Congress demanded a delay in a requirement of the healthcare law that uninsured Americans must purchase insurance or face a tax penalty and said they would intensify their investigations into the launch of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as ""Obamacare."" ""It is our job to hold them accountable, and when it comes to Obamacare clearly there is a lot to hold accountable,"" House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner told reporters on Wednesday. The administration is trying to preserve Democratic Party unity on the issue, which showed signs of fraying. The head of the Democratic National Committee, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, told MSNBC the administration should be willing to extend the open-enrollment period for people to sign up for insurance. It ends on March 31. Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking House Democrat, criticized the website for forcing consumers to provide private information before deciding what kind of health insurance plan they want to buy. ""I've talked to too many people who tell me before they ever get around to figuring out what it is they want to buy, they're having to answer questions that they don't feel they should be answering,"" Clyburn said. Max Baucus, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement that he hopes to meet with other committee members in the coming weeks, but said he would wait until after the website is repaired. Republicans are not waiting. The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday will hear from the top contractors responsible for the program, including website developer CGI Federal. 'WORKING HARD TO FIX THE PROBLEMS' Online exchanges, or marketplaces, were designed to be the main way for millions of uninsured Americans to research and buy health insurance plans under the law, but the October 1 debut has been marred by technical glitches that have kept many from signing on and making purchases. Those unable to sign up online can call a toll-free telephone number as an alternative. The administration has so far declined to disclose the number of enrollments, either online or by telephone. A prolonged delay in getting Healthcare.gov to work could jeopardize White House efforts to sign up as many as 7 million people in 2014, the first full year the law takes effect. The administration this week began what it called a ""tech surge,"" bringing in experts led by the administration's top economic aide Jeffrey Zients to analyze and fix the problems. ""I think what we learned is they're working hard to fix the problems,"" Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said after Wednesday's briefing. The Health and Human Services Department will begin regular news briefings on Thursday to provide updates on ""the progress that's being made and on the efforts that are being undertaken, both to address the technical problems and to make the whole experience for American consumers better,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. House Democrats said there was no discussion in the briefing about whether the problems should lead to a delay of the individual requirement that every American have insurance or pay a tax penalty. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a delay would reduce enrollment significantly. REPUBLICANS DEMAND DELAY Republicans, who have fought the healthcare law as an unwarranted extension of the federal government, said the requirement should be delayed until the problems with the rollout are resolved. ""With so many unanswered questions and the problems arising around this rollout, it doesn't make any sense to impose this one percent mandate tax on the American people,"" House Republican Leader Eric Cantor told reporters on Wednesday. Republicans have repeatedly tried to derail or delay the healthcare law since taking control of the House in the 2010 elections. They demanded more answers on Wednesday about the scope of the problems. Three committees in the Republican-controlled House have announced investigations of the law's rollout, which Cantor described as ""nothing short of a debacle."" HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has been the focal point of criticism and Republicans have demanded she step down, but so far the White House has rallied around her. Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, told the New York Times on Tuesday that Sebelius ""has the president's confidence. And she knows that."" In the same article, an unidentified White House aide also appeared to try to distance Sebelius from the website troubles, and was quoted as saying, ""Kathleen has the title, but she doesn't have the responsibility or in many respects the kind of wide authority and access to the president that she really needs to make a difference."" Sebelius, who will testify to Congress next week, and McDonough attended the session with insurance company executives. They included the chief executives of WellPoint Inc, Humana Inc and Aetna Inc among others. WellPoint raised its 2013 membership and profit forecasts in part to reflect coming market changes under the law, its chief executive, Joseph Swedish, said in a statement on Wednesday.

LARRY DOWNING / Reuters

The health insurance exchanges were supposed to be the crowning glory of Obamacare -- an easy way to help the 45 million people who don't have health insurance get some. Turns out, it hasn't been so easy. The White House has rolled out so many last-minute fixes that critics and supporters alike are asking how anyone can understand what the rules are now.

First, it was a year’s reprieve for businesses that were supposed to be providing health insurance for workers. Then came a batch of delays, exemptions and other exceptions, coming to a head late Thursday night as the White House scrambled to announce -- and then clarify -- a break for people who are the most furious about losing their insurance coverage.



Republicans piled on Friday, saying the White House has now made meaningless the individual mandate – the requirement that everyone have health insurance or pay a tax .

Here’s a run-down of what's changed so far:



1. The exemption. Thursday night, the Obama administration offered a special “hardship exemption” to people whose individual plans were canceled and who have yet to arrange other coverage. They can get either extremely cheap, bare-bones plans known as catastrophic coverage, or skip health insurance without paying the tax.

These catastrophic plans had only been available to people under 30 or those who could not find health insurance plans with premiums costing less than 8 percent of their income. An updated list of exemptions includes those who recently filed for bankruptcy or had medical expenses they couldn't pay, among other hardships.

2. The slip. Late in November, the administration gave people an extra week to get signed up, slipping the deadline from Dec. 15 to Dec. 23 for people who wanted to enroll and get health insurance starting the first day possible, Jan. 14. This came with a clear admission that the federal online insurance exchange was badly flawed.



The site went down again for repairs for several hours on Friday, just days before one major deadline for people to use it. ""We screwed it up,"" President Obama said in his last news conference of the year.



3. The slide. Last week, officials gave people another week to pay their first premiums and still get coverage. This was forced on insurers: the industry later said it would let people pay as late as Jan. 10 and still get credit for coverage starting Jan. 1, so long as they had already signed up. It's a big concession — insurers usually like a lot more lead time and they want everything buttoned up, including payment, before they hand out insurance cards.

4. The fix. After an onslaught of attacks about his promise that “if you like you insurance plan, you can keep it”, Obama formally apologized and said that people could, in fact, keep their policies – even if they were policies his administration said were rotten and provided lousy coverage. The catch: insurance companies may have already discontinued the plans and state insurance commissioners would have to agree, and not all did.

5. The redefinition. There was October’s redefinition of what the March 31 deadline meant, made after it looked as if people needed to actually sign up by Feb. 15 to make the March 31 deadline to have coverage or pay a tax.

6. The delay. Back in July, the administration delayed for one year the requirement that large employers provide health insurance for their employees. The 2010 health reform law requires anyone with 50 or more workers to provide health insurance – something small businesses have been complaining about, loudly, for years. On Tuesday, the government said they could have more time to get it done.

But Obama says despite the tweaks, the law is working.

""The basic structure of the law is working, despite all the problems,"" Obama said.

He said at least 500,000 people, and maybe more, have managed to sign up using the federal and state web sites. ""Since that time, I now have a couple of million people, maybe more, who are going to have health care on Jan. 1 and that is a big deal. That's why I ran for this office,"" Obama added. California says it got more than 53,000 people signed up in just the first three days of this week.

None of the delays appear to have helped Obama’s approval rating – the latest NBC/WSJ poll gave Obama a job approval rating of just 43 percent. Half of those surveyed said they are dissatisfied or disappointed with Obama’s presidency and 58 percent say their discontent comes from his handling of health reform.

And the delays appear to have rewarded people who want to defy the law’s requirements, rather than those who did what the administration asked and signed up early.

“This is a slap in the face to the thousands of Americans who have already purchased expensive insurance through the Obamacare exchanges,” said Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who has been an outspoken critic of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

Administration officials called the latest changes “common sense."" ""This is essentially an additional safety net in case folks might have slipped through the cracks,"" Obama said. But the insurance industry and critics said they just made things even more bewildering.

“One thing is certain: The Administration’s latest initiative is not going to simplify anything,” Robert Moffit and Alyene Senger, health policy experts at the right-leaning Heritage Foundation, wrote in a blog post. “Rest assured it is going to create even greater confusion for health insurers trying to sell these products. Also, don’t expect the unhappy consumers who’ve just lost their previous coverage to understand clearly which plan they can pick and be legally qualified to pick it.”

Health policy expert Doug Holtz-Eakin, who leads the center-right American Action Forum, says this week’s changes are “a big deal”. “Substantively, it opens the door to deferring the mandate entirely and by acknowledging that catastrophic plans would be suitable coverage it makes a lie of all the rhetoric about how existing insurance (“underinsurance”) is ‘subpar’ and ‘poor,’” he wrote in a blog post.



“It is an invitation to those who have chosen policies through HealthCare.gov to cancel them and waive the mandate.”

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/08/David-Gergen-GAI-Report-Indictment-of-Obama-White-House-Operation-Bordering-on-Malfeasance,2013-12-08 00:00:00,['Tony Lee'],David Gergen: Report on Obamacare Prep Shows 'No One in Charge' of White House,"A veteran Washington adviser who has worked for four Presidents on both sides of the political aisle said that the stunning Government Accountability Report that found President Barack Obama has not had a one-on-one meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius since the passage of Obamacare over three years ago is an indictment of the entire White House operation and shows that the Obama administration has bordered on “malfeasance.”

“I have no doubt the White House is right, that Secretary Sebelius was in several group meetings with the president about health care,” Gergen caveated, “but the whole point is, there was nobody in charge in the administration.”

Appearing on CNN’s Newsroom program Saturday night was David Gergen, a known Washington “fixer.” Some veteran Washington observers have even suggested that Obama should bring Gergen in to help manage the Obamacare rollout crisis. He was asked by CNN Anchor Deborah Feyerick about the GAI report.

Feyerick cited a report from “an outfit called the Government Accountability Institute [that] finds the president and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius held just a single one-on-one meeting after Obamacare was signed into law over three years ago.”

“I don’t think this is simply sloppiness on the part of the White House,” Gergen said. “What seems to me is there’s a case of near malfeasance here.”

Gergen, who has served as Director of Speechwriting for the Nixon White House, Director of Communications for both Presidents Ford and Reagan, and then as a senior advisor to President Bill Clinton, is intimately familiar with how the White House operates. In addition, he normally takes a “neutral” position on most matters and often gives those in power the benefit of doubt.

But Gergen emphasized that the GAI report concerning the lack of meetings between Sebelius and Obama raises troubling issues about the conduct of affairs in the Obama White House.

Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer unveiled the report on Wednesday on Fox News’s Hannity and Breitbart News.

As Breitbart News has reported, Schweizer said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare.

“In the case of President Obama, if you look at his calendar, there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all,” Schweizer said on Hannity.

Feyerick, the CNN host, added that the White House had attacked the report, “Jay Carney [is] saying that the report’s misleading and based on a ridiculously false premise, those are his words David Gergen, what do you think about this?”

Gergen responded by saying the GAI report was a big deal and should not be dismissed. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Obama and Sebelius meet “regularly” but their meetings were not recored on the visitors logs. Schweizer had previously noted that GAI also looked at White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House, it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” And he noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meeting off the books, Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.

Gergen faulted the White House for this lack of contact and condemned the whole White House operation.

“The fact that he was not meeting with her one-on-one, I think, frankly, is not so much an indictment of her but of the White House operation,” he said.

Gergen said that “at the same time three years pass with no one-on-one meetings according to this Politico article. The president had 277 one-on-one meetings with other members of his cabinet.” Gergen referenced Schweizer’s Politico article in which he mentioned that, “perhaps the insular White House team wanted to distance the president from the bureaucratic process in the hopes of granting him a halo of deniability if the launch failed.” Schweizer also noted “the lack of meetings reinforces the severity of what the New York Times describes as the ‘deeply dysfunctional relationship between the Department of Health and Human Services and its technology contractors, and tensions between the White House chief of staff and senior health department officials.'”

Feyerick, the CNN host, added, that if health care reform “was so important to the president, you would think that there was a lot more one-on-one interaction especially on something that’s so critical to him and his policy.” Princeton Professor Julian Zelizer, who was also on the panel, did not respond directly to the details of the GAI report, only to say that “we have to be careful because as the White House said, that [report] does come from a conservative organization.”

The Government Accountability Institute, though, is a nonpartisan organization and its mission is to “investigate and expose crony capitalism, misuse of taxpayer monies and other governmental corruption or malfeasance.” GAI, headed by Schweizer, has written several reports in recent years and has been criticized by both the Obama White House and House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH)."

Obama was not the only politician fudging the truth. Most Democrat lawmakers repeated this claim on the campaign trail and in meetings with constituents. If Obama apologized, they should as well, as they are equally culpable.

Breitbart News has compiled a list of the Top 10 Senate Democrats who should follow Obama’s lead and apologize to the American public. These particular lawmakers either went all-in on the false claim for partisan reasons or were in a position to know that millions of Americans would not be able to keep their health insurance.

If a reader interprets this list as a guide for whom to call in Congress, so be it.

10. SEN. MARY LANDRIEU (D-LA): “If you like the insurance that you have, you’ll be able to keep it.” (MSNBC’s Hardball, 12/16/09)

Mary Landrieu, like all Senate Democrats, provided the deciding vote on passing ObamaCare. After 3 years, it is hard to remember all the parliamentary tricks the Democrats used to pass a bill that almost none of them had read. Landrieu, who is up for reelection next year, lied on TV. She should apologize.

9. SEN. KAY HAGAN (D-NC): “We need to support the private insurance industry so that people who have insurance they’re happy with can keep it while also providing a backstop option for people without access to affordable coverage.” (“Republicans Vent As Other Compromise Plans Get Aired,” National Journal’s Congress Daily, 6/18/09)

160,000 residents of North Carolina has lost their health coverage. Sen. Hagan has been most aggressive in trying to separate herself from ObamaCare. No wonder, since even a Democrat poll has found her now in a statistical tie with any of her possible Republican challengers. In September, Hagan held a 12-17 point lead. She is up for reelection next year and should apologize.

8. SEN. MARK BEGICH (D-AK): “If you got a doctor now, you got a medical professional you want, you get to keep that. If you have an insurance program or a health care policy you want of ideas, make sure you keep it. That you can keep who you want.”

Begich won his Senate seat in 2008, after DOJ staffers trumped up false charges against the sitting GOP Senator Ted Stevens. Begich is running for reelection in Alaska, without the Obama wave and without a mythical DOJ investigation. He should apologize.

7. SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO): “We should begin with a basic principle: if you have coverage and you like it, you can keep it. If you have your doctor, and you like him or her, you should be able to keep them as well. We will not take that choice away from you.”

Sen. Bennet heads to DSCC, the party arm to elect Democrats to the US Senate. He will have an outsized role in races across the country. He said his position on ObamaCare was based on a “basic principle.” He should apologize.

6. SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D-WA): “Again, if you like what you have, you will be able to keep it. Let me say this again: If you like what you have, when our legislation is passed and signed by the President, you will be able to keep it.” (Sen. Murray, Congressional Record, S.6400, 6/10/09)

Let me say this again, as a senior member, and now Chair of the Budget Committee, Sen. Murray must have been in a position to know that these claims were false. She won her first race for Senate campaigning as a “soccer mom” in “tennis shoes.” Insert your own joke. 290,000 residents of Washington have lost their health insurance. She should apologize.

5. SEN. TOM HARKIN (D-IA): “One of the things we put in the health care bill when we designed it was the protection for consumers to keep the plan they have if they like it; thus, the term ‘grandfathered plans.’ If you have a plan you like –existing policies–you can keep them. …we said, if you like a plan, you get to keep it, and you can grandfather it in.” (Sen. Harkin, Congressional Record, S.7675-6, 9/29/10)

Sen. Harkin has long been a slippery politician. As Chair of the Health Committee in the Senate, Harkin would have had more intimate knowledge of ObamaCare than most other lawmakers. His yowler here is he tries to claim that the “put in” language to ensure people could keep the plan they like. That is a sin of commission. Harkin, who is retiring, should absolutely apologize.

4. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): “If you like your insurance, you keep it.” (U.S. Senate, Finance Committee, Bill Mark-Up, 9/24/09)

Schumer, who was in a position to know the inner-workings of the law seems to have lied. Asking him for an apology, though, is like asking Anthony Weiner to become modestly self-aware. Still, he should apologize.

3. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): “This bill before us on the Senate floor makes it clear that if you have an insurance policy that you like, you can keep it. If you like the doctor that you’re currently doing business with, you can continue to use that doctor.” (Sen. Durbin, Teleconference, 12/4/09)

Durbin is the Number 2 Democrat in the Senate, amazingly. He seems preternaturally disposed to obscuring the truth. He actually said the legislation “makes it clear” that you can keep your insurance. He either can’t read legislation or he was intentionally misleading the public. In any event, he should apologize.

2.SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV):”In fact, one of our core principles is that if you like the health care you have, you can keep it.” (Sen. Reid, Congressional Record, S.8642, 8/3/09)

Core principles, apparently, aren’t what they used to be. Sen. Reid emptied out the parliamentary cupboard to get ObamaCare passed. As Majority Leader, he had to have a keen understanding of what was in the bill and what the consequences would be. The White House, at the time, was aware of the fact that many Americans would lose their health insurance. Surely, Sen. Reid was privy to the same information. He should apologize.

And, the #1 Senate Democrat who should apologize…

1. SEN. MAX BAUCUS (D-MT): “That is why one of the central promises of health care reform has been and is: If you like what you have, you can keep it. That is critically important. If a person has a plan, and he or she likes it, he or she can keep it.” (Sen. Baucus, Congressional Record, S.7676, 9/29/10)

Sen. Baucus wrote most of the bill that became ObamaCare. He has been steeped in health care policy for decades. He was in a position to know, and had to know, that the “central promise” that people could keep their current health care coverage was a lie.

He should apologize, but unfortunately, he has chosen to retire rather than face the voters. I can only hope he does not go softly into the night."

Washington (CNN) – The No. 3 House Democrat on Sunday blamed a culture of sound bites for President Barack Obama's reneged promise that Americans would be able to keep their existing health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act.

""And this is a sound bite that the President probably needed to take some more time to explain to the American people,"" Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union with Candy Crowley.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

After millions of people received cancellation notices for their health plans, Obama faced considerable pushback over his promise to Americans that the new health care reform would not affect those who are already happy with their insurance policies.

""If you like your health insurance, you can keep it,"" Obama repeatedly told Americans when selling his signature piece of legislation.

After that turned out not to be the case, Obama on Thursday announced his administration would allow insurance companies to extend those canceled policies for a year.

Clyburn, the House assistant Democratic leader, said Obama relied too heavily on a sound bite-friendly selling point, rather than spelling out that he was only referring to plans in place before the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010 and hadn't changed since.

Fact Check: If you liked your health plan, you can keep your health plan

""One of the things in Washington that I dislike more than anything else is when people say to me, 'If you're explaining it, you're losing it.' I don't like that at all. I really believe the American people are deserving of explanations,"" he said, also blaming the media for not fully explaining the new legislation.

With recent polls showing the President is considered less trustworthy than in the past, Obama on Thursday said he expects he'll need to regain Americans' faith after the rocky rollout of HealthCare.gov and his broken promise about existing plans.

Clyburn said he was confident Obama can do so.

""Paradise lost, paradise regained. When you lose something you can find it again,"" he said. ""The President admitted that he expects to be held responsible for regaining the Americans' trust, and I think he will.""

http://news.yahoo.com/white-house-steps-damage-control-healthcare-rollout-172728534--sector.html,,[],White House steps up damage control on healthcare rollout,"By David Lawder and Mark Felsenthal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House sought to limit the political damage from the troubled rollout of the government's healthcare website on Wednesday as Republicans increased the pressure to delay parts of President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy. Obama administration officials held a closed-door briefing for Democrats in the House of Representatives and a private session with insurance company executives to discuss efforts to fix the Healthcare.gov website. Republican critics in Congress demanded a delay in a requirement of the healthcare law that uninsured Americans must purchase insurance or face a tax penalty and said they would intensify their investigations into the launch of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as ""Obamacare."" ""It is our job to hold them accountable, and when it comes to Obamacare clearly there is a lot to hold accountable,"" House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner told reporters on Wednesday. The administration is trying to preserve Democratic Party unity on the issue, which showed signs of fraying. The head of the Democratic National Committee, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, told MSNBC the administration should be willing to extend the open-enrollment period for people to sign up for insurance. It ends on March 31. Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking House Democrat, criticized the website for forcing consumers to provide private information before deciding what kind of health insurance plan they want to buy. ""I've talked to too many people who tell me before they ever get around to figuring out what it is they want to buy, they're having to answer questions that they don't feel they should be answering,"" Clyburn said. Max Baucus, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement that he hopes to meet with other committee members in the coming weeks, but said he would wait until after the website is repaired. Republicans are not waiting. The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday will hear from the top contractors responsible for the program, including website developer CGI Federal. 'WORKING HARD TO FIX THE PROBLEMS' Online exchanges, or marketplaces, were designed to be the main way for millions of uninsured Americans to research and buy health insurance plans under the law, but the October 1 debut has been marred by technical glitches that have kept many from signing on and making purchases. Those unable to sign up online can call a toll-free telephone number as an alternative. The administration has so far declined to disclose the number of enrollments, either online or by telephone. A prolonged delay in getting Healthcare.gov to work could jeopardize White House efforts to sign up as many as 7 million people in 2014, the first full year the law takes effect. The administration this week began what it called a ""tech surge,"" bringing in experts led by the administration's top economic aide Jeffrey Zients to analyze and fix the problems. ""I think what we learned is they're working hard to fix the problems,"" Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said after Wednesday's briefing. The Health and Human Services Department will begin regular news briefings on Thursday to provide updates on ""the progress that's being made and on the efforts that are being undertaken, both to address the technical problems and to make the whole experience for American consumers better,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. House Democrats said there was no discussion in the briefing about whether the problems should lead to a delay of the individual requirement that every American have insurance or pay a tax penalty. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a delay would reduce enrollment significantly. REPUBLICANS DEMAND DELAY Republicans, who have fought the healthcare law as an unwarranted extension of the federal government, said the requirement should be delayed until the problems with the rollout are resolved. ""With so many unanswered questions and the problems arising around this rollout, it doesn't make any sense to impose this one percent mandate tax on the American people,"" House Republican Leader Eric Cantor told reporters on Wednesday. Republicans have repeatedly tried to derail or delay the healthcare law since taking control of the House in the 2010 elections. They demanded more answers on Wednesday about the scope of the problems. Three committees in the Republican-controlled House have announced investigations of the law's rollout, which Cantor described as ""nothing short of a debacle."" HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has been the focal point of criticism and Republicans have demanded she step down, but so far the White House has rallied around her. Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, told the New York Times on Tuesday that Sebelius ""has the president's confidence. And she knows that."" In the same article, an unidentified White House aide also appeared to try to distance Sebelius from the website troubles, and was quoted as saying, ""Kathleen has the title, but she doesn't have the responsibility or in many respects the kind of wide authority and access to the president that she really needs to make a difference."" Sebelius, who will testify to Congress next week, and McDonough attended the session with insurance company executives. They included the chief executives of WellPoint Inc, Humana Inc and Aetna Inc among others. WellPoint raised its 2013 membership and profit forecasts in part to reflect coming market changes under the law, its chief executive, Joseph Swedish, said in a statement on Wednesday.

USA TODAY

Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., says it's time for Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to resign for ""gross incompetence"" over the rocky start to a centerpiece of President Obama's health care law.

It's not unusual for a GOP senator to call on a member of a Democratic Cabinet to resign, or vice versa. But when the senator and the Cabinet secretary hail from the same state, their families have long been friends, and the senator supported the secretary's confirmation, that's noteworthy.

Sebelius and the Obama administration are taking a lot of blows over the new online health insurance exchanges that launched Oct. 1. Roberts has long been a critic of the health care law, and the computer glitches that have marred the rollout of the online exchanges are his last straw.

""Everything we warned about has come to pass,"" Roberts said in a statement that was especially critical of Sebelius' much-mocked appearance on The Daily Showwith Jon Stewart. ""They can see Obamacare has failed them. We need a secretary who can admit when enough is enough.""

Sebelius, a former governor of Kansas, defended the administration's launch of the health insurance exchanges. People have complained about long delays to sign up or not being able to do so at all because the Healthcare.gov website crashes. ""Nobody wants Americans to have to wait to sign up,"" she wrote in an op-ed column for USA TODAY. ""Engineers are working day and night to make upgrades. We're adding more servers to enable the system to handle larger loads. And we're upgrading our software as well to make the system more efficient and enable it to handle higher volumes.""

Roberts said at Sebelius' confirmation hearing in 2009 that they enjoyed a ""special relationship."" He was a congressional aide to Keith Sebelius, the secretary's father-in-law, and considers him his ""godfather"" in politics.

Insurance Commissioner Fired Day After Criticizing Obamacare 'Fix',"Washington, D.C.’s insurance commissioner was fired a day after he criticized President Barack Obama’s “administrative fix” for Obamacare.

William P. White, the D.C. insurance commissioner, told the Washington Post that D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray’s top deputies said Gray “wants to go in a different direction” after White was one of the first commissioners to push back against Obama’s “fix.”

Though White said he was not told that he was specifically fired for his criticism, he “said the timing was hard to ignore.” He said that 24 hours after his criticism, he was ‘basically being told, ‘Thanks, but no thanks.'”

Obama, in a Thursday White House press conference, announced an administrative fix that would allow insurance companies to extend plans that they have cancelled for another year. After that press conference, White, according to the Post, said Obama’s “action today undercuts the purpose of the exchanges, including the District’s DC Health Link, by creating exceptions that make it more difficult for them to operate.”

He also said that he concurred with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’s assessment that Obama’s administrative fix “threatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond.”

According to the Post, “White’s statement was removed from the department’s Web site sometime before Friday morning.”

White was “Gray’s commissioner for the D.C. Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking since February 2011.” D.C. officials said he was removed because any criticism of Obama’s administrative fix needed to be vetted more thoroughly, and White failed acknowledge the misstep of not sending his statement criticizing Obama higher up the chain of command before releasing it.

After Obama falsely promised Americans that they could keep their insurance plans under Obamacare, he has scrambled after millions received cancellation notices, and he eventually announced on Thursday his administration will allow insurance companies to let those whose insurance plans were cancelled to re-apply and keep their plans for another year.

Whether insurance companies will be allowed to do so, though, will ultimately rest with the insurance commissioners of the states. And others, like Washington state’s insurance commissioner, have already rejected Obama’s “administrative fix,” vowing to “stay the course” with Obamacare.

As the Post noted, Obama’s plan “rattled the insurance industry, which had set prices for next year based on many of its products changing to comply with the health-care law,” because “allowing some plans to continue beyond Jan. 1 could also run afoul of provisions in laws passed by dozens of states and the District to implement” Obamacare."

(CNN) —

As a rehabilitation physician, I’ve supported many of the ideas behind the Affordable Care Act since before Barack Obama’s presidency began. During the hot summer of town hall debates surrounding the legislation in 2009, I wrote an essay called “Standing up for Obama’s health plan,” and I have continued highlighting the fundamental advances that all of us, most especially disabled Americans, stand to share under the ACA.

But when the Obama administration decided last week to pull out a major pillar of the ACA, they lost my faith in their political wisdom.

There was a practical necessity to many of the president’s other compromises in order to get the ACA passed. Regrettably, it gives states just enough power over insurance marketplaces and the Medicaid expansion to continue the unequal and unfair distribution of state-based social services. It allows states to eviscerate Medicaid in ways that don’t make sense.

In some states, Medicaid pays to save the life of a stroke victim in the hospital, but then denies adequate rehabilitation services and devices to prevent that person’s ongoing health problems from rapidly placing further strain on the thin social-service safety net.

Coutesy of Ford Vox Ford Vox

The vast majority of Americans get medical insurance through their employers, although the number of employers that offer insurance has fallen 10% since 2000, and the insurance they do offer is increasingly lousy. Low-quality insurance, like so-called “mini medical” plans, is common. Employees won’t know their coverage is insufficient until it’s too late. If you work for one of these companies and your child suffers a serious trauma, the 30 visits or fewer these plans offer for outpatient therapy simply won’t be enough. I’ve seen this gut-wrenching situation time and again.

True health care reform must end this sorry state of affairs in the workplace, where health care is centered. But by postponing for a year the implementation of the ACA’s requirement that employers with more than 50 full-time workers offer insurance of minimally acceptable quality or face fines of $2,000 to $3,000, the administration has weakened the core of health care reform. It is delaying a critical national debate on what the ACA minimums should be.

How did this happen? The administration caved to pressure from business lobbyists, who, according to Politico, “mounted a coordinated campaign to convince senior White House officials that their date for requiring coverage was simply impractical.” It’s too bad patients and health care providers didn’t get their counterbalancing message out. Without it, the business lobby was able to create an atmosphere of false urgency by claiming businesses weren’t ready to start filing the information about the insurance plans they offer (or don’t).

Without that critical information, the rest of the already heavily compromised ACA apparatus starts to tilt precariously. How can the government enforce the individual mandate, which requires people to buy insurance if their employers don’t offer it or if they offer insurance that is substandard or overpriced? Without information from businesses, the government won’t know whether individuals are claiming legitimate exemptions or not.

The federal government has long excelled at helping private businesses attract and retain workers with affordable benefits. American business lobbyists don’t gripe so much about the nearly $200 billion in tax credits the nation grants their clients by designating employer-offered health benefits nontaxable. You’d think businesses would be pleased that the Congressional Budget Office projects that businesses that don’t offer qualifying insurance plans will be paying only $10 billion in penalties in 2014. Now they’ll be paying zilch.

In its notice announcing the ACA delay, the administration correctly states that the vast majority of employers already provide insurance. But so what? The ACA is as much about regulating insurance as encouraging businesses to provide it.

America’s employers, left to their own devices, have been exchanging dinky medical insurance for cheaper products and services for too long. Peachtree Hotel Group, which owns a variety of chain hotels, mostly in the South, recently disclosed to The Wall Street Journal how much it nickle-and-dimes the health of its 550 employees. The company’s chief financial officer says it offers a limited benefit plan, and now that the ACA is delayed for a year, it may increase the employee contribution on the full-benefit plan it was planning to offer next year under the law.

The next time you stay at Peachtree’s Courtyard by Marriott in Gulf Shores, Alabama, know that you could be paying a few cents less for your room so that Peachtree can provide capped health coverage to its valued employees. But if a Peachtree employee were to suffer a catastrophic injury, every taxpaying citizen of Alabama would be paying a few cents more to provide the Medicaid coverage and social services the patient needs.

Why does it make sense to let companies make irresponsible choices in exchange for a little more profit? These are the kinds of cutthroat business decisions a massive piece of legislation like the ACA should combat.

The retail and restaurant lobbyists who stealthily hunted bigger profit margins these past few months will now seize on the act’s wounded carcass. Republicans are already charging that this delay proves the administration knows the ACA is unworkable. They’re using this decision as another opportunity to stop or delay the law.

They’re right to do so. The ACA represents a large, painful change for a number of American institutions. Hospitals, doctors, patients, insurers and our government are in for a period of turmoil as these changes pulse through society’s many layers. Handing a reprieve to one of those groups is unfair to the rest of us, and will distort the necessary debates as specific problems come to light just in time for the 2014 midterm elections.

The administration should either delay the whole law until 2015 or go forward in 2014 as planned. Mortally wounding the ACA before the coming battle isn’t compromise – it’s foreshadowing.

Obamacare was sold as simply a refinement of the current system, retaining competition among independent insurers but making things more efficient, fair and generous. Free contraceptives for Sandra Fluke. Free mammograms and checkups for you and me. Free (or subsidized) insurance for some 30 million uninsured. And, mirabile dictu, not costing the government a dime.

In fact, Obamacare is a full-scale federal takeover. The keep-your-plan-if-you-like-your-plan ruse was a way of saying to the millions of Americans who had insurance and liked what they had: Don’t worry. You’ll be left unmolested. For you, everything goes on as before.

That was a fraud from the very beginning. The law was designed to throw people off their private plans and into government-run exchanges where they would be made to overpay — forced to purchase government-mandated services they don’t need — as a way to subsidize others. (That’s how you get to the ostensible free lunch.)

It wasn’t until the first cancellation notices went out in late 2013 that the deception began to be understood. And felt. Six million Americans with private insurance have just lost it. And that’s just the beginning. By the Department of Health and Human Services’ own estimates, about 75 million Americans would have plans that their employers would have the right to cancel. And millions of middle-class workers who will migrate to the exchanges and don’t qualify for government subsidies will see their premiums, deductibles and co-pays go up.

It gets worse. The dislocation extends to losing one’s doctor and drug coverage, as insurance companies narrow availability to compensate for the huge costs imposed on them by the extended coverage and “free” services the new law mandates.

But it’s not just individuals seeing their medical care turned upside down. The insurance providers, the backbone of the system, are being utterly transformed. They are rapidly becoming mere extensions of the federal government.

Look what happened just last week. Health and Human Services unilaterally and without warning changed coverage deadlines and guidelines. It asked insurers to start covering people on Jan. 1 even if they signed up as late as the day before and even if they hadn’t paid their premiums. And is “strongly encouraging” them to pay during the transition for doctor visits and medicines not covered in their current plans (if covered in the patient’s previous — canceled — plan).

On what authority does a Cabinet secretary tell private companies to pay for services not in their plans and cover people not on their rolls? Where in Obamacare’s 2,500 pages are such high-handed dictates authorized? Does anyone even ask? The bill itself is simply taken as a kind of blanket warrant for HHS to run, regulate and control the whole insurance system.

Remember the uproar over forcing religious institutions to provide contraception coverage? The president’s “fix” was a new regulation ordering insurers to provide these services for free. Apart from the fact that this transparent ruse does nothing to resolve the underlying issue of conscience — God sees — by what right does the government order private companies to provide free services for anyone?

Three years ago I predicted that Obamacare would turn insurers into the lapdog equivalent of utility companies. I undershot. They are being treated as wholly owned subsidiaries. Take the phrase “strongly encouraging.” Sweet persuasion? In reality, these are offers insurers can’t refuse. Disappoint your federal master and he has the power to kick you off the federal exchanges, where the health insurance business of the future is supposed to be conducted.

Moreover, if adverse selection drives insurers into a financial death spiral — too few healthy young people to offset more costly, sicker, older folks — their only recourse will be a government bailout. Do they really want to get on the wrong side of the White House, their only lifeline when facing insolvency?

I don’t care a whit for the insurance companies. They deserve what they get. They collaborated with the White House in concocting this scheme and are now being swallowed by it. But I do care about the citizenry and its access to a functioning, flourishing, choice-driven medical system.

Obamacare posed as a free-market alternative to a British-style single-payer system. Then, during congressional debate, the White House ostentatiously rejected the so-called “public option.” But that’s irrelevant. The whole damn thing is the public option. The federal government now runs the insurance market, dictating deadlines, procedures, rates, risk assessments and coverage requirements. It’s gotten so cocky it’s now telling insurers to cover the claims that, by law, they are not required to.

Most second-term presidents become fixated on global affairs because the world beyond our shores, with all its strife and misery, often seems more malleable than life in Washington, with its fractious Congress and waning electoral mandate. The trick, though, for a foreign policy president, is to be good at it—and these days those skills appear to be eluding Barack Obama.



This week’s biggest rebuke to Obama foreign policy was not Wednesday’s House hearing on Benghazi with its wrenching narrative of the September night that Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in Libya. Nor was it Friday morning’s revelation of new Benghazi-related documents. More embarrassing was a front-page article in last Sunday’s New York Times detailing how Obama erred last August when he impetuously declared that Syria’s use of chemical weapons in its civil war would be a “red line.”



It’s a simple rule: Presidents should never make threats until they have worked out how they would enforce them. But Obama violated it with his stern but ill-considered warning to Syrian strongman Bashar Assad. The Times article quotes one anonymous top government official claiming, “What Obama said in August was unscripted” and “nuance got completely dropped.” Barry Pavel, a former national security adviser to Obama, said flatly, “I’m not convinced it was thought through.”



Current and former foreign policy advisers usually fall on their swords to protect a president’s reputation for sagacity. Only long afterward, when the “if only he had listened to me” memoirs are published, do we finally get a glimpse of what really happened in the White House. That’s why it’s telling that Obama insiders are already willing to trash the president for his all-bluster “red line” rhetoric.



The reason for the finger-pointing at Obama is that America is now caught in a loose-lips-create-slips dilemma. Without any good policy options available and a growing isolationist mood among voters, Obama must decide what to do in response to highly probable evidence that forces loyal to Assad used banned chemical weapons. Arming the rebels, many of whom are Islamic militants, carries its own risk, yet doing nothing makes America appear feckless and irresolute.



Playing for time, Obama has been reduced to linguistic hair-splitting. Asked at a Tuesday press conference about perceptions that Syria has crossed his supposed red line, Obama said lamely, “I don't make decisions based on ‘perceived.’ And I can't organize international coalitions around ‘perceived.’ We've tried that in the past, by the way, and it didn't work out well.”



That, of course, was a reference to George W. Bush and his fallacious weapons-of-mass-destruction pretext for the Iraq War. As a presidential candidate, Obama presented himself as the antithesis of this kind of shoot-first foreign policy impetuousness. But, as president, it’s startling how much Obama resembles Bush in many aspects of national security policy.



Take Guantanamo, where currently about 100 of the remaining detainees are waging a hunger strike. Asked at a recent press conference about the Bush-era Cuban detention camp that he has repeatedly vowed to close, Obama sounded more like an outside critic than a president: “It hurts us in terms of international standing. … It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed.”



Despite intermittant efforts by Obama since taking office, Congress has refused to allow the president to close Guantanamo. But that does not make Obama a helpless bystander with no control over this symbolic blot on America’s international reputation.



The president has refused to use his existing legal authority (using waivers from the Defense Department) to repatriate 86 low-risk detainees, mostly from Yemen, whose cases have been reviewed by American authorities. Some of these prisoners were rank-and-file al-Qaida soldiers back in 2001, and others were probably picked up by mistake. But today these detainees would be less of a threat sent back to their home countries then they are as enduring symbols of an American gulag on Guantanamo.



Then there are the drones. Bush may have initiated the airborne assassination program in 2004, but Obama has made it a hallmark of his response to terrorism. With his drone policy, Obama has embraced three of the worst aspects of Bush-era national security policy: an obsession with secrecy; a contorted view of legal norms, especially the definition of “imminent threat”; and a refusal to consider that American tactics may create more terrorists than they kill. In Pakistan alone, based on the best independent statistics, Obama has ordered six times as many drone strikes as ever Bush did.



The silence from most Democrats on these troubling aspects of Obama foreign policy has been dispiriting. Had Bush made toothless threats to Syria, force-fed prisoners in Guantanamo or rained death from the air in Pakistan on a weekly basis, liberals in Congress would be sputtering with outrage. Instead, with a few conspicuous exceptions—like Oregon Senator Ron Wyden on drones—the dominant feeling appears to be that if Obama does it, it has to be right.



Ever since George McGovern lost 49 states to Richard Nixon in 1972, Democrats have cowered in terror at the thought of being branded as soft on national security. This may partly explain Obama’s timorousness on Guantanamo and the president’s embrace of drone strikes as a way of being tough against terrorists without risking American casualties.



The Republican obsession with Benghazi is rooted in the belief that the Obama administration was reluctant to label the 2012 Libyan attacks as “terrorism” because that would undermine the president’s narrative in an election year. Wednesday’s hearing—built around the testimony of three mid-level State Department officials—failed to prove anything close to causation. On Friday morning, however, ABC News reported that the State Department had insisted references to prior warnings on terrorism should be airbrushed out of the initial CIA talking points on the Banghazi attack.



This was the briefing document that U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, who drew the short straw as the administration’s TV talker, relied on when she made the rounds of Sunday-morning interviews the week of the attacks. Now, based on the ABC News story, it seems clear that Victoria Nuland, a career foreign service officer who was Hillary Clinton’s spokesperson at State, had insisted to the White House that these talking points be watered down.



Even now, so much about Benghazi remains murky, including how big a scandal it will actually prove to be. Were Nuland’s editing suggestions primarily designed to politically protect Obama and Clinton? Or was this, at its core, a Washington bureaucratic battle over which agency should be blamed for the deaths in Libya—State or the CIA?



Security was obviously lax in Benghazi. But was that because Stevens was a fearless diplomat who hated hunkering down behind concrete walls? Or was this related to the CIA’s still-mysterious role on the ground in Benghazi? And did the administration’s self-congratulatory belief in the Libyan revolution play a role in the relaxation of vigilence? Remember, Libya was Obama’s success story from the ""Arab spring""—the nation where a dictator was toppled by America boldly leading from behind.



Despite the documents discovered by ABC News, my guess is that the tragedy in Benghazi and its muddled aftermath had far more to do with human error than major-league conspiracy. In fact, given the way that Obama has handled his “red line” in Syria, the case for human error seems quite compelling."

(CNN) —

Late on the night of last September 11, U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens spoke to his deputy for the final time from the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.

“Greg, we’re under attack,” Stevens told Gregory Hicks.

Within hours, Stevens and three other Americans were dead, victims of an armed terrorist assault that has since become a political and foreign policy flashpoint in Washington’s partisan wars.

The dramatic narrative recounted by Hicks at a six-hour Republican-led House hearing on Wednesday reflected the knowledge of a high-level insider who was in Libya that long night and was deeply involved in trying to react to events.

His efforts to determine the circumstances of the attack and muster help for those under siege in eastern Libya were later praised by his superiors and by President Barack Obama.

The step-by-step account riveted the Oversight Committee proceeding that was also marked by sharp partisan exchanges over the merits of continued congressional inquiries over the attack.

What the Obama administration has said about the Libya attack

Republicans once again accused the Obama administration of trying to cover up the fact that it was a well-orchestrated assault by militants, failing to adequately explain events to the public, and then refusing to cooperate with congressional investigators.

Democrats once again accused Republicans of using tragedy for political gain.

Hicks – praised by Republicans as a “whistleblower” but who says he has since been effectively demoted – was joined at the witness table by Eric Nordstrom, a former regional security officer in Libya, and Mark Thompson, the State Department’s acting deputy assistant secretary for counterterrorism.

Our goal “is to get answers, declared committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California. “The administration, however, has not been cooperative.”

Hicks described in personal detail how he missed Stevens’ initial call and then reached him by cell phone as the attack unfolded in phases.

“I got the ambassador on the other end and he said, ‘Greg, we’re under attack.’”

He recounted the efforts of a security response team on site that drove back the attackers, and “repeated attempts” by those on the ground to enter the burning compound to try and rescue Stevens and others.

He then said that Stevens was at a hospital that was controlled by a group that he said Twitter feeds identified as leading the attack. Was it a trap to lure more Americans?

Then the worst news about his boss.

“I received a call from the prime minister of Libya. I think it’s the saddest phone call I’ve ever had in my life. He told me that Ambassador Stevens had passed away,” Hicks said.

Mother of Benghazi victim: I blame Hillary

A slow-to-evolve explanation

Oversight committee Republicans continued to go after televised remarks by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice five days after the attack. In them, she insisted it was the result of a spontaneous demonstration over an anti-Islam film that turned violent.

GOP critics believe Rice was shielding Obama at the height of his re-election campaign during which there were times that he trumpeted U.S. successes in combating terrorism, including the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011.

Administration officials say Rice was using official talking points that relied on the best available information at the time.

Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina, asked Hicks if there was any evidence early on that the attack was a protest.

“No, there was none,” Hicks said. “I’m confident Ambassador Stevens would have reported a protest immediately if one appeared on his door.”

Hicks also said an inflammatory anti-Muslim YouTube video initially cited as a cause of the alleged protest was “a non-event in Libya.”

He previously insisted administration officials immediately knew the culprit was al Qaeda.

“I think everybody in the mission thought it was a terrorist attack from the beginning,” Hicks told investigators in interviews before the hearings.

In fact, Hicks said during the hearing that he was told by the Libyan president soon afterward that elements with possible terror links were thought to be behind the assault.

The veteran diplomat said his “jaw dropped” and he was both “stunned” and “embarrassed” when Rice said the attack was a response to the YouTube video.

Boehner calls for White House to release Benghazi emails

Hicks also argued the U.S. military could have blunted the attack by scrambling intimidating military aircraft from Italy’s Aviano Air Base – an assertion denied by Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey when he testified before Congress in February.

Dempsey told Congress it would take up to 20 hours to scramble the aircraft to get to Benghazi; Hicks said he believed it would take two to three hours.

“I was speaking from my perspective … on the ground in Tripoli based on what the defense attache told me,” Hicks said when asked by

Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Oversight panel, asked Hicks if he had any reason to question Dempsey’s assertion.

Finally, Hicks claimed four members of the military were ready to board a plane from Tripoli to Benghazi, but were prevented from doing so by their superiors.

“How did the personnel react at being told to stand down?” asked Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah.

“They were furious,” said Hicks. “I can only say, well, I will quote Lieutenant Colonel Gibson who said, ‘This is the first time in my career that a diplomat has more balls than somebody in the military.’”

Pentagon officials insist the members of the military in question were told not to go to Benghazi because they were not equipped for combat, and were needed in Tripoli to care for wounded headed their way.

Analysis: State Department failed to understand dangerous situation in Benghazi

Nordstrom said in written testimony it was “inexplicable” that a followup internal State Department review ignored “the role senior department leadership played before, during, and after” the attack.

In the run-up to the hearing, Issa trickled out testimony from the witnesses in an apparent attempt to build anticipation for the session, one of several that have occurred in Congress focusing on security at the compound and the administration’s response.

Committee Democrats accused Republicans of engaging in a “smear” campaign.

“What we have seen … is a full-scale media campaign that is not designed to investigate what happened in a responsible and bipartisan way but rather a launch of unfounded accusations to smear public officials,” Cummings said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney also weighed in, telling reporters that the Benghazi attack “is a subject that has from its beginning been subject to attempts to politicize it by Republicans.”

He defended defended the administration has “made extraordinary efforts to work with” Congress on multiple investigations.

Four Americans killed in Benghazi: Why?

Accusation of playing politics

For its part, the State Department also accused House Republicans of playing politics with the tragedy.

“This is not sort of a collaborative process where the committee is working directly with us in trying to establish facts that would help, you know, as we look to keep our people safe overseas in a very complex environment,” State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said on Monday.

Wednesday’s hearing is another chapter in what has become an epic back and forth between Democrats and Republicans on Benghazi, partly stemming from Rice’s televised comments. The comments are widely believed to have cost her a likely nomination to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state.

Some congressional Republicans previously sharply questioned Clinton over the administration’s explanation of events and the state of security at the compound at the time of the attack.

Clinton has said that she accepted responsibility for the deaths, declaring that as secretary of state, she was “in charge of the State Department’s 60,000-plus people all over the world.”

In January, Clinton testified for more than five hours before the House and Senate Foreign Relations committees. In her testimony, she acknowledged a “systematic breakdown” on Benghazi and said her department was taking additional steps to increase U.S. security at diplomatic posts.

At one point at that hearing, Clinton barely controlled her anger as she responded to a lawmaker who pressed her on the administration’s post-attack storyline.

Critics have questioned the validity of continued congressional scrutiny, especially Democrats, who say Republicans are only interested in discrediting the administration and hurting Clinton’s chances if she were to run for president in 2016.

Former deputy chief of mission in Libya: U.S. military assets told to stand down

One Republican congressman, Ohio’s Jim Jordan, used the hearing to criticize top Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills.

Hicks said he received a call from Mills, who he added was not happy that a State Department lawyer – described by Republicans as a minder – was excluded from a briefing on Benghazi in Libya with Hicks, a Republican congressman and others.

Hicks has been “praised by everybody who counts, the president, the secretary, everyone above him,” Jordan said. “And yet now, they’re obstructing – because he won’t – he won’t help them cover this up.”

But former Clinton aide Philppe Reines disputed that characterization, saying the State Department took a cooperative approach with Congress. He said in a written statement that Mills had, in fact, called Hicks to support him.

“She wanted (people on the ground in Libya) to know that no matter how far away they were from home, they weren’t alone,” Reines said. “She was with them, and most importantly (Secretary Clinton) was with them.”

Putin in September as the standoff over the fate of Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor seeking asylum there, takes its toll on already strained relations between the United States and Russia, officials said Thursday.

Canceling the meeting in Moscow would be seen as a direct slap at Mr. Putin, who is known to value such high-level visits as a validation of Russian prestige. While the White House may be using the meeting as leverage to win cooperation as it seeks the return to the United States of Mr. Snowden, who is now staying at a Moscow airport, the reconsideration also reflects a broader concern that the two countries are far apart on issues like Syria, Iran, arms control and missile defense.

The conviction on Thursday of Aleksei A. Navalny, a prominent leader of the opposition to Mr. Putin, on embezzlement charges further underscored the deepening divide between the two countries as the White House pronounced itself “deeply disappointed” at what it called a trend of “suppressing dissent and civil society in Russia.” The verdict and five-year sentence came a week after the posthumous conviction of Sergei L. Magnitsky, a lawyer investigating official corruption who was arrested and died in custody.

“We call on the Russian government to cease its campaign of pressure against individuals and groups seeking to expose corruption, and to ensure that the universal human rights and fundamental freedoms of all of its citizens, including the freedoms of speech and assembly, are protected and respected,” said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary."

Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff on Tuesday called off the high-profile visit that both governments had planned for Oct. 23. A White House spokesman sought to downplay the diplomatic snub by a key ally and trading partner, and described the decision to indefinitely postpone the visit as mutual.

The White House said in a statement that Rousseff and President Obama had agreed that the state visit — an elaborate affair with meetings and a formal dinner with toasts — would be better staged when relations between the two nations were less tense.

Obama “understands and regrets” the concern that disclosures about U.S. spying has generated in Brazil, the statement said. “He is committed to working together with President Rousseff and her government in diplomatic channels to move beyond this issue as a source of tension in our bilateral relationship.”

A statement from the Brazilian president’s office was harsher, citing a “lack of ... explanations and commitment to cease interceptive activities” for the cancellation.

“The illegal interception of communications data belonging to citizens, companies and members of the Brazilian government are a grave matter, an assault on national sovereignty and individual rights, and are incompatible with relations between friendly nations,” the statement said.

Since July, Brazilian news organizations have carried three reports based on classified documents leaked by Snowden, a former systems administrator at an NSA listening post. One indicated that the intelligence agency had intercepted communications between Rousseff and her aides, among other senior officials.

Rousseff quickly denounced the eavesdropping, and aides said she wanted an apology from Obama and was reconsidering her invitation to Washington.

Obama tried to head off the rebuke. At a meeting this month of the Group of 20 nations in St. Petersburg, Russia, he added a meeting with Rousseff to his schedule and offered to address her concerns. National security advisor Susan Rice met with her Brazilian counterpart last week.

But the outreach failed. On Monday, the two leaders spoke by phone and agreed to delay the pomp and circumstance of a state visit so it would “not be overshadowed by a single bilateral issue, no matter how important or challenging the issue may be,” the White House said.

The cancellation marks the second presidential visit scrapped because of diplomatic umbrage related to Snowden and the trove of secret surveillance documents he has leaked to news media.

Obama canceled a planned meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month after Putin offered Snowden temporary asylum. The two leaders met informally days later in St. Petersburg, however, and both governments have endorsed a joint plan to disarm Syria of chemical weapons.

The invitation to Rousseff, the only state visit the White House had planned this year, was widely seen in Brazil as affirmation of its rising status on the international stage. But Rousseff appears to have calculated that reprimanding Washington over spying was more important for her domestic audience than a sit-down in the Oval Office.

“Slapping Obama in the face, standing up to the big neighbor in the North, will be much hyped here and could increase her popularity as she faces elections next year,” said David Fleischer, a political scientist at the University of Brasilia. “It increases Brazil’s standing in the world by saying we can stand up to the U.S. when they did something very nasty to us.”

“The issue of spying would have dominated the Washington visit,” said Peter Hakim, president emeritus at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think tank that focuses on relations with Latin America. “And Rousseff must have been nervous that something more could come out [from Snowden] before then.”

A Brazilian government commission met Tuesday with officials at the Russian Embassy to explore the possibility of a visit to Russia to meet with Snowden. Rousseff also is promoting legislation that would require Google, Facebook and other technology companies to store data collected in Brazil on Brazilian soil and therefore submit it to Brazilian law. Rousseff plans to speak on spying at the United Nations General Assembly next week.

The White House glossed over the downturn in relations, but the delay could have implications for U.S. businesses. Among the likely topics of discussion were a multibillion-dollar contract to sell Boeing aircraft, as well as access to oil fields for U.S. companies, said Carl Meacham, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

“This signals a different kind of environment for the U.S.,” said Meacham.

But before they got too far into that, Obama had something else to say.

“With the prime minister’s permission, I want to make one other point,” Obama said, launching into an appeal for Congress to support more money for embassy security — a not-so-subtle reply to Republicans who’ve pounced on the president’s handling of last year’s attack on the diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya.

The remark signaled how Obama and his aides have decided to respond to the pounding they have taken in recent days as three controversies have threatened to interfere with his second-term agenda. The White House has tried to showcase Obama as a pragmatic leader taking decisive action, contrasting him with what the president’s aides see as a Washington establishment obsessed with scandal.

“My concern is making sure that, if there’s a problem in the government, that we fix it,” Obama said, one of five times he used the word “fix” in his comments.

Signs of the strategy have been large and small, touching each of the controversies that have dominated the news cycles of the last week.

On Wednesday, administration officials announced support for a law to shield the news media from at least some subpoenas in criminal investigations, a move to deflect criticism from liberals over a federal prosecutor’s decision to seize telephone records of Associated Press reporters.

Then the White House released 99 pages of emails related to the Benghazi attack, aimed at proving wrong those who claimed the administration had politicized the event.

Little more than an hour later, Obama appeared in the East Room to announce on live television that he had pushed out the acting IRS commissioner, seeking to show he would move quickly to straighten out the tax agency after an inspector general’s report released Tuesday concluded that it had inappropriately targeted conservative groups.

On Thursday, in addition to his remarks on embassy security, Obama appointed a new acting commissioner to take over at the Internal Revenue Service and made his first comments on the AP subpoenas. Obama said he respected press freedom, but defended aggressive investigations of leaks as necessary to protect American personnel overseas, saying, “I make no apologies.”

The president also sought to demonstrate he was handling other crises that were nearly overlooked, gathering top military brass at the White House after a report estimated that 26,000 military members were sexually assaulted in unreported incidents last year.

The moves came after pressure from Democrats outside the White House. Many feared that the president’s Mr. Cool approach would not overcome the familiar churn of the Washington scandal machine.

One Democratic strategist, who asked not to be identified to preserve relations with the administration, said early in the week that he called a senior administration official to find out when the West Wing was going to come out fighting. “They didn’t want to get out ahead of the facts,” he said, was the answer he got.

Tommy Vietor, a former National Security Council spokesman, defended the White House response. “They took their time,” he said. “They reviewed the IG’s report, they declassified the emails, they got their facts together. They didn’t care about one 24-hour news cycle.”

The game of scandal response is relatively new to a White House that prides itself on its low blood pressure and control of the news cycle. White House aides privately vented about the frustration of feeling unable to push their message, set the record straight or change the subject.

The White House has since tried to thaw the chill with the press. On Wednesday, Press Secretary Jay Carney tried to lighten the tone at his briefing with a self-effacing joke and reference to a viral video mocking his frequent use of the phrase “I appreciate the question” for questions he doesn’t especially appreciate. Senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer, who rarely does television interviews, also appeared on CNN on Thursday to urge Democrats and Republicans to come together to “fix the problem.”

As the president spoke to the media in the Rose Garden on Thursday, a who’s who of Democratic spin-masters and veterans of scandals past met inside with Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Pfeiffer. Former Clinton Press Secretary Mike McCurry, Clinton speechwriter Don Baer and Tad Devine, who was an advisor to Vice President Al Gore, huddled with others for what participants said was an occasional get-together.

“This is what passes for a scandal these days?” quipped one longtime Democratic strategist.

The president’s attempt to change the subject included his meeting at the White House with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to discuss sexual harassment in the military. The subject gained credence not only because of the report on undisclosed assaults but also because of the sexual abuse investigations of two servicemen who coordinated sexual assault prevention programs.

The media were allowed in for photos and his comments.

Obama said sexual assault in the military was “not a sideshow,” a label his advisors use to describe the controversy over the Benghazi talking points, and he assured military leaders he would be working on the issue.

“There’s no silver bullet to solving this problem,” Obama said. “This is going to require a sustained effort over a long period of time.”

It’s not yet clear whether the newfound strategy will turn the tide for the White House. Republicans on Capitol Hill did not let up after the release of the Benghazi emails, saying the documents did not back up the White House version of events. “If the White House wants to get out of hot water they should just start being candid,” said Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).

Some Obama partisans, however, are relieved, said Neera Tanden, president of the progressive think tank Center for American Progress. “Most people, most Democrats, think they turned the corner,” she said.

Speaking to the nation from the White House, Mr. Obama laid out his most extensive and detailed case for an attack to punish Syria for its use of chemical weapons. But he also acknowledged the deep doubts of Americans who after the experience of Iraq and Afghanistan view any form of military engagement in Syria with alarm.

In a speech that only 48 hours ago was going to be solely a call to arms, Mr. Obama instead offered a qualified endorsement of a proposal that his own advisers conceded was rife with risk, given Russia’s steadfast refusal to agree to any previous measures to pressure Syria, its longtime ally.

“It’s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments,” Mr. Obama said. “But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force.”"

There is a lot to learn from this mistake for the entire organization. We have rebuilt CBS News in a way that has dramatically improved our reporting abilities. Ironically 60 Minutes, which has been a model for those changes, fell short by broadcasting a now discredited account of an important story, and did not take full advantage of the reporting abilities of CBS News that might have prevented it from happening.

As a result, I have asked Lara Logan, who has distinguished herself and has put herself in harm’s way many times in the course of covering stories for us, to take a leave of absence, which she has agreed to do. I have asked the same of producer Max McClellan, who also has a distinguished career at CBS News.

As Executive Producer, I am responsible for what gets on the air. I pride myself in catching almost everything, but this deception got through and it shouldn’t have.

When faced with a such an error, we must use it as an opportunity to make our broadcast even stronger. We are making adjustments at 60 Minutes to reduce the chances of it happening again.

There is a lot of pride at CBS News. Every broadcast is working hard to live up to the high standard set at CBS News for excellence in reporting. This was a regrettable mistake. But there are many fine professionals at 60 Minutes who produce some of the very best of broadcast journalism, covering the important and interesting stories of our times, and they will continue to do so each and every Sunday.

Chairman, CBS News

Executive Producer, 60 Minutes



SUMMARY OF FINDINGS



My review found that the Benghazi story aired by 60 Minutes on October 27 was deficient in several respects:



--From the start, Lara Logan and her producing team were looking for a different angle to the story of the Benghazi attack. They believed they found it in the story of Dylan Davies, written under the pseudonym, “Morgan Jones”. It purported to be the first western eyewitness account of the attack. But Logan’s report went to air without 60 Minutes knowing what Davies had told the FBI and the State Department about his own activities and location on the night of the attack.

--The fact that the FBI and the State Department had information that differed from the account Davies gave to 60 Minutes was knowable before the piece aired. But the wider reporting resources of CBS News were not employed in an effort to confirm his account. It’s possible that reporters and producers with better access to inside FBI sources could have found out that Davies had given varying and conflicting accounts of his story.



--Members of the 60 Minutes reporting team conducted interviews with Davies and other individuals in his book, including the doctor who received and treated Ambassador Stevens at the Benghazi hospital. They went to Davies’ employer Blue Mountain, the State Department, the FBI (which had interviewed Davies), and other government agencies to ask about their investigations into the attack. Logan and producer Max McClellan told me they found no reason to doubt Davies’ account and found no holes in his story. But the team did not sufficiently vet Davies’ account of his own actions and whereabouts that night.

--Davies told 60 Minutes that he had lied to his own employer that night about his location, telling Blue Mountain that he was staying at his villa, as his superior ordered him to do, but telling 60 Minutes that he then defied that order and went to the compound. This crucial point – his admission that he had not told his employer the truth about his own actions – should have been a red flag in the editorial vetting process.

--After the story aired, the Washington Post reported the existence of a so-called “incident report” that had been prepared by Davies for Blue Mountain in which he reportedly said he spent most of the night at his villa, and had not gone to the hospital or the mission compound. Reached by phone, Davies told the 60 Minutes team that he had not written the incident report, disavowed any knowledge of it, and insisted that the account he gave 60 Minutes was word for word what he had told the FBI. Based on that information and the strong conviction expressed by the team about their story, Jeff Fager defended the story and the reporting to the press.

--On November 7, the New York Times informed Fager that the FBI’s version of Davies’ story differed from what he had told 60 Minutes. Within hours, CBS News was able to confirm that in the FBI’s account of their interview, Davies was not at the hospital or the mission compound the night of the attack. 60 Minutes announced that a correction would be made, that the broadcast had been misled, and that it was a mistake to include Davies in the story. Later a State Department source also told CBS News that Davies had stayed at his villa that night and had not witnessed the attack.

--Questions have been raised about the recent pictures from the compound which were displayed at the end of the report, including a picture of Ambassador Stevens’ schedule for the day after the attack. Video taken by the producer-cameraman whom the 60 Minutes team sent to the Benghazi compound last month clearly shows that the pictures of the Technical Operations Center were authentic, including the picture of the schedule in the debris.

--Questions have also been raised about the role of Al Qaeda in the attack since Logan declared in the report that Al Qaeda fighters had carried it out. Al Qaeda’s role is the subject of much disagreement and debate. While Logan had multiple sources and good reasons to have confidence in them, her assertions that Al Qaeda carried out the attack and controlled the hospital were not adequately attributed in her report.

--In October of 2012, one month before starting work on the Benghazi story, Logan made a speech in which she took a strong public position arguing that the US Government was misrepresenting the threat from Al Qaeda, and urging actions that the US should take in response to the Benghazi attack. From a CBS News Standards perspective, there is a conflict in taking a public position on the government’s handling of Benghazi and Al Qaeda, while continuing to report on the story.

--The book, written by Davies and a co-author, was published by Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, part of the CBS Corporation. 60 Minutes erred in not disclosing that connection in the segment.

Politico reports that the meeting started at approximately 12:45 PM ET, and that it moved the normal press briefing to 1:45 PM ET. Jay Carney, White House press secretary, did not comment on whether the meeting took place.

Politico reports:

The off-the-record session was announced to reporters in the wake of an ABC News report showing that White House and State Dept. officials were involved in revising the now-discredited CIA talking points about the attack on Benghazi.

The administration routinely exerts pressure on reporters it feels are not kind enough in their coverage. Reporters like Cheryl Attkisson of CBS News have felt the hand of their bosses for “wading dangerously close to advocacy” with regard to Benghazi. No doubt this “off-the-record” meeting was designed to get all the president’s horses and all the president’s men to put the Benghazi humpty dumpty together again.

UPDATE: Reporters not invited to the off-the-record briefing are reportedly incredibly unhappy about it:

UPDATE II: Jake Tapper of CNN reports that the regularly scheduled press briefing has been delayed even further:

UPDATE III: Politico now reports that the meeting has been characterized as “deep background.” The existence of the meeting itself is considered “off-the-record.” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, “Deep background means that the info presented by the briefers can be used in reporting but the briefers can’t be quoted.” So expect a fair number of “White House sources” to appear in reportage for the next few days.

UPDATE IV: Jay Carney began his on-the-record press briefing by announcing that 14 news organizations were invited to the closed door briefing, but that it was not a substitute for the on-the-record briefing. He then announced that it was “erroneous” to describe the briefing as “off-the-record,” and instead suggested it was “deep background.”

According to the speakers, a significant amount of the opposition to immigration reform is being led by liberals, environmentalists and pro-abortion and eugenics activists worried about population growth.

“[T]he primary leaders and funders of the anti-immigration movement were drawn to it because they were also active organizers and supporters of, and contributors to, the population-control movement in the United States,” Mario Lopez, a speaker on the call, recently wrote. Lopez is President of the Hispanic Leadership Fund. Lopez was joined on the call by Josh Culling, with Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform.

This ad hominem argument is both inane and irrelevant. People come into issues from all kinds of vantage points. I have no doubt that there active immigration reform opponents who are liberals or have overblown worries about population growth. Those views, however, don’t discredit what they may say on a different issue. Nor do those views discredit what people without those views believe on an issue.

Friday’s call was a leftist tactic to discount what millions of Americans feel about an issue because some other people hold views with which they would disagree. It was reminiscent of the media’s attempt to smear the entire Tea Party movement because a handful of people said or did something stupid.

Even if one were to cede the premise that an entire infrastructure to oppose immigration reform were built by population control activists, the fact is immaterial to the concerns many have about the legislation before the Senate. Even if you support expansive legal immigration, it is a bad bill. Its fatal flaw is that it doesn’t secure the border or increase enforcement in any meaningful way. One doesn’t have to be a population control zealot to see the fundamental problem with that approach.

Surely, the speakers would hopefully acknowledge, there are many opposed to the Senate bill who don’t believe in population control. I would wager the overwhelming majority of Americans who have concerns about the bill are not advocates of abortion or eugenics to control the population. So, why are the views of a decided minority relevant to an issue with national implications?

The richest irony of the call was that the speakers are allies of groups like SEIU and La Raza in supporting the specific Senate proposal. One could just as easily have a convened a press call to discuss the “history” behind these groups and why conservatives should be cautious about working with them. The speakers on the call, for example, acknowledged doing at least some work with the National Immigration Forum, which has received considerable funding from George Soros’ Open Society Institute. Is that the proper alliance for a conservative?

No one should schedule such a call, however. Issues should be decided on merits, not ad hominem aspersions about someone else’s motives. The call was an attempt to smear all opposition to the Senate bill as arising out of the questionable beliefs of a few people. It was an attempt to quash, rather than foster, debate on the underlying merits of the proposal.

The call also perpetuated a dangerously false choice. Conservatives should either accept legislation largely written by Sen. Chuck Schumer or be labeled as against reform. That our allies are forcing this choice is unconscionable."

In an apparent first for a world leader visiting the White House, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera on Tuesday briefly co-opted the President of the United States’ – in this case obviously Barack Obama – Oval Office desk.

""I’m going to sit at the President of the United States’ desk,"" Pinera states in Spanish before undertaking the bit of foolery that reportedly broke all manner of long-held White House protocols for visiting leaders, according to a YouTube video of the unfortunate event.

[pullquote]

Pinera then decisively rounds the hallowed workspace at which Lincoln, Roosevelt – both Teddy and Franklin D. -- JFK and 40 others penned into law untold acts of world-changing legislation, not to mention declarations of war and related political bric-a-brac – and makes himself rather comfortably at home, although without, thankfully, going so far as to put his feet up on the desk.

Perhaps to break the obvious tension, Alfredo Moreno Charme, the Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs, reportedly asked a seemingly awestruck Obama, ""How many other presidents have done the same?""

To his credit, a cordial and by-then-bemused Obama, who quickly recovered from his initial and barely perceptible bout of surprise, responded in Spanish, “Este es el unico,” or, “This is the only one.”

Boisterous laughter ensued among the more than dozen or so dignitaries arranged around the history-laden room, at which point Pinera awkwardly justified the gaffe by explaining, ""You know my daughter was born here.”

And, indeed, Pinera, a billionaire businessman who ascended in 2010 to his country’s highest office, has rather rich American ties.

He reportedly spent some early childhood in New York City, and attended Harvard University before attaining a degree from the prestigious school. However, his political career has reportedly been beset by the sort of obvious failures he rarely – if ever – experienced in the business world.

The reported ample archive of his sundry missteps has reportedly given way to his countrymen’s characterization of similar clownishness as the one apparent on Tuesday in the Oval Office as “Pineri-cosas.”"

Schumer Debate persists over whether Snowden is a hero or a traitor

(CNN) —

The fragile U.S.-Russia relationship – already frayed by disagreements over Syria, Iran and nuclear arms – showed another sign of strain Sunday, as American lawmakers blasted the country’s President Vladimir Putin for allowing NSA leaker Edward Snowden to land in Moscow while evading U.S. espionage charges.

Snowden, who has admitted leaking top-secret information about government surveillance programs, left Hong Kong on Sunday and later touched down in Moscow, according to Wikileaks, which helped him travel. While Russia is not believed to be his final destination – Ecuador’s prime minister said Snowden applied for asylum in his country – lawmakers on Sunday were quick to fault Putin for harboring a man the U.S. government desperately wants back.

“Putin always seems almost eager to put a finger in the eye of the United States, whether it is Syria, Iran, and now, of course, with Snowden,” Sen. Chuck Schumer said on CNN’s State of the Union. “That’s not how allies should treat one another, and I think it will have serious consequences for the United States-Russia relationship.”

That relationship was already showing signs of strain at last week’s Group of Eight conference in Northern Ireland, where global leaders pressured Putin on his country’s support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which extends back to the Cold War and Assad’s father. At a joint appearance that followed a bilateral meeting last week, Putin and President Barack Obama were tense and unsmiling and offered no indication their deep disagreements about the way forward in war-torn Syria were any closer to being resolved.

Why would Snowden head for Ecuador?

Later in the week, Obama publicly pressured Russia to join the United States in slashing its supply of nuclear weapons, saying both nations needed to “move beyond Cold War nuclear postures.”

Obama delivered his remarks at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, which for decades symbolized the East-West divide.

On Sunday, however, the divide between the United States and Russia persisted. Schumer, a New York Democrat, suggested on CNN that Putin personally approved Snowden’s landing in Moscow on Sunday.

“Very few are the areas in which he does cooperate (with the U.S.) these days. I think this action, Putin allowing Snowden to land in Russia and then go somewhere else, is going to have serious consequences for the U.S.-Russian relationship,” Schumer said.

His characterization of Russia’s stance was echoed by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, an infrequent ally of Schumer’s, who spoke on “Fox News Sunday.”

“I hope we’ll chase him to the ends of the earth, bring him to justice and let the Russians know there will be consequences if they harbor this guy,” said Graham, who represents South Carolina.

“They want to be part of the world community, the (World Trade Organization). They want a good relationship with the United States. They should hold this felon and send him back home for justice,” Graham said. Russia joined the World Trade Organization last August after nearly two decades of negotiations. Before being admitted, it was the largest economy not represented at the global trade body.

As lawmakers spoke Sunday, it remained unclear where Snowden’s final destination would be, though he was not expected to remain in Russia. Snowden’s U.S. passport has been revoked, according to a source familiar with the matter, setting up any travel out of Russia to become a major diplomatic flashpoint.

“Persons wanted on felony charges, such as Mr. Snowden, should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel, other than is necessary to return him to the United States,” State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.

Earlier in June, Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would consider a request for political asylum from Snowden, but that such a request from the NSA leaker had not yet been made.

Peskov, in an indication of the Kremlin’s stance, also wrote on Twitter, “The U.S. security services were breaking the laws of their country by tapping phone calls and conducting Internet surveillance.”

Wikileaks’ Assange urges support for Snowden, slams Obama

“Snowden, same as Assange, is a human rights activist,” he continued, referring to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, currently holed up at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he’s been granted asylum.

Asked Sunday whether he believed Putin had advance knowledge of Snowden’s travel plans, Rep. Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said, “That wouldn’t surprise me.”

“Russia is a country that wants to get back on the world stage, and I don’t think they really care if they do it in a way that’s in the best interest of good citizenship around the world,” Rogers said on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” citing Putin’s stance on Syria and nuclear disarmament.

“I’m sure they would love to have a little coffee and a few conversations with Mr. Snowden,” continued the Michigan Republican, referring to the Russians. “That’s why this is so serious and why we need to be so aggressive in making sure that people understand the difference between somebody who betrays their country and gives secrets away that will protect American lives at the expense of whatever he hopes to gain in the company of the Russians.”

Rogers’ remarks underscored the debate between those who believe Snowden committed an act of treason and those who view him as a hero promoting greater government transparency. The debate has created unlikely alliances in Washington, where some Democrats find themselves on the same side as Republicans – and opposite their base – in calling for Snowden’s arrest.

An empty debate? Why little will happen to change how we snoop

Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, was loudly booed and heckled at a conference of progressives Saturday when she asserted Snowden had broken the law. Earlier, she drew a distinction between lawmakers like herself, who oversee the nation’s security, and privacy-minded citizens.

“I know that some of you attribute heroic status to that action,” she said, referring to Snowden’s leaks. “But, again, you don’t have the responsibility for the security of the United States. Those of us who do have to strike a different balance.”

“I don’t think this man is a whistle-blower,” another California Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “Whatever his motives are, and I take him at face value, he could have stayed and faced the music. I don’t think running is a noble thought.”

That view was countered by Sen. Rand Paul, a libertarian-minded Kentucky Republican who has been one of the few U.S. lawmakers to praise Snowden. While he warned Snowden would be discredited if he “cozies up to the Russian government,” Paul suggested the former CIA employee had lived up to his duty as a citizen by exposing what he felt were government misdeeds.

“I would say that Mr. Snowden hasn’t lied to anyone. He did break his oath of office, but part of his oath of office is to the Constitution,” Paul said on CNN, adding: “He was simply coming forward and telling the truth – that your government was lying.”

Snowden gets proposal tweet from Russian agent,"A demonstrator holds a sign with a photograph of former U.S. spy agency NSA contractor Edward Snowden and the word Brian Snyder / Reuters

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A tabloid says Vladimir Putin is Russia's most eligible bachelor, but the president may have competition from an American half his age: Edward Snowden, the former U.S. spy agency contractor believed to be holed up at a Moscow airport.

Snowden, 30, has received a marriage proposal of sorts in a tweet from Anna Chapman, the glamorous redhead who was one of 10 Russian agents arrested in the United States and deported in a Cold war-style spy swap in 2010.

""Snowden, will you marry me?!"" a posting on a Twitter account bearing Chapman's name and photograph said late on Wednesday.

After a few hours with no reply, a second tweet appeared.

Anna Chapman was at the center of the biggest spy crisis between the United States and Russia since the Cold War as one of the US-based 'sleeper' agents. SERGEI CHIRIKOV / EPA

""@nsa, will you look after our children?"" it said, a wry reference, perhaps, to the surveillance powers of the U.S. National Security Agency.

Chapman, 31, did not immediately respond to an emailed query about the authenticity of the tweets and the proposal to Snowden, who is wanted by Washington on espionage charges.

Former NSA contractor Snowden is believed to have been living in a transit area in the Moscow airport since arriving on June 23. He has appealed to various countries for asylum.

Putin, 60, who praised Chapman and the other Russian agents deported from the United States, has separated from his wife, prompting the weekly Secrets of the Stars to speculate on his eligibility, under the headline: ""Any woman would marry Putin!""

All Americans of faith should be outraged by these comments which clearly telegraph the President’s belief system and are in fact at their core even anti-American.”

American Catholics for Religious Freedom points out that the media has completely ignored the story, and adds, “Secular progressives like President Obama ignore the truth that faith-based education is a component of the Religious Freedom guaranteed by the Constitution. He can’t bear the thought that Catholic and parochial schools not only teach important values but consistently produce better educational results at lower cost than America’s failing public schools. The President’s troubling values are showing here in a way that demonstrate just how dangerous this Administration is and how committed it is to eroding the rights of all people of faith.”

And, they note, this is the same President who has attempted to cram down anti-Catholic doctrine via Obamacare. “It’s time Americans stood up for Religious Freedom, for the U.S. Constitution and against President Obama’s radical views about the place of faith in American life,” the group concludes.

Pollak'],"In Foreign Affairs, Obama's 'Not Bush' Non-Policy Collapses","The alleged use of deadly chemical weapons by the Syrian regime against civilians and opponents on the anniversary of President Barack Obama’s “red line” statement might have marked the collapse of Obama’s foreign policy–if such policy actually existed. In fact, however, the Obama administration has no foreign policy other than its continued opposition to the perceived postures of George W. Bush, more than four years gone.

Obama’s policy in Syria had been to rehabilitate the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad. Well before he won the presidency, Democrats–including current Secretary of State John Kerry–made a point of visiting Assad to show their approach to foreign relations was different from, and more effective than, the allegedly confrontational approach of the Bush administration. Syria’s nuclear weapons program, exposed when Israel destroyed it in 2007, did not prompt any change in Democrats’ approach to the regime.

Therefore Obama renewed diplomatic relations and re-opened the U.S. embassy in Damascus, elevating the status of the regime. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even referred to Assad as a “reformer.” The hope was that doing so would convince him to side with the U.S. over Iran, and to win goodwill in the Arab world more generally.

In Egypt, the Obama administration adopted a similar approach, i.e. appeasing a tyrant with the intention of establishing a clear break with Bush’s pressure for democratic reforms and encourage a new perception of the U.S. as more open to the Arab and Muslim worlds. In the midst of an orgy of federal spending, Obama cut funding for pro-democracy groups in Egypt and prioritized relations with Hosni Mubarak’s regime.

At the same time, however, Obama began trying to rehabilitate the Muslim Brotherhood, not because he wished to encourage a democratic process in Egypt that might include their participation, but because he wished to appease Islamist sentiment in general. His administration refused, for example, to identify radical Islam as the source of terrorism, and even redefined the term “war on terror” itself as “overseas contingency operations.”

Therefore when the Arab Spring erupted in 2011, the Obama administration initially tried to argue that he was not a “dictator.” Then, as media criticism began to mount, Obama switched sides and backed Mubarak’s ouster, all the while claiming that he had not, in fact, changed his policy. His previous efforts to rehabilitate the Muslim Brotherhood as a legitimate organization gave some amount–though not much–of legitimacy to that claim.

Today, in the aftermath of the Egyptian coup, Obama’s foreign policy has lost even the pretense of principle. He is showing outrage at the Egyptian military’s treatment of the Muslim Brotherhood protestors, cutting some aid and canceling joint military exercises (none of which he did in response to the Brotherhood’s own excesses when in power). Yet he refuses to call the coup itself a “coup,” or to cut all aid to the Egyptian military.

Meanwhile, in Syria, Obama is still refusing to do anything that might actually deter the regime from using banned weapons–such as imposing a no-fly zone, for instance–while accelerating aid to the Syrian rebels, who are dominated by anti-American jihadists. His policies are all half-measures and contradictions. Faced with the fact that his academic anti-colonialism has little real-world relevance, he is just avoiding any real commitments.

In fact, the only real foreign policy priority of the Obama administration is to avoid being blamed for anything that could possibly go wrong. He concluded his remarks on Egypt last week by insisting: “We don’t take sides with any particular party or political figure. I know it’s tempting inside of Egypt to blame the United States or the West or some other outside actor for what’s gone wrong.” The buck stops…with Egypt, he said. Not with me.

That is not to say that the Middle East’s current problems are easy to resolve. Republicans and conservatives have had a tough time coming to a consensus about what should be done. The Arab world presents only bad options and worse options: a genocidal regime in Syria versus brutal jihadist groups; a military tyranny in Egypt versus radical Islamists with hegemonic ambitions. The dangerous temptation to withdraw is strong.

The one point of agreement among conservatives–even the likes of Patrick Buchanan, these days–is that the U.S. should primarily be concerned with shoring up Israel against common enemies such as Al Qaeda and Iran. In other words, the best path might be to focus on the sole U.S. ally in the region. But the Obama administration has done the opposite, pressuring Israel and giving Iran leeway, despite continued frustration.

It is arguable that the Bush administration had a similarly rudderless foreign policy when it took office in 2001, driven only by the desire to do the opposite of its predecessor. Yet it pulled together a new strategy–however flawed–after 9/11, when circumstances had changed. Obama has failed to learn from crisis–whether the Green Revolution in Iran in 2009, or the Arab Spring and its aftermath. “Not Bush” is a non-policy, but a real failure."

The events surrounding the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012, look dramatically different depending on your politics. Republicans tend to see a cover-up and a scandal. Democrats see an attempt to damage President Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton. A Pew poll suggests that the public is divided as well, with 40 percent saying the administration has been dishonest, 37 percent saying it has told the truth, and 23 percent saying they’re not sure. Let’s assess what we do and don’t know.

1. U.N. Ambassador Susan E. Rice gave a deliberately false account of the attack.

This is ground zero in the alleged scandal. Conspiracy theorists contend the administration covered up evidence that Stevens was killed in an organized terrorist attack because Obama, during the 2012 campaign, claimed he had “decimated” al-Qaeda. On Sunday talk shows five days after the attack, Rice gave interviews based on talking points supplied by U.S. intelligence agencies; she suggested that Stevens’s death resulted from “spontaneous” protests that spread from the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, provoked by a movie trailer lampooning the prophet Muhammad.

In response to charges of a cover-up, the White House this past week released 100 pages of e-mails that show the State Department sought to remove references to possible links to Ansar al-Sharia, an Islamist group tied to al-Qaeda, and to earlier CIA warnings of extremist threats in Benghazi and eastern Libya.

Was there a cover-up? It does appear White House spokesman Jay Carney wasn’t giving the full story when he said, at a Nov. 28 briefing, that the White House and State Department had made only a “single adjustment” to the talking points, changing the word “consulate” to “diplomatic facility.” It is also possible that State wanted to tone down or remove passages that might cast the department or Clinton in a bad light.

But the e-mails indicate as well that the White House and State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland were mainly concerned with prejudging an ongoing investigation by releasing classified information too soon. And there is little doubt that Rice’s taped remarks reflected the best intelligence assessment of the attacks at the time. As more information came in, intelligence officials changed that assessment publicly. If the talking points were extensively edited after an interagency consultation, that was fairly normal procedure, especially when it came to deleting classified portions referring to specific groups. Rice did allow, in her comments on TV, that “extremist elements” might have taken part in the attack.

Even now, the FBI and other agencies are not certain who the culprits were. In that light, the administration’s efforts to remove references to specific groups look more judicious than nefarious.

2. A faster military response would have saved at least some of the four Americans.

We will never know for sure. In congressional testimony, Stevens’s former deputy, Gregory Hicks, said his request that the military send in F-16s and Special Operations troops as the attack was underway was refused. The Obama administration has responded that Hicks, a career diplomat, was no military expert. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and former defense secretary Leon Panetta testified this year that a military rescue mission would not have been practical. Dempsey said it would have taken “up to 20 hours or so” to get F-16s to the site, and he called them “the wrong tool for the job.”

Former defense secretary Robert Gates delivered perhaps the most persuasive rebuttal to this myth. On CBS’s “Face the Nation” on May 12, Gates said he probably would have made the same decisions. He also said Hicks’s notion that flying a fighter jet over the attackers might have dispersed them reflected “sort of a cartoonish impression of military capabilities,” ignoring the “number of surface-to-air missiles that have disappeared from [former Libyan leader Moammar] Gaddafi’s arsenals.”

3. Obama and Clinton should not be blamed.

This is the Democrats’ favorite myth. In December, Clinton’s own Accountability Review Board concluded that “systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies” might have contributed to the four deaths. But the report didn’t assign responsibility to any individual, and it confined blame for any mistakes to “two bureaus of the State Department.”

In fact, the Obama administration did appear to be playing down or ignoring security threats in Libya at the time. As the report said: “Simply put, in the months leading up to September 11, 2012, security in Benghazi was not recognized and implemented as a ‘shared responsibility’ in Washington, resulting in stove-piped discussions and decisions on policy and security.” The report also noted “known gaps” in the intelligence community’s assessments. And it’s the responsibility of those at the highest levels — the president and the secretary of state — to fill those gaps. In congressional testimony in January, Clinton said that she didn’t read an Aug. 16 cable from Stevens that raised questions about security and that she didn’t know about a decision to reject a request for more security. “I didn’t see those requests. They did not come to me. I did not approve them. I did not deny them,” she said. If so, it’s fair to ask: Why wasn’t Clinton involved?

4. The Benghazi attack could not have been predicted.

The administration’s argument is that there was no specific threat — and it will probably be Clinton’s, too, if she reemerges in public life ahead of 2016. The circumstances were unusual. Stevens was taking extraordinary risks in traveling to Benghazi, where he established contacts with anti-Gaddafi rebels during the uprising. Few U.S. ambassadors would ever be in a similar situation.

But these risks were known before the attack. As the Accountability Review Board report concluded, “At the time of the September attacks, Benghazi remained a lawless town nominally controlled by the Supreme Security Council (SSC) — a coalition of militia elements loosely cobbled into a single force to provide interim security — but in reality run by a diverse group of local Islamist militias.” Why was Stevens allowed to travel to such an unsecure place?

5. Benghazi is a pseudo-scandal manufactured by the GOP.

Republicans have blown Benghazi out of proportion. It doesn’t appear to have been a cover-up, but neither can it be dismissed. It represents a tragic failure of U.S. policy, one that should spark a larger discussion about whether the government has responded poorly to the Islamist threats that have emerged since the Arab Spring. It is reasonable to ask whether the Obama administration, starting with the president himself, created the conditions for Benghazi by being overconfident about the destruction of al-Qaeda and playing down the significance of extremist elements, possibly linked to al-Qaeda, that had emerged in Libya and elsewhere. Unless these threats are better understood, it is easy to imagine a similar disaster happening elsewhere.

Because Benghazi cost precious American lives, it should be investigated carefully rather than politicized endlessly.

A prolonged conflict is perceived as hurting Iran, which finances Mr. Assad’s war effort. Whether Mr. Obama follows through on his promise to retaliate for the use of chemical weapons is a test of his commitment, ultimately, to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb — as long as the retaliation does not become a full-scale intervention in Syria.

“If it’s Iran-first policy, then any diversion to Syria is not fruitful,” said Aluf Benn, editor of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. “From the Israeli point of view, the worst scenario is mission-creep in Syria and America gets entangled in a third war in the Middle East, which paralyzes its ability to strike Iran and limits Israel’s ability to strike Iran as well.”

This spring, when an Israeli official called for an international response to what he said were earlier Syrian chemical attacks, he was muzzled and reprimanded for appearing to pressure the White House. Now, said Eyal Zisser, a historian at Tel Aviv University who specializes in the region, “it’s clear that Israel does not want to appear as somebody that is pushing the United States for a deep involvement.”

There are significant differences between Israel and the United States on Syria. There was widespread criticism here of Mr. Obama’s decision to delay responding to the chemical attack, with the quote “When you have to shoot, shoot, don’t talk” from “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” becoming a common refrain. One Israeli dentist even took out a large newspaper ad promoting his implant services with a picture of Mr. Obama captioned, “He doesn’t have teeth?”

There has also been a broader debate about how best to respond to the war in Syria.

When the uprising began, many here saw Mr. Assad, who like his predecessor and father had maintained quiet on the border, as “the devil you know,” and therefore preferable to the rebels, some of whom were aligned with Al Qaeda or Sunni militants like the Palestinian Hamas faction.

As the death toll has mounted, more Israelis joined a camp led by Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, who argues that the devil you know is, actually, a devil who should be ousted sooner rather than later.

That split remains. But as hopes have dimmed for the emergence of a moderate, secular rebel force that might forge democratic change and even constructive dialogue with Israel, a third approach has gained traction: Let the bad guys burn themselves out."

“Just today, before coming in here, I read an e-mail to me about a general, the minister of defense, former minister or assistant minister, I forget which, who has just defected and is now in Turkey,” the secretary of state testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “And there are other defections that we are hearing about because of the potential that we might take action.”

A few minutes later, Kerry revised his account: This official-sounding “e-mail” was actually a Reuters news account about a former defense minister based on a claim by the Syrian opposition. “Reuters has now said the Syrian government is saying the defection has not taken place,” Kerry said. “So who knows whether it has or hasn’t?”

Who knows?

This is the problem with the case the Obama administration is making for attacking Syria.

Officials say the evidence is incontrovertible that Assad used sarin gas against his people. Lawmakers emerging from secret, classified briefings seem to agree. But while members of Congress are coming around to an attack on Syria, the American public remains skeptical. Why? Maybe it’s because the government won’t let them in on the secret.

The public heard about another “slam dunk” case a decade ago and, then as now, Democratic and Republican lawmakers agreed that the secret evidence was compelling. And it turned out to be wrong. Now, administration officials are telling Americans to trust their assurances that the secret evidence is convincing and that their war planning is solid. But they won’t provide details.

Estimates of collateral damage? “Lower than a certain number which I would rather share with you in a classified setting,” Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey told lawmakers.

Response of the Arab and Muslim countries? “This is something I’d be happier discussing in greater detail with you in the closed session,” Kerry said.

Safeguards to keep military action limited? “We can talk about that in a closed session,” Dempsey said.

How would Russia and other Syrian allies respond to a U.S. strike? “We all agree that that would be best handled in a classified session,” Kerry said.

No, we don’t all agree.

The administration’s case against Assad may well be airtight. Walter Pincus, The Post’s longtime intelligence correspondent, tells me he hasn’t heard the sort of doubts from the intelligence community that he heard during the run-up to the Iraq war. The problem is that the refusal to declassify evidence helps opponents such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin cast doubt on the intelligence. The administration is hiding behind the protection of “sources and methods,” but is any foe still unaware of the National Security Agency’s satellite and intercept capabilities?

Pincus argues for releasing the intercepts that describe the Syrian regime using the weapons and then ending the barrage, and the satellite imagery showing preparations for an attack and the firing of rockets from Assad-controlled territory. But instead of declassifying, administration officials are being ostentatious about their secrecy, as if protecting their club’s secret handshake.

“TOP SECRET/CLOSED,” said the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s notice for Wednesday’s hearing. “CLOSED,” said the Senate Armed Services Committee’s notice. In “open” testimony Tuesday and Wednesday, the officials encouraged lawmakers to save their questions for secret sessions.

Arming the Syrian opposition? That “would require a closed or classified hearing.” The broad effects of the military strike? “I would prefer to speak out in a classified setting.” Could Hezbollah have chemical weapons? “We need to talk about that in our classified session.” Would allies join an attack? It “would not be appropriate to speak about in an unclassified setting.” Could an attack make Assad use chemical weapons again? “I urge you to go to the classified briefing.”

At Wednesday’s hearing, Kerry said that “beyond a reasonable doubt, the evidence proves that the Assad regime prepared this attack.” He then dangled this: “In an appropriate setting, you will learn additional evidence which came to us even today.”

But isn’t it “appropriate” for the American public to see some hard evidence? During Tuesday’s Senate hearing, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) asked for the administration to “declassify a higher percentage of the information that we have so the American people and the international community can see it.”

Kerry said that the amount declassified is “unprecedented” and that what’s out there now is “sufficient.”

He may think so. But it’s not sufficient until the American public believes it.

Lindsey Graham says he will continue to try to block President Obama’s two nominees for high-level posts until he talks to survivors of the fatal Benghazi terror attacks.

Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he hopes there's a way to arrange interviews with five State Department employees so he can let the nominations move forward.

""All I want to do is talk to the survivors, protecting their security, protecting their identity, to find out exactly what did happen,” Graham told CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Graham said he would stall the nominations after a ""60 Minutes"" story in late October in which a former contractor at a British security company falsely claimed to be at the scene of the Benghazi assault.

CBS News admitted on Friday that it was wrong to trust a source, but Graham says his position remains unchanged.

The South Carolina lawmaker has been among the most outspoken Capitol Hill lawmakers regarding the September 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya.

Among his original concerns was whether the attacks were indeed sparked by outrage over an anti-Islamic video, as former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice and other administration officials originally said.

His pressure for answers eventually led to Rice withdrawing her name for consideration for the secretary of state job.

“Was it a protest? Was it an al Qaeda-inspired attack?” Graham asked again Sunday.

The two nominees are Janet Yellen for Federal Reserve chairman and Jeh Johnson for secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

""I want to perform oversight,” Graham told CNN. “I'm not trying to prosecute a crime. I'm not trying to defend the British contractor.""

The 2012 raid killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

Graham and others argue the Obama administration tried to mislead the American people in the heat of a presidential campaign by playing down a terrorist attack on Obama's watch. Republicans have accused the administration of stonewalling their investigations.

The State Department has told Graham that it was concerned about congressional interviews with the survivors of the attack because of Justice Department advice that the survivors could be witnesses in a criminal trial and any interviews outside the criminal justice process could jeopardize a case.

http://news.yahoo.com/from-benghazi-to-syria--obama%E2%80%99s-bush-league-mistakes-in-foreign-policy-190548055.html,,[],From Benghazi to Syria: Obama’s Bush-league mistakes in foreign policy,"By Walter Shapiro



Most second-term presidents become fixated on global affairs because the world beyond our shores, with all its strife and misery, often seems more malleable than life in Washington, with its fractious Congress and waning electoral mandate. The trick, though, for a foreign policy president, is to be good at it—and these days those skills appear to be eluding Barack Obama.



This week’s biggest rebuke to Obama foreign policy was not Wednesday’s House hearing on Benghazi with its wrenching narrative of the September night that Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in Libya. Nor was it Friday morning’s revelation of new Benghazi-related documents. More embarrassing was a front-page article in last Sunday’s New York Times detailing how Obama erred last August when he impetuously declared that Syria’s use of chemical weapons in its civil war would be a “red line.”



It’s a simple rule: Presidents should never make threats until they have worked out how they would enforce them. But Obama violated it with his stern but ill-considered warning to Syrian strongman Bashar Assad. The Times article quotes one anonymous top government official claiming, “What Obama said in August was unscripted” and “nuance got completely dropped.” Barry Pavel, a former national security adviser to Obama, said flatly, “I’m not convinced it was thought through.”



Current and former foreign policy advisers usually fall on their swords to protect a president’s reputation for sagacity. Only long afterward, when the “if only he had listened to me” memoirs are published, do we finally get a glimpse of what really happened in the White House. That’s why it’s telling that Obama insiders are already willing to trash the president for his all-bluster “red line” rhetoric.



The reason for the finger-pointing at Obama is that America is now caught in a loose-lips-create-slips dilemma. Without any good policy options available and a growing isolationist mood among voters, Obama must decide what to do in response to highly probable evidence that forces loyal to Assad used banned chemical weapons. Arming the rebels, many of whom are Islamic militants, carries its own risk, yet doing nothing makes America appear feckless and irresolute.



Playing for time, Obama has been reduced to linguistic hair-splitting. Asked at a Tuesday press conference about perceptions that Syria has crossed his supposed red line, Obama said lamely, “I don't make decisions based on ‘perceived.’ And I can't organize international coalitions around ‘perceived.’ We've tried that in the past, by the way, and it didn't work out well.”



That, of course, was a reference to George W. Bush and his fallacious weapons-of-mass-destruction pretext for the Iraq War. As a presidential candidate, Obama presented himself as the antithesis of this kind of shoot-first foreign policy impetuousness. But, as president, it’s startling how much Obama resembles Bush in many aspects of national security policy.



Take Guantanamo, where currently about 100 of the remaining detainees are waging a hunger strike. Asked at a recent press conference about the Bush-era Cuban detention camp that he has repeatedly vowed to close, Obama sounded more like an outside critic than a president: “It hurts us in terms of international standing. … It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed.”



Despite intermittant efforts by Obama since taking office, Congress has refused to allow the president to close Guantanamo. But that does not make Obama a helpless bystander with no control over this symbolic blot on America’s international reputation.



The president has refused to use his existing legal authority (using waivers from the Defense Department) to repatriate 86 low-risk detainees, mostly from Yemen, whose cases have been reviewed by American authorities. Some of these prisoners were rank-and-file al-Qaida soldiers back in 2001, and others were probably picked up by mistake. But today these detainees would be less of a threat sent back to their home countries then they are as enduring symbols of an American gulag on Guantanamo.



Then there are the drones. Bush may have initiated the airborne assassination program in 2004, but Obama has made it a hallmark of his response to terrorism. With his drone policy, Obama has embraced three of the worst aspects of Bush-era national security policy: an obsession with secrecy; a contorted view of legal norms, especially the definition of “imminent threat”; and a refusal to consider that American tactics may create more terrorists than they kill. In Pakistan alone, based on the best independent statistics, Obama has ordered six times as many drone strikes as ever Bush did.



The silence from most Democrats on these troubling aspects of Obama foreign policy has been dispiriting. Had Bush made toothless threats to Syria, force-fed prisoners in Guantanamo or rained death from the air in Pakistan on a weekly basis, liberals in Congress would be sputtering with outrage. Instead, with a few conspicuous exceptions—like Oregon Senator Ron Wyden on drones—the dominant feeling appears to be that if Obama does it, it has to be right.



Ever since George McGovern lost 49 states to Richard Nixon in 1972, Democrats have cowered in terror at the thought of being branded as soft on national security. This may partly explain Obama’s timorousness on Guantanamo and the president’s embrace of drone strikes as a way of being tough against terrorists without risking American casualties.



The Republican obsession with Benghazi is rooted in the belief that the Obama administration was reluctant to label the 2012 Libyan attacks as “terrorism” because that would undermine the president’s narrative in an election year. Wednesday’s hearing—built around the testimony of three mid-level State Department officials—failed to prove anything close to causation. On Friday morning, however, ABC News reported that the State Department had insisted references to prior warnings on terrorism should be airbrushed out of the initial CIA talking points on the Banghazi attack.



This was the briefing document that U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, who drew the short straw as the administration’s TV talker, relied on when she made the rounds of Sunday-morning interviews the week of the attacks. Now, based on the ABC News story, it seems clear that Victoria Nuland, a career foreign service officer who was Hillary Clinton’s spokesperson at State, had insisted to the White House that these talking points be watered down.



Even now, so much about Benghazi remains murky, including how big a scandal it will actually prove to be. Were Nuland’s editing suggestions primarily designed to politically protect Obama and Clinton? Or was this, at its core, a Washington bureaucratic battle over which agency should be blamed for the deaths in Libya—State or the CIA?



Security was obviously lax in Benghazi. But was that because Stevens was a fearless diplomat who hated hunkering down behind concrete walls? Or was this related to the CIA’s still-mysterious role on the ground in Benghazi? And did the administration’s self-congratulatory belief in the Libyan revolution play a role in the relaxation of vigilence? Remember, Libya was Obama’s success story from the ""Arab spring""—the nation where a dictator was toppled by America boldly leading from behind.



Despite the documents discovered by ABC News, my guess is that the tragedy in Benghazi and its muddled aftermath had far more to do with human error than major-league conspiracy. In fact, given the way that Obama has handled his “red line” in Syria, the case for human error seems quite compelling."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/07/03/Egypt-Kerry-yacht,2013-07-03 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],'Deeply Concerned' Obama Searches for Egypt Strategy,"As the Egyptian military effectively declared a coup, overthrowing the elected government of repressive Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed Morsi, the Obama administration struggled to come up with a coherent strategy to deal with the situation.

President Obama released a statement on Morsi’s ouster, suggesting that his administration “does not support particular individuals or political parties, but we are committed to the democratic process and respect for the law.” With those principles in mind, Obama declared himself “deeply concerned” and called for a transition to civilian rule. He refused to state whether the United States would withdraw aid to Egypt, saying only that he had directed a comprehensive review process.

Simultaneously, the State Department, which issued a mandatory evacuation order to non-essential personnel on Wednesday, said it would not take sides in the Egyptian situation. “We haven’t taken sides and don’t plan to take sides here,” said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.

In an embarrassing signifier of the level of chaos plaguing the administration, Secretary of State John Kerry called into the top level meetings from a secure phone. According to CBS producer Mosheh Oinounou, Kerry was on the “Isabel” on Wednesday afternoon. Oinounou said that when another CBS producer yelled “Morsi!” to Kerry, she received no response. Oinounou tweeted this photo:

Later, Oinounou reported that the State Department denies his claim that CBS reporters saw Kerry aboard his yacht; the State Department maintains that Kerry has been working on Egypt “all day.”

Whether Kerry was working all day or not on the strategy, it’s clear that confusion reigns at the highest levels. President Obama in Cairo in 2009 decried the “overthrow of a democratically-elected Iranian government” in the 1950s; when Honduras’ military ousted a would-be dictator, the Obama administration originally kicked back before caving. Now, it seems that the administration can’t label the military coup a military coup, and won’t label it a democratic movement.

President Obama isn’t even leading from behind at this point, simply because he can’t tell which direction is behind.

NOTE: This post has been edited to reflect the State Department’s denial of the original CBS report regarding Kerry’s presence on his yacht.

Blow'],"It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World - The New York Times","The truly anti-war-inclined, many of them true liberals, are so exhausted by our current and recent forays that they can’t even fathom another.

And they have real concerns. Would a United States military action be legal without a United Nations resolution? How do we ensure that dropping bombs won’t be tantamount to whacking the hornets’ nest, setting in motion painful repercussions that we cannot foresee? What to make of this Goldilocks bombing strategy of not-too-little, not-too-much but just enough? How is such a thing calibrated? And why bomb at all if we plan to leave Bashar Assad in power?

This genuine anti-war-in-Syria crowd finds itself in the odd company of the pro-war-on-Obama crowd. The latter will never be satisfied with anything this president does or how he does it. The president’s very presence irritates like a rock in a shoe.

For many of these folks, everything is a bargaining chip and all roads lead to Benghazi.

On Sunday, Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, said:

“One of the problems with all of this focus on Syria is it’s missing the ball from what we should be focused on, which is the grave threat from radical Islamic terrorism. I mean, just this week is the one-year anniversary of the attack on Benghazi.”

With Benghazi, Republicans are like a dog with a bone.

So into this crazy, mixed-up world of odd alliances steps the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, with a proposal — whether serious or not only time will tell — to defuse the situation by creating an even odder alliance: the Russians persuade the Syrians to declare and surrender their chemical weapons to international monitors in order to prevent American military action.

Under this new deal, we’d all be partners of a sort, working toward a common goal. And ironically, such a deal will most likely require boots on the ground in order to guard weapons inspectors and secure weapons, something that President Obama promised wouldn’t happen if Congress gave him authorization to bomb."

Conservative GOP members challenged Clinton on the lack of security at the diplomatic compound in Benghazi as well as the erroneous account that the attack grew spontaneously from a protest over an anti-Islam film produced in the United States.

At two hearings, which together totaled more than five hours, Clinton acknowledged a “systemic breakdown” cited by an independent review of issues leading up to the armed assault and said her department was taking additional steps to increase security at U.S. diplomatic facilities.

Clinton spent the better part of last September 11 trying to get a handle on security at several other U.S. embassies in the Middle East where anti-American protests were in full swing over an anti-Muslim film produced in the United States.

She said the U.S. embassy was “under assault” by crowds trying to scale the wall. American embassies in Yemen and Tunisia were also facing a “serious threat. Clinton personally called the president of Tunisia, she said, to “beg him to send reinforcements, which he did, to finally save our embassy.”

By 4 p.m. that day, Clinton was notified about the Benghazi attack. In the coming hours, she was in meetings and spoke with staff, the American Embassy in Tripoli and other U.S. officials.

Directing the U.S. response from the State Department, Clinton stayed in touch with officials across the administration and with the Libyan government.

She instructed her staff to “consider every option, to just break down the doors of the Libyan officials to get as much security support as we possibly could.”

Clinton said in the hours and days following the attack in Benghazi, there were “no delays in decision-making. No denials of support from Washington or from our military,” something an independent board established to review the matter cited in its report.

2. U.S. diplomatic posts in some 20 countries under threat

Clinton said threats to U.S. diplomatic posts are ongoing.

“Sitting here today, we probably have at least 20 other posts that are under a serious threat environment as I speak to you,” she told senators. “We operate in places where we know that our facilities are being surveilled for potential attacks where we have a steady Intel stream of plotting.”

Clinton detailed what the State Department has done to begin implementing the 29 recommendations of the Accountability Review Board to improve security at diplomatic posts in high-threat areas, in addition to a few of her own.

Opinion: Benghazi blame game is useless

Specifically, Clinton has appointed a team, led by her deputy, to focus on tightening security, sent joint teams of military special forces and diplomatic security threat analysts to more than a dozen high-risk posts and appointed a senior official to focus exclusively on those areas.

The State Department is also working to streamline requests for security so they make their way more quickly up the chain of leadership.

Despite the threat, Clinton stressed the importance of U.S. leadership and diplomatic presence in the Middle East.

“We’ve come a long way in the past four years, and we cannot afford to retreat now,” Clinton told senators. “When America is absent, especially from unstable environments, there are consequences. Extremism takes root, our interests suffer, our security at home is threatened.”

3. Clinton not shying away from a fight

Clinton grew emotional and held back tears when talking about U.S. personnel killed in the Benghazi attack.

“For me, this is not just a matter of policy, it’s personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews,” Clinton said as she choked back tears. “I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters, and the wives left alone to raise their children.”

But she lost patience with the focus of Republican senators on talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice on the next Sunday’s talk shows that focused on a protest at the U.S. post in Benghazi, which turned out not to have taken place.

Opinion: Rand Paul vs. Hillary Clinton, clash of titans

When Sen. Ron Johnson pressed Clinton on why the State Department didn’t call U.S. personnel who were evacuated from Benghazi to determine whether there was a protest, Clinton took him to task.

“With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,” Clinton reminded Johnson as she banged her hand on the table.

“Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they’d go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening,” she said.

4. Militants in Mali and Algeria have arms from Libya

Clinton warned the security situation in northern Mali, where international forces are battling militants, has been exacerbated by flow of weapons from neighboring Libya following the fall of Moammar Gadhafi.

She said there was “no doubt” such weapons were also used in an attack by militants on an Algerian natural gas plant last week.

She noted the aftermath of the Arab spring has changed power dynamics and stretched security forces across the region thin.

Calling the campaign struggle against the Islamic fighters a necessary response to “a very serious, ongoing threat,” Clinton said the “United States cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe-haven for Islamist rebels that could eventually pose a more direct threat to U.S. interests.”

Noting the increased strength of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the regional affiliate of the al Qaeda network fighting along side local Malians, Clinton warned that the United States must prepare for the possibility that groups like AQIM could threaten direct attacks on U.S. interests as they gain power.

“You can’t say because they haven’t done something they’re not going to do it,” Clinton said. “This is not only a terrorist syndicate, it is a criminal enterprise. So make no mistake about it, we’ve got to have a better strategy.”

5. Republicans still aren’t buying it

While their tone was generally respectful, several Republican senators made clear they were unsatisfied with Clinton’s answers.

Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, one of the administration’s toughest critics since the Benghazi attack, took Clinton to task for what he considered lackluster attention to the growing threat in Benghazi.

McCain wanted to know why Clinton hadn’t read a cable from Ambassador Christopher Stevens warning that the mission in Benghazi could not survive a sustained assault.

Sen. Rand Paul said it would have been an offense worthy of firing Clinton had he been president.

McCain also blasted Clinton’s answers to questions about the administration’s claim that a protest had taken place in Benghazi.

“The American people deserve to know answers, and they certainly don’t deserve false answers,” McCain told Clinton.

Clinton was more diplomatic with her old friend, saying she respected his strong feelings for the incident given his own relationship with Stevens, but that they disagreed about what happened and when it happened with respect to explaining events.

In addition to lessons the State Department learned about improving security at diplomatic posts, Clinton, who called the Benghazi attack an act of terrorism since Day One, suggested the administration might learn another lesson.

“Just withhold. Don’t say what you don’t know for sure until it’s finally decided.”

Syria 'expert' Elizabeth O'Bagy

During last week’s Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on possible military strikes against Syria, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) read from an “important op-ed by Dr. Elizabeth O’Bagy,” whom he described as a “Syria analyst at the Institute for the Study of War.” That group fired O'Bagy Wednesday after learning she had falsely claimed she holds a Ph.D.

One of the people advocating war in Syria, occasionally quoted by certain pro-Syria War kossacks, is Elizabeth O'Bagy. O'Bagy is your run-of-the-mill PNAF type. She writes op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. She's even been cited as a source by John McCain and John Kerry. She's a CNN and Fox News analyst. She's a junior member of the Washington neoconservative foreign policy establishment. If you've ever lived or done business in Washington, you've probably encountered people like her. If you could stand it.

She's the person who has been going around saying stuff like this:



O’Bagy wrote that “contrary to many media accounts, the war in Syria is not being waged entirely, or even predominantly, by dangerous Islamists and al Qaeda die-hards.” For McCain and Kerry, each advocating intervention, the op-ed served as a way to speak to concerns over the make-up of the forces fighting Syrian President Bashar Assad, and whether they're hostile to U.S. interests.

It's a patent falsehood. Even our own intelligence agencies say that the biggest and most effective ""rebels"" are various Saudi-financed jihadists and Al Qaeda. And that even the so-called ""moderates"" are anything but. Of course, she never disclosed that she was also political director for ... you guessed it, The Syrian Emergency Task Force which was the group that organized ... you guessed it ... John McCain's trip to Syria. The same trip that caused him to start beating the war drums for military intervention. The SETF is a bunch of Syrian-American yuppies looking to go take over the country ... as long as they don't have to do any of the fighting themselves.

And guess who finances the operation. Well, I'm still finding that out. But I suspect that when I explore the fact that the SETF's founder and executive director was a featured speaker at last year's Republican National Convention, I'm pretty sure what we have here is an Ahmed Chalabi-style get rich quick scheme being pushed by a bunch of Syrian-American elites and their neocon allies. After we've done all the dirty work in blood and treasure, they'll gladly come in as agents of ""democracy.""

How many times do we have to watch this movie, folks?

O'Bagy got fired for lying on her resume, claiming she had a PhD when she didn't. No doubt she's lying about, in John Kerry's words, her ""enormous experience in Syria"" as well. But that's just a small part of the story.

The bigger story here, for an enterprising reporter, is just who is behind the push to get America involved in the Syrian civil war. Who are the people operating behind the scenes, coddling and convincing important senators like McCain? Getting themselves and their allies speaking gigs in the media? Getting themselves quoted as foreign policy analysts? Getting meetings with important officials whom they've happened to have gone to Harvard with?

It is important to know because if we are going to be, yet again, duped into a stupid war by a bunch of well-connected elitists with their own secret agenda, then I'd like to know NOW rather than 10 years, 7,000 lives, 35,000 wounds, and $2 trillion later."

""The odds of dying in a terrorist attack are a lot lower than they are of dying in a car accident, unfortunately,"" Obama said when asked by Leno if it is still safe for Americans to travel abroad in light of recent heightened terrorist threats.

Obama denied that the U.S. has a domestic spying program but said the work done by the National Security Agency (NSA) is a “critical component” in keeping the country safe from outside threats.

""We don’t have a domestic spying program,” he said. “What we do have is some mechanisms that can track a phone number or an email address that is connected to a terrorist attack. That information is useful.""

However, Obama did acknowledge that recent accusations of the government spying on average Americans has “raised a lot of questions for people.”



In a lighter exchange, Obama was asked about his lunch meeting with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Obama did not get into the specifics of the meeting with his former campaign rival but joked about Clinton's ""glow"" since leaving government.

""We had a great time and she had that post-administration glow,"" Obama told Leno. ""When folks leave the White House, like two weeks later, they look great!""



Obama also had kind words for another former rival, John McCain.



When Leno asked Obama about his blossoming ""bromance"" with the Arizona Republican, Obama joked, ""That's how classic romantic comedies go."" He went on to say, ""He is a person of integrity. He is willing to say things, regardless of the politics ... It's probably not good for me to compliment him on television.""



Leno was also asked about former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who has recently received a one year asylum in Russia after leaking classified information about U.S. intelligence programs.

Story continues

""We don’t know exactly what he did, except what he said on the Internet and it's important for me not to judge,"" Obama said.

However, Obama did say that in light of the incident he has asked the White House staff to look at ways of reducing the number of contract employees employed by federal agencies.

As to Russia’s decision to grant Snowden temporary asylum, Obama said he did not think that, or the recent controversy surrounding Russia’s stance on gay rights would deter the U.S. from participating in next year’s Winter Olympic games in Sochi, Russia.

""I think Putin and Russia have a big stake in making sure the Olympics work,"" he said. ""I think they understand that for most of the countries that participate in the Olympics, we wouldn't tolerate gays and lesbians being treated differently,"" he said.

As 2013 ends, President Obama has lost credibility with many people who trusted him at the start of the year. Thanks to the Healthcare.gov debacle, polls find support for the president among women and independents has dropped to the lowest ebb of his presidency. Obama's words -- promising Americans they could keep their doctors under his health care plan -- didn’t match his deeds.

Surprisingly, the same thing is happening on the other side of the world among Arabs in the Middle East and for the same reason.

Too often, Obama’s speeches and actions don’t match.

""We are glad the Americans are here,"" said Ahmed al-Ibrahim, an adviser to some of Saudi Arabia's royals and officials, when I met with him recently, ""but we fear that the president has lost credibility after Syria.""

More On This...

[pullquote]

The Saudi official is referring to Obama’s “red line” vow of military action if the Syrian dictator Bashir Assad used chemical weapons against his own people. Assad did and Obama didn’t. Saudi officials were stunned.

Next came the revelation earlier this year that Obama was secretly negotiating with Iran, the mortal enemy of both Israel and Saudi Arabia. Officials in both nations have told me that they simply don't believe that the president can sweet-talk the mullahs out of the weapons they have coveted for years.

“The bond of trust between America and Saudi Arabia has been broken in the Obama years,"" al-Ibrahim said. ""We feel we have been stabbed in the back by Obama.""

""Every time that Obama had to choose between his enemies and his friends, he always chose his enemies,"" he said. ""We don't know what he's putting in his tea.""

Al-Ibrahim also pointed to Obama's “dangerous inaction” during violent Iran-backed uprisings in Bahrain, and now his negotiations with Iran, and his separate, secret negotiations with Iran's terrorist proxy Hezbollah. Since American officials cannot legally negotiate with terrorist groups and Hezbollah is a State Department-listed terror organization, the administration has been using British diplomats to carry messages to Hezbollah. The Obama administration reportedly favors a ""warm up to a direct relationship in the future"" with Hezbollah.

Obama is sending conflicting messages. In Washington, the president says negotiations are all we need to meet the Iranian threat. He issued a rare veto threat to try to halt tougher sanctions against Iran.

At the same time, in the Middle East, the president has dispatched more than 40 U.S. Navy vessels (including a carrier-strike group) and sent his secretary of defense to detail America's vast military assets in the region.

Speaking to Arab defense ministers, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel itemized America's military commitment to immediately respond to Iranian aggression:

• More than 35,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines in the theater;

• Even after exiting Iraq, the U.S. Army maintains more than 10,000 forward-deployed soldiers as well as tanks, artillery, and attack helicopters;

• America's most advanced fighter jets, including F-22s, are deployed less than an hour's flight time from Iran;

• American surveillance aircraft, ground listening stations, satellites, and sea patrols continue to scan for threats across the region;

• America's missile defense systems--on ground, sea, and air--remain on high alert. That includes the U.S. Navy's ballistic missile defense ships, Patriot missile batteries, and phased-array radars.

“The Department of Defense will work with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) on better integration of its members’ missile defense capabilities. The United States continues to believe that a multilateral framework is the best way to develop interoperable and integrated regional missile defense. Such defenses are the best way to deter and, if necessary, defeat coercion and aggression,"" Hagel told the Gulf News on Dec.18.

With little fanfare, Obama has also quietly lifted the ban on selling sensitive missile-defense technology to Saudi Arabia and other Arab allies living within reach of Iran's new Shahab-3 missiles. The Shahab-3's range is 1,242 miles--placing Israel and most of America's Arab allies within striking distance.

However, Obama's quiet efforts to provide new missile defenses and renewed security guarantees may be too little, too late.

The Saudis are now seeking their own military arrangements because they no longer trust the U.S. The GCC, a regional alliance of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, recently announced the creation of a joint military force based in the Saudi capital of Riyadh.

“There will be a unified command of around 100,000 members, God willing,” Prince Miteb bin Abdullah told reporters. This new force represents a massive expansion of the 30,000-strong Peninsula Shield force.

""We no longer believe that America alone can safeguard our freedom from Iranian aggression,"" said al-Ibrahim, ""that's why we are expanding our forces and integrating our missile defenses with our neighbors.""

He added, ""the world should understand that the GCC will not stay quiet and leave our member-states vulnerable to bad actors and bad deals in the region. It is our duty to protect our region.""

And now, astonished Saudi officials are contrasting Obama's quick actions last weekend in South Sudan with his unwillingness to act in places like Syria or in Bahrain where thousands of U.S. troops and the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet are based.

""The president has shown that he can take action when he chooses to. He chose not to act after the chemical weapons attacks in Syria, but as soon as things started to go wrong in South Sudan, Obama jumped on it,"" said al-Ibrahim.

On Saturday, Obama dispatched three CV-22 Osprey aircraft, the sort that can fly like an airplane and an helicopter, to South Sudan to evacuate Americans caught in ongoing violence in the city of Bor. The aircraft came under small arms fire and were forced to retreat as they attempted to land. Four U.S. service members were injured in the attempted evacuation. American citizens were rescued successfully on Sunday using civilian and U.N. helicopters.

In his June 4, 2009 Cairo speech, the first American president raised in a Muslim land came to offer a bold promise: ""I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world; one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect."" Four and a half years later, Arab leaders like al-Ibrahim say that ""mutual interest"" is sundered and ""mutual respect"" squandered.



If the Saudi exasperation sounds familiar, it is because it is the same tone you hear in Tel Aviv and in Washington."

The Obama administration appeared focused on the testimony, with senior officials at the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon responding through the day to Republican accusations of incompetence and cover-up in campaign war room style.

In the balance, in the view of both Democrats and Republicans, is not just the reputation of Mr. Obama but also potentially the prospects for the 2016 presidential election as well, since Mrs. Clinton, who stepped down in February, is the Democratic Party’s leading prospect. If the testimony did not fundamentally challenge the facts and timeline of the Benghazi attack and the administration’s response to it, it vividly illustrated the anxiety of top State Department officials about how the events would be publicly portrayed.

Mr. Hicks offered an unbecoming view of political supervision and intimidation inside the Obama administration. When Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, visited Libya after the attack, Mr. Hicks said his bosses told him not to talk to the congressman. When he did anyway, and a State Department lawyer was excluded from one meeting because he lacked the necessary security clearance, Mr. Hicks said he received an angry phone call from Mrs. Clinton’s chief of staff, Cheryl Mills.

“So this goes right to the person next to Secretary of State Clinton. Is that accurate?” asked Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio. Mr. Hicks responded, “Yes, sir.”

A State Department official said Mr. Hicks had been free to talk to Mr. Chaffetz, but that department policy required a department lawyer to be present during interviews for any Congressional investigation."

By Fareed Zakaria

Last March, President Barack Obama spoke about how Syria’s use of chemical weapons would be a “game-changer.” It has, except not quite in the sense that he meant. It has been an event that has confused and confounded the Obama administration. Whatever your views on the larger issues, it’s hard not to conclude that the administration’s handling of Syria over the last year has been a case study in how not to do foreign policy.

The president started out with an understanding that the Syrian conflict is a messy sectarian struggle that cannot be influenced easily by American military intervention. He was disciplined in resisting calls to jump into a cauldron. But from the start he confused and undermined this policy with loose rhetoric, perhaps egged on by some of his advisors and critics to ""do something.""

So he announced just over two years ago that President Bashar al-Assad of Syria had to go. Now a pundit can engage in grandiose speech. The president of the United States should make declarations like this only if he has some strategy to actually achieve them. He did not.

In truth, Obama – and many others – miscalculated. They believed that al-Assad’s regime was near the end, misreading both its strength and brutality, but also the level of support it has from several segments of Syria.

Then, just about a year ago, came the off-the-cuff remarks about a red line on chemical weapons, insufficiently thought through but now publicly stated and definitive. Since then, American foreign policy in Syria has largely been concerned about ensuring that Obama’s threat does not seem empty. It has been a complicated dance.

But what American national interest is being followed? The administration says it is upholding international law. Except, as Fred Kaplan pointed out in Slate this week, the institutions that embody international law and consensus – the United Nations and other international organizations – do not support this action. The United States plus France and Turkey cannot be considered the embodiment of international law and global public opinion.

More from GPS: Does public care about U.N. blessing?

The nature of the strike, we are told, will be short and symbolic – a shot across the bow. In the midst of a civil war in which both sides are in a high-stakes struggle for survival, does anyone think that this will make any difference?

And then, the strangest twist – an unplanned, last minute appeal to Congress, paving the way for further delay, weakening momentum, erasing what little surprise existed, and setting the stage for a potential defeat at home.

I don’t think that this strike, should it eventually take place, will be as damaging as its critics fear. The al-Assad regime will likely hunker down, take it, and move on. It will make little difference one way or the other. But the manner in which the Obama administration has first created and then mismanaged this crisis will, alas, cast a long shadow on America’s role in the world."

It's unclear whether the demands would slow down the administration, as it begins to build the public case for a military strike. One Defense official told Fox News that a U.S. strike is ""not a matter of if, but when.""

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney stressed Tuesday afternoon that the president has not yet decided to authorize the use of military force. But he made a legal argument for doing so, saying that the United States and 188 other nations are signatories to a chemical weapons convention opposing the use of such weapons, and that there must be a response to a clear violation of those terms.

While officials had indicated the intelligence documents implicating the Assad regime might be released as early as Tuesday, the administration has not yet made them public.

The quickly moving developments, in response to an alleged chemical weapons strike by the Assad regime last week, have lawmakers -- currently on summer recess -- clamoring for influence in a decision that has wide-ranging implications for both the Syrian civil war and the U.S. itself.

Republican Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia is asking colleagues to sign a letter to Obama that urges him to reconvene Congress and seek approval first for any military action.

Other lawmakers are stopping short of demanding a vote, but still want the administration to bring them into the process before moving ahead.

""I expect the Commander in Chief would consult with Congress in the days ahead as he considers the options available to him,"" Rep. Buck McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, R-Calif., said in a statement, while urging the administration to ""act decisively.""

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, on Tuesday urged the administration to submit a ""detailed plan"" on the objectives and cost of any strike.

After House Speaker John Boehner's office complained that the White House had not been in touch, a White House official reached out to Boehner Monday afternoon to discuss the Syria situation.

Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said the speaker, too, ""made clear that before any action is taken there must be meaningful consultation with members of Congress, as well as clearly defined objectives and a broader strategy to achieve stability.""

Likewise, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said: ""Absent an imminent threat to United States national security, the U.S. should not be engaged in military action without congressional approval.""

Secretary of State John Kerry has been reaching out to Congress on the sidelines.

Lawmakers, in urging the administration to consult with them, point in part to the War Powers Resolution of 1973. The resolution technically requires the president to seek congressional authorization when the military is sent into ""hostilities"" for anything but a retaliatory attack or formally declared war. But presidents have routinely flouted or found ways around that resolution -- the resolution, for instance, did not stop Obama from teaming up with Britain and France for airstrikes in Libya against Muammar Qaddafi's government.

The Obama administration seems to be waiting for top allies -- like Britain and France -- to get on board before advancing with any plans to attack Syria.

In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron has called back Parliament to debate and vote on a Syria plan on Thursday. And in France, President Francois Hollande on Tuesday said France ""is ready to punish"" those who gassed hundreds in Syria.

In Washington, some members of Congress have long been opposed to intervention in Syria. But a number of high-ranking officials are speaking out in favor of a limited strike. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., was the latest to say a multinational military action would be ""appropriate""

Polls over the past year have shown the public is far less interested in getting more deeply involved in Syria. A Fox News poll in July found only 11 percent of voters favored sending weapons to the opposition. Forty-four percent said the U.S. should get out of the conflict entirely.

His comments came after the disclosure that administration emails on talking points about the deadly attack showed that the original CIA document underwent several revisions, including one pushed by the State Department to delete a reference to warnings about the terrorist threat around the facility.

But the demand has gathered new backers this week since the emails appear to contradict initial claims by White House Spokesman Jay Carney that changes to the talking points in the days after the event were minor ones.

At least 139 House members are now backing a plan by Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) to name a special committee. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has so far resisted the appointment of a special panel, arguing that multiple committees already looking into the attack can handle the job.

The head of a panel of retired diplomats and ex-military officers, which investigated the attack, said Sunday that there was no reason to conduct another probe into what happened at Benghazi and the U.S. response in the hours and days that followed.

“I don’t see yet any reason why what we did at the accountability review board should be reopened,” said retired Ambassador Thomas Pickering on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

He noted that the panel had a narrow mandate to look at security arrangements at the facility. But he acknowledged that the panel had not questioned Clinton, who was still secretary of State, and other top State Department officials about their actions.

“We didn’t believe that was necessary, and I don’t see any reason to do so now,” he said.

Instead, he said, when they met with Clinton, they briefed her on their findings.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he has asked Pickering and retired Adm. Mike Mullen, who co-chaired the investigation, to answer questions after State Department officials criticized their review in hearings last week.

McCain said Clinton’s role was one issue still to be examined. “I think the secretary of State has played a role in this,” he said. “She had to have been in the loop some way, but we don’t know for sure.”

Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), also appearing on “This Week,” said there was “absolutely not” a coverup by the administration but acknowledged that the talking points became a “consensus document that avoided all of the difficult issues.”

The Obama administration appeared focused on the testimony, with senior officials at the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon responding through the day to Republican accusations of incompetence and cover-up in campaign war room style.

In the balance, in the view of both Democrats and Republicans, is not just the reputation of Mr. Obama but also potentially the prospects for the 2016 presidential election as well, since Mrs. Clinton, who stepped down in February, is the Democratic Party’s leading prospect. If the testimony did not fundamentally challenge the facts and timeline of the Benghazi attack and the administration’s response to it, it vividly illustrated the anxiety of top State Department officials about how the events would be publicly portrayed.

Mr. Hicks offered an unbecoming view of political supervision and intimidation inside the Obama administration. When Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, visited Libya after the attack, Mr. Hicks said his bosses told him not to talk to the congressman. When he did anyway, and a State Department lawyer was excluded from one meeting because he lacked the necessary security clearance, Mr. Hicks said he received an angry phone call from Mrs. Clinton’s chief of staff, Cheryl Mills.

“So this goes right to the person next to Secretary of State Clinton. Is that accurate?” asked Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio. Mr. Hicks responded, “Yes, sir.”

A State Department official said Mr. Hicks had been free to talk to Mr. Chaffetz, but that department policy required a department lawyer to be present during interviews for any Congressional investigation."

Our priority should continue to be saving American lives, not saving face.”

A clear theme of Mr. Obama’s remarks was that he believed that the public’s understanding of the surveillance programs had been distorted. He portrayed some of Mr. Snowden’s leaks as having been reported in “the most sensationalized manner possible” and parceled out to “maximize attention” in “dribs and in drabs, sometimes coming out sideways.” The result has been misimpressions not merely among the American public, he said, but around the world — a reference to the widespread international criticism of the United States over reports of its surveillance policies.

“If you are the ordinary person and you start seeing a bunch of headlines saying ‘U.S. Big Brother looking down on you, collecting telephone records, etc.,’ well, understandably people would be concerned,” he said, while also addressing some of his reassurances to those abroad.

“To others around the world, I want to make clear once again that America is not interested in spying on ordinary people,” he said. “Our intelligence is focused above all on finding the information that’s necessary to protect our people and, in many cases, protect our allies. It’s true we have significant capabilities. What’s also true is we show a restraint that many governments around the world don’t even think to do.”

In an effort to rebuild public trust, Mr. Obama said he wanted to work with Congress to modify the phone log program, but in what he said would be an “appropriate” way. He listed as examples of those steps establishing more oversight and auditing how the database is used.

The president also threw his support behind a proposal to change the procedures of the secret court that approves electronic spying under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, saying an adversarial lawyer should make arguments opposing the Justice Department when the court is considering whether to approve broad surveillance programs."

Howley connects the dots surrounding a number of recent leaks coming of out CBS News about the fate of its award-winning investigative reporter, Sharyl Attkisson.

From the beginning, Attkisson has been one of the few mainstream journalists willing to dig into the September 11 terror attack in Libya, and the Administration’s response to it. Fearing the story might lead exactly where it did yesterday with Jonathan Karl’s bombshell report, the mainstream media has poured most if its energy into wishing the story away or playing Palace Guard for the White House.

Attkisson’s dogged pursuit of the truth has not only pitted her against a media desperate to protect Obama, but also, apparently, against her bosses at CBS News, one of whom is the brother of a top Obama official.

Moreover, CBS News president David Rhoades is not only the brother of President Obama’s national security advisor, Ben Rhodes, but ABC News reports that Ben Rhodes was very much involved in the editing of the now-infamous CIA talking points.

So…

1. According to ABC News, Obama’s national security advisor Ben Rhodes was deeply involved in the editing of the CIA talking points.

2. These same CIA talking points are central to what many believe is a White House coverup.

3. Ben Rhodes is the brother of CBS News president David Rhodes.

4. At CBS News, Sharyl Attkisson is one of the only mainstream media journalists with the dogged determination and moral courage to demand the truth about the White House’s involvement in the CIA talking points.

5. For months now reports have surfaced that Attkisson’s bosses are unhappy with her, that she has trouble getting her Libya stories on the air, and that she’s being accused of engaging in “advocacy.”

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations may be President Obama’s next national security adviser.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations may be President Obama’s next national security adviser.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations may be President Obama’s next national security adviser.

Susan E. Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who lost out in a bruising bid for the job of secretary of state, may have the last laugh.

Rice has emerged as far and away the front-runner to succeed Thomas E. Donilon as President Obama’s national security adviser later this year, according to an administration official familiar with the president’s thinking. The job would place her at the nexus of foreign-policy decision making and allow her to rival the influence of Secretary of State John F. Kerry in shaping the president’s foreign policy.

The appointment would mark a dramatic twist of fortune for Rice, whose prospects to become the country’s top diplomat fizzled last year after a round of television appearances in which she provided what turned out to be a flawed account of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya.

That episode ignited a firestorm of criticism from Senate Republicans, who questioned her honesty and vowed to oppose her nomination and exposed misgivings from more liberal detractors who questioned whether her temperament, her family’s investments and her relations with African strongmen made her unfit to lead the State Department.

In plotting her political rehabilitation, Rice has kept whatever disappointment she may have felt in check, employing humor to blunt the indignity of the experience.

At the same time, her staff has sought to erect a more protective shield around her, moving to restrict access by mid-level foreign delegates suspected of leaking details about her more controversial positions and sometimes undiplomatic remarks in confidential deliberations at the United Nations.

Last month, Rice marked her reentry onto the national political stage with an appearance on Comedy Central’s “Daily Show” with Jon Stewart, a sympathetic host who denounced the “malevolence” of her Republican critics and urged her to respond with her trademark cussing. “What would you say to them?” he asked. “And feel free to talk like a sailor.”

In December, just days after she withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of state, Rice made a showing at the U.N. Correspondents Association annual ball, where she assured U.N.-based reporters and diplomats she was not disappointed to be sticking around the United Nations for a while longer. “There is no place in the world I’d rather be tonight,” she said. The punch line appeared on a screen behind her: a picture of the State Department.

Rice made light of reporting highlighting her support for controversial African leaders, including Rwandan President Paul Kagame, whose government stands accused of backing a brutal insurgency in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo: “I’m amazed by some of the work you do — absolutely incredible. Some of you have been able to uncover things about me that I didn’t even know about myself. Seriously, even I didn’t know that I once lost a human-heart-eating contest to Idi Amin.”

Rice, 48, has largely fallen below the media’s radar, but her standing within the Obama administration remains secure, according to White House officials and Democratic lawmakers. Her U.N. colleagues are betting she will ultimately serve as Obama’s national security adviser, probably sometime after the United States assumes the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council in July.

“I think that Susan always maintains close relations with the president and his national security team, and that continues to be the case,” said Ben J. Rhodes, the spokesman for the National Security Council. “If anything, the way she handled the Benghazi situation — and then the withdrawal — only enhanced her relations here, because she did so with grace and good humor.”

Democratic lawmakers said they believe the controversy over Benghazi has largely subsided. The post of national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation, giving the president wider scope to appoint whomever he wants.

“I think people have moved on with Benghazi as it relates to Susan Rice,” said Rep. Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.), the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “In the general course of events, it has not weakened her at all. I think the president has confidence in her, and she serves at the pleasure of the president.”

Several Republican lawmakers, including Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), who previously made clear their opposition to Rice as secretary of state, did not respond to requests for comment for this article. Other conservative critics suggested the stain of the Benghazi remarks — in which Rice suggested the attack appeared to have grown out of a “spontaneous” protest over an ­anti-Muslim video — endures.

“I suspect that Ambassador Rice will never recover from her performance on Benghazi,” said Danielle Pletka, vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. “Luckily she’s a young woman, and there will be future administrations. But in this one, I suspect she’s not going to go anywhere that requires confirmation.”

At the United Nations, Rice — who is set to become the longest-serving U.S. ambassador to the United Nations since Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., who served from 1953 to 1960 — has continued to plow ahead, overseeing U.S. efforts to negotiate two sanctions resolutions on North Korea.

If the battle has left scars, her colleagues say they have not shown.

“Absolutely, chin up, raring to go,” said Hardeep Singh Puri, India’s U.N. ambassador. “She’s been very circumspect. The fact that something went wrong on this Benghazi matter is neither here nor there. The fact is that she is meant for big things.”

Diplomats say Rice’s bruising experience has not made her any softer, particularly in the case of a string of recent leaks.

After the disclosure of her opposition to sanctions against Rwanda, the United States lodged a complaint with France over suspicions of leaking and informed French officials that lower-level experts would not be allowed into meetings with Rice, according to Security Council diplomats. Her office also instructed the United Nations to restrict attendance to closed-door consultations of the Security Council after a leak detailing Rice’s support for a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali.

Rice declined to be interviewed for this article. Her spokeswoman, Erin Pelton, said: “Under Ambassador Rice, the United States negotiates privately and in good faith with our Security Council colleagues. We don’t leak the contents of often sensitive meetings because we don’t want to undermine the integrity and effectiveness of the negotiations.”

One council diplomat, describing Rice’s recent scrapes with other diplomats, said she remains “combative.” Rice herself is all too aware of such characterizations.

“People have called me brusque, aggressive, abrasive,” she joked at the U.N. correspondents ball. “Of course, they don’t say that to my face, because they know I’d kick their butts.”"

The system works by encouraging government workers to rat out any coworkers they suspect of being potentially inclined to blow the whistle before any leaks are even attempted, with an eye toward rooting out potential ""threats"" and intimidating rank-and-file workers against even daring to risk revealing information about government crimes and abuses.

It wasn't supposed to be this way. President Obama ran his initial campaign on a pledge for transparency and a promise to enhance whistleblower protection, both of which have been scrapped. Instead, the administration now forwards the narrative that whistleblowers by their very nature are a threat to national security, and that all government actions that aren't explicitly publicized by the White House are secrets as a matter of course.

Government hostility to whistleblowers is nothing new, of course. Though the claims of grave danger stemming from making the public and ""the enemy"" (in many cases the two seem identical for the career bureaucrat) never pan out, whistleblowers have always faced threats both overt and covert, and attempted retaliation from all levels of government.

In the past the worst of this retaliation was extralegal -- President Nixon ordered a break-in at the psychiatrist of whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg in the hope of uncovering something to use against him. That's no longer the case, however, as in spite of laws like the Whistleblowers Protection Act (WPA) of 1989 the retaliation against recent whistleblowers has primarily focused on threats of huge prison sentences, and in an era of secret laws and secret courts, those threats have more force now than in the past.

The WPA, and efforts to enhance it like the No-FEAR Act, have at their core an exemption for ""national security,"" and in recent administrations the attempt to label anything and everything as a matter of national security has left them treating these laws as though they essentially don't exist.

That's where the Insider Threat program comes in. Detailed by McClatchy newspapers in recent weeks, the new scheme encourages all agencies of the federal government to come up with their own disparate anti-whistleblower rules, at the center of which will be a threat to punish anybody who even suspects a potential whistleblower and doesn't turn them in. The details of the initiative get more terrifying the deeper one delves into them, with the conclusion that recent divorcees and people with perceived money troubles have to be turned in, and will face preemptive action against them, likely ending their careers on mere suspicion that they couldn't be trusted, when the chips are down, to continue betraying the public trust in the name of secrecy.

With the ""national security"" exemption in the law, the administration may feel the initiative is secure, but the reality is that any efforts to use the exemption must pass muster in a court. Even in this security-mad era, no court is going to buy that the Department of Education or others implementing this program have real concerns that an internal whistleblower uncovering abuse is truly threatening the nation as a whole.

Though it may take quite some time to get fleshed out in court, it is plain that the administration's hostility to whistleblowers has gone from pathological to downright illegal, as the Insider Threat program is explicitly designed to discriminate against whistleblowers (or even would-be whistleblowers) in ways banned under federal law.

This level of hostility toward the public's right to know cannot be permitted, nor simply left for the courts to resolve. Congress should immediately push initiatives to bolster protections for whistleblowers to the extent that a sitting president can no longer threaten the entire class of government employees. From Peter Buxtun's revelation of the Tuskegee experiments of the 1960's to the wiretapping and torture revelations of today, whistleblowers have provided an essential check against government overreach and abuse. Now more than ever that's a check we need in place.

Negroponte, a former diplomat and director of national intelligence under George W. Bush. “Maybe if there are more prosecutions, it will.”

But critics argue that the Cartwright case, and now the appeals court ruling, show how the antileak campaign has gone too far, producing a chilling effect on news gathering without deterring leakers. Mr. Snowden has said he was inspired by the deeds of Pfc. Bradley Manning, who is facing a court-martial after divulging the diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.

“I think it has gotten away from them,” said Morton H. Halperin, who served in national security or diplomatic positions in three previous administrations. “If the president doesn’t fix this, I think his claim that he understands the importance of balancing the First Amendment against claims of national security will lack any credibility.”

Implicitly at least, Mr. Holder seemed to acknowledge some of the criticism this month when he restored and bolstered longstanding Justice Department restraints on seeking evidence from journalists. He said those restrictions “will help ensure the proper balance is struck when pursuing investigations into unauthorized disclosures.”

Mr. Holder’s move came in response to a torrent of criticism after the revelations this spring that prosecutors had secretly subpoenaed the phone logs for more than 20 phone lines of The Associated Press in one leak inquiry and two days of phone logs of a Fox News reporter, James Rosen, in another investigation aimed at a State Department adviser, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim. Prosecutors also obtained a court-ordered search warrant for Mr. Rosen’s e-mails by identifying him as a criminal co-conspirator of Mr. Kim’s.

But Mr. Holder’s conciliatory message was seemingly undermined by the Justice Department’s success in overturning a lower court’s ruling that a reporter for The New York Times, James Risen, had a First Amendment right to refuse to reveal his sources in the trial of a former C.I.A. analyst, Jeffrey Sterling. Mr. Sterling was charged in 2010 with disclosing classified information to Mr. Risen about a covert operation to deceive Iranian scientists described in Mr. Risen’s 2006 book, “State of War.”"

Um ... oops?

Let's all just savor this, shall we? The House Republicans release a scathing report blaming Hillary Clinton for something-something-Benghazi, because something-something-Benghazi is the newest Fox News conspiracy theory and there's really just nothing, and I mean nothing, that the Congress of the United States of America needs to spend their time on more than Fox News conspiracy theories. That's a given. Darrell Issa exists to investibate those theories. The entire House Oversight Committee has been turned into an episode of Scooby Doo where Obama or Hillary Clinton are behind literally every bad thing that happens in America, from solar companies going bust to children getting cavities.

The smoking gun in the new Republican report? That Hillary Clinton ""signed"" memos rejecting stepped-up security at the compound, thus proving that everything was all her fault, period, exclamation point, Ronald Reagan smiley face. There's only one little problem with that: Clinton did not ""sign"" the letter. Darrell Issa and the rest of the Crack House Investigative Team of Superheroes got confused on a basic fact of how the State Department works, and not one of them bothered to actually freaking check, just once, with the State Department as to their top-notch theory of things:



[By tradition], every cable from an embassy bears the “signature” of the ambassador — and every cable from Washington bears the “signature” of the secretary of state. The protocol is explained in the State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual: […] Because of this protocol, “Secretary Clinton ‘signed’ hundreds of thousands of cables during her tenure as secretary,” said State Department spokesman Patrick H. Ventrell. “As then-Secretary Clinton testified, the security cables related to Benghazi did not come to her attention. These cables were reviewed at the assistant secretary level.”

“The allegations in your staff report are false, extremely irresponsible, and lack even a rudimentary understanding of how State Department cables are processed,” Cummings wrote in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). […] “Although a telephone call could have clarified this issue in a matter of moments, you chose not to check with the Department before making these highly inflammatory and erroneous accusations in a public forum.”

Yep. The entire House Republican ""investigative"" team didn't know that, and they didn't check, and/or they didn't listen to Every Damn State Department Employee Who Could Tell Them That. Or, as Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings puts it Has there ever been a Congress more incompetent than this one? I don't mean partisan, or mean, or ineffective—I mean stone-cold incompetent. This is the sort of thing that really should require a public pie in the face for all involved, and the House Republican caucus is just goddamn stupid enough that we could probably get that required public pie-ing passed as actual bill, providing we bury it in some language about continued oil subsidies or free guns to American toddlers."

So does that of Sean Smith, Glenn Doherty and Tyrone Woods who, along with Stevens, were murdered at the hands of Al Qaeda-linked terrorists in a siege of the U. S consulate in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012.

Despite President Obama’s pledge to “hunt down” the Islamic jihadists who slaughtered those four brave Americans in cold blood, to date, not one suspect has been killed or apprehended.

This despite the fact that one of the main suspects in the attack, Ahmed Khattala, has granted lengthy interviews to the New York Times, CNN and several other American news outlets and saunters around the streets of Libya in plain sight even today, almost daring the Obama administration to come get him.

[pullquote]

More On This... The Obama Doctrine has officially collapsed — Putin is now in charge

Khattala has good reason to feel safe. Over the course of the past year, Obama administration officials have gone from falsely blaming the Benghazi assault on an obscure YouTube video about Mohammed (current National Security Advisor Susan Rice) to whining “what difference does it make” (former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton) to, finally, throwing their hands in the air and dismissing Benghazi altogether as just another GOP-driven “phony scandal” (President Obama himself).

Yes, Ahmed Khattala must be quaking in his sandals.

The multiple lies, cover-ups and brazen disinterest on the part of the Obama administration in seeking justice for Stevens and his colleagues comprise one of the most shameful episodes in the history of American foreign policy. Perhaps the most maddening aspect of the Benghazi siege—again, a premeditated terror attack by an Al Qaeda linked outfit on a U.S. consulate that left four Americans dead—is that we’ll likely never get some of the more crucial questions surrounding it answered.

Just where was President Obama as the entire seven-hour-plus ordeal was unfolding?

Whose idea was it to concoct the YouTube clip lie and parade Rice in front of a national television audience to trumpet it five days after the attack?

Why did the CIA reportedly have dozens of personnel on the ground in Benghazi the night of the attack?

Why is the Obama administration going to such great lengths to suppress any testimony about Benghazi?

Virginia Congressman Frank Wolf, for one, has charged that the administration may have been supplying weapons gathered in Libya to Syrian rebels and is seeking to cover its tracks. That would help explain the CIA assets on the ground in Benghazi.

Wolf’s theory makes a lot of sense, given the fondness the Obama White House has shown for supporting Islamist revolutionaries everywhere from Egypt to, ironically enough, Libya.

This decision to back—even arm—radical Islamists is a stunning turn of events.

Today, on September 11, 2013, one year after the Benghazi attack and just twelve years removed from 9/11, the U.S. government is throwing its weight behind forces—whether Al-Qaeda types in Syria or Muslim Brotherhooders in Egypt and elsewhere—that share the exact same totalitarian, anti-American ideology as the jihadists who brought down the Twin Towers.

Which begs the question: what exactly do we have to show for twelve years of American blood and treasure expended in the War on Terror?

President Obama’s willfully misleading claims during the 2012 campaign season that Al Qaeda was “on the run” and “nearing defeat” notwithstanding, AQ and its allies and affiliates now cover more geographical ground than they did on 9/11: from Pakistan and Iraq to Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, North Africa, Sinai, Nigeria, Algeria, Europe and beyond.

Likewise, Al Qaeda’s ideology has inspired a generation of young followers in the West, resulting in the kind of terror and mayhem we saw unleashed by the Tsarnaev brothers in Boston last April.

At the same time, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, Iran, continues its march towards nuclear weapons and along with its jihadist proxy, Hezbollah, is establishing a presence throughout Latin America, at our very doorstep.

In addition, while the Muslim Brotherhood may be down in Egypt right now, it is anything but out. The world’s first modern Islamist terrorist organization has affiliates in some 70 countries worldwide and remains wildly influential, including among Muslim communities here in the United States.

From closing down U.S. embassies en masse last month, to farming out its Syria policy to Putin’s Russia, to propping up the Morsi dictatorship in Egypt and throwing Israel under the bus at every turn, the Obama administration has projected stunning weakness, uncertainty and ignorance and overseen a series of foreign policy disasters that have whittled down America’s influence in the Middle East to almost nil.

And thanks to the Benghazi debacle, our enemies now believe that American blood comes cheap."

Alejandro Mayorkas, director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, was named by Homeland Security's Inspector General's Office as a target in an investigation involving the foreign investor program run by USCIS, according to an email sent to lawmakers late Monday.

The investigation was opened in September 2012 following a referral from an FBI counterintelligence analyst. The probe was first reported by The Associated Press.

The investigation into Mayorkas is based on allegations he helped secure U.S. visas for Chinese businessmen after they had been denied by his own agency’s officials. The visas had been sought by Gulf Coast Funds Management, a financing company headed by then-Secretary of State Clinton’s brother Anthony Rodham, according to an aide to GOP Sen. Charles Grassley, who had received internal USCIS emails about the matter from a department whistle-blower.

According to an email sent to lawmakers Monday, the IG's office said, ""At this point in our investigation, we do not have any findings of criminal misconduct."" The email did not specify any criminal allegations it might be investigating.

White House press secretary Jay Carney referred questions to the inspector general's office, which said that the probe is in its preliminary stage and that it doesn't comment on the specifics of investigations.

The program, known as EB-5, allows foreigners to get visas if they invest $500,000 to $1 million in projects or businesses that create jobs for U.S. citizens. The amount of the investment required depends on the type of project. Investors who are approved for the program can become legal permanent residents after two years and can later be eligible to become citizens.

If Mayorkas were confirmed as Homeland Security's deputy secretary, he probably would run the department until a permanent replacement was approved to take over for departing Secretary Janet Napolitano.

The email to lawmakers said the primary complaint against Mayorkas was that he helped a financing company run by Rodham to win approval for an investor visa, even after the application was denied and an appeal was rejected.

Mayorkas, a former U.S. attorney in California, previously came under criticism for his involvement in the commutation by President Bill Clinton of the prison sentence of the son of a Democratic Party donor.

Another of Hillary Clinton's brothers, Hugh Rodham, had been hired by the donor to lobby for the commutation. Mayorkas told lawmakers during his 2009 confirmation hearing that ""it was a mistake"" to talk to the White House about the request.

Hillary Clinton, who stepped down as secretary of state on Feb. 1, is considered a possible contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.

According to the Inspector General's email, the investigation of the investor visa program also includes allegations that other USCIS Office of General Counsel officials obstructed an audit of the visa program by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The email did not name any specific official from the general counsel's office.

The email says investigators did not know whether Mayorkas was aware of the investigation.

The FBI's Washington field office was told about the investigation in June after it inquired about Mayorkas as part of the White House background investigation for his nomination as deputy DHS secretary.

The FBI in Washington has been concerned about the investor visa program and the projects funded by foreign sources since at least March, according to emails obtained by The AP.

The bureau wanted details of all of the limited liability companies that had invested in the EB-5 visa program. Of particular concern, the FBI official wrote, was Chinese investment in projects, including the building of an FBI facility.

""Let's just say that we have a significant issue that my higher-ups are really concerned about and this may be addressed way above my pay grade,"" an official wrote in one email. The FBI official's name was redacted in that email.

Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent the FBI a lengthy letter Tuesday asking for details of its review of the foreign investor visa program and Chinese investment in U.S. infrastructure projects.

Chinese investment in infrastructure projects has long been a concern of the U.S. government. In September, the Obama administration blocked a Chinese company from owning four wind farm projects in northern Oregon that were near a Navy base used to fly unmanned drones and electronic-warfare planes on training missions. In October, the House Intelligence Committee warned that two leading Chinese technology firms, Huawei Technologies Ltd. and ZTE Corp., posed a major security threat to the U.S. Both firms have denied being influenced by the Chinese government.

The most routine users of the EB-5 program are Chinese investors.

According to an undated, unclassified State Department report about the program obtained by the AP, the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou, China, processed more investor visas in the 2011 fiscal year than any other consulate or embassy.

The document says ""applicants are usually coached and prepped for their interviews, making it difficult to take at face value applicants' claims"" about where their money comes from and whether they hold membership in the Chinese Communist Party. Party membership would make an applicant ineligible for the investor visa.

Anthony Rodham is president and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management LLC in McLean, Va. The firm is one of hundreds of ""Regional Centers"" that pool investments from foreign nationals looking to invest in U.S. businesses or industries as part of the foreign investor visa program.

There was no immediate response to an email sent to Gulf Coast requesting comment.

It is unclear from the IG's email why the investor visa application was denied. Visa requests can be denied for a number of reasons, including a circumstance where an applicant has a criminal background or is considered a threat to national security or public safety.

He Joined The Network In September', 'Is Based Out Of Washington']","Clinton sought end-run around counterterrorism bureau on night of Benghazi attack, witness will say","On the night of Sept. 11, as the Obama administration scrambled to respond to the Benghazi terror attacks, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and a key aide effectively tried to cut the department's own counterterrorism bureau out of the chain of reporting and decision-making, according to a ""whistle-blower"" witness from that bureau who will soon testify to the charge before Congress, Fox News has learned.

That witness is Mark I. Thompson, a former Marine and now the deputy coordinator for operations in the agency’s counterterrorism bureau. Sources tell Fox News Thompson will level the allegation against Clinton during testimony on Wednesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif.

Fox News has also learned that another official from the counterterrorism bureau -- independently of Thompson -- voiced the same complaint about Clinton and Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy to trusted national security colleagues back in October.

Extremists linked to Al Qaeda stormed the U.S. Consulate and a nearby annex on Sept. 11, in a heavily armed and well-coordinated eight-hour assault that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three other Americans.

Thompson considers himself a whistle-blower whose account was suppressed by the official investigative panel that Clinton convened to review the episode, the Accountability Review Board (ARB). Thompson's lawyer, Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney, has further alleged that his client has been subjected to threats and intimidation by as-yet-unnamed superiors at State, in advance of his cooperation with Congress.

Sources close to the congressional investigation who have been briefed on what Thompson will testify tell Fox News the veteran counterterrorism official concluded on Sept. 11 that Clinton and Kennedy tried to cut the counterterrorism bureau out of the loop as they and other Obama administration officials weighed how to respond to -- and characterize -- the Benghazi attacks.

""You should have seen what (Clinton) tried to do to us that night,"" the second official in State's counterterrorism bureau told colleagues back in October. Those comments would appear to be corroborated by Thompson's forthcoming testimony.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called the counterterrorism officials' allegation ""100 percent false."" A spokesman for Clinton said tersely that the charge is not true.

Daniel Benjamin, who ran the department's Counterterrorism Bureau at the time, also put out a statement Monday morning strongly denying the charges.

""I ran the bureau then, and I can say now with certainty, as the former Coordinator for Counterterrorism, that this charge is simply untrue,"" he said. ""Though I was out of the country on official travel at the time of the attack, I was in frequent contact with the Department. At no time did I feel that the Bureau was in any way being left out of deliberations that it should have been part of.""

He went on to call his bureau a ""central participant in the interagency discussion about the longer-term response to Benghazi."" He said ""at no time was the Bureau sidelined or otherwise kept from carrying out its tasks.""

Thompson's attorney, diGenova, would not comment for this article.

Documents from the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council, first published in the May 13 edition of ""The Weekly Standard,"" showed that senior officials from those agencies decided within days of the attacks to delete all references to Al Qaeda's known involvement in them from ""talking points"" being prepared for those administration officers being sent out to discuss the attacks publicly.

Those talking points -- and indeed, the statements of all senior Obama administration officials who commented publicly on Benghazi during the early days after the attacks -- sought instead to depict the Americans' deaths as the result of a spontaneous protest that went awry. The administration later acknowledged that there had been no such protest, as evidence mounted that Al Qaeda-linked terrorists had participated in the attacks. The latter conclusion had figured prominently in the earliest CIA drafts of the talking points, but was stricken by an ad hoc group of senior officials controlling the drafting process. Among those involved in prodding the deletions, the documents published by ""The Weekly Standard"" show, was State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, who wrote at one point that the revisions were not sufficient to satisfy ""my building's leadership.""

The allegations of the two counterterrorism officials stand to return the former secretary of state to the center of the Benghazi story. Widely regarded as a leading potential candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, Clinton has insisted she was not privy to decisions made by underlings about the inadequate security for the U.S. installations in Benghazi that were made in the run-up to the attacks. And she has portrayed her role -- once the attacks became known in Washington -- as that of a determined fact-finder who worked with colleagues to fashion the best possible response to the crisis.

Clinton testified about Benghazi for the first and only time in January of this year, shortly before leaving office. She had long delayed her testimony, at first because she cited the need for the ARB to complete its report, and then because she suffered a series of untimely health problems that included a stomach virus, a concussion sustained during a fall at home, and a blood clot near her brain, from which she has since recovered. However, Clinton was never interviewed by the ARB she convened.

Fox News disclosed last week that the conduct of the ARB is itself now under review by the State Department's Office of Inspector General. A department spokesman said the OIG probe is examining all prior ARBs, not just the one established after Benghazi.

The two U.S. officials -- former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and former Ambassador Tom Pickering -- who oversaw the internal review of the attacks defended their report.

""From the beginning of the ARB process, we had unfettered access to everyone and everything including all the documentation we needed. Our marching orders were to get to the bottom of what happened, and that's what we did,"" they said in a statement Monday.

The counterterrorism officials, however, concluded that Clinton and Kennedy were immediately wary of the attacks being portrayed as acts of terrorism, and accordingly worked to prevent the counterterrorism bureau from having a role in the department's early decision-making relating to them.

Also appearing before the oversight committee on Wednesday will be Gregory N. Hicks, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya at the time of the Benghazi terrorist attacks. Like Thompson, Hicks is a career State Department official who considers himself a Benghazi whistle-blower. His attorney, Victoria Toensing, a former chief counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee, has charged that Hicks, too, has faced threats of reprisal from unnamed superiors at State. (Toensing and diGenova, who are representing their respective clients pro bono, are married.)

Portions of the forthcoming testimony of Hicks -- who was one of the last people to speak to Stevens, and who upon the ambassador's death became the senior U.S. diplomat in Libya -- were made public by Rep. Issa during an appearance on the CBS News program ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.

Hicks told the committee that he and his colleagues on the ground in Libya that night knew instantly that Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and that he was astonished that no one drafting the administration's talking points consulted with him before finalizing them, or before U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice delivered them on the Sunday talk shows of Sept. 16.

Hicks was interviewed by the ARB but Thompson was not, sources close to the committee's investigation tell Fox News."

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/22/obama-independent-spying-review-team-is-closely-tied-to-white-house/,2013-09-22 00:00:00,[],Obama's independent spying review team is closely tied to White House,"Stung by public unease about new details of spying by the National Security Agency, President Barack Obama selected a panel of advisers he described as independent experts to scrutinize the NSA's surveillance programs to be sure they weren't violating civil liberties and to restore Americans' trust.

But with just weeks remaining before its first deadline to report back to the White House, the review panel has effectively been operating as an arm of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the NSA and all other U.S. spy efforts.

The panel's advisers work in offices on loan from the DNI. Interview requests and press statements from the review panel are carefully coordinated through the DNI's press office. James Clapper, the intelligence director, exempted the panel from U.S. rules that require federal committees to conduct their business and their meetings in ways the public can observe. Its final report, when it's issued, will be submitted for White House approval before the public can read it.

Even the panel's official name suggests it's run by Clapper's office: ""Director of National Intelligence Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies.""

Its meetings in recent weeks with technology industry and privacy groups have been closed to the public even though no classified information was discussed, according to participants. Attendees told The Associated Press they raised concerns about the NSA's spying programs. During one session, two participants said, panel members said the group might hold a separate classified meeting soon with technology executives to discuss details of secret surveillance programs.

""No one can look at this group and say it's completely independent,"" said one attendee, Sascha Meinrath, director of the Open Technology Institute and vice president at the New America Foundation. Meinrath said the closed meetings ""leave the public out of the loop.""

Obama described the panel an Aug. 9 speech as an ""independent group"" and said its members would ""consider how we can maintain the trust of the people, how we can make sure that there absolutely is no abuse in terms of how these surveillance technologies are used.""

The formal White House memorandum days later -- effectively the legal charter for the group -- does not specify anything about its role being independent of the Obama administration. It directed the panel to emphasize in its review whether U.S. spying programs protect national security, advance foreign policy and are protected against the types of leaks that led to the national debate in the first place. The final consideration in the White House memo told the panel to examine ""our need to maintain the public trust."" There was no mention of the panel investigating surveillance abuses.

The review panel, in a statement released through the DNI's press office, confirmed to the AP that Clapper had exempted it from the U.S. Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires such committees to conduct open meetings and notify the public about their activities. It said Clapper made the decision because of the ""highly classified nature of their review,"" but added: ""We are conducting this review as openly and transparently as possible."" In private meetings so far, several attendees said their discussions did not mention any classified activities and that the panel members steered them away from doing so.

Four of the five review panel members previously worked for Democratic administrations: Peter Swire, former Office of Management and Budget privacy director under President Bill Clinton; Michael Morell, Obama's former deputy CIA director; Richard Clarke, former counterterrorism coordinator under Clinton and later for President George W. Bush; and Cass Sunstein, Obama's former regulatory czar. A fifth panel member, Geoffrey Stone of the University of Chicago, leads a university committee looking to build Obama's presidential library in Chicago and was an informal adviser to Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.

Stone wrote in a July op-ed that the NSA surveillance program that collects the phone records of every American every day is constitutional.

""We would have liked a more diverse group,"" said Michelle Richardson, an ACLU legislative counsel who attended one meeting for civil liberties groups.

The review panel overlaps with a similar effort by a second advisory group. In July, Obama asked the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to report on the NSA programs and their effects on civil liberties. While PCLOB's work is expected to take months and has no deadline, Obama ordered the review group to report interim findings within 60 days and provide a final report by Dec. 15.

'PCLOB chairman David Medine said recently that his group's purview was different because it was not subject to review by the White House. PCLOB's hearings so far have been conducted in public, although the group has been given classified briefings by national security officials.

""We're proceeding regardless of other groups' timelines,"" Medine said.

A spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, Caitlin Hayden, said the review group and civil liberties board have separate mandates. She said the review panel is looking at spy programs authorized under the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the USA Patriot Act, and references to the NSA collecting phone-records and obtaining copies of Internet messages from U.S. technology companies. The civil liberties board, however, is focusing on the same surveillance programs, according to a June 2013 Congressional authorization letter.

Obama has said in recent comments that he might be open to setting up public advocates who could oppose government lawyers at secret federal surveillance court proceedings -- similar to a proposal by Swire in 2004. But the administration has otherwise backed the surveillance programs as essential for national security.

Participants in one session held for the technology industry included lawyers and other figures from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook and Apple -- firms that reportedly have worked with the NSA in surveillance operations. No phone company executives attended, participants said. Technology executives pressed for more authority to tell computer users their private data is not being abused by the government, said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.

Neither session, according to participants, gave any hint of changes under consideration.

""Any time someone brought up what was at the heart of these issues,"" Meinrath said, ""we were told to put that into record on the website, or else we were told it was classified."""

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Holder Jr. after articles in The New York Times described an ambitious series of cyberattacks under the code name Olympic Games that were intended to slow Iran’s progress toward a nuclear bomb. That General Cartwright is a focus of the leak inquiry was first reported by NBC News.

Detecting and preventing Stasi agents from penetrating the security of U.S. diplomatic facilities in West Germany was a 24-7 undertaking.

The East German secret police were even more ruthless and relentless in operations against their own citizens. Political suppression in that communist state was total. There was no room for dissent. Thousands of East Germans were arbitrarily imprisoned for “internal security” reasons.

So it was especially galling to learn upon returning to the states in 1969 that the FBI had a counterintelligence program, known as COINTELPRO, that was, in some ways, as pernicious as the threat we were working against overseas.

Senate hearings in the 1970s revealed that the FBI, under the guise of protecting national security, had treated rights guaranteed by the First Amendment as little more than a collection of antiquated wishes best ignored.

With its surveillance of citizens, infiltration of civil rights groups and disruption of legal activities, the FBI’s counterintelligence program echoed the behavior of East Germany’s Stasi. The FBI acknowledges on its Web site that “COINTELPRO was later rightfully criticized by Congress and the American people for abridging first amendment rights and for other reasons.”

Fortunately, Congress reined in the FBI, placing it behind, and not beyond, the Constitution.

Where are we now?

The revelations that the Justice Department had secretly seized journalists’ phone records and that the Internal Revenue Service had targeted conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status show that government’s heavy hand has not been lifted. Are these examples of COINTELPRO revisited?

Not quite, though they are disturbing.

Governments spend millions to prevent secrets from falling into enemy hands. A Justice Department probe into a compromised Middle East intelligence operation last year was not focused on the surreptitious work of a foreign power. The unlawful disclosure came from within.

The Justice Department sought to discover who in the U.S. government allegedly told the Associated Press about a failed al-Qaeda plot in Yemen.

The compromised Yemeni operation differs from some breakdowns in national security for its cause. Chalk up that serious breach to hubris: the leaker’s puerile chest-thumping about having bested a sworn enemy or, worse, a self-serving desire to burnish the Obama administration’s credentials as an al-Qaeda slayer.

Ann Telnaes animation: John Boehner’s selective accountability (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

In this regard, the administration has only itself to blame.

On top of the mistakes made by a U.S. official leaking the nation’s secrets, the administration compounded things by launching a dragnet for the records of calls received and made from 20 phone lines (including office, home and cell numbers) of the AP journalists in five area codes and three states.

Talk about power running amok.

Meanwhile, back in the bureaucracy, Internal Revenue Service workers were having a high old time putting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status through hoops. IRS employees were instructed to be on the “lookout” for groups with “tea party” and “patriot” in their names, according to the report of the Treasury Department’s inspector general for tax administration.

The acting IRS commissioner has already been forced to walk the plank, and more heads may roll. The IRS has a steep hill to climb to gain the public’s trust. But there is one bright spot: This misbehavior was detected and exposed by government self-policing. Of course, the selective screening never should have occurred. But the inspector general system created to ferret out government fraud, waste and abuse worked in this case.

The Justice Department, meanwhile, is in an even deeper hole.

Who can take seriously the department’s mission, as stated by its Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties, “to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the American people”?

Famed First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams told the Daily Beast this week that the Justice Department’s broad seizure of journalists’ phone records was “certainly one of the most intense intrusions by the government into a pressroom that I can remember.”

“Why couldn’t they put this issue before a judge?” Abrams asked. “What they have done is foreclose any meaningful response by the AP. This isn’t just seeking a record of one journalist for one day. This is breaking and entering into the heart of the journalistic process of the Associated Press.”

Media outlets covering D.C. affairs should also be concerned. Journalists who draw on confidential sources while aggressively covering the city’s corruption scandal may now wonder if U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen is going after their phone records. After all, it was Machen’s office that served the subpoenas in the AP case.

COINTELPRO? No. Unchecked government power? Yes.

Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA), a sub-committee chairman on the House Appropriations Committee, issued a resolution for a House Select Committee to investigate issues surrounding the Benghazi Attack last November in the 112th Congress. He re-issued his resolution for the select committee when the 113th Congress began. The resolution currently has over 60 co-sponsors.

Only Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) can appoint a Select Committee and Boehner appears to mainly rely on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to investigate the Benghazi attack. However, any information that may be garnered from that committee will, as always, remain classified.

“As a retired Special Operations officer who spent most of my thirty-six years preparing for and executing rescue missions to save fellow Americans, I am deeply troubled by the events in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. The men and women who I served with lived by an ethos that pledged to never leave a fallen comrade and to make every effort to respond when a fellow American was threatened. I have seen men take great risks to save a fellow warrior. I have even seen men die trying to do so,” wrote General William G. ‘Jerry’ Boykin in a statement to Breitbart News.

Boykin added, “The lack of accountability regarding the Benghazi event disturbs me greatly and bears the earmarks of a cover up. America is entitled to a full accounting of this egregious attack on our people with some explanation as to why there was no effort to save the Americans in the US Embassy annex and the CIA station, or at least to recover their bodies before they fell into Libyan hands. Our Congress has yet to fulfill its responsibility to provide a complete analysis of the attack or to provide answers as to what exactly happened. A bi-partisan Special Committee is needed to determine the truth about Benghazi.”

Last month, Rep. Wolf, along with Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-PA), a House Ways and Means Committee member, sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry demanding more informatio n on State Department employees who survived the Benghazi attack. In his letter to Kerry, Wolf noted that sources say that as many as 30 survivors of the Benghazi attack were allegedly wounded. Seven of those thirty were said to be critical injuries. Sec. Kerry confirmed he visited an injured Benghazi survivor at Walter Reed.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, pointed to Kerry’s admission as a reason why he expects to speak with Benghazi survivors. “Now that Secretary Kerry has publicly, essentially a Senator, in a post way, has chosen to visit with them, any claim that they’re not available at this point to Congress is unsupportable. And I look forward to oversight by all committees,” Issa told Breitbart News.

Since Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) first told Breitbart News in December that the Obama administration had not been allowing him or any other member of Congress to see Benghazi survivors, more Republican members, including Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and John McCain (R-AZ) are calling for survivors to be allowed to testify at hearings on Capitol Hill without fear of legal or career repercussions.

Signers of the letter believe the House Select Committee should look into a number of issues, including the lack of military response to the events in Benghazi, if any non-military assistance was provided during the attack; the number U.S. personnel who were injured in Benghazi; the current locations of survivors; the names of the individuals in the White House Situation Room (WHSR) during the entire 8-hour period of the attacks and was a senior US military officer present.

“As veterans from all aspects of Special Operations, we have no doubt that there’s a lot more to what happened in Benghazi than President Obama and his Administration are letting on. From the very beginning, he has attempted to mislead and outright lied to the American people about why the attack on September 11th, 2012 happened, how it happened, and what our government did or did not do to save the lives of our patriots abroad,” former Navy SEAL Captain Larry Bailey wrote in a statement to Breitbart News.

The representatives from the retired military community want “a full accounting of the events of September 11, 2012,” adding that the, “American public be fully informed regarding this egregious terrorist attack on US diplomatic personnel and facilities. We owe that truth to the American people and the families of the fallen.”

Goldfarb', 'Deputy Business Editor']",Obama ‘frustrated’ by Russia’s decision to grant Snowden asylum,"Despite this, Obama confirmed he would attend the G-20 summit in St. Petersburg in September.

""There are times when they slip back into Cold War thinking and Cold War mentality,” Obama said on air Tuesday evening. “What I continually say to them and to President Putin, that’s the past.""

Obama last saw Putin at the G-8 summit earlier this summer in northern Ireland. The two leaders held a joint press conference, an experience that resulted in Putin ""not looking too excited."" said Obama.

Obama was interviewed by Leno during a stop in Los Angeles after the president attended a housing event in Phoenix Tuesday. He is set to travel to Camp Pendleton for a speech to troops Wednesday before returning to Washington.

He supported the NSA’s surveillance efforts, calling them a “critical component to counterterrorism"" even while he acknowledged they have ""raised a lot of questions for people.""

""We don’t have a domestic spying program,” Obama said. “What we do have is some mechanisms that can track a phone number or an e-mail address that is connected to a terrorist attack. That information is useful.""

Obama wouldn’t say what he would call Snowden – who has been labeled a hero and a traitor by different parties. The U.S. government has accused of him being a criminal.

""We don’t know exactly what he did, except what he said on the Internet and it's important for me not to judge,” Obama told Leno.

Obama said he asked his staff to look at ways to reduce the number of contractors in national security; Snowden worked for contractor Booz Allen Hamilton.

Obama defended recent decisions to shutter U.S. embassies in the Middle East and North Africa and to issue a global travel alert. Americans, he said, should still take vacation in a “prudent way” by reviewing State Department guidance on the Web.

""The odds of dying in a terrorist attack are a lot lower than they are of dying in a car accident, unfortunately,” Obama said. ""The general rule is just show some common sense and some caution.""

Earlier Tuesday aboard Air Force One, White House press secretary Jay Carney said that the president's appearance on the Tonight Show was meant to ""communicate with Americans where they are."" In contrast to the usual back-and-forth between the administration and more traditional press, Carney acknowledged that ""viewers of late-night shows are not necessarily the readers of newspapers or wire services, or necessarily viewers of cable or broadcast news shows."""
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/books/the-way-of-the-knife-by-mark-mazzetti.html,2013-04-25 00:00:00,['James Mann'],"‘The Way of the Knife,” by Mark Mazzetti","Some of these conflicts seem predictable and not particularly interesting. Yet Mr. Mazzetti effectively wades through the euphemisms and bureaucratic fog. When a Pentagon contractor sought to avoid infringing on the C.I.A.’s turf, he said that what he was doing was not spying or gathering intelligence, but rather collecting “atmospheric information.”

“The Way of the Knife” has some flaws. The narrative sometimes seems disjointed, because it occasionally bogs down in individual cases whose significance is unclear or in episodes that distract from the larger story.

For example, there’s Mr. Mazzetti’s superb handling — the best account yet — of the case of Raymond Davis, the burly American spy jailed by Pakistani officials after he killed two men on the streets of Lahore. The book deftly explains how this case marked a fundamental turning point in American relations with Pakistan by showing that country’s intelligence service the extent to which the C.I.A. was operating inside its borders without its permission or even its knowledge.

But then, by contrast, Mr. Mazzetti dwells unaccountably on a woman named Michele Ballarin, a Virginia socialite who dabbled in influencing American policy toward Somalia. At first glance, she seems an updated version of Joanne Herring, the Texas supporter of the anti-Soviet resistance in Afghanistan whose flamboyant character was played by Julia Roberts in “Charlie Wilson’s War.” But the book never makes clear Ms. Ballarin’s background or motivations, and the recurring accounts of her activities never seem to go anywhere.

Another defect in “The Way of the Knife” is that it sometimes transmits the tall tales, hype or braggadocio of the people Mr. Mazzetti interviewed. The book reports, in passing, that a C.I.A. official “penetrated the K.G.B. with dozens of highly placed moles in the 1970s,” although, based on cold war histories, that claim seems highly inflated even for the agency as a whole, much less an individual agent.

Similarly, another interviewee tells Mr. Mazzetti that “most of the C.I.A.’s informants in China were 80-year-old generals” although in the People’s Liberation Army these days, there are few if any generals over 80 and, I’d wager, few if any of these are working for American intelligence. These highly dubious claims come not from the author himself, but the people he interviewed — yet he might have showed some skepticism in reporting what they said.

Over all, though, Mr. Mazzetti’s book stands up as a portrait of the secret wars. Recent developments have served to underscore the point of the book. The President’s Intelligence Advisory Board warned last month that the C.I.A. has become too focused on drone strikes and paramilitary operations; it recommended a renewed focus on traditional spying and analysis in places like China.

“Many C.I.A. officers who joined the agency since Sept. 11, 2001, have experienced only man hunting and killing,” writes Mr. Mazzetti. Perhaps, one can hope, the C.I.A. will bring this era to a close."

(CNN) – Attorney General Eric Holder’s direct involvement in the decision to search a reporter’s e-mail records should bar him from leading a review of how the government investigates national security leaks, Republicans argued Sunday.

The decision to apply for a warrant to search Fox News reporter James Rosen’s private correspondence was vetted at the Justice Department's highest levels, including Holder, a Justice official said last week, although the later decision to issue the warrant was made by a federal magistrate judge.



The Obama administration's aggressive posture against leaks to reporters on national security matters has come under scrutiny as probes of Rosen and Associated Press reporters have come to light.

It prompted Obama to announce on Thursday that he has directed Holder to review federal guidelines for investigating leaks and reporters. That review will include assembling a panel of media representatives.

But Republicans argued Sunday that Holder was too entwined in the various leak investigations to objectively review his agency’s rules.

“You cannot investigate yourself, and I think it's a total conflict of interest,” said Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

MORE: News Corp long aware of Fox News subpoena

The investigation into Rosen centered on a 2009 leak of intelligence related to North Korea and the potential ramifications of imposing further sanctions on the country. Investigators searched Rosen’s phone records, e-mails, and security badge logs at the State Department in the course of their probe.

In a separate case, records from Associated Press reporters and editors were seized as the government attempted to find out who leaked classified information about a terrorist plot based in Yemen.

While employees of the AP were not cited as potential criminals, an FBI affidavit used to obtain the warrant for Rosen's e-mails described him as potentially being an ""aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator"" to the crime of disclosing government secrets.

A top State Department official was charged with leaking government secrets in the Rosen case, though formal charges were never filed against Rosen or Fox News.

The disclosure that government investigators have used journalists’ phone and e-mail records to try to ferret out leakers has led to an outcry from news organizations and civil liberties advocates. Speaking Thursday, Obama said he was “troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable.""

Earlier this month, the White House said it was asking Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, to reintroduce so-called “reporter shield” legislation that would put in place stricter standards for government seizure of media records.

The bill would switch the sensitive decisions on investigating journalists from the attorney general, who is currently empowered to issue subpoenas to news organizations, to a federal judge, who is independent of the executive branch.

Schumer said Sunday that he and Sen. Lindsey Graham have assembled a bipartisan group of eight senators to help push the measure forward.

“If we can set up these rules, I think we'll avoid the morass,” Schumer said on CBS. “You always need set rules and an independent arbiter. We have neither now.”

Graham, appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” said the recent Justice Department incidents are grounds for a special counsel, who he argued could more objectively review the government’s rules for investigating journalists.

“When classified information is leaked into the public that can put operations or American operatives in harm's way, we've got to find a way to pursue that. But this is clearly an overreach,” said Graham, R-South Carolina.

Even one Democrat said Holder’s impartiality was an open question. Sen. Dick Durbin, on “Fox News Sunday,” said he would “like to know if Holder has any conflict in here beyond what we've heard when it comes to the Fox case.”"

Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.).

McCaskill said Thursday at a Senate hearing that the investigation into USIS, whose original name was US Investigations Services, is based on the “systemic failure to adequately conduct investigations under its contract” with the federal government.

In a statement, USIS said it “has never been informed that it is under criminal investigation.” The company said it received a subpoena for records from OPM’s inspector general in January 2012 and fully cooperated with “the government’s civil investigative efforts.”

The company declined to confirm whether it had screened Snowden, saying the thousands of investigations it conducts for the government are confidential.

Snowden was working for another Virginia government contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, when he disclosed details of National Security Agency surveillance of U.S. citizens. The case has thrown a spotlight on the government’s reliance on contractors for sensitive tasks. In 2011, more than 4.2 million government and contract workers had security clearances, and more than a third of them had top-secret access.

McCaskill spokesman Drew Pusateri said McCaskill was told of the investigation by OPM’s inspector general.

Patrick McFarland, the inspector general for OPM, told the committee that there are concerns about USIS’s background check into Snowden. “Yes, we do believe that there — there may be some problems,” McFarland said at the hearing, according to the Reuters news agency.

According to its Web site, privately held USIS has 100 contracts to provide background checks for more than 95 federal agencies. The company was established in July 1996 “as a result of the privatization of the investigative branch of the Office of Personnel Management,” according to the Web site.

The company’s has more than 6,700 employees, and its clients include the departments of Justice, State, Homeland Security and Defense, plus about a dozen intelligence agencies, including the NSA and the National Reconnaissance Office. USIS is part of Altegrity, which is in turn owned by Providence Equity Partners."

Gosar on Napolitano Resignation: Eric Holder Should 'Follow Her Lead',"Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) said Friday that the resignation of President Barack Obama’s Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is not enough. He said Attorney General Eric Holder should step down too.

“One down and one to go,” Gosar said in a statement. “While Secretary Napolitano may be gone she will not be forgotten. Her inaction and incompetence on border security will continue to plague our nation for years to come.”

“‘See no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil’ is no way to govern and yet it is exactly how she and this administration operates,” he continued. “The American public deserve better.”

Gosar added that it is time for Holder to resign as well.

“What the American people need now is for Attorney General Eric Holder to follow her lead and resign,” Gosar said. “The American people have no confidence in him or his ability to do his job. My message to him would be: Better late than never. Today is a good day to go.”

Gosar has a resolution in the House calling for Holder’s resignation that a number of members of Congress have signed onto. During the previous session, 130 House members, eight U.S. Senators, and several governors from around the country called for Holder to resign over Operation Fast and Furious.

In Fast and Furious, the Obama administration’s Department of Justice and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed 2,000 weapons bought through straw purchases to fall into the hands of Mexican drug cartels. Holder remains in both criminal and civil contempt of Congress for his failure to cooperate with the congressional investigation into the scandal, which left hundreds of Mexican citizens and U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry dead.

President Obama has asserted executive privilege to continue concealing thousands of pages of documents related to the scandal from Congress.

Fast and Furious is hardly Holder’s only problem moving forward, especially as House Republicans draw closer to obtaining the documents uncovered via a federal court lawsuit. The Attorney General faces multiple scandals, particularly his decision to approve secret investigations into members of the news media. Holder reportedly met with President Obama on a forthcoming report on the DOJ’s activities in regards to that issue on Friday.

The Associated Press noted how Gosar’s harsh words for Napolitano contrast sharply with those of his fellow Arizona Republican, Sen. John McCain. McCain rushed to praise Napolitano for her work, saying she “served our nation with honor.”

Napolitano’s DHS released hundreds of illegal aliens from prisons earlier this year, citing the sequester as the reason."

Pollak'],Hidden Hagel 2008 Speech Surfaces: No Attack on Iran Even if Israel Threatened,"New footage of a speech by Chuck Hagel in 2008 has surfaced, in which the former Senator mocked the idea of continuing the U.S. policy of confronting Iran and supporting Israel. “When I hear the talk about–well you can’t talk with Iran, you can’t talk with Syria and we’re, we should stay where we are and support Israel, and so on, well you miss the point,” he told the laughing audience at an event for his book, America: Our Next Chapter.

Hagel added that the U.S. “shouldn’t even be thinking about the options of bombing Iran,” even in the event of a nuclear attack on Israel, and suggested Israel would be the first to attack Iran with a nuclear weapon.

Hagel told the Senate on Jan. 31 that he could not provide records or video for more than four of the “hundreds” of speeches he had given over the previous five years because they had not been transcribed or recorded:

We have given the committee every copy of every speech that I have that’s out there, every video that I have that’s out there. On paid speeches, most every one of those paid speeches–in the contract it says that they are private and not videotaped. That wasn’t my decision. That was the contract of the group I spoke to. I believe every paid speech I gave I didn’t have a prepared text. I gave it extemporaneously, which is something I’ve been doing for long before I left the Senate.

However, records and recordings of many of those speeches do exist, suggesting the administration either did not perform the due diligence necessary to comply with the Senate’s request, or that Hagel misled the Senate.

In the new footage, which was uploaded to YouTube and is apparently from a question-and-answer session after his formal remarks, Hagel fields a question about whether the U.S. would attack Iran to help defend Israel from an attack by Iran or one of its proxies that threatened Israel’s existence. He says that the U.S. should not attack Iran, and that the U.S. should “engage” Iran instead–even in those circumstances:

Q: [I]f Israel is attacked by Iran or an Iranian proxy like Hezbollah in a way that existentially threatens Israel, almost to the extent that Israel was attacked in ’73 and it’s existentially threatened, would you support an American airstrike using U.S. forces, B2s, whatever on Iran?” A: I’ll answer the question as honestly as I can. That’s a hypothetical question that somehow frames up the simplicity of the hypothetical question. The complications in the Middle East, and I’m certainly not an expert there, I have a chapter on the Middle East, I do know [laughter], I know a little something about the Middle East. I spent a lot of time there. And I spent a lot of time in Israel with the prime minister and others. You, who are well informed on this issue know the complexities starting with–go back to the Bible, go back to ancient times, thousands of years. I mean that, if you really want to start trying to understand the Middle East, Paul, or David Aaron Miller, who you may know, has a new book out on this, The Not So Promised Land, [sic]. And if you want to read something that is very, very enlightening, this guy, he’s getting tremendous reviews on it. He’s Jewish. He worked in the State Department , worked for Baker, worked for Albright, I think he’s worked for four Secretaries of State, different Democrats, Republicans. But it’s a great, great book. But your question, I mean the complication of what’s going on there, Hamas is already attacking Israel. Iran supports Hamas. Iran supports Hezbollah. What I would much rather see is this administration, or hopefully the next administration, engage Iran, engage Syria. When I hear the talk about–well you can’t talk with Iran, you can’t talk with Syria and we’re, we should stay where we are and support Israel, and so on, well you miss the point. Our policy has been so successful I believe, hasn’t it [laughter], that the Middle East is far better off today than it’s ever been, isn’t it? [Laughter.] I mean all those countries, Lebanon is in great shape, Gaza is in great shape, Israel is in good shape, Iran, Iraq, things have never looked better, because we won’t talk to anybody. We are not going to have peace, stability, security or anything that even hints of it in the Middle East until Iran and Syria and all the players are part of it. Now that doesn’t apologize for, or doesn’t close our eyes to what Iran has been doing, what Iran does do. But unless they are engaged in some way, then I don’t see this getting any better. And where this could go, where this could eventually go–somebody was asking me the other day about a nuclear exchange in the world, where that would come from? And I said, well, I’ll give you a scenario that’s very real. If Israel gets backed up enough into a corner, and Israel uses a tactical theater nuclear weapon–you want to talk about seeing some things unravel in the world. The United States shouldn’t even be thinking about the options of bombing Iran or anybody else. I mean, we got our hands full right now… [Applause]

E-mails reveal administration officials were behind the crafting of a false narrative on Benghazi

State Department was driving force behind revisions%2C analyst says

Lawmaker wants to know why truth didn%27t come out right away

Dozens of e-mails released by the White House reveal that Obama administration officials were behind the crafting of a false narrative about the attack in Benghazi, Libya. The communications raise questions about who called the shots and why, say an analyst and a lawmaker involved in the investigation.

According to the documents, officials at the State Department, CIA and White House national security staff heavily revised a CIA memo to remove all references to Islamist extremists known to have participated in the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya.

The revisions also removed the CIA's claims that the agency had issued repeated warnings to the State Department about the threat of al-Qaeda-linked militants in Benghazi.

Among the unknowns:

•Why were the revisions made?

•Why did Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton testify before Congress that the edits were a product of the intelligence community when State officials had made many of the requests for alterations?

•Why did the White House say it made no substantive edits when the e-mails show officials there helped lead the process for changes?

•Where did the story come from that the attack grew from a protest against an anti-Islam video? The video was mentioned once in 100 pages of e-mails, but it was a central theme of Obama's and Clinton's description of the event.

""It's widely accepted as fact now that what the White House was spewing was demonstrably false,"" says Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who is on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""I think there was clarity in the beginning, but it became obscured by fiction over the course of time.""

President Obama acknowledged during a news conference Thursday that ""there's been intense discussion in Congress lately about the attacks in Benghazi."" He said he is intent on doing everything in the government's power to prevent a similar tragedy, and he is increasing security and military presence at high risk diplomatic posts. Congress should ""come together"" to provide needed funding, he said.

The e-mails from Sept. 14-15 show that the State Department was ""the key driving force for the revisions,"" says Thomas Joscelyn, an analyst with the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy in Washington.

The White House has since acknowledged what the CIA stated from the beginning: The Benghazi attack was a planned terrorist attack.

Chaffetz says many more documents need to be released to explain why the truth didn't come out right away.

Major revisions to the CIA memo were requested by Victoria Nuland, then-spokeswoman for the State Department, who said changes were needed to ""resolve all my issues or those of my building leadership."" The e-mails do not state what leaders she referred to.

Protests to the video ""came to be the central focal point"" of the administration's explanation of how the attack happened, Chaffetz says, but no such protest happened outside the consulate.

Chaffetz says it's ""a mystery that only the White House can clarify.""

Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, used the final version of the CIA memo when she went on talk shows Sept. 16 and blamed the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others on the protests.

Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, ranking Democrat on the oversight committee, said the e-mails show that State Department and other administration officials altered the memo ""to protect the FBI's ongoing criminal investigation and our nation's intelligence operations.""

He accused Republicans of making ""reckless accusations"" that the White House scrubbed the talking points for political reasons.

Yet another question is why then-CIA chief David Petraeus, who expressed displeasure with the final talking points, did not act more forcefully to prevent the watered down version of his memo from being presented to lawmakers and the public.

""As CIA director, he has an ability to shape the narrative, and if he thinks the narrative is incorrect, he has a duty to speak up,"" Joscelyn said.

Though White House spokesman Jay Carney has insisted the White House made almost no changes to the original memo, the e-mails show that Tommy Vietor, then-spokesman for the White House's national security adviser, wanted State Department concerns about the memo to be addressed.

Members of Congress ""all think it was premeditated based on inaccurate assumptions or briefings. ... We need to brief members/press and correct the record,""Vietor wrote in an e-mail Sept. 14.

Nuland said in e-mails that the CIA memo's references to previous terrorist activity near the consulate and in the region could be construed by Congress as evidence that the State Department ignored the safety of its staff in Benghazi.

The CIA retorted in the e-mails that the FBI ""did not have major concerns"" with the memo's findings. Evidence for its conclusions that the attack was preplanned by an al-Qaeda-linked terrorist group came from the claims of terror group Ansar al-Sharia and witness accounts forwarded by the CIA station chief in Tripoli.

Even top State officials had acknowledged that fact before the process to edit it out began, Chaffetz said.

Chaffetz said one e-mail, which was sent the day after the attack by Beth Jones, State's acting assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, to several high ranking State Department officials, described how she corrected the Libyan ambassador to the United States for suggesting the Benghazi attack may have been perpetrated by loyalists to ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.

Jones wrote to her supervisors, Chaffetz says, that the al-Qaeda-linked Libyan group Ansar al-Sharia was behind the attack."

http://news.yahoo.com/spies-worry-over-doomsday-cache-stashed-ex-nsa-205827759--sector.html,,[],"Spies worry over ""doomsday"" cache stashed by ex-NSA contractor Snowden","By Mark Hosenball WASHINGTON (Reuters) - British and U.S. intelligence officials say they are worried about a ""doomsday"" cache of highly classified, heavily encrypted material they believe former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden has stored on a data cloud. The cache contains documents generated by the NSA and other agencies and includes names of U.S. and allied intelligence personnel, seven current and former U.S. officials and other sources briefed on the matter said. The data is protected with sophisticated encryption, and multiple passwords are needed to open it, said two of the sources, who like the others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. The passwords are in the possession of at least three different people and are valid for only a brief time window each day, they said. The identities of persons who might have the passwords are unknown. Spokespeople for both NSA and the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. One source described the cache of still unpublished material as Snowden's ""insurance policy"" against arrest or physical harm. U.S. officials and other sources said only a small proportion of the classified material Snowden downloaded during stints as a contract systems administrator for NSA has been made public. Some Obama Administration officials have said privately that Snowden downloaded enough material to fuel two more years of news stories. ""The worst is yet to come,"" said one former U.S. official who follows the investigation closely. Snowden, who is believed to have downloaded between 50,000 and 200,000 classified NSA and British government documents, is living in Russia under temporary asylum, where he fled after traveling to Hong Kong. He has been charged in the United States under the Espionage Act. Cryptome, a website which started publishing leaked secret documents years before the group WikiLeaks or Snowden surfaced, estimated that the total number of Snowden documents made public so far is over 500. Given Snowden's presence in Moscow, and the low likelihood that he will return to the United States anytime soon, U.S. and British authorities say they are focused more on dealing with the consequences of the material he has released than trying to apprehend him. It is unclear whether U.S. or allied intelligence agencies - or those of adversary services such as Russia's and China's - know where the material is stored and, if so, have tried to unlock it. One former senior U.S. official said that the Chinese and Russians have cryptographers skilled enough to open the cache if they find it. Snowden's revelations of government secrets have brought to light extensive and previously unknown surveillance of phone, email and social media communications by the NSA and allied agencies. That has sparked several diplomatic rows between Washington and its allies, along with civil liberties debates in Europe, the United States and elsewhere. Among the material which Snowden acquired from classified government computer servers, but which has not been published by media outlets known to have had access to it, are documents containing names and resumes of employees working for NSA's British counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), sources familiar with the matter said. The sources said Snowden started downloading some of it from a classified GCHQ website, known as GC-Wiki, when he was employed by Dell and assigned to NSA in 2012. Snowden made a calculated decision to move from Dell Inc to another NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, because he would have wide-ranging access to NSA data at the latter firm, one source with knowledge of the matter said. ""EXTREME PRECAUTIONS"" Glenn Greenwald, who met with Snowden in Hong Kong and was among the first to report on the leaked documents for the Guardian newspaper, said the former NSA contractor had ""taken extreme precautions to make sure many different people around the world have these archives to insure the stories will inevitably be published."" ""If anything happens at all to Edward Snowden, he has arranged for them to get access to the full archives,"" Greenwald said in a June interview with the Daily Beast website. He added: ""I don't know for sure whether has more documents than the ones he has given me... I believe he does."" In an email exchange with Reuters, Greenwald, who has said he remains in contact with Snowden, affirmed his statements about Snowden's ""precautions"" but said he had nothing to add. Officials believe that the ""doomsday"" cache is stored and encrypted separately from any material that Snowden has provided to media outlets. Conservative British politicians, including Louise Mensch, a former member of parliament, have accused the Guardian, one of two media outlets to first publish stories based on Snowden's leaks, of ""trafficking of GCHQ agents' names abroad."" No names of British intelligence personnel have been published by any media outlet. After U.K. officials informed the Guardian it could face legal action, the newspaper disclosed it had destroyed computers containing Snowden material on GCHQ, but had provided copies of the data to the New York Times and the U.S. nonprofit group ProPublica. Sources familiar with unpublished material Snowden downloaded said it also contains information about the CIA - possibly including personnel names - as well as other U.S. spy agencies such as the National Reconnaissance Office and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which operate U.S. image-producing satellites and analyze their data. U.S. security officials have indicated in briefings they do not know what, if any, of the material is still in Snowden's personal possession. Snowden himself has been quoted as saying he took no such materials with him to Russia. (Editing by Warren Strobel and Tim Dobbyn)"

http://news.yahoo.com/defense-nominee-hagel-defends-record-senate-143219140--politics.html,,[],Defense nominee Hagel defends his record in Senate,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama's nominee for defense secretary on Thursday defended his views of the military and global threats in a combative confirmation hearing, pushing back against criticism of his past statements on Israel, Iran, Iraq and nuclear weapons. Chuck Hagel told senators that America ""must engage — not retreat — in the world,"" and insisted that his record is consistent on that point.

The former two-term Republican senator faced strong GOP resistance and was forced to explain past remarks and votes even as he appeared on a path to confirmation as Obama second-term defense secretary and the nation's 24th Pentagon chief.

His fiercest exchange came with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a fellow Vietnam veteran, onetime close friend and a potential vote that would carry considerable sway. Politics and Hagel's evolving opposition to the Iraq war caused a split between the two men that was on full display at the confirmation hearing.

McCain pressed Hagel on whether he was right or wrong about his opposition to the influx of 30,000 U.S. troops in Iraq in 2007. Hagel, who voted to authorize military force in Iraq, later opposed the conflict, comparing it to Vietnam and arguing that it shifted the focus from Afghanistan.

""Were you right? Were you correct in your assessment?"" McCain asked.

""I would defer to the judgment of history to sort that out,"" Hagel said as the two men talked over each other.

""The committee deserves your judgment as to whether you were right or wrong about the surge,"" McCain insisted.

Unable to elicit a simple answer, McCain said the record should show that Hagel refused to answer.

McCain made it clear that he would have the final word — with his vote, which he said would be influenced by Hagel's refusal to answer yes or no.

""I think history has already made a judgment about the surge, sir, and you're on the wrong side of it. And your refusal to answer whether you were right or wrong about it is going to have an impact on my judgment as to whether to vote for your confirmation or not,"" he said.

Story continues

Hagel was the lone witness in a jam-packed hearing room at a session that could be crucial in determining whether he will win Senate confirmation and join Obama's second-term national security team. He spoke out forcefully for a strong military while trying to explain 12 years of Senate votes and numerous statements.

""No one individual vote, no one individual quote or no one individual statement defines me, my beliefs, or my record,"" Hagel told the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""My overall worldview has never changed: that America has and must maintain the strongest military in the world; that we must lead the international community to confront threats and challenges together; and that we must use all tools of American power to protect our citizens and our interests.""

Hagel, 66, a decorated Vietnam combat veteran, would be the lone Republican in Obama's cabinet and the first enlisted man to become defense secretary, a point that Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., highlighted.

""It would be a positive message for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines in harm's way around the world to know that one of their own holds the highest office in the Department of Defense and that he has their backs,"" Levin said.

Two former committee chairmen — Democrat Sam Nunn and Republican John Warner — introduced the nominee.

""War for Chuck Hagel is not an abstraction,"" Nunn said.

Hagel has the announced backing of about a dozen Democrats and the tacit support of dozens more who are unlikely to embarrass the president by defeating his Cabinet pick. One Republican — Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi — has said he will vote for his former colleague.

Seven Republicans, including four members of the Armed Services panel, have said they will oppose Hagel's nomination. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., announced his opposition on Thursday, saying Hagel's views ""are too apart from what I believe to be the way forward for preserving America's proper role in the world.""

Democrats hold a 55-45 advantage in the Senate.

Republicans repeatedly questioned Hagel about a May 2012 study that he co-authored by the advocacy group Global Zero that called for an 80 percent reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons and elimination of all nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles.

The group argued that with the Cold War over, the United States needs no more than 900 total nuclear weapons. Currently, the U.S. and Russia have about 5,000 each, either deployed or in reserve. Both countries are on track to reduce the deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 by 2018, the number set in the New START treaty that the Senate ratified in December 2010.

Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., quoted from the report and expressed serious misgivings.

""Many of my colleagues are concerned you've changed your views. My concerns are that you haven't changed your views. You continue to hold extreme views, far to the left even of this administration,"" said Fischer.

In last year's Senate race, Hagel endorsed Fischer's Democratic rival, former Sen. Bob Kerrey, who also is a decorated Vietnam combat veteran.

Hagel insisted that the report was illustrative and said it wasn't realistic to consider unilateral reductions.

In an exchange with Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., Hagel sought to explain that his wartime experience in which he was wounded twice informed his decisions and votes.

""It does condition you,"" he said. ""I'm not shaped, framed, molded, consumed by that experience. Of course not. But it's part of me.""

Once the hearing was under way, the Republican National Committee put out a news release titled, ""Chuck Hagel is the Wrong Choice for Secretary of Defense,"" and contending that he would weaken the nation's military.

Responding specifically to attacks from outside GOP-leaning groups, Hagel repeated his regrets about using the term ""Jewish lobby"" to refer to pro-Israel groups. He said he should have used another term.

""I should have used another term and I'm sorry and I regret it,"" Hagel said. ""On the use of intimidation, I should have used 'influence,' I think would have been more appropriate.""

Hagel said he was committed to Obama's goal of ensuring that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon, and insisted that all options, including military force, are on the table.

""My policy is one of prevention, and not one of containment — and the president has made clear that is the policy of our government,"" Hagel said.

Under questioning, Hagel said he always supported multilateral sanctions against Iran, but acknowledged that he cast votes against unilateral sanctions on a case-by-case basis. He argued that in some cases, such as votes in 2001-2002, he was taking into account the concerns of Republican President George W. Bush.

He also countered with votes and letters against Iran and Hezbollah.

""There's a more complete record than just one or two or three or four"" votes, Hagel said, insisting that he has been on the record many times saying Hamas and Hezbollah are terrorist organizations and Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was harshly critical of Hagel for failing to sign letters to the European Union and the president in years past on designating Hezbollah a terrorist organization and backing Israel.

""The lack of signature by you runs chills up my spine,"" Graham complained."

During her Senate testimony, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that approximately 25 Americans who were on the ground or who witnessed the terrorist attack in Benghazi were immediately evacuated. Secretary Clinton also revealed that neither she, nor her senior people, debriefed or spoke with those people immediately after the attack, or for months afterward, to understand what happened. She stated that she didn't want to be later accused of playing politics.

When I questioned her about the misinformation disseminated for days by the administration, most notably by Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice on Sunday news programs five days after the attack, she asked, ""What difference does it make?""

If you don't expeditiously debrief the people who witnessed the attack, how can you understand who initiated it, what weapons they used and who may have been involved? How do you initiate a proper response if you don't know what transpired? How do you move properly to protect other American assets and people in the region? How do you know what failures occurred, so that you can immediately correct them, if you have not debriefed the very victims of those failures? And lastly, how do you tell the truth to the American people if you don't know the facts?

Our diplomatic forces in Benghazi were denied the security they repeatedly requested for many months before Sept. 11, 2012. Secretary Clinton stated that she was not told of those desperate requests in the most dangerous region in the world. As a result, our people in Benghazi were ill-prepared to repel or avoid that attack, and four Americans were murdered. For many days after the event, the American people were also misinformed as to the nature and perpetrators of that attack.

In truth, Benghazi is a failure of leadership — before, during and after the terrorist attack.

To answer Secretary Clinton, it does make a difference. It matters enormously for the American public to know whether or not their president and members of his administration are on top of a crisis and telling them the truth.

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee."

She Joined The Post In', 'Is Based In Washington']",Tech executives to Obama: NSA spying revelations are threatening business,"Leaders of the nation’s biggest technology firms warned President Obama during a lengthy meeting at the White House on Tuesday that National Security Agency spying programs are damaging their reputations and could harm the broader economy.

Cisco Systems has said it is seeing customers, especially overseas, back away from American-branded technology after documents revealed that the NSA enlisted tech firms and secretly tapped into their data hubs around the world as the agency pursued terrorism suspects. Companies such as IBM, AT&T and Verizon Communications are facing angry shareholders, some of whom have filed lawsuits demanding that the companies disclose their participation in NSA intelligence programs.

The companies also pressed the need for transparency and for limits on surveillance to restore the credibility of the U.S. government. They wanted an explanation of what the NSA was doing overseas to collect their data and to be able to talk about it, said industry and U.S. officials briefed on the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss it freely.

“Most companies” in the room pressed this point, “and they did so loudly,” said one U.S. official.

Obama said that he heard their message and that the White House would consider the group’s views as it completed a review of NSA surveillance programs.

Silicon Valley has been a critical driver of the economic recovery and has long represented the face of American ingenuity around the world. Many of these companies say they are still trying to assess the damage caused by Edward Snowden’s leak of NSA documents showing their work with intelligence officials.

But some shareholders say Silicon Valley has been slow to recognize the reputational crisis that is developing around the world for these companies. “Verizon and AT&T are not managing this crisis effectively,” said Jonas Kron, director of shareholder advocacy at Trillium, an investment advisory firm. “Now is the time for these companies to demonstrate that they will protect user privacy.”

The morning meeting at the White House, held in the Roosevelt Room, took on added import given a federal judge’s ruling Monday that the NSA’s counterterrorism program to collect Americans’ phone records appears to be unconstitutional. That, along with the outcry from Silicon Valley and civil liberties advocates, some of whom belong to Obama’s party, is increasing pressure on the administration to curb NSA surveillance efforts.

The gathering was scheduled for two hours but went well over the allotted time, with the majority of the discussion focused on the companies’ demands for changes to NSA spying programs, according to tech industry officials.

Several of the executives came to the meeting particularly angered over a Washington Post report in late October that revealed the NSA and its British counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, were gaining access to the data connections that link Google and Yahoo servers around the world, industry officials said.

Their message was to say: “What the hell are you doing? Are you really hacking into the infrastructure of American companies overseas? The same American companies that cooperate with your lawful orders and spend a lot of money to comply with them to facilitate your intelligence collection?” said one industry official familiar with the companies’ views.

The NSA has stressed that its overseas collection is carried out lawfully, under executive authority. Any data on Americans are handled according to rules that protect their privacy, including the requirement to obtain a warrant to target an American’s communications, officials say.

In the meeting, the executives reiterated a list of demands that had been sent to the White House in a letter last week calling on the administration to cease bulk data collection of e-mails, online address books and other personal information; to impose limits on how easily the NSA can obtain court orders for Internet data; and to allow the companies to be more transparent about government intelligence requests.

Several participants acknowledged that the White House had to balance the companies’ business concerns against national security considerations.

Senior administration officials described the meeting with the 15 executives as “constructive, not at all contentious.”

“This was an opportunity for the President to hear from CEOs directly as we near completion of our review of signals intelligence programs, building on the feedback we’ve received from the private sector in recent weeks and months,” the White House said in a statement.

One participant suggested the president pardon Snowden. Obama said he could not do so, said one industry official. White House officials have said that Snowden is accused of leaking classified information and faces felony charges in the United States, and that he should be returned as soon as possible to the United States, “where he will be accorded full due process and protections.”

Senior executives from AT&T, Yahoo, Apple, Netflix, Twitter, Google, Microsoft and Facebook were among those in attendance.

“We appreciated the opportunity to share directly with the President our principles on government surveillance that we released last week and we urged him to move aggressively on reform,” the technology firms said in a joint statement after the meeting.

Many of these firms have played a key role in boosting Obama’s political fortunes. Tech companies pumped nearly $7.8 million into his campaign in the last cycle, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Some of the top officials meeting with the president Tuesday served as bundlers for his 2012 bid. Yahoo’s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, raised between $100,000 and $200,000, according to the center, and Shervin Pish­evar, co-founder of the Sherpa technology investment fund, raised more than $500,000. Mark Pincus, Zynga’s chief product officer and chairman, gave $1 million to Priorities Action USA, the super PAC that supported Obama.

Still, some of these executives, as well as their shareholders, are fretting about the ­bottom-line impact of the NSA intelligence programs.

In Cisco’s earnings report last month, executives explained that disappointing sales in emerging markets were partly tied to the NSA leaks, which may have “caused a number of customers to pause and reevaluate,” Cisco’s head of sales, Robert Lloyd, said at the time.

Last week, IBM shareholders sued the company in a New York federal court, saying that it harmed investors with its secret participation in NSA programs.

“IBM’s association with the NSA presented a material risk to the company’s sales and, in particular . . . sales in China that were of critical importance to investors,” the Louisiana Sheriffs’ Pension and Relief Fund said in its lawsuit. “Despite that knowledge . . . IBM misrepresented to investors that it was a market leader in the Asia-Pacific region and that IBM expected solid improvement in the sales of its hardware division.”

Last month, shareholders of Verizon and AT&T demanded that the companies disclose their participation in NSA intelligence programs.

The $160.7 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund filed a resolution with AT&T’s board to make public its participation in government intelligence programs. The pension fund argued that customers can too easily switch to another wireless carrier amid concerns that AT&T is sharing telephone data and other information with the government.

The meeting at the White House was the second time top Silicon Valley and telecommunications leaders have convened with Obama since Snowden began to release portions of a trove of top-secret documents detailing NSA spying programs.

Obama tried to keep the tenor friendly, even cracking jokes, an industry official said.

At one point, he asked Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings if he brought advanced copies of the second season of “House of Cards,” a satire-drama of Washington politics, according to a pool report of the meeting.

Hastings laughed and invited Obama to do a cameo appearance on the show. Obama said of the ruthless lead character, a congressman played by Kevin Spacey, “This guy’s getting a lot of stuff done.”

“I wish things were that ruthlessly efficient,” Obama said, to laughter from all the tech executives.

Monday, in the wake of the NSA spying scandal, Cohen lashed out at his former employer as the “official network of the Obama White House.”

This isn’t exactly news to the most of us, but MSNBC’s water carrying for Obama’s massive surveillance state apparently woke Mr. Cohen up:

When it comes to issues of U.S. militarism and spying, the allegedly “progressive” MSNBC often seems closer to the “official network of the Obama White House” than anything resembling an independent channel. With a few exceptions (especially Chris Hayes [10]), MSNBC has usually reacted to expanded militarism and surveillance by downplaying the abuses or defending them.

Had McCain or Romney defeated Obama and implemented the exact same policies, treating whistleblowers like Manning and Snowden as foreign espionage agents, one would expect MSNBC hosts to be loudly denouncing the Republican abuses of authority.

Cohen then names names:

As Snowden arrived in Russia from Hong Kong, MSNBC host Ed Schultz blustered on [12] about Snowden as a “punk” and “coward.” …

MSNBC’s Melissa Harris-Perry has been condemning Snowden [14] by contrasting him with civil disobedients who “love their country” and submit to arrest – while Snowden just wants to “save his own skin [11].” …

MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow has also disappointed. After doing a typically thorough presentation on the force-down of President’s Morales’ plane, she ended her report [17] by expressing displeasure only that Washington had apparently gotten allies to go out on the limb “for nothing.”

For the most part, the left is perfectly okay with MSNBC being a branch of the Obama White House on every other issue. It is only on issues the left disagree with, like this spying business, that brings out the complaints.

MSNBC is at least being consistent.

Professional staff members at the National Security Agency and other U.S. intelligence agencies are angry, these officials say, believing the president has cast them adrift as he tries to distance himself from the disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that have strained ties with close allies.

The resistance emerged as the White House said it would curtail foreign intelligence collection in some cases and two senior U.S. senators called for investigations of the practice.

France, Germany, Italy, Mexico and Sweden have all publicly complained about the NSA surveillance operations, which reportedly captured private cellphone conversations by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, among other foreign leaders.

FOR THE RECORD:

U.S. spying: An article in the Oct. 29 front section about U.S. spying on foreign leaders misidentified Sen. John McCain as the ranking minority member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He is a member of the committee, but no longer the ranking member.



On Monday, as Spain joined the protest, the fallout also spread to Capitol Hill.

Until now, members of Congress have chiefly focused their attention on Snowden’s disclosures about the NSA’s collection of U.S. telephone and email records under secret court orders.

“With respect to NSA collection of intelligence on leaders of U.S. allies — including France, Spain, Mexico and Germany — let me state unequivocally: I am totally opposed,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee.

“Unless the United States is engaged in hostilities against a country or there is an emergency need for this type of surveillance, I do not believe the United States should be collecting phone calls or emails of friendly presidents and prime ministers,” she said in a statement.

Feinstein said the Intelligence Committee had not been told of “certain surveillance activities” for more than a decade, and she said she would initiate a major review of the NSA operation. She added that the White House had informed her that “collection on our allies will not continue,” although other officials said most U.S. surveillance overseas would not be affected.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), ranking minority member of the Armed Services Committee, said Congress should consider creating a special select committee to examine U.S. eavesdropping on foreign leaders.

“Obviously, we’re going to want to know exactly what the president knew and when he knew it,” McCain told reporters in Chicago. “We have always eavesdropped on people around the world. But the advance of technology has given us enormous capabilities, and I think you might make an argument that some of this capability has been very offensive both to us and to our allies.”

In Madrid, Spanish Foreign Ministry officials summoned the U.S. ambassador to object to the alleged NSA communications net in Spain. Citing documents leaked by Snowden, El Mundo, a major Spanish daily, said the U.S. spy agency had collected data on more than 60 million phone calls made in just 30 days, from early December 2012 to early January 2013.

Precisely how the surveillance is conducted is unclear. But if a foreign leader is targeted for eavesdropping, the relevant U.S. ambassador and the National Security Council staffer at the White House who deals with the country are given regular reports, said two former senior intelligence officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in discussing classified information.

Obama may not have been specifically briefed on NSA operations targeting a foreign leader’s cellphone or email communications, one of the officials said. “But certainly the National Security Council and senior people across the intelligence community knew exactly what was going on, and to suggest otherwise is ridiculous.”

If U.S. spying on key foreign leaders was news to the White House, current and former officials said, then White House officials have not been reading their briefing books.

Some U.S. intelligence officials said they were being blamed by the White House for conducting surveillance that was authorized under the law and utilized at the White House.

“People are furious,” said a senior intelligence official who would not be identified discussing classified information. “This is officially the White House cutting off the intelligence community.”

Any decision to spy on friendly foreign leaders is made with input from the State Department, which considers the political risk, the official said. Any useful intelligence is then given to the president’s counter-terrorism advisor, Lisa Monaco, among other White House officials.

Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said Monday that Obama had ordered a review of surveillance capabilities, including those affecting America’s closest foreign partners and allies.

“Our review is looking across the board at our intelligence gathering to ensure that as we gather intelligence, we are properly accounting for both the security of our citizens and our allies and the privacy concerns shared by Americans and citizens around the world,” Carney said.

Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said the review would examine “whether we have the appropriate posture when it comes to heads of state, how we coordinate with our closest allies and partners, and what further guiding principles or constraints might be appropriate for our efforts.”

She said the review should be completed this year.

Citing documents from Snowden, the German news magazine Der Spiegel reported last week that the NSA’s Special Collection Service had monitored Merkel’s cellphone since 2002. Obama subsequently called Merkel and told her he was not aware her phone had been hacked, U.S. officials said.

Intelligence officials also disputed a Wall Street Journal article Monday that said the White House had learned only this summer — during a review of surveillance operations that might be exposed by Snowden — about an NSA program to monitor communications of 35 world leaders. Since then, officials said, several of the eavesdropping operations have been stopped because of political sensitivities.

Chief,"WASHINGTON — President Obama’s nomination on Monday of John O. Brennan as director of the Central Intelligence Agency puts one of his closest and most powerful aides in charge of an agency that has been transformed by more than a decade of secret wars.

Working closely with the president, Mr. Brennan oversaw the escalation of drone strikes in Pakistan in 2010 and was the principal architect of the administration’s secret counterterrorism operations in Yemen. He became a prominent public spokesman for the administration, appearing on television after foiled terrorist plots and giving speeches about the legality and morality of targeted killing.

The question that now faces Mr. Brennan, if he is confirmed by the Senate, is whether the C.I.A. should remain at the center of secret American paramilitary operations — most notably drone strikes — or rebuild its traditional espionage capabilities, which intelligence veterans say have atrophied during years of terrorist manhunts.

Four years ago, Mr. Brennan bowed out of consideration as Mr. Obama’s C.I.A. director in the face of claims from some human rights advocates that he had approved — or at least failed to stop — its use of brutal interrogation methods. He denied the accusations and ended up with a consolation prize, a job as the president’s counterterrorism adviser that most assumed would have offered a much lower profile."

The NSA spying scandal goes deep%2C and the only upside is that it will distract from other scandals.

Sooner or later%2C power granted tends to become power abused.

Most Americans generally think that politicians are untrustworthy.

""How ironic is that? We wanted a president that listens to all Americans -- now we have one."" That was Jay Leno's take on the Obama administration's expanding NSA spying scandal, which has gone beyond Verizon phone records to include Google, Facebook, Yahoo and just about all the other major tech companies except, apparently, for Twitter.

The NSA spying scandal goes deep, and the Obama administration's only upside is that the furor over its poking into Americans' private business on a wholesale basis will distract people from the furor over the use of the IRS and other federal agencies to target political enemies -- and even donors to Republican causes -- and the furor over the Benghazi screwup and subsequent lies (scapegoated filmmaker Nakoula is still in jail), the furor over the ""Fast And Furious"" gunrunning scandal that left literally scores of Mexicans dead, the scandal over the DOJ's poking into phone records of journalists (and their parents), HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' shakedown of companies she regulates for ""donations"" to pay for ObamaCare implementation that Congress has refused to fund, the Pigford scandal where the Treasury Department's ""Judgment Fund"" appears to have been raided for political purposes -- well, it's getting to where you need a scorecard to keep up.

But, in fact, there's a common theme in all of these scandals: Abuse of power. And, what's more, that abuse-of-power theme is what makes the NSA snooping story bigger than it otherwise would be. It all comes down to trust.

The justification for giving the government a lot of snooping power hangs on two key arguments: That snooping will make us safer and that the snooping power won't be abused.

Has it made us safer? Anonymous government sources quoted in news reports say yes, but we know that all that snooping didn't catch the Tsarnaev brothers before they bombed the Boston Marathon -- even though they made extensive use of email and the Internet, and even though Russian security officials had warned us that they were a threat. The snooping didn't catch Major Nidal Hasan before he perpetrated the Fort Hood Massacre, though he should have been spotted easily enough. It didn't, apparently, warn us of the Benghazi attacks -- though perhaps it explains how administration flacks were able to find and scapegoat a YouTube filmmaker so quickly . But in terms of keeping us safe, the snooping doesn't look so great.

As for abuse, well, is it plausible to believe that a government that would abuse the powers of the IRS to attack political enemies, go after journalists who publish unflattering material or scapegoat a filmmaker in the hopes of providing political cover to an election-season claim that al-Qaeda was finished would have any qualms about misusing the massive power of government-run snooping and Big Data? What we've seen here is a pattern of abuse. There's little reason to think that pattern will change, absent a change of administration -- and, quite possibly, not even then. Sooner or later, power granted tends to become power abused. Then there's the risk that information gathered might leak, of course, as recent events demonstrate.

Most Americans generally think that politicians are untrustworthy. So why trust them with so much power? The evidence to date strongly suggests that they aren't worthy of it.

Obama quoted the Al Qaeda leader during his wide-ranging speech on counterterrorism policy last Thursday in Washington. As part of his argument in defense of the lethal drone program, Obama suggested bin Laden himself deemed the strikes to be effective.

""Don't take my word for it,"" Obama said. ""In the intelligence gathered at bin Laden's compound, we found that he wrote, 'We could lose the reserves to enemy's airstrikes. We cannot fight airstrikes with explosives.'""

It is without question that the strikes have killed key terror leaders, and have changed the way Al Qaeda and its affiliates operate. The bin Laden document Obama referenced said as much.

But the document -- one of several bin Laden writings published by West Point's Combating Terrorism Center -- showed bin Laden discussing how drones strikes have changed his organization's tactics, not necessarily how they have Al Qaeda on the run.

More On This...

The document, which refers repeatedly to the ""ummah,"" or Muslim population, says: ""The Ummah should put forward some, but enough, forces to fight America. The Ummah must keep some of its forces on reserve. This will be in the Ummah's best interests. The Ummah will use the reserve in the future, but during the appropriate time.

""In the meanwhile, we do not want to send the reserves to the front line, especially in areas where the enemy only uses airstrikes to attack our forces. So, the reserves will not, for the most part, be effective in such conflicts. Basically, we could lose the reserves to enemy's airstrikes. We cannot fight air strikes with explosives!""

The document goes on to say that ""we still have a powerful force which we can organize and prepare for deployment.""

Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, argued that bin Laden's full quote has a far different meaning than that conveyed by the excerpt Obama cited last week.

""When you look at the context of the whole statement, it doesn't support their story,"" he told FoxNews.com.

He acknowledged that the drones have killed senior terrorists, but said ""it's just more complicated than that.""

Joscelyn wrote in The Weekly Standard: ""The full quote actually supports a different argument -- that al Qaeda's 'reserves' have been removed from the drones' kill box. It is quite obvious that improvised explosive devices, car bombs, small arms and the like cannot take out unmanned drones. So, Al Qaeda has simply moved some of its forces elsewhere.""

Joscelyn said the ""selective citation"" speaks to a broader problem -- ""the president and his administration only see what they want to see in the fight against Al Qaeda and affiliates groups.""

In his counterterrorism speech, Obama said the ""core of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on the path to defeat,"" while at the same time acknowledging Al Qaeda affiliates continue to threaten U.S. interests.

Obama vowed to put new limits on the U.S. drone program, while defending the need for it in an unconventional war.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" accused Obama of ""sounding retreat"" in the address.

""At the end of the day, this is the most tone-deaf president I ever could imagine,"" he said.

Other lawmakers praised Obama for taking new steps to disclose details about the U.S. drone program.

""I am also encouraged that the administration is taking steps to improve transparency as it pertains to the use of lethal force, particularly when it comes to the possible targeting of U.S. citizens,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said last week."

Ambassador Christopher Stevens%2C 3 other Americans died in Libya

Clinton%27s testimony was delayed for weeks due to her hospitalization

Clinton tells committee%3A %27I take responsibility%27

WASHINGTON — A combative Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday fended off fierce interrogations from senators and House members in congressional hearings illuminating the brutal Sept. 11 attack on a U.S. Consulate in Libya that left a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead.

Clinton, who testified before a Senate panel in the morning and a House panel later in the day, also promised to improve security for State Department officials in North Africa and around the world following the Sept. 11 attack in Benghazi.

""I take responsibility,"" Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Nobody is more committed to getting this right. I am determined to leave the State Department and our country safer, stronger and more secure.""

Clinton bristled at claims that the administration misled the public by initially linking the attack to a protest that spiraled out of control.

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis, said ""a simple phone call"" to people in Benghazi ""would have established immediately"" that there was no protest. ""Why wasn't that known?"" he asked.

Clinton said State Department officials decided it was not appropriate to talk to U.S. officials in Benghazi before the FBI conducted their interviews. Pressed further on why that call wasn't made, Clinton erupted in anger.

""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,"" she said. ""Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night and decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.""

Job One, she said, is to find the killers and ""bring them to justice.""

Clinton, in what could be her last congressional testimony before leaving her post, said the deaths were ""personal"" for her.

She was near tears as she talked of standing next to President Obama ""as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews (Air Force Base). I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters.""

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., gave Clinton a warm but brief welcome before quickly pressing her on security issues at the consulate. He said when he met with U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens on July 7 — more than two months before the attack — Stevens expressed ""his deep and grave concerns about security in Benghazi … and the need for additional assistance.""

Clinton said requests for more security never reached her desk. McCain said the administration's ""preference for a 'soft footprint' was part of the reason for what took place"" in Benghazi.

An Independent Accountability Review Board appointed by the State Department concluded that ""systemic failures"" left the consulate in Benghazi inadequately protected and confirmed that no protest preceded the deadly attack. In a report released in December, the board recommended that the State Department strengthen security in high-risk posts.

Clinton told the committee she has asked a deputy secretary to lead a task force to ensure that all 29 of the panels recommendations are implemented quickly and completely — and to pursue ""additional steps above and beyond"" those in the board's report.

""Benghazi did not happen in a vacuum,"" Clinton said. The instability brought on by the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011 has expanded the reach of extremists across North Africa, she said.

The State Department for days after the Sept. 11 attack blamed it on a spontaneous protest of what it called a ""reprehensible"" video that denigrated Islam's prophet Mohammed, while CIA and diplomats from the scene were reporting that no protest preceded the attack.

Clinton testified that on the day of the attack, before it happened, she had been at the State Department dealing with a different crisis that evolved from protests to a YouTube video that disparaged Mohammed.

""During most of the day, prior to getting notice of the attack on our compound in Benghazi, we were very focused on the situation around our embassy in Cairo,"" Clinton said. ""There were attempts to scale the wall, and we were in close contact with our counterparts in Cairo.""

When the attack in Benghazi happened, about 4 p.m. Washington time, she called Libyan security officials ""to get assistance as quickly as possible.""

Clinton testified she spoke to National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, then-CIA director Gen. David Petraeus, who had a compound in Benghazi, and the White House.

She said U.S. officials participated in talks about what to do in a secure video conference with senior officials from the White House, the intelligence community and the Defense Department.

""I spoke to President Obama later in the day,"" she said.

Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, asked Clinton if she selected Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to go on the Sunday talk shows where she blamed the attack on a video days after it was clear the attack was terrorism.

""I did not,"" Clinton said.

Rice's television appearances five days after the attack derailed her possible nomination to replace Clinton as secretary of State. Clinton said she was too busy at the time to appear on TV herself.

""I was not focused on talking points,"" Clinton said. ""I was focused on keeping our people safe. We still had people attacking our embassy in Yemen, trying to scale the walls. I had to call the president in Tunis and beg him to send reinforcements, which he did and eventually saved our embassy there.""

Also, the classified intelligence assessment of the Benghazi attack was still cloudy about what it was, she said.

""There were a variety of potential causes and triggers,"" Clinton said.

There were some communications and coordination before the attack, but it still wasn't clear if it rose to the level of a pre-planned terrorist attack, she said.

Clinton testified that her department reacted to the attack by taking immediate steps to protect personnel and postings in embassies and consulates facing large protests around the world.

At the House hearing, Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., noted that Clinton had been ""very close"" to Stevens and wondered whether he had ever personally asked her to get involved.

""No. None of those cables ever came before me,"" Clinton replied.

""Chris Stevens, who knew more about Libya than anyone else I know in this country, didn't see a direct threat to our diplomatic facilities, and also neither did our intelligence community,"" Clinton said. ""They did not make the connection between the deteriorating security and a direct threat on our compound.""

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., asked why no one was significantly disciplined, despite State Department claims that employees responsible for poor security in Benghazi would be disciplined.

""There has just been a shuffling of the deck chairs,"" Ros-Lehtinen said. ""Do you find it acceptable that officials who were responsible remain employed at the State Department?""

Clinton said all four individuals have been removed from their jobs and put on administrative leave.

""This is something I need your help with,"" Clinton said. The administrative review board found that, under U.S. law, ""unsatisfactory leadership is not satisfactory for a breach of duty,"" she said. ""I have put forth to the Congress and Senate to fix that problem going forward.""

Danielle Pletka, an analyst for the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, said Clinton's testimony provided more questions than answers.

Clinton's assertion that she did not see cables from Stevens and his security chief asking for more security reflects ""a general vibe"" throughout the administration that the White House is not going to look kindly on anything that implies the country was facing a higher threat level, Pletka said.

Clinton's testimony was an effort to make the hearing about the aftermath rather than about why it happened, Pletka said. ""Understanding why it happened, who was responsible and what lies were told makes a huge difference,"" she said.

US President Barack Obama has been urged to appear in front of the European Parliament to explain the allegations that US authorities spied on EU embassies.

In a heated debate on 3 July 2013, days after new allegations of the Prism scheme surfaced, Dutch liberal MEP Sophie In 't Veld said the EU needed to secure its ""moral authority"".

""We can no longer tolerate US laws being applied directly on EU territories - I don't want to hear the arguments of national security any more,"" she stated.

Former CIA employee Edward Snowden leaked reports that claimed that US agencies were gathering millions of phone records and monitoring internet data, using a programme known as Prism.

US director of national security, James Clapper's office said information gathered under Prism was obtained under the auspices of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa).

The European United Left group has tabled a motion saying that Mr Snowden should be given asylum in the EU, with the Green group suggesting he should be given the parliament's Sakharov Prize for ""freedom of thought"".

But British Conservative MEP Timothy Kirkhope accused the European Parliament of acting as ""judge, jury and executioner, conducting a witch-hunt aimed at securing headlines rather than finding the facts"".

He also condemned as ""shameful"" calls by socialist MEPs to halt talks on developing a free trade agreement in retaliation for the spying claims.

The Greek socialist MEP Dimitrios Droutsas defended demands to block the trade deal, arguing ""we cannot sacrifice our principles on the altar of economics"".

Speaking on behalf of the European Commission, Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding said that privacy was a ""non-negotiable fundamental right"".

She said the recent allegations highlighted the need for parliament and national governments to conclude ongoing talks on creating an EU-wide data protection law as soon as possible.

Alejandro Mayorkas, tapped for the No. 2 position at the Department of Homeland Security, and others are facing an inspector general probe over allegations they helped a company with ties to Virginia Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe secure visas for investors. Adding to the controversy, The Washington Times reported overnight that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reached out to Mayorkas to help speed along visas for foreign investors of a politically connected casino hotel in Las Vegas.

But the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday voted 9-0 to advance his nomination to the full Senate -- with all Republicans sitting out and voting ""present.""

Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., top Republican on the Senate panel, called the vote ""virtually without precedent."" He had urged lawmakers to wait until ""all the facts"" are available.

""If we confirm Mr. Mayorkas under a cloud, we haven't helped him, we haven't helped the Department of Homeland Security,"" he said.

""I'm deeply disappointed,"" Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said after the vote.

But Democrats defended the nominee, suggesting his name was being dragged through the mud.

""It is discouraging to see someone with such an extraordinary record of service being held up for no apparent reason,"" Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said.

Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., the committee chairman, called him an ""exceptional candidate"" and the controversy surrounding him ""unfair.""

The nominee currently heads U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. In that role, he has come under criticism for his handling of the EB-5 program, which allows foreigners investing at least a half-million dollars in a U.S. project to seek a special visa.

The Times report, citing internal government documents, claimed the Obama administration expedited visa applications for about two dozen foreign investors for a Las Vegas casino hotel after pressure from Reid and his staff.

Reid, who represents Nevada, reportedly reached out to Mayorkas, setting in motion a process that ultimately granted expedited status to the investor visas for the SLS Hotel, formerly known as the Sahara Casino.

One email, cited by the Times, showed a USCIS official relaying how Reid's intervention created a heated situation in the agency.

""This one is going to be a major headache for us all because Sen. Reid's office/staff is pushing hard and I just had a long yelling match on the phone,"" the official wrote in a December 2012 email.

Reid's office, without denying the report, defended his actions. ""Senator Reid has supported and will continue to support the SLS Las Vegas project in any way he can,"" the statement said. ""Sen. Reid believes it is his job to do all he can to promote economic growth and development in the state, and he makes no apologies for helping to bring jobs to Nevada.""

The Times said the decision to overturn a prior, normally non-appealable visa decision ultimately benefited several companies whose executives have been heavy Democratic donors.

Coburn, citing the ongoing IG investigation into the program itself, noted the accusations are merely ""allegations,"" but said they could raise questions about Mayorkas' ""fitness for public service."""

Jeb Bush (R) will honor former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with this year’s Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center. The award will be presented to Clinton on September 10th, the eve of the first anniversary of the terrorist attack on the United States mission in Benghazi that killed four Americans.

The Christian Science Monitor reports that Bush, a potential GOP contender in the 2016 presidential race, is chairman of the board of trustees of the National Constitution Center located in Philadelphia.

“Former Secretary Clinton has dedicated her life to serving and engaging people across the world in democracy,” Bush said in a statement. “These efforts as a citizen, an activist, and a leader have earned Secretary Clinton this year’s Liberty Medal.”

Bush’s decision to honor Clinton, who is considered by some to be a likely Democrat candidate for president in 2016, was condemned by the Independence Hall Tea Party Association of Philadelphia. According to the Christian Science Monitor, the organization released its own statement Monday, referring to the event as “extremely distressing,” and offering, instead, an opportunity for another Liberty Medal recipient.

According to the statement:

As all of you undoubtedly know, much of the blame for the Obama Administration’s failure to contain the Benghazi attack and the scandalous handling of its aftermath, can be traced directly to Ms. Clinton. Indeed, a Congressional investigation regarding Ms. Clinton’s role in the cover-up of the Administration’s failure is still ongoing. A newly formed organization, the Independence Hall Foundation, will hold a “What Difference Does It Make” press conference on Independence Mall, September 10, 4 PM, to denounce the selection of Ms. Clinton as the 2013 Liberty Medal recipient and to offer an alternative award (details below). During the conference, the Foundation will name its choice of recipient(s) for the 2013 Defender of Liberty Medal. Dom Giordano will headline the presser and we certainly hope you will consider joining us. A 5 PM Prayer Vigil for the victims of the Benghazi attack will immediately follow the press conference.

The National Constitution Center’s announcement, dated June 27th, about the award of the Liberty Medal to Clinton, states:

As Secretary of State, Clinton advocated for “smart power” in foreign policy, elevating diplomacy and development and repositioning them for the 21st century – with new tools, technologies, and partners, including the private sector and civil society around the world.

National Constitution Center president and CEO Jeffrey Rosen said, “Hillary Clinton has devoted her life to expanding opportunities for ‘We the People’ not just in this country but around the globe.”

Upon the announcement of Clinton’s award in June, Gateway Pundit’s Jim Hoft wrote, “Really Jeb, no one else came to mind?”"

The newly released emails highlight the political concerns expressed in those discussions as President Obama’s administration wrestled with what to tell the public in the wake of the September attack and in the midst of the presidential campaign.

The emails show that the original CIA document underwent several revisions, including one pushed by the State Department to delete a reference to CIA warnings about the terrorist threat around the diplomatic outpost.

That information “could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings,” State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland wrote, according to emails read to the Los Angeles Times by a congressional source. They were originally reported by the conservative weekly magazine Weekly Standard and ABC News. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney did not dispute their authenticity during a lengthy explanation Friday afternoon.

The talking points were originally written for members of Congress who might speak publicly about the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. They also went to United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice as she prepared for Sunday news shows five days after the attack.

Carney said Friday that the talking points were drafted as the facts were coming to light, and that officials were trying to say what they knew without speculating about the unknown.

“The effort is always to, in that circumstance, and with an ongoing investigation and a lot of information, some of it accurate, some of it not, about what had happened and who was responsible, to provide information for members of Congress and others in the administration, for example, who might speak publicly about it that was based on only what the intelligence community could say for sure it thought it knew,” Carney said.

The emails indicate that Nuland was the driving force behind significant changes.

The information about the advance warning could be used by Congress to criticize the State Department, Nuland wrote, “so why do we want to feed that?”

She was reacting to a paragraph that said the CIA had previously warned of a threat of “extremists linked to Al Qaeda in Benghazi and eastern Libya.”

“We cannot rule out the individuals have previously surveilled the U.S. facilities, also contributing to the efficacy of the attacks,” the original document read.

Nuland also objected to a line that mentioned a militant group, Ansar al Sharia, which had taken credit for the attack.

“I have serious concerns about all parts highlighted below,” she wrote, questioning why the administration was “arming members of Congress to start making assertions to the media that we ourselves are not making because we don’t want to prejudice the FBI investigation. Why do we want the Hill to be fingering Ansar al Sharia when we aren’t doing that ourselves?”

The FBI had signed off on the mention of Ansar al Sharia, according to an email by a staffer who was coordinating the interagency negotiations.

Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security advisor at the White House, wrote in a subsequent email that Nuland’s concerns would have to be taken into account.

The emails were discussed, though not quoted, in a report by House Republicans released last month. Nuland was not named, and little was made of it.

But the wording of the actual emails raised new questions in a contentious news conference Friday. Previously, Carney had said the changes to the talking points were stylistic, not substantive.

Some members of Congress were shown the emails months ago, according to senior administration officials, and raised no objections. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) demanded that the White House release all of the emails for review.

“Congress is going to continue to investigate this issue using all the resources at our disposal,” he said in a statement from his office.

The leak of a document on the Obama administration's drone strike policy has some people in Washington playing the ""what if"" game.

What if President George W. Bush's administration had written such a document on the legality of drone attacks, even on U.S. citizens working with suspected terrorists overseas?

Former Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer tweeted: ""Good thing (Department of Justice) drone memo didn't come out in 2008. Candidate Obama would never have put up with stuff like that going on.""

Joe Scarborough, the former Republican congressman who hosts MSNBC's Morning Joe, said that if this were the Bush administration, there would be ""congressional hearings"" and ""articles of impeachment.""

Candidate Obama and Democrats did indeed criticize Bush-era counterterrorism policies, such as warrantless wiretaps and enhanced interrogation techniques (waterboarding).

Aides to President Obama said he is continuing the war on terrorism, authorized by Congress shortly after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Obama ""takes the absolute necessity to conduct our war against al-Qaeda and its affiliates in a way that's consistent with the Constitution and our laws very seriously,"" said White House press secretary Jay Carney.

The spokesman added that ""it is a matter of fact that al-Qaeda is in a state of war against us and that senior leaders, operational leaders of al-Qaeda are continually plotting to attack the United States, plotting to kill American citizens as they did most horrifically on Sept. 11, 2001.""

The debate over Obama's drone strike policy may not end soon, as noted by the Associated Press:

""Uncomfortable with the Obama administration's use of deadly drones, a growing number in Congress is looking to limit America's authority to kill suspected terrorists, even U.S. citizens. The Democratic-led outcry was emboldened by the revelation in a newly surfaced Justice Department memo that shows drones can strike against a wider range of threats, with less evidence, than previously believed.

""The drone program, which has been used from Pakistan across the Middle East and into North Africa to find and kill an unknown number of suspected terrorists, is expected to be a top topic of debate when the Senate Intelligence Committee grills John Brennan, the White House's pick for CIA chief, at a hearing Thursday."""

The president has pledged to make comprehensive immigration reform a priority during the next few months, and Republicans and Democrats in Congress have been meeting toward a possible deal.

But that's not enough for activists in Chicago who want the administration to slow the number of deportations, which reached 410,000 for the year ending last October.

""President Obama cannot talk about human rights if he doesn't stop the deportation of human beings whose families are being torn apart,"" the Rev. Jose Landaverde, a Little Village pastor, said during a news conference last week outside the downtown offices of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Monday's march is set to begin at 11 a.m. at the Daley Center and end with a rally at Federal Plaza.

As they call for a moratorium on deportations, organizers plan to highlight a case in which 34 workers at an Elk Grove Village pallet company were arrested by federal immigration agents in November. Those workers are now in proceedings that could lead to deportation.

The arrests sparked a series of small protests in recent weeks, leading to a meeting last week among ICE officials, U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Chicago, and immigration activists.

ICE spokeswoman Gail Montenegro said federal agents executing a search warrant in an unrelated criminal investigation learned that the workers at Chicago Pallet Service Inc. were in the country illegally. She declined to discuss the nature of the initial investigation. Gutierrez said the probe involved money laundering.

Gutierrez and immigration activists met with ICE officials in the hope of persuading them to suspend the arrested workers' cases under what is known as prosecutorial discretion.

Montenegro said ICE officials agreed to consider the request ""on a case-by-case basis."" She added that the agency is focused on ""sensible, effective enforcement"" that prioritizes deporting hardened criminals and repeat offenders over less urgent cases.

President Obama's advisers are also trying to tamp down concerns about the targeted killings ahead of the confirmation hearing Thursday for CIA director nominee John Brennan -- the counterterrorism adviser and drone-program supporter who has come under criticism from Democrats.

Pressed repeatedly about the complicated constitutional and legal questions raised by the targeted killing of Americans, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday that the president takes those issues ""very seriously.""

But he noted that Al Qaeda is in a ""state of war against us,"" and defended what he described as ""targeted strikes against specific Al Qaeda terrorists.""

""We conduct those strikes because they are necessary to mitigate ongoing actual threats, to stop plots, to prevent future attacks and to save American lives,"" Carney said. ""These strikes are legal, they are ethical and they are wise.""

Carney would not describe the legal criteria for ordering those drone strikes.

A Justice Department official, though, told Fox News there are at least three conditions that have to be met in order for a strike to be ordered -- there has to be an ""imminent"" threat, the target has to have engaged in terrorist activities, and the target has to be unable to be captured.

Separately, Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday that the government is ""confident that we're doing so in a way that is consistent with federal and international law.""

Under Obama, the U.S. drone program has ramped up dramatically since the George W. Bush administration. It has become one of the most important tools in the administration's counterterrorism campaign -- particularly in Pakistan, but also in the expanding fronts of the war against Al Qaeda and its affiliates.

Scrutiny of the program follows a 2011 drone strike in Yemen that killed two Americans -- Anwar al-Awlaki and Samir Khan. It marked the first time an American citizen was targeted for death by a U.S. president and killed in a drone strike.

On Monday, a bipartisan group of 11 senators wrote a letter to Obama asking for ""any and all legal opinions"" that describe the basis for the authority to ""deliberately kill American citizens.""

The questions come in advance of Brennan's confirmation hearing Thursday before the Senate intelligence committee. Several of the authors of the drone letter sit on that committee. Obama's nominee for Defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, also had his confirmation hearing last week. The letter Monday made a blunt threat suggesting that withholding information on drones could imperil those nominations.

""The executive branch's cooperation on this matter will help avoid an unnecessary confrontation that could affect the Senate's consideration of nominees for national security positions,"" the senators wrote.

As the letter was released, a Justice Department document surfaced in news reports describing the administration's drone-attack authority.

As first reported Monday night by NBC News, the memo says it is legal for the government to kill U.S. citizens abroad if it believes they are senior Al Qaeda leaders continually engaged in operations aimed at killing Americans -- even if there is no intelligence pointing to an active plot against America.

The 16-page document says that delaying action against individuals continually planning to kill Americans would create an unacceptably high risk. It adds that the threat posed by Al Qaeda and its associated forces demands a broader concept of when a person continually planning terror attacks presents an imminent threat.

It's unclear whether that will satisfy lawmakers' concerns. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., chairwoman of the intelligence committee, said in a statement Tuesday that the document was already provided to the committee last year.

""The committee continues to seek the actual legal opinions by the Department of Justice that provide details not outlined in this particular white paper,"" she said. Feinstein was not among the senators who signed the letter to Obama Monday.

While Awlaki was considered a powerful terror operative for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, he was never charged. In their letter Monday, the senators said they believe there are ""circumstances"" where a U.S. president can use ""lethal force"" against Americans who ""choose to take up arms"" against their country, ""just as President Lincoln had the authority to direct Union troops to fire upon Confederate forces during the Civil War.""

But they said ""it is vitally important"" for Congress and the public to understand how the administration interprets the limits on that power. They complained that the administration has ignored prior requests for legal opinions from the Justice Department.

Brennan, a vocal supporter of the drone program and other controversial counterterrorism tools dating back to the George W. Bush administration, is facing a level of criticism from Democrats that no other Obama nominee has encountered. Eight Democrats and three Republicans penned the letter to Obama Monday. One of them, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has previously pressed Brennan on the drone issue.

Another, Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., said last week he was ""deeply disappointed"" coming out of a meeting with Brennan. He claimed the White House counterterrorism adviser was ""unprepared"" to discuss a recent report on the CIA detention and interrogation program.

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Edward Snowden’s NSA leaks are the backlash of too much secrecy,"Keep your distance: The director of national intelligence is having intestinal distress.

“For me, it is literally — not figuratively, literally — gut-wrenching to see this happen,” James Clapper told Andrea Mitchell over the weekend, referring to leaks about the government’s secret program to collect vast troves of phone and Internet data.

There might be a bit more sympathy for Clapper’s digestive difficulty if he hadn’t delivered a kick in the gut to the American public just three months ago.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) asked Clapper at a Senate hearing in March, “Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?”

“No, sir,” Clapper testified.

Ann Telnaes animation: The NSA’s data gathering technique (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

“It does not?” Wyden pressed.

“Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.”

We now know that Clapper was not telling the truth. The National Security Agency is quite wittingly collecting phone records of millions of Americans, and much more.

As the administration and some in Congress vent their anger about leaks to The Post and to Britain’s Guardian newspaper, officials have only themselves to blame. It is precisely their effort to hide such a vast and consequential program from the American public that caused this pressure valve to burst. Instead of allowing a democratic debate about the programs in broad terms that would not have compromised national security, their attempts to keep the public in the dark have created a backlash in which the risks to national security can’t be controlled.

Edward Snowden, the leaker, did the honorable thing in revealing his identity; it would be more honorable if he would turn himself in and face the consequences for his law-breaking. But there is little honor in the way administration officials and lawmakers have avoided responsibility. Obama administration officials are blaming Snowden, while some lawmakers complain disingenuously that the administration kept them out of the loop.

“All of us are sort of asking what in the world has gone on,” a seemingly bewildered Eric Cantor (R-Va.), the House majority leader, alleged Monday on CBS’s “This Morning.”

Host Norah O’Donnell asked whether he had known about the program before the leaks.

“Well,” Cantor replied, “there are a variety of — of classified programs that exist for us to, again, guard against a terrorist threat. And . . . ”

Asked whether the Obama administration’s surveillance went further than the George W. Bush administration’s, Cantor said that “these are questions we don’t know the answers to.”

“How do you not know the answer?” O’Donnell asked.

Good question. All 535 members of Congress had authorization to learn all about the programs. Senators even received a written invitation in 2011 to view a classified report. Likewise, Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said Monday that members “could have gotten a briefing whenever they wanted to.”

But apparently few bothered. Worse, lawmakers quashed efforts to allow even modest public disclosure of the broad contours of the program. Steven Aftergood, who runs the Federation of American Scientists’ Project on Government Secrecy, lists the various ways in which the administration, Congress and the courts denied the public any right to know:

The Justice Department and the DNI promised a new effort to declassify opinions issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court; Justice official Lisa Monaco, now Obama’s counterterrorism director, said all significant FISA rulings would be reviewed for declassification. But no new opinions were declassified under the initiative.

The House last year turned back attempts to require public reports on the general outlines of the government’s surveillance programs. The various disclosure proposals, offered by Democratic Reps. Bobby Scott (Va.), Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.) and Sheila Jackson Lee (Tex.), were defeated by the Judiciary Committee.

In the Senate, amendments to provide modest disclosures and declassifications, offered by Wyden and fellow Democratic Sens. Jeff Merkley (Ore.) and Mark Udall (Colo.) during the FISA renewal in December, were all defeated.

The FISA court itself colluded in the secrecy. After senators asked the court to provide declassified summaries of its decisions, the chief FISA judge, Reggie B. Walton, responded with a letter on March 27 citing “serious obstacles” to the request.

“It was a shoddy performance all around,” Aftergood said Monday. “The pervasive secrecy on this topic created an information vacuum. If congressional oversight was not going to fill it in, it turned out leaks would. That’s not the optimal solution.”

Not optimal, but probably inevitable. Officials who denied the public a responsible debate on surveillance will now have a debate on Snowden’s terms — and there’s no use in bellyaching about it.

None of the Republican groups have said their applications were rejected. Progress Texas, another of the organizations, faced the same lines of questioning as the Tea Party groups from the same IRS office that issued letters to the Republican-friendly applicants. A third group, Clean Elections Texas, which supports public funding of campaigns, also received IRS inquiries.

Missing from much coverage is the relevant recent history—the role of the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision and how it prompted a deluge of requests from new organizations seeking tax-exempt status under tax code Section 501(c)(4) as “social welfare” organizations—despite the fact that many of these are blatantly political operations.

decision and how it prompted a deluge of requests from new organizations seeking tax-exempt status under tax code Section 501(c)(4) as “social welfare” organizations—despite the fact that many of these are blatantly political operations. Congress requires the IRS to review every application for tax-exempt status to weed out organizations that are partisan, political, or that generate private gain. Congress has imposed this requirement on the IRS, and its predecessor agencies, since 1913.

The maelstrom over the revelation that the IRS targeted anti-tax Tea Party groups applying for tax exempt status for scrutiny is showing no signs of slowing down, with Republicans seeing their chance to milk a scandal for political purposes. But while the politics is heating up, some important context is emerging, like the fact that liberal groups were targeted as well , and in fact the only group to have its application denied was a liberal group.The IRS released a statement late Tuesday admitting that it had pooled together the applications of groups that were politically active, and incorrectly used the names of some of the groups—a ""minority"" of them—as the basis for targeting them. Which, David Cay Johnston at the reminds readers is the IRS's job.Those are just two of the salient points Johnston makes to give the critical context behind this scandal. He also points out that the IRS is tasked with the vague and mushy directive to distinguish between groups are ""primarily engaged"" in politics versus those that are primarily engaged in ""social welfare,"" and getting to that distinction is a challenge for an agency deluged by applications post-and which has had its budget slashed by 17 percent per capita in the last decade. The agency processed501(c)(4) applications in 2012.

The other point he makes, which we're not hearing frequently or loudly enough in the response to the kerfuffle, is a real scandal: ""the social welfare tax exemption is being used by existing 501(c)(4) organizations, including some very large ones, to promote partisan political interests—the very activity Congress has explicitly prohibited for a century."" In other words, Karl Rove and Crossroads.

This is a serious issue, one deserving of investigation. But Republicans could be biting off more than they can chew if it causes a bright light to be shone on how politically partisan organizations, like Rove's, are exploiting the law."
http://news.yahoo.com/senate-confirms-kerry-nomination-state-dept-214010433--politics.html,,[],Senate confirms Kerry nomination for State Dept.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate overwhelmingly confirmed President Barack Obama's choice of five-term Sen. John Kerry to be secretary of state, with Republicans and Democrats praising him as the ideal successor to Hillary Rodham Clinton.

The vote Tuesday was 94-3. One senator — Kerry — voted present and accepted congratulations from colleagues on the Senate floor. The roll call came just hours after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved the man who has led the panel for the past four years.

No date has been set for Kerry's swearing-in, but in a letter to Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, Kerry says his resignation is effective at 4 p.m. Friday. The State Departments plans a welcoming ceremony for Kerry on Monday.

Obama tapped Kerry, 69, the son of a diplomat, decorated Vietnam veteran and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, to succeed Clinton, who is stepping down after four years. The Massachusetts Democrat, who had pined for the job but was passed over in 2009, has served as Obama's unofficial envoy, smoothing fractious ties with Afghanistan and Pakistan.

""Sen. Kerry will need no introduction to the world's political and military leaders and will begin Day One fully conversant not only with the intricacies of U.S. foreign policy, but able to act on a multitude of international stages,"" said Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who will succeed Kerry as committee chairman.

Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the panel's top Republican, called Kerry ""a realist"" who will deal with unrest in Egypt, civil war in Syria, the threat of al-Qaida-linked groups in Africa and Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons.

Kerry, a forceful proponent of climate change legislation, also will have a say in whether the United States moves ahead on the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada, a divisive issue that has roiled environmentalists.

Obama had nominated Kerry after Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, removed her name from consideration following criticism from Republicans over her initial comments about the attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

Story continues

Voting against Kerry were three Republicans — Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma and John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas. Absent from the vote were Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and John Hoeven, R-N.D.

""Sen. Kerry has a long history of liberal positions that are not consistent with a majority of Texans,"" Cornyn said in a statement. The senator is up for re-election next year and could face a tea party challenge.

Kerry's smooth path to the nation's top diplomatic job stands in stark contrast to the harsher treatment for Obama's other national security nominees — Chuck Hagel to be defense secretary and John Brennan to be CIA director.

Hagel, the former two-term Republican senator from Nebraska, faces strong opposition from some of his onetime GOP colleagues who question his support for reductions in the nuclear arsenal and cuts in defense spending. Lawmakers also have questioned whether he is sufficiently supportive of Israel and strongly opposed to any outreach to Iran.

Democrats have rallied for Hagel, and he has the announced support of at least a dozen members in advance of his confirmation hearing on Thursday. Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi will support Hagel, a spokesman said Tuesday, making him the first Republican to signal he will vote for the nomination.

Six Republicans have said they would vote against him, with some opposing Obama's choice even before the president's announcement.

Brennan faces questions from the GOP about White House leaks of classified information and from Democrats about the administration's use of drones.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., threatened to block the nomination of both men until he gets more answers from the Obama administration about the assault on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

Graham, who earlier this month signaled he would delay Brennan's pick, said in an interview Monday night with Fox News' ""On the Record"" the he would ""absolutely"" block Hagel unless Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testifies about the attack in Benghazi, Libya.

Clinton testified for more than five hours last Wednesday before the House and Senate, but that wasn't sufficient for Graham.

""Hillary Clinton got away with murder, in my view,"" he said. ""She said they had a clear-eyed view of the threats. How could you have a clear-eyed of the threats in Benghazi when you didn't know about the ambassador's cable coming back from Libya?""

Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., told reporters Tuesday that a hearing with Panetta on Libya is planned though the date is uncertain. Graham welcomed that news and said he would not thwart a committee vote on the nomination.

""Happy as a clam. News to me,"" said Graham, who met with Hagel for 20 minutes on Tuesday.

Pentagon spokesman George Little said Panetta had not responded yet to the request but that the department has been forthcoming with information. He insisted that the Hagel confirmation process move as quickly as possible.

Two former chairmen of the committee — Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia and Republican John Warner of Virginia — plan to introduce Hagel, according to officials close to the confirmation process. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the committee has not formally made an announcement.

As a White House emissary, Kerry has tamped down diplomatic fires for Obama. He also has stepped ahead of the administration on a handful of crises. He joined Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., as an early proponent of a more aggressive policy toward Libya, pushing for using military forces to impose a ""no-fly zone"" over Libya as Moammar Gadhafi's forces killed rebels and other citizens. He was one of the early voices calling for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down as revolution roiled the nation two years ago.

During his tenure, Kerry has pushed for reducing the number of nuclear weapons, shepherding a U.S.-Russia treaty through the Senate in December 2010, and has cast climate change as a national security threat, joining forces with Republicans on legislation that faced too many obstacles to win congressional passage.

He has led delegations to Syria and met a few times with President Bashar Assad, now a pariah in U.S. eyes after months of civil war and bloodshed as the government looks to put down a people's rebellion. Figuring out an end-game for the Middle East country would demand all of Kerry's skills.

The selection of Kerry closes a political circle with Obama. In 2004, it was White House hopeful Kerry who asked a largely unknown Illinois state senator to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic convention in Boston, handing the national stage to Obama. Kerry lost that election to President George W. Bush. Four years later, Obama was the White House hopeful who succeeded where Kerry had failed.

Maureen O%27Connor admits she took %242.1 million



She won and lost more than %241 billion

O%27Connor pleaded not guilty to a money laundering charge

SAN DIEGO (AP) — Maureen O'Connor was a physical education teacher who won a seat on the San Diego City Council when she was only 25 years old, later winning two terms as the city's first female mayor as she charmed voters with a populist flair.

But her rapid rise was matched by her fall, culminating Thursday when she acknowledged in federal court that she took $2.1 million from her late husband's charitable foundation during a decade-long gambling spree in which she won — and lost — more than $1 billion.

O'Connor pleaded not guilty to a money laundering charge in an agreement with the Justice Department that defers prosecution for two years while she tries to repay the foundation and receives treatment for gambling.

O'Connor, 66, once had a personal fortune that her attorney estimated between $40 million and $50 million, inherited from her husband of 17 years, Robert O. Peterson, founder of the Jack in the Box Inc. fast-food chain. She is now virtually broke, living with a sister.

O'Connor walked across the courtroom with a cane, appearing frail and struggling to maintain composure at one point as her attorney wrapped his arm around her shoulder and placed his hand on her head.

At a news conference, she said she always intended to repay the foundation and appeared to blame her behavior on a brain tumor that was diagnosed in 2011.

""There are two Maureens — Maureen No. 1 and Maureen No. 2,"" said O'Connor, who declined to take questions. ""Maureen No. 2 is the Maureen who did not know she had a tumor growing in her brain.""

O'Connor's game of choice was video poker at casinos in San Diego, Las Vegas and Atlantic City, N.J. Her attorney, Eugene Iredale, said she played for hours at a time.

She won about $1 billion from 2000 to 2009, according to winnings that casinos reported to the Internal Revenue Service, but lost even more. Iredale said her net gambling losses topped $13 million.

News of O'Connor's gambling troubles and financial ruin elicited sympathy in her hometown. Magistrate Judge David Bartick told her that she left ""a very strong legacy in the city of San Diego.""

The U.S. attorney's office said O'Connor's medical condition influenced the decision to strike a deal, saying it may have been impossible to bring the case to trial. The tumor was removed but doctors submitted letters detailing significant ailments.

""Maureen O'Connor was a selfless public official who contributed much to the well-being of San Diego,"" said U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy. ""However, no figure, regardless of how much good they've done or how much they've given to charity, can escape criminal liability with impunity.""

O'Connor, the eighth of 13 children whose father was a boxer and nightclub owner and mother was a registered nurse, was elected to the City Council three years after graduating from San Diego State University. She was mayor from 1986 to 1992, San Diego's only Democratic leader over a four-decade span. She promoted community policing, championed the arts and oversaw completion of a downtown convention center.

O'Connor began gambling around 2001 as she struggled with pain and loneliness from the death of her husband from leukemia in 1994 and the passing of several close friends, said Iredale, who called it ""grief gambling"" in a court filing. Within four years, she was betting heavily.

O'Connor acknowledged taking $2.1 million from the R.P. Foundation between September 2008 and March 2009 to pay gambling debts, wager more and cover living costs. She was one of three trustees of the foundation, a nonprofit organization that supported the Alzheimer's Association, City of Hope, San Diego Hospice and other charities.

Her annual gambling winnings peaked at more than $200 million, said Phillip Halpern, an assistant U.S. attorney. Prosecutors said they didn't know exactly how much she lost but that she also borrowed money from friends and sold property to gamble.

O'Connor sold a home in tony La Jolla for $2.5 million in 2010 that is down the street from former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.

She also sold the Heritage House Hotel in the Northern California coastal town of Mendocino for $7.5 million in 2005 to investors who defaulted, Iredale said. She sued and plans to turn over any damages to repay the foundation."

(CNN) —

When President Barack Obama headed to the Jersey Shore this week to tout the recovery effort from Superstorm Sandy, congressional Republicans sought to keep the nation’s focus on Washington.

On the same day Obama played “Touchdown Fever” with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on the Point Pleasant boardwalk and urged Americans to come spend money in the devastated region, House GOP committee leaders ensured that a series of controversies dominating the start of the president’s second term remained in the headlines.

Obama quoted from the Tom Waits song “Jersey Girl” popularized by local hero Bruce Springsteen, while GOP officials announced subpoenas of State Department records involving last year’s deadly Benghazi terrorist attack, questioned if Attorney General Eric Holder lied to Congress about cracking down on journalists and announced another congressional hearing on IRS targeting of conservative groups.

And on Friday, Obama stood in the Rose Garden to push Congress to extend student loan rates that are set to double on July 1 if the White House and Republicans can’t strike a deal.

It’s all part of a high-stakes showdown over political messaging, with the White House trying to shift the focus from the controversies that Republicans seek to emphasize in their efforts to retain their House majority and perhaps win control of the Senate in next year’s congressional elections.

“Voters react against what they perceive to be excess and overkill,” said Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway, who noted that recent polls show the public believes one of the current controversies – the IRS targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status – amounted to government overreach.

“Any political party that overreaches usually gets slapped back by the public,” she added, referring to losses suffered by parties in power in mid-term elections in 1994, 2006 and 2010.

The GOP narrative depicts a government gone wild, with party leaders and strategists accusing the Obama administration of routinely abusing its powers. To bolster their argument, they lump the three controversies together in an effort to create a sweeping example of leaders avoiding accountability and responsibility.

“Benghazi. The IRS. AP phone records. The failures for which Barack Obama will be remembered are not just those of one man or one administration,” Republican strategist Alex Castellanos, a CNN contributor, recently wrote in an opinion piece. “They are the failures of an old idea – that big, old, dumb, top-down, factory style government can manage the complexities of modern times.”

Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee, complained of “an arrogant abuse of power” by the president.

“Now in his second term, now that he’s implementing his agenda, we are seeing big government in practice,” the House Budget Committee chairman said Wednesday on Fox.

Asked if the controversies would bring Republican victories in next year’s congressional elections to take control of the Senate while retaining their majority in the House, Ryan said it was “just way too premature to make a comment like that.”

White House emphasizes business as usual

For his part, Obama seemed to acknowledge his political troubles at a fundraiser on Wednesday night in Chicago, telling supporters that “sometimes we take a bad turn, sometimes we make mistakes.”

At the same time, the president complained of “obstructionism for the sake of obstructionism” by political foes who appeared interested “only in scoring political points or placating a base, as opposed to trying to advance the interests of the American people.”

“We’ve got to figure out a way to work around that,” he continued, declaring that the solution would be for Democrats to regain majority control in the House next year.

Obama’s schedule this week demonstrated how the White House took a “business as usual” approach that emphasized low-risk issues for the president, such as Tuesday’s visit to New Jersey for a bipartisan review of recovery efforts with Christie, a leading Republican.

The joint appearance benefited both men by portraying them as reasonable leaders able to work with political foes on major issues such as responding to a crisis like last year’s storm.

Other events on the president’s agenda included two Chicago fundraisers and remarks at an Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month Celebration at the White House, all following last week’s major speech on security issues including U.S. drone policy and closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility that houses terror suspects.

Despite the White House efforts to shift the focus from the Washington controversies, Wednesday’s briefing with reporters by chief spokesman Jay Carney showed the difficulty.

While the first questions were about other matters – a reported drone strike, the Syrian civil war and cyber-security issues with China – CNN’s Jim Acosta then asked about GOP accusations that Holder may have lied to Congress about the secret subpoenas and search warrants obtained by the Justice Department in recent years for information from journalists involved in reporting classified information.

Reporters from NBC, CBS and Fox quickly followed up on the same topic, forcing Carney to defend Holder and reiterate Obama’s confidence in him.

On Thursday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One from Chicago that Obama would later attend his annual hurricane season briefing. He then faced more questions about Holder, with Earnest expressing Obama’s confidence that the controversies would not affect the attorney general’s ability to do his job.

GOP singles out Holder

Republicans have taken particular aim at Holder, an old nemesis from his days in the Clinton administration who has been a political lightning rod in the Obama administration.

He was cited for contempt of Congress by House Republicans last year in a dispute over documents related to the botched “Fast and Furious” gun-walking operation. Holder rejected the vote boycotted by most House Democrats as political theater.

Critics now seek to link him to two cases stemming from Justice Department investigations of classified leaks – one involving secret subpoenas last year of phone records of Associated Press journalists, and the other about subpoenas and search warrants obtained in secret three years ago for phone records, e-mails and security badge details of Fox correspondent James Rosen.

Some Republicans attempt to group the classified leaks cases with the other controversies – IRS targeting of conservative groups and erroneous talking points from the administration four days after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, last September that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.

“I think it is time for Mr. Holder to step aside,” Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis of Florida told Fox News on Wednesday. “We need a new attorney general, especially with all of these matters that are now going to need investigation from the IRS to the DOJ treatment of reporters. I just don’t think he is in a position where he can do that in a way that the American people expect.”

Obama and Democrats joined Republicans in condemning the IRS targeting, which is under investigation by congressional committees as well as Holder’s Department of Justice.

The classified leaks investigations also raised concern among Democrats including Obama, who ordered Holder to conduct a review of how the government investigates such cases.

However, Democratic strategist Stephanie Cutter, a CNN political contributor, described Republican calls for Holder to resign as overkill, noting that GOP legislators had demanded an investigation into classified leaks in the first place.

“I think that if the president took action every time a House Republican criticized a member of his Cabinet, we’d have a pretty empty government,” Cutter said when asked if Holder was proving a liability to Obama. “… For average Americans, they’re not really paying attention to this and they’re wondering, you know, why shouldn’t the Department of Justice investigate, you know, intelligence leaks about some of our most pressing national security issues?”

Public responds to IRS

A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday appeared to back up some of Cutter’s assertion.

According to the survey, 44% of registered voters responded that the IRS probe of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status was the most important of the controversies facing the Obama administration, while 24% said the handling of the Benghazi attack was the biggest concern. Only 15% called the Justice Department’s seizure of journalists’ phone records as the most important.

By contrast, 73% of respondents said the economy was a higher priority than the three controversies, according to the survey. However, it also showed that more than three-quarters of respondents wanted a special prosecutor – rather than Holder – to investigate the IRS targeting.

To liberal political analyst Earl Ofari Hutchinson, Republicans have attacked Holder as part of a broader strategy to tarnish the administration.

“Typing Holder as the font of secrecy, manipulation and wrongdoing in the Obama administration will be played and replayed in the run-up to the 2014 elections,” Hutchinson wrote Thursday on his website. “The aim will be to paint Holder as an incompetent, conniving political hack who supposedly typifies the poor and untrustworthy judgment of Obama in picking his political appointees.”

Conway, the GOP pollster, argued that the controversies all started with problematic acts by the administration.

“It’s an advantage to the party out of power if the party in power is seen to be obfuscating or hiding the truth,” she said, noting that “these are not investigations that began in (Republican House Speaker) John Boehner’s office.”

Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University constitutional lawyer, noted that most recent presidents faced accusations if not outright evidence of scandal in their second terms.

In the Obama administration, Turley said, Holder serves the role of “sin-eater,” or “people that would take your sins away for a price.”

“Holder is the ultimate sin-eater in the beltway,” Turley argued on CNN. “He protects the president and he has an important use in that sense.”

By Thomas Ferraro

WASHINGTON, March 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is getting an earful about the big spending cuts beginning to hit government services from worried and irate constituents, including one senator's own spouse.

Democratic Senator Thomas Carper of Delaware said his wife, ""my most important constituent,"" asked him, ""Why can't you guys get your act together? Do you know what people think of you guys?""

""I told her that Washington needs to work more like Delaware,"" said Carper, a former governor of the state. ""In Delaware, Democrats and Republicans work together.""

They have not worked together in Washington. And so the across-the-board cuts of the so-called ""sequester"" - which both Republicans and Democrats have said they oppose - took effect Friday night after President Barack Obama and Republican leaders failed to agree on a way to replace them with targeted spending reductions.

Up until the final few days before Friday, when the reductions began because of a law enacted in 2011, constituents urged, some begged, lawmakers to avert them.

The cuts threaten the U.S. economic recovery, could disrupt federal services from airports to national parks, and may force furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and employees of federal contractors, the administration says.

""They want to kill us all,"" Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, said of his constituents.

Laura Zayner, a senior officer with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, was among 400 federal workers facing possible furloughs who came to Washington last week to lobby Congress.

""We consider the furlough a slap in the face. We take it personally,"" Zayner said. ""We are not picking sides, Democrats or Republicans. But we want them to do their jobs and stop the cuts.""

John Kelshaw, who works with the Internal Revenue Service, came to town from New Jersey. He and a few other federal workers met with Republican Representative John Runyan.

""We told him that a lot of our people live paycheck to paycheck. We said, 'Give us a break,'"" Kelshaw said. He said Runyan, of New Jersey, listened but made no commitments.

WHO'S TO BLAME?

Polls so far show most Americans blame Republicans rather than Obama and his Democrats for the standoff. But that could change.

Republicans insist that any deficit-reduction replacement deal include only spending cuts. Democrats want a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.

According to a February 28 Gallup survey, 56 percent of those polled thought the cuts will damage the economy. The feeling crossed party lines, Gallup reported, with 64 percent of Republicans and 51 percent of Democrats agreeing they would inflict economic pain.

Democratic Senator Mark Pryor said his constituents in Arkansas routinely ask him, ""'Why can't you guys work it out?'""

Pryor said he tells them, ""Nobody has clean hands on this.""

Both sides seem to size up any issue on a basis of who gets the political advantage, he said. ""If someone suddenly came up with a cure to cancer, the question in Washington would be, 'Is this good or bad for Obama?'""

The president on Friday said of the cuts, ""This is not a win for anybody. This is a loss for the American people.""

Hatch, of Utah, said he recently told his state legislature that he expected the federal government to impose the sweeping cuts. ""A number of them stood up and said maybe that's the only way we are going get any real reduction in spending,"" he said.

On the other side, Representative Luis Gutierrez, a Chicago Democrat who won an 11th term last year with more than 80 percent of the vote, said his constituents ""tell me 'Keep on fighting, Luis, keep on fighting.'""

Representative Scott Rigell, a Virginia Republican whose district includes the shipbuilding yards in Newport News that are likely to be hit hard by cuts in military spending, was dismayed by the untargeted reductions.

Rigell got a letter from a constituent last month that read in part, ""My husband, a project manager for the defense industry, went to work this morning to lay off half of his workforce because of sequestration.""

In an interview, Rigell said, ""When I think they (shipyard workers) could lose their jobs because of the dysfunction in Washington ... this is not acceptable to me.""

""I've been at that shipyard. Some of hardest working folks I know. They're coming in at 5:30 a.m. with a lunch bucket and making $35,000 a year and wondering if they'll have a job."""

Simple: The iron law of longevity. All governments make mistakes, and all governments try to hide those mistakes. But the longer an administration is in office, the more errors it makes, and the harder they are to conceal.

Just ask Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton or George W. Bush, all of whom spent much of their second terms playing defense.

The longevity rule caught up with Barack Obama last week as he wrestled clumsily with not one controversy but three: the Internal Revenue Service’s treatment of “tea party” groups, the Benghazi killings and the Justice Department’s seizure of Associated Press telephone records.

Inevitably, the president’s Republican critics reached for historical comparisons: It’s another Watergate, said some. Another Iran-Contra, said others. To the hyperbolic Rep. Steve King of Iowa, Benghazi alone was worse than Watergate and Iran-Contra combined, “times maybe 10.”

So far, though, the three imbroglios don’t add up to another Watergate; not even close. But there are enough unanswered questions to keep any administration tied up for months in congressional hearings, and that’s exactly what’s about to happen.

Let’s take the three issues in turn.

The IRS scandal is the most straightforward: A mismanaged unit of the tax agency applied political criteria to its scrutiny of applications for tax-exempt status. Despite the initial portrayal of a rogue operation confined to Cincinnati, IRS officials in Washington knew about the problem and failed to fix it. At least one appears to have misled Congress last year by suggesting that tea party complaints were unfounded.

Last week, Obama condemned the IRS conduct as “intolerable and inexcusable,” and he fired the agency’s acting director.

But every customer of the IRS, not only Republicans, should want an independent investigation to determine whether higher-ups encouraged the Cincinnati cabal.

Benghazi is the most tangled issue, and the most partisan. A State Department review board has already concluded that security for Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens’ fatal visit to the Libyan city was inexcusably weak; then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton accepted responsibility for that.

But the political side of the Benghazi “scandal,” which still needs to be in quotes, has focused on other targets. Republicans charge that Obama lied about the attacks, portraying them as spontaneous to avoid weakening his election-year claim that he had put Al Qaeda on the path to defeat.

It’s true that Obama was slow to blame terrorists for the killing. “We don’t have all the information yet,” he said on Sept. 25. But by then, other officials had already told Congress that Al Qaeda affiliates were involved. That was five weeks before the election; if the White House was trying to mount a coverup, it apparently forgot to tell the rest of the administration.

It’s also true that Obama aides presided over an internal debate over what information would be in official talking points. But when the White House finally released emails from that wrangle, they mostly revealed a bureaucratic fight between the CIA, which wanted to trumpet its warnings about Libya, and the State Department, which didn’t want to expose its failings. There’s no evidence of anyone acting to protect the Obama reelection campaign.

Still, the White House has a problem: It’s been acting guilty. Obama spokesman Jay Carney said initially that the White House had little to do with the talking points, and that only one substantive change was made to the text. Those descriptions turned out to be false. It’s no wonder Republicans have demanded more answers. But the Benghazi talking points still look mostly like a partisan sideshow, too complicated and murky to engage most voters.

The third controversy, over the Justice Department’s secret decision to seize telephone records of dozens of reporters and editors at the Associated Press, is a different kind of scandal. Republicans have been careful about this one because many have long demanded that the Obama administration get tough on leaks of classified information.

But it still fits into the GOP’s critique of Obama as imperious and authoritarian. And it puts another dent in Obama’s already battered image as a onetime civil libertarian who has grown fond of executive power in office.

If Obama is both smart and lucky, all three controversies will gradually fade away, assuming no more wrongdoing comes to light. His Republican critics already run the risk of repeating their error in the 1998 impeachment of Clinton; if they hound the White House on charges that don’t pan out, they’ll be vulnerable to charges that they’re wasting time on partisan squabbles.

During the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Clinton White House made a point of putting the president on camera every day to show he was at work on the economy, not his legal troubles. The Obama White House is already following the same path.

But a season of scandal still comes with a cost. If Congress spends much of its time on investigations (and one-third of all House committees have announced they plan to do just that), it will have fewer hours to work on other issues. If the White House must focus on defending the president against charges of malpractice, that saps its energy as well.

Any second-term president has limited time after reelection to win legislative battles. Obama’s clock is already ticking; his agenda is already in trouble. If the remainder of 2013 is dominated by inquests that widen the partisan divide, the chances for bipartisan deal-making — especially a grand bargain on taxes and spending — will wane even further.

http://news.yahoo.com/white-house-rejects-latest-republican-offer-end-shutdown-000940029--business.html,,[],"Obama, congressional leaders still deadlocked on shutdown","By Jeff Mason and Thomas Ferraro WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama met with Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress on Wednesday to try to break a deadlock that has shut down wide swaths of the federal government, but there was no breakthrough. After more than an hour of talks, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said Obama refused to negotiate, while House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of trying to hold the president hostage over Obamacare. Reid said Obama told Republicans ""he will not stand"" for their tactics. As hundreds of thousands of federal employees faced a second day without pay, leaders of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and the Democratic-led Senate offered token concessions that were quickly dismissed by the other side. Obama, meanwhile, scaled back a long-planned trip to Asia. Republicans have tried to tie continued government funding to measures that would undercut Obama's signature healthcare law. Obama and his Democrats say that is a non-starter. ""The president reiterated one more time that he will not negotiate,"" Boehner told reporters after the White House meeting. ""All we're asking for here is a discussion and fairness for the American people under Obamacare."" Reid said Democrats were willing to discuss any ways to tackle the budget after a temporary funding bill is passed. ""We're through playing these little games,"" he said. The shutdown, which took effect Monday at midnight (0400 GMT Tuesday), has raised questions about Washington's ability to carry out its most essential duties. Though it would do relatively little damage to the world's largest economy in the short term, global markets could be roiled if Congress also fails to raise the debt limit before borrowing authority runs out in coming weeks. The shutdown has closed landmarks like the Grand Canyon and prevented some cancer patients from receiving cutting-edge treatment. United Technologies Corp, which makes Sikorsky helicopters and other items for the military, said it would be forced to furlough as many as 4,000 employees, if the U.S. government shutdown continues through next week, due to the absence of government quality inspectors. OBAMA EXASPERATED ""Am I exasperated? Absolutely I'm exasperated. Because this is entirely unnecessary,"" Obama told CNBC television in an interview before meeting the congressional leaders. ""I am exasperated with the idea that unless I say to 20 million people, 'You can't have health insurance,' these folks will not reopen the government. That is irresponsible."" The U.S. Army's top general said the shutdown was significantly harming day-to-day operations, and intelligence leaders say it is undermining their ability to monitor threats. A Federal Reserve official said it could delay the central bank's ability to assess whether its monetary stimulus efforts are still needed. The uncertainty in Washington has forced the White House to scale back an Asia trip that was designed to reinforce U.S. commitment to the region. Obama scuttled two stops on a planned four-country tour and left visits to two other countries up in the air. He was due to leave on Saturday and return a week later. Secretary of State John Kerry will visit Malaysia and the Philippines in his place. Obama is weighing whether to attend diplomatic summits in Indonesia and Brunei, a White House official said. Despite the disruption, Boehner's Republicans have failed to derail Obama's controversial healthcare law, which passed a milestone on Tuesday when it began signing up uninsured Americans for subsidized health coverage. Though some moderate Republicans have begun to question their party's strategy, Boehner so far has kept them united behind a plan to offer a series of small bills that would re-open select parts of the government most visibly affected by the shutdown. The Republican-controlled House passed and sent to the Senate a funding bill that would re-open the National Institutes of Health, which conducts medical research, and another bill to reopen shuttered federal parks and museums, such as the Smithsonian museums, the National Gallery of Art and the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Both bills passed with the support of about two-dozen Democrats, who joined Republicans. The House was expected to vote Thursday on measures to fund veterans' care, the District of Colombia and the Army Reserve. The measures are likely to be defeated in the Democratic-controlled Senate, and Obama said he would veto them if they reached his desk. Still, they allowed Republicans to charge that their adversaries are standing in the way of help for elderly veterans and young cancer patients. ""Will they now say 'no' to funding for veterans, our National Parks and the National Institutes of Health?"" asked Boehner spokesman Michael Steel. Reid told Republicans he would engage in talks about tax reform, farm policy and other pressing issues that Congress has failed to address once Republicans agreed to re-open the government without conditions. Republicans dismissed that idea. A Reuters/Ipsos poll indicated that 24 percent of Americans blamed Republicans for the shutdown, while 19 percent blamed Obama or Democrats. Another 46 percent said everyone was to blame. BIGGER FIGHT LOOMS The shutdown fight is rapidly merging with a higher-stakes battle over the government's borrowing power that is expected to come to a head soon. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said the United States will exhaust its borrowing authority no later than October 17. The government could have difficulty paying pension checks, interest charges and other bills after that point. Many Republicans see the debt limit vote as another opportunity to undercut Obama's healthcare law or extract other concessions - an approach that business groups say could lead to disaster. ""You can re-litigate these policy issues in a political forum, but they shouldn't use the threat of causing the U.S. to fail on its ... obligations to repay on its debt as a cudgel,"" Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein told reporters after he and other financial-industry executives met with Obama. Some Democrats have begun to consider asking Obama to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling on his own - a move that could lead to years of court battles. The White House has said that approach is not feasible. Asked whether there is a push underway among Democrats to convince Obama that he should use this power, a senior House Democrat who asked not to be identified said: ""No, not at this point."" Stock investors on Wednesday appeared to show growing anxiety over the standoff after taking the news in their stride on Tuesday. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both closed down 0.1 percent. Obama said Wall Street should be worried about the debt ceiling. ""I think this time's different. I think they should be concerned,"" Obama told CNBC. ""When you have a situation in which a faction is willing potentially to default on U.S. government obligations, then we are in trouble."" A short-term shutdown would slow U.S. economic growth by about 0.2 percentage points, Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday, but a weeks-long disruption could weigh more heavily - 0.4 percentage points - as furloughed workers scale back personal spending. The last shutdown in 1995 and 1996 cost taxpayers $1.4 billion, according to congressional researchers.

Roby leads Republicans in asking Obama to take lead to avert drastic cuts,"Republicans on Saturday stepped up their call for President Obama to take the lead in negotiations to avert roughly $85 billion in automatic cuts to the military and other government spending next month by replacing the cuts with less drastic reductions.

Alabama Republican Rep. Martha Roby said the president is responsible for the cuts because his administration proposed the plan, known as sequester, during the 2011 debt-limit negotiations.

“In his State of the Union address, President Obama himself admitted that these cuts are a really bad idea,” Roby said Saturday in the weekly Republican address. “What the president failed to mention was sequester was his idea.”

Roby, chairwoman of a House Armed Services subcommittee, is among several Republican lawmakers, including Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who after Obama's speech Tuesday, is saying how the across-the-board cuts to the military would impact bases, including those in their home districts.

Roby said her district’s Fort Rucker, the Army’s primary flight-training base, would lose 500 students training to be combat aviators.

“The numbers are astounding,” said Roby, who voted against the August 2011 Budget Control Act. “This is just one set of cuts at one base.”

The consequences of the sequester agreement were intended to be so drastic that the parties were expected to reach a deal before the cuts started.

Roby is urging the president to consider two proposals by the Republican-controlled House that call for replacing sequester with more targeted cuts.

However, the March 1 deadline is fast approaching with no deal, as the president is playing golf in Florida during the long President’s Day weekend and Congress is on a nine-day break.

“Sequestration is going to take place,” Blackburn told CNBC on Wednesday.

Leaders of the Democrat-controlled Senate announced a plan Thursday to avoid the cuts. However, the plan, a mix of spending cuts and tax increases on the country’s highest earners, is not expected to pass. It further highlights the continuing debate on whether to solve the country’s fiscal problems with less spending or more taxes.

“I disagree with Republicans who think we should do that by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training; Medicare and Social Security benefits,” Obama said Saturday during his weekly address. “That would force our senior citizens and working families to bear the burden of deficit reduction while the wealthiest are asked to do nothing more.”

Sequester would result in roughly $85 billion in cuts this year from the federal budget, with $46 billion from the Pentagon. No so-called ""safety-net"" programs would be cut. But the economy could lose an estimate 750,000 jobs as a result of sequester, which cuts $1.2 trillion in spending over the next decade.

“President Obama and Senate Democrats see sequester as another opportunity to push through another tax hike,” Roby said. “The ink has barely dried on the tax hikes the president pushed through in January.”"

She says Obama prefers a ""no-drama"" White House in which people stay in their lanes Staffers are not encouraged to bring the President bad news, she says Borger: There was no rollout czar for Obamacare; everyone stayed in their silo

(CNN) —

As the story of the Obamacare website fiasco unfolds, senior administration aides tell me that the President is “mad, frustrated and angry.”

Mad that his signature legislative achievement is stuck at the gate, frustrated that he’s running out of time to fix it and angry that he’s got a second-term agenda now going nowhere. He’s so furious, in fact, that he stepped out of character to vent to an assembled group of top aides, saying he would have delayed the website if he had known it was a mess.

By Thursday, the president was venting publicly. “Had I been informed, I wouldn’t be going out saying, boy, this is going to be great. You know, I’m accused of a lot of things, but I don’t think I’m stupid enough to go around saying, this is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity, a week before the website opens, if I thought that it wasn’t going to work.”

All of which begs the real question: How could he not have known?

It’s a real head-scratcher. Most powerful man in the world. Most important issue. Most politically explosive, particularly coming on the heels of the government shutdown. Consider the context: Republicans had just tried to defund Obamacare, and they lost in a heap of public humiliation. So the rollout of Obamacare had to be really impressive, because the Republicans had to be proven wrong.

CNN Gloria Borger

And yet, as the dry runs continued to produce red flags – over and over – the President remained in his steely cocoon. If this were the presidency of George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan, the obvious theories would abound: The chief executive is disengaged. Or incurious. Or worse. But since Obama is none of the above, what gives?

This much is clear, after speaking with both past and present senior administration officials: No one was really in charge, so no one knew for sure how bad the overall picture was. What’s more, and – perhaps most telling – no one wanted even to hint to the President that this techno-savvy administration possibly had a website stuck in, say, 1995. “People don’t like to tell him bad news,” says an ex-White House staffer. “Part of it is the no-drama culture.”

Oh, that. The infamous no-drama Obama credo: no panic, no drama. “No drama is attractive to people, except there are times when people actually should light their hair on fire,” says one former senior administration official. “That would have been a very good thing.”

Indeed. People who have served in top jobs at the White House seem to agree on one thing: a President who wants to get at the truth has to understand the extent of his own isolation. And then establish a zone of immunity for truth-tellers.

That, of course, presumes that the top staff inside the White House knew the full truth. And that probably wasn’t the case. Again, you ask, how can that be? Answer: The operation resembled the proverbial blind men and the elephant parable: Everyone seemed to touch a part of it, but no one could really see the whole picture, or disaster coming right at them.

“It’s not that someone had an envelope with a note in it saying here comes the second-term crisis,” an ex-top White House staffer says. “They were thinking there were some bugs, they would be fixed; these are smart people.”

They may be smart, but it appears they had no singular leader. No rollout czar. They had health care wonks and tech wonks and political wonks and even a presidential wonk, but no put-it-all-together-and-make-sure-it-all-works wonks.

And maybe, no truth-telling wonks, who would have warned the president that it was a no-no to promise that people could keep their health care policies.

Everyone, it seems, lived in his own silo. And that’s where they stayed.

This is a President, says one admirer, “who likes everyone to stay in his lane.” Which begs the question: Whose lane was it to say the website wasn’t working? The probability is that the information filtered to a bunch of different people in a bunch of different lanes.

Sure, the stay-in-your-lane theory of operation is important to a well-run White House, but here’s the flip side if it’s implemented too literally: If you hear something outside your purview that is bad, you may not want to report it higher. Why? “Everyone thinks if it isn’t in my lane, and I talk about it, I’m being a tattletale,” says one ex-administration official. “That would be discouraged as bad behavior in this current White House.” (An exception, some point out, ex-chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, who “encouraged people to contradict each other.” To put it mildly, Rahm was pro-drama.)

Which brings us to the President, who isn’t. And if you aren’t 100% sure that the website is a mess – because no one is actually in charge to tell the White House with any certainty – what is there to bring to the President? Reports of some bad tests? Bugs? Fixes that are being made?

“Nobody is trying to create drama, angst and anxiety,” says an ex-White House official. “And it’s hard to go in there and say, ‘Well, I don’t think this is going to work.’ ”

So, the irony. All the effort to spare the drama created a huge theatrical mess all of its own. The reviews are lousy, and now the unhappy leading man is stewing, centerstage.

At a press conference on Monday, President Obama addressed the Benghazi talking points criticism, and said, “We don’t have time to be playing these kinds of political games here in Washington.” (The Washington Post)

After answering questions Monday morning about two of the controversies that have undermined his administration, President Obama flew off to New York to raise money for the Democratic Party. There, before partisan donors, he reflected on his second term and said he will continue to reach out to Republicans. “I sure want to do some governing,” he explained.

Obama’s words suggest that he believes there is a way to compartmentalize the business of his second term: legislative and other business here, scandals over there. But things are too messy for that right now. A politician who has counted good luck as part of his skill set will need all the breaks he can muster to pull off that bit of political jujitsu.

Even in the best of times, Obama’s outreach to Republicans produced little in return — and these are no longer close to the best of times. The question is whether the barely civil relationship between the White House and the opposition party has been irreparably damaged. A related question is how much the controversies will weaken Obama’s standing with the public. Together, the answers will decide how effectively he can govern.

It is too early to draw any broad conclusions about the long-term damage to Obama’s presidency from the news that the Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative groups and that the Justice Department collected two months of phone records from Associated Press reporters and editors. But in the moment, these controversies — along with the ongoing congressional investigation of the attacks in Benghazi, Libya — have created major challenges for the administration.

The president and his advisers have tried to insulate the White House from the actions of the IRS and the Justice Department, claiming ignorance. The IRS, officials argued Friday, is quasi-independent. It took the president three days to express his outrage at the agency’s actions. As for the Justice Department’s leak investigation, White House officials said Monday night that it was a department decision that was not forwarded to the president.

Those are temporary responses that probably will not be sufficient over time. The White House may have known nothing about either, but both are now the president’s problem. And both reflect questions about the administration that predate the revelations of the past few days.

The tea party movement has been a political nemesis for Obama since the first year of his presidency. The movement helped turn the battle over health care into one of the most divisive fights of his presidency. The political potency of the grass-roots activists who rallied behind tea party banners helped deliver the worst midterm-election defeat to a party holding the White House in 70 years.

The president and his advisers may not have known anything about IRS targeting of tea party groups for greater scrutiny, but the abuse of power confirmed complaints by conservatives and GOP lawmakers that the practice was taking place and impressions among conservatives that the administration is truly hostile to the tea party movement. Holding those responsible accountable will be only part of Obama’s challenge in responding.

Less is known about the Justice Department’s leak investigation. It was carried out by an administration that came into office talking about the importance of civil liberties, but whose record has been a disappointment to civil libertarians. No one can recall anything as far-reaching as what the Justice Department apparently did in secretly gathering information about the work of AP journalists.

Obama showed his greatest passion Monday when he denounced the GOP-led inquiry of the killing of four Americans in a terrorist attack in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012. That partisan politics are involved in the congressional investigation is certainly the case. In addition to whatever enmity is felt toward the Obama administration over its handling of the aftermath, GOP leaders see former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton for what she is, which is a potentially formidable presidential candidate in 2016.

Obama argued that the current focus on administration talking points is a political sideshow. As others, including The Post’s Glenn Kessler, have noted, the multiple alterations in those talking points appeared to reflect an internal turf war between the State Department and the CIA. Obama argued that it was hardly a coverup.

Given the timing of the attack in Benghazi, which occurred in the heat of a presidential race, White House officials worked to keep the issue from becoming part of the campaign debate — and GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s maladroit handling of it at the start provided convenient cover for the White House. Obama’s campaign put Romney on the defensive, rather than the opposite, although the deaths of the four Americans — and the subsequent security lapses that were enumerated — were a major stain on the administration.

As questions were raised, White House officials avoided drawing conclusions about the origins of the attacks. Even as the head of the National Counterterrorism Center testified that what happened at the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, the president continued to resist labeling it as such. For whatever reason, the administration’s semantic gamesmanship contributed to what the president now dismisses as a sideshow.

Obama is early into his second term, but it has not gone as planned. His gun-control initiative was blocked. Prospects for a grand bargain on the budget are problematic. Immigration reform is moving forward slowly in the Senate and faces uncertainty in the House, although administration officials remain optimistic that Congress eventually will approve a bill.

On Monday night in New York, the president said, “I’m going to do everything I can over the next 31 / 2 years to continue to reach out to my Republican friends on the other side of the aisle. . . . I want to get some stuff done. I don’t have a lot of time.”

He will have to spend some of that precious time trying to clean up unexpected messes that have landed on his desk. How seriously off track his administration is will depend in large part on how skillfully Obama handles what is before him."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) Monday, calling him a ""schoolyard bully"" for trying to insert instructions into Senate budget negotiations that would prohibit raising taxes or the debt ceiling.

""My friend from Texas is like a schoolyard bully,"" Reid said. ""He pushes everybody around and is losing, and instead of playing the game according to the rules, he not only takes the ball home with him but changes the rules. That way no one wins except the bully who tries to indicate to people he has won. We’re asking Republicans to play by the rules and let us go to conference.""

""I object too, but what my friend suggests is fairly ridiculous if you want the truth -- before we go to conference determine what you do and not do in the conference, that's not how we do things around here,"" he continued.

Cruz responded, ""I wasn't aware we were in a schoolyard.""

""There's either an objection or no objection,"" Reid shot back. ""We've had enough of reserving the right to object.""

""Reserving the right to object,"" said Cruz.

""Mr. President, there is no such thing,"" Reid said.

Cruz finally objected.

The exchange came after Reid tried to move toward ""regular order,"" in which Senate Republicans appoint budget conferees to negotiate with the House, which passed its own budget resolution.

The Senate passed a budget on March 23, neutralizing a key Republican talking point that the Senate had not passed a budget. The bill passed 50-49 with no Republican votes and increased taxes.

Cruz, like many Republicans, had criticized the Senate for not passing a budget. ""As you know, we haven't had a budget in over three years,"" he said on Fox News in November 2012, before taking office. ""I think if the Democrats want to pursue big government policy, they ought to vote on it. They've got to go on record and say this is what we want to do, this is our budget."""

The federal government is in the third week of a shutdown while Congress worked out a deal to fund its operations and to avoid a possible default because of the debt limit.

Meanwhile, furloughed federal workers express their displeasure as the government shutdown seemed to be headed for a third week.

Meanwhile, furloughed federal workers express their displeasure as the government shutdown seemed to be headed for a third week.

Even for a Congress where griping is endemic and insults routine, spirits were especially dark on Saturday.

For a legislative body that takes six weeks for its August break, the third consecutive working Saturday without any solution to the crises in sight meant short tempers and foul moods.

Most vocal in their bitterness were House Republicans, who voted midday and then left Washington until Monday, sputtering as they went that President Obama had halted talks with their leaders in favor of negotiating with Senate Republicans — and even angrier that their Senate colleagues seemed receptive to the president’s overture.

“They’re trying to cut the House out, and trying to jam us with the Senate. We’re not going to roll over and take that,” said House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).

Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.), not generally considered one of the House’s bomb-throwers, advised Republicans in the Senate to “grow a backbone and stand up with the House Republicans, like they said they were going to.”

Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) addressed the shutdown during a press conference on Capitol Hill on Saturday, saying Susan Collins's plan to end the shutdown and extend the debt ceiling is ""not going to go any place."" (AP)

Senate Republicans were likewise fed up with their House colleagues, for refusing to accept that they will not win major changes to the federal health-care law and that their party’s leverage only decreases as the shutdown drags and default approaches.

“Our friends in the House apparently can’t muster the votes to send something over here to open up the government, so it’s dysfunction at every level,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.).

Several rounds of past budget fights have ended with Senate Republicans forging agreement with Senate Democrats and then shoving it over to the House to be adopted on a bipartisan vote, over the objections of the GOP’s most conservative members.

Republicans in both chambers appeared to be bracing for a repeat of that outcome, which would solve the current crisis but only deepen mistrust between Republicans in the Senate and in the House.

But the ill will was broadly shared.

In the House, a Republican aide accused a leading Democrat of a physical confrontation with another GOP aide on the floor the House. The congressman acknowledged a heated exchange but denied jabbing the man in the chest.

In the Senate, a bipartisan proposal to end the shutdown and raise the debt ceiling written by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) provided a glimmer of hope Friday. It was declared dead a day later.

Senate Democrats emerged grim-faced from a 90-minute, closed-door meeting where leaders briefed them on nascent talks underway between Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in place of the Collins proposal, which ran aground amid Democratic opposition.

“Adults will get in the room sooner or later,” said Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), exiting the meeting early.

Manchin had backed Collins’s proposal, which would have funded the government at current levels for six months and raise the debt limit through the end of January. It would have required the House and Senate to enter broader budget negotiations but left in place the deep across-the-board cuts known as the sequester while they talked.

An aide said other Democrats, who had opposed Collins’s proposal because it would have left the sequester untouched, had been growing annoyed with their own leadership late Friday and Saturday morning, as rumors spread that a deal was being forged around its tenets before they had been briefed about it.

“The key to this place is communication, even if there’s nothing to say,” the Democratic aide said. “If members feel like they’re being kept out of the loop, they get upset.”

Likewise, in the House, Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.) had a raised-voice hallway confrontation with a member of his leadership in clear view of reporters, demanding to know how House leaders plan to resolve the stalemate.

“If Eric Cantor and John Boehner can’t answer the questions ‘what are we fighting for’ — that’s not good!” Rigell told Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), the House’s fourth-ranking Republican.

Rigell has been one of the leading Republican voices urging the GOP to pass a measure to reopen the government, even without getting significant changes to the Affordable Care Act in return.

“We’re on the same page, but we need to be able to articulate specific objectives,” he continued, jabbing his finger in the air to make the point, before an aide came over to suggest that the two continue the conversation in private.

But the low point of the day came when a spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) accused Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) of having a physical altercation with another Cantor aide on the House floor.

Crowley denied touching the aide during the incident, which came after Republicans shut down an attempt by Democrats to lodge repeated requests for the chamber to consider a bill to reopen the government without any conditions.

“He had come to our side and was yelling across the aisles that they were shutting down the debate and pulling the bill,” Crowley told reporters shortly after the incident.

“I said to him then, the staffer is shutting down democracy! And he said, ‘That’s right,’ ” Crowley said.

Crowley said it was the aide who was out of line and who in fact apologized for his conduct after the encounter. A Cantor spokesman said later that all sides had spoken and resolved the matter.

Talks were expected to continue in the Senate through Sunday, where several members expressed hope that a breakthrough was not far off — always darkest before the dawn, and all that.

“There’s good discussion going,” said Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.), generally one of the chamber’s sunniest members. “I see us getting there, in fits and starts.”

But, he conceded: “I think people are pretty tired and haggard.”

After all he was involved, publicly, from the beginning.

Last Friday, the American Center for Law and Justice (where I serve as Chief Counsel) filed its Second Amended Complaint against the United States, the IRS, and a legion of IRS officials. This Complaint, in which we represent 41 organizations in 22 states, presents perhaps the most complete story yet of the IRS conservative targeting scandal.

And it is an ugly story indeed.

What was sold to the American public as a low-level scandal perpetrated by a few rogue employees – a scandal stopped after senior officials became aware and asserted control – is now (to borrow a Watergate phrase) “no longer operative.”

[pullquote]

Instead, we detail a long-running assault on the Tea Party, beginning shortly after its emergence in 2009, that is empowered, encouraged, and orchestrated not only by senior IRS officials in Washington, but also through outright targeting by the White House, Congressional Democrats, and the mainstream media.

In fact, the IRS was doing little more than focusing its attention exactly where the president of the United States told it to focus – on the groups the president himself identified as a “threat to democracy.”

Consider President Obama’s aggressive public statements – made just as we now know senior IRS officials were intentionally and aggressively scrutinizing conservative groups’ applications for tax exemption.

On August 9, 2010 the president warned of “attack ads run by shadowy groups with harmless-sounding names” during his weekly radio address. The President said: We don’t know who’s behind these ads and we don’t know who’s paying for them . . . you don’t know if it’s a foreign controlled corporation. ... The only people who don’t want to disclose the truth are people with something to hide.”

On September 16, 2010, President Obama once again warned that some unidentified “foreign-controlled entity” could be providing “millions of dollars” for “attack ads.” Less than one week later, he complained that “nobody knows” the identities of the individuals who support conservative groups.

On September 22, 2010, President Obama warned of groups opposing his policies “pos[ing] as non-for-profit social and welfare trade groups” and he claimed such groups were “guided by seasoned Republican political operatives” and potentially supported by some unidentified “foreign controlled entity.”

On October 14, 2010, President Obama called organizations with “benign sounding” names “a problem for democracy”; the next week he complained about individuals who “hide behind those front groups,” called such groups a “threat to our democracy,” and claimed such groups were engaged in “unsupervised” spending.

Next, consider the IRS’s actions following those statements. Not only did the IRS continue its targeting, it issued broad questionnaires that made unconstitutionally-intrusive inquiries designed to get answers to exactly the questions President Obama posed.

Who are your donors?

What is the political activity of your family and associates?

What are the passwords for your websites?

After all, according to the president, you’re only afraid to answer these questions if “you’ve got something to hide.”

The demagoguery is breathtaking. Not only does he raise the wholly-unsubstantiated possibility of shadowy “foreign” involvement in the Tea Party groups, a charge incredible on its face, but he goes the extra mile of calling such groups, a “threat to our democracy.”

When the president of the United States declares these groups a “threat to our democracy” is it any surprise that his enthusiastic supporters (and donors) within the IRS responded with an unprecedented campaign of selective targeting, intimidation, and governmental intrusion?

One grows weary of stating the obvious, but if President Bush had declared a specific category of citizen groups a “threat to democracy” potentially run by “political operatives” or “foreign-controlled,” and the IRS launched an unprecedented campaign of targeting and intrusive questioning, the mainstream media would have been relentless not only in its independent investigations but in its calls for accountability – at the highest levels.

Was the president of the United States involved in the IRS scandal? He was the one who identified the targets – in the most public manner possible.

A president singling out citizens groups for targeting and intrusive questioning merely because he dislikes their message and fears their political influence?

Now that is a “threat to democracy.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/gop-leader-warns-attacks-free-speech-080754980.html,,[],GOP leader warns of attacks on free speech,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate Republican leader, who last year accused the Obama administration of Nixon-style dirty tricks, said Friday the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups is part of a broader government assault on free speech.

Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky seized on the spate of controversies besetting the White House, saying Americans are recognizing a pattern of attack on First Amendment rights across government agencies, the administration, President Barack Obama's congressional allies, left-wing groups and public employee unions.

""As serious as the IRS scandal is, what we're dealing with here is larger than the actions of one agency or any group of employees,"" McConnell, who is up for re-election next year, said in a speech to the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""This administration has institutionalized the practice of pitting bureaucrats against the very people they're supposed to be serving, and it needs to stop.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the charge leveled by McConnell was ""demonstrably bogus.""

""As I'm sure the minority leader in the Senate is aware, the independent inspector general has testified and has made clear in his report that he has found no evidence that anyone outside of the IRS had any involvement in the inappropriate targeting of conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status,"" Carney said.

Speaking to the same organization last year, McConnell accused the administration and Obama's re-election campaign of leaking tax information and maintaining an enemies list in a chilling style reminiscent of President Richard Nixon, the Republican who resigned in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal. McConnell's criticism was largely dismissed as election-year hyperbole.

In the first six months of Obama's second term, the administration's problems have produced an assortment of political targets for Republicans. One is the IRS affair, which has resulted in resignations and departures from the agency. So far, no evidence has come to light that anyone in the Obama administration outside the IRS was involved in targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status.

Story continues

Other issues facing the Obama administration this year include government surveillance of phone and Internet records; its handling of last year's terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans; the Justice Department's seizure of phone records of journalists at The Associated Press and, in another case, reading the emails of Fox News reporter James Rosen.

McConnell referred to the IRS episode with a bit of I-told-you-so.

""When I warned about all this last year, I got slammed by the usual suspects on the left. They said I was full of it,"" he said. ""But even some of them now seem to realize that just because McConnell is the one pulling the alarm doesn't mean there isn't a fire. The IRS scandal has reminded people of the temptations to abuse that big government, and its political patrons, are prone to. People are waking up to a pattern here.""

In comments certain to appeal to Republican voters, McConnell described public sector unions as power hungry and able to expand their reach with the help of congressional friends. He said the unions no longer serve the public's interest but rather serve the government's.

""There's no better illustration of this than the announcement this week that in the midst of congressional hearings into their activities, unionized employees at the IRS are about to get $70 million in bonuses,"" McConnell complained.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said earlier this week that the IRS plans to hand out $70 million in bonuses to employees. Under a contract with the employees' union, IRS workers can receive individual performance bonuses of up to $3,500 a year.

In response to Grassley's criticism, the agency said it's under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement with the National Treasury Employees Union. The agency and the union say they are in negotiations over the matter.

Her father, Paul Laxalt, was himself a U.S. senator from Nevada from 1974 to 1987 and served as chairman of the Republican National Committee. He is still active in politics; the 90-year-old worked behind the scenes to build support in Nevada for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Laxalt declined to comment.

In her own statement to the paper, Michelle Laxalt said she asked Domenici to ""agree that this remain private between the two of us."" She raised the son, Adam Paul Laxalt, as a single mother. According to past Virginia voter registration records, he was born in August 1978, 35 years ago. Michelle Laxalt would have been 24 at the time; Domenici would have been 46.

""Given the fact that both my father and the father of my child were United States senators, I felt strongly that I would make this choice according to my values and would not seek advice, input or permission,"" she said. Laxalt's sister Kathleen (Neena) Laxalt was clueless.

Adam Laxalt is not commenting on his parents' relationship.

""I have lived my entire life as a private citizen and intend to remain one,"" he said. ""I plan to address personal issues privately and will not be commenting or joining any public discussion.""

The 80-year-old Domenici retired in 2008 after six terms, citing a degenerative brain disease. He and his wife, Nancy, have eight children. He told the Albuquerque Journal that his family has known about his affair for several months.

“I have apologized as best as I can to my wife, and we have worked together to strengthen our relationship,” he said.

Adam Laxalt is a lawyer working in Las Vegas, who served five years in the Navy. After a troubled adolescence that included a battle with alcoholism, he got a bachelors and law degree from Georgetown University. He provided legal counsel on detainee operations in Iraq. He also served as a law clerk for the U.S. Air Force general counsel; as an aide to John Bolton in the State Department; and as a staffer for former senator John Warner (R-Va.). He has written op-eds on health-care reform and Don't Ask Don't Tell, among other issues. Michelle Laxalt is the founder of a Washington lobbying firm who served in the Reagan administration.

Domenici is not the only lawmaker (or former lawmaker) to have hidden a child. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), who is unmarried, recently disclosed that he has a 24-year-old daughter whom he learned about three years ago. A 2008 drunken driving incident led former congressman Vito Fossella (R-N.Y.) to acknowledge his long-running affair and out-of-wedlock daughter. Essie Mae Washington-Williams, the mixed-race daughter whom Strom Thurmond kept secret for 70 years, died earlier this month. She revealed her parentage only after her father, a former senator from South Carolina, died in 2003."

Talking to Mr. Cutler in his deep headmaster's monotone, Mr. Cheney dispenses with the fig leaf of ""we."" He no longer feigns deference to W., whom he now disdains for favoring Condi over him in the second term and for not pardoning ""Cheney's Cheney,"" Scooter Libby. ""I had a job to do,"" he said. Continuing: ""I got on the telephone with the president, who was in Florida, and told him not to be at one location where we could both be taken out."" Mr. Cheney kept W. flying aimlessly in the air on 9/11 while he and Lynn left on a helicopter for a secure undisclosed location, leaving Washington in a bleak, scared silence, with no one reassuring the nation in those first terrifying hours. ""I gave the instructions that we'd authorize our pilots to take [the Pennsylvania flight] out... After I'd given the order, it was pretty quiet. Everybody had heard it, and it was obviously a significant moment.""

In his memoir, W. described feeling ""blindsided"" again and again. In this film, the blindsider is the eminence grise who was supposed to shore up the untested president. The documentary reveals the Iago lengths that Mr. Cheney went to in order to manipulate the unprepared Junior Bush... ...He filled W.'s head with stories about conflicts between presidents and vice presidents sparked by the vice president's ambition, while protesting that he himself did not want the job. ...He was always goosing up W.'s insecurities so he could take advantage of them. To make his crazy and appallingly costly detour from Osama to Saddam by cherry-picking his fake case for invading Iraq, he played on W.'s fear of being lampooned as a wimp, as his father had been.

There's no more pretending that this was anything other than a Cheney presidency, at least for Bush's un-elected 'first term.' Don't believe me? Read on:Read more: http://www.post-gazette.com/...

Here's a deal: I can almost forgive Bush--I'll settle for Cheney in prison and Bush can be convicted of the crimes that he committed and then have his sentence commuted. It's incredible to compare what happened with Watergate--remember Barbara Jordan?--to the rabbit role we went down with Iraq, torture, spying, vote-rigging, kickbacks, conflicts of interest, corporate giveaways, economic terrorism and inside men.

This is a matter of justice and responsibility. This failure does not hang solely on President Obama's head or Nancy Pelosi's, although she sure deserves a lot of the blame. It hangs on the whole Democratic Party, and the whole nation, including the rotten state of the Republican Party."

Today, the House passed the so-called Retail Investor Protection Act 254 to 166. 30 Democrats voted with 224 Republicans in favor. 165 Democrats--and one Republican--voted against it. Those following H.R. 2374 thought it would pass with wide bipartisan margins, so having 165 Democratic NAY's was better than expected. The 30 Democratic YEA's still need to be named and shamed, however.

First, let's begin with the important question: What is the Retail Investor Protection Act? The bill delays a new Department of Labor rule that would prevent financial advisers from stealing from your 401(K) plans or IRAs. Allowing financial advisers to rip you off is a great complement to that other plank in the Republican-Conservadem retirement insecurity platform, cutting Social Security.

Here's David Dayen with more details:

The Labor Department proposal, known as the “fiduciary rule,” would change the ethical standards by which employer-based retirement products like 401(k)’s and IRAs are marketed and sold. The rule has not been updated since 1975, before 401(k)’s and IRAs even existed. The Labor Department wants to broaden the definition of a “fiduciary” to cover all financial advisers who offer individual investment advice for a fee. Under the rule, they would be legally required to work in the best interest of their clients. For example, a fiduciary would not be able to push investment products on customers in which they have a financial stake. The agency defines the goal of the proposal as “to ensure that potential conflicts of interest among advisers are not allowed to compromise the quality of investment advice that millions of American workers rely on, so they can retire with the dignity that they have worked hard to achieve.” ... Currently, it is depressingly common for financial advisers, more than 80 percent of whom are not fiduciaries, to self-deal when offering advice. First off, they obtain large fees from the retirement products they sell. According to the think tank Demos, a median-income, two-earner household will pay $155,000 during their lifetime to financial advisers on average. (The lifetime gains for two-earner households from retirement accounts are around $230,000, meaning that nearly two-thirds of the profits go to the industry.) Second, non-fiduciary financial advisers can enjoy kickbacks; right now there is no rule against an adviser from a mutual fund company encouraging clients to put their money in specific funds sold by that company. In fact, that’s the norm, and the adviser typically receives a commission for the sale. Conflicts of interest like this cost retirement investors at least $1 billion a month, because the funds they get channeled into underperform the alternatives. Financial advisers also encourage rollovers into high-cost IRAs when an individual changes jobs. None of these schemes have to be disclosed to the customer, under the current standard. The National Bureau for Economic Research found in a recent study that “adviser self‐interest plays an important role in generating advice that is not in the best interest of the clients.” So in the middle of a retirement crisis, when the majority of Americans already aren’t accumulating the savings they need to maintain their standard of living, sellers of retirement products are skimming close to $60 billion a year off the top through deceptive practices, making a bad situation even worse.

Now that we know what it is, let's move to the next question: Who voted for it?

The lone Republican NO was Walter Jones (NC-03).

And here are the 30 Democratic YEA votes. Most of their names should look familiar if you've seen any of my past roll call diaries.

My Cat's Number One Priority is His Own Needs.

Geoffrey has a routine. As cats go, and I have had many, he's the most routine-driven feline I have ever met. He's deeply conservative that way. If I'm not up by 7am, he sees to it that I am and then flumpity flump down the stairs to the door. Out he goes just long enough for me to freshen his food and water, which I have paid for. He doesn't care if I have to pee first, or forgot to put out the garbage on garbage day, he has his routine and nobody is going to change it. The next thing he does is come in and eat that food, that FREE food, and he's smug and entitled when he does it. He then makes a commentary on his human companion:

Fig. 2. After consuming his food with an attitude of smug entitlement, he sends a message to the 99%.

2. My Cat is a Racist.

Geoffrey is an unapologetic racist. Like the GOP with banksters and corporate types, he cozies up to people, even new people, because they keep the slush fund of food, water, litter and catnip flowing like the Mighty Mississippi. But as far as other animals are concerned, if you're another animal and you're not a ragdoll cat like he is, he'll deliver an angry screed and may attack you. I have never seen such rank racism, or at least not since the last time Rand Paul gave a speech.

3. My Cat is a Sadistic Authoritarian.

Geoffrey believes in the death penalty for vermin, but he's not content to use some supposedly humane form of execution, oh no. He is both a practitioner and advocate of torture of the most ugly sort and expects--no, demands approval and support for that by bringing these poor creatures into the house half dead. If he were a member of Congress, he'd perform an execution live on C-SPAN just to make a point.

4. My Cat is a Lazy Bum.

Not only does Geoffrey enjoy an exalted position in the household, he feels entitled to more vacation than he has earned, very much like a Republican politician.

5. My Cat is a Conspiracy Theorist



In the 1960s, a regular non-pedigreed white domestic longhaired cat named Josephine, who had produced several litters of typical cats, was injured in an accident involving a car and taken to the veterinary hospital at the University of California. Josephine was of a Persian/Angora type and had litters sired by several unknown male Birman or Burmese-like cats, one of which had the Siamese point coloration. Baker believed that Josephine was subject to a secret government genetic experiment during treatment at the lab, and claimed that it made Josephine docile, relaxed when picked up, and immune to pain.

Fig. 5. Docile sun-basker or government conspiracy? I report, you decide.

So there you have it, my feline friend, five reasons why I think you're a Republican member of the 1%. The revolution's a coming, Geoffy, and you can't do a thing to stop it.

Virginia’s first lady has taken the field as a cheerleader for both the Washington Redskins and her husband.

Virginia’s first lady has taken the field as a cheerleader for both the Redskins and her husband, Gov. Robert. F. McDonnell.

Virginia’s first lady has taken the field as a cheerleader for both the Redskins and her husband, Gov. Robert. F. McDonnell.

Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell bought nearly $9,800 in clothing with money from her husband’s political action committee and tapped into his campaign and inaugural funds to buy $7,600 in mostly unspecified items, according to records and a representative for the PAC.

The spending is legal under Virginia’s lax campaign finance laws, which prohibit the conversion of political funds for private use only when a PAC or campaign committee disbands — not while it is operating.

But the purchases are unusual in Virginia, where campaign finance records indicate that candidates do not routinely dip into political funds to buy personal items such as clothing for themselves or their spouses.

Maureen McDonnell’s use of political donations comes to light at a time when she and her husband, Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R), are under intense scrutiny for accepting luxury items and $120,000 in loans from wealthy Virginia businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr. Federal and state investigators are probing the Star Scientific executive’s ties to the McDonnells, who promoted his firm’s nutritional supplement, Anatabloc. Last week the governor apologized for embarrassing the commonwealth and repaid the loans.

Several gifts that have drawn investigators’ attention seem aimed at polishing Maureen McDonnell’s image as first lady. They are looking into whether the former Washington Redskins cheerleader and mother of five received free cosmetic dental work from a Richmond-area dentist, jewelry from a state delegate and a $15,000 Bergdorf Goodman shopping spree from Williams.

Using political money for clothes helped McDonnell step up her style while her family’s finances were hit by the plunging real estate market.

Bob McDonnell won the 2009 governor’s race as several properties that he and his family bought for a combined $3.84 million at the height of the real estate boom had lost value. Maureen McDonnell complained to officials at Opportunity Virginia PAC that she didn’t have the wardrobe or resources necessary for her new role as first lady, according to a person familiar with the PAC’s operations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to maintain a relationship with the McDonnells.

Maureen McDonnell was given a PAC credit card, according to that person. A representative of the PAC confirmed Friday that the card was provided to the first lady, but he added that she no longer has it. The representative answered questions on behalf of the committee on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the ongoing investigations.

Rich Galen, a private spokesman for the governor and first lady on matters related to the investigations, said that Maureen McDonnell was borrowing the clothes, which would be donated to charity after Bob McDonnell completes his term in January. The PAC also said that the items will be returned to the committee and then donated to charity.

Asked in a brief phone interview whether the committee spent money on department-store clothing, Phil Cox, director of the PAC and executive director of the Republican Governors Association, said: “All of the PAC expenditures are publicly available. What’s there is there.” Cox does not sign off on the PAC’s expense reports.

Outfitting herself

Maureen McDonnell has charged about $9,800 in clothing to the PAC, but that is not obvious from campaign finance reports filed by the committee.

None of the items the first lady put on the PAC credit card was identified as clothing in public records available online through the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. The purchases are billed as “event expenses” and “travel expenses.” At times, however, the vendor listed suggests clothing: Nordstrom, Macy’s, Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord & Taylor and Ann Taylor. In all, the PAC spent $6,300 at those stores.

In those cases where the stores are identified, nothing in the public record links the purchases to Maureen McDonnell.

Her name is listed on three additional PAC expenses totaling about $3,500. But in those instances, the records do not indicate what was bought or where. Instead of clothing stores, the vendor listed is “Maureen McDonnell.” The purchases are identified as “travel expenses” and “event expenses.”

But the PAC representative confirmed that $9,800 in purchases — all of those publicly linked either to the clothing stores or to the first lady — were clothing for her. He said they were bought for official gubernatorial or political events.

She spent $2,379 at Nordstrom over two days in March 2012 and another $535 there a month before that, all to prepare for a trip to California to market Virginia products and attend a Republican Governors Association meeting.

She spent $1,121 in July 2012 at Saks to buy clothes for a gala celebrating the bicentennial of the governor’s mansion.

She spent about $6,000 around the time of McDonnell’s January 2010 inauguration, about half of that for clothing charged to the PAC. The other half: $3,087 that Bob McDonnell’s inaugural committee paid to her for unspecified “event expenses.”

The PAC representative said it was not clear what she bought with the inaugural funds. With the committee now closed and original receipts and other records in storage, he said the answer was not readily available.

Maureen McDonnell also received payments from two other committees associated with her husband. The Bob McDonnell for Governor committee paid her $2,369 in unspecified “event” and “travel” expenses in July and September 2009. Bob McDonnell for Attorney General reimbursed her $1,021 for a camera in August 2007 and $1,104 that December for unspecified “event supplies.”

The representative said he did not know what the camera was for. The nature of the other reimbursements also was unclear because records from those now-closed committees also are in storage, he said. Also unexplained was the $1,100 that Bob McDonnell for Governor spent at Dick’s Sporting Goods over three days in late October 2009.

‘No restriction’

When a campaign committee or PAC is being disbanded, candidates are prohibited from converting any surplus funds to personal use for themselves or immediate relatives. But while a political committee is running, “there are no restrictions,” said Nikki Sheridan, spokeswoman for the Virginia State Board of Elections.

“If they wanted to use the money to send their kids to college, they could probably do that,” she said. “There is no restriction on clothing, grooming or legal fees unless you’re shutting down your PAC.”

The law is one of the nation’s most lax. Most states restrict personal use at any stage in the life of a political committee, according to Karen Shanton, a legislative studies specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. But it is in keeping with Virginia’s no-limits, full-disclosure approach to campaign finance generally. The state has no caps on political contributions. And officeholders are allowed to take personal gifts of any value as long as they report those worth more than $50.

State elections officials said it is not unusual for candidates to call asking if they can charge their campaigns for the clothing they wear in the course of running for office. They are told that it is not illegal.

Whether it is a wise public relations move is another matter.

Del. Onzlee Ware (D-Roanoke) drew attention in 2009 for using campaign funds for personal items, including a YMCA membership.

State Board of Elections officials reviewed his spending but concluded there was no violation of the law after the attorney general’s office advised them in writing that the law “does not prohibit the personal use of campaign contributions by candidates or office holders unless or until” they disband their committees.

Even so, it appears to be more the exception than the rule that Virginia politicians use political funds to fill their closets.

U.S. Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D) has had one clothing expense paid for with campaign funds — $708 at Nordstrom — since he ran for governor in 2004.

State Sen. A. Donald McEachin (D-Richmond), charged a $794 tuxedo from Franco’s Fine Clothier to his campaign account in early 2009 but refunded his campaign in mid-2010. McEachin said he had meant to pay personally for the tuxedo, which he was buying for an Urban League dinner, but accidentally pulled out his campaign credit card. He said he made the refund after discovering the error.

At least a handful of other Virginia candidates have billed their campaigns for relatively modest clothing or tailoring services.

The man Bob McDonnell defeated in 2009, state Sen. R. Creigh Deeds (D-Bath) charged $42 at Macy’s, $38 in Kohl’s and $84 at Dick’s Sporting Goods in the course of his campaign. All of the purchases were identified on his reports as clothing. He also billed his campaign for more than $500 in dry cleaning charges while he was on the campaign trail.

Deeds said he couldn’t recall what any of the clothing purchases were for, but said they were small and probably related to the difficulties of the hectic campaign pace.

“You’re out and you spill coffee on a necktie in the morning and you have big things to do the rest of the day,” he said, speaking hypothetically. “You’ve got to go out and buy a new necktie.”

Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II’s gubernatorial campaign spent $182 at Macy’s in May after the Republican showed up to shoot a TV commercial with two blue shirts.

“[W]e needed the AG in various color shirts, so a staffer went to Macy’s and purchased what was needed,” campaign spokeswoman Anna Nix said via e-mail. “As a practice, the AG does not believe [in using] nor use campaign funds for personal use.”"
http://www.usatoday.com/story/onpolitics/2013/02/20/pete-domenici-son-laxalt-senate/1932823/,2013-02-20 00:00:00,[],Ex-senator Domenici reveals son after 30 years,"Catalina Camia, USA TODAY

Here's a talker: Former senator Pete Domenici acknowledged he fathered a son outside of his marriage mroe than 30 years ago — with the daughter of another senator, Paul Laxalt.

Domenici, a New Mexico Republican who was once the top budget expert in Congress, revealed his secret to the Albuquerque Journal. The Associated Press picked up the story Wednesday.

Domenici, 80, and Michelle Laxalt released statements to the Albuquerque paper saying Domenici is the father of her son, Las Vegas lawyer Adam Laxalt. ""One night's mistake led to a pregnancy 30 years ago,"" she said.

The former senator and Michelle Laxalt indicated they were disclosing Adam Laxalt's fatherhood ""because they thought somebody might soon attempt to make it public, with her statement saying she thought someone would shop it to the media to smear Domenici,"" according to the AP.

Michelle Laxalt said they agreed to keep the fatherhood a secret because Domenici and her father, a Nevada Republican, were serving in the U.S. Senate at the same time.

Domenici is a former Senate Budget Committee chairman, who is known for his advocacy on mental health and nuclear energy. He served from 1973 to 2009 and was New Mexico's longest-serving senator. He retired because of health reasons and has a brain disease.

""I deeply regret this and am very sorry for my behavior,"" Domenici said in his statement. ""I hope New Mexicans will view that my accomplishments for my beloved state outweigh my personal transgression.""

Domenici told the Albuquerque paper that he has apologized to his wife, Nancy, with whom he has eight children. The ex-senator appeared before the Senate this month, introducing Treasury secretary nominee Jack Lew at his confirmation hearing.

In New Mexico, political observers hope Domenici will be remembered for his legislative work.

""There is no question that Sen. Pete Domenici accomplished innumerable positive results for New Mexico and our great nation over his 36-year tenure as a New Mexico senator,"" said John Billingsley, chairman of the state Republican Party. ""It is my hope that the people of New Mexico remember him for those accomplishments.""

t's not the first time that a lawmaker has been quiet about a child. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., revealed that he has a 24-year-old daughter — which he did after inquiries were made about the woman he was texting during the State of the Union Address.

“Let me be clear” he said on the Senate floor the other day. “I don’t trust the Republicans, and I don’t trust the Democrats.” And why not? The last four years have given us all ample reason not to trust the Democrats, as $1 trillion deficits have become the new normal and the national debt has zoomed toward $17 trillion, all under the Obama-Pelosi-Reid team’s watch.

But what about the Republicans, who so often claim to be the party of limited government? The truth is, the GOP’s record is seldom as grand as its rhetoric. Aside from a few Tea Party stalwarts, plenty of Republican senators are ready to throw in the towel on the debt ceiling, let it go up, and get a few scraps from the Democrats in return.

“Here is the dirty little secret about some of those on the right side of the aisle,” Cruz was quoted in the New York Times. “There are some who would very much like to cast a symbolic vote against raising the debt ceiling and nonetheless allow our friends on the left side of the aisle to raise the debt ceiling. That, to some Republicans, is the ideal outcome.”

He is right about that. Senior Republican staffers in Congress tell me that members of the Republican Leadership in both houses of Congress are terrified of not raising the debt ceiling, having been convinced that calamity will ensue if we don’t. But the alternative? Senate Majority Leader McConnell would, I am told, be happy to see the debt ceiling raised with no Republican votes. Then Republicans can beat up Democrats for raising it, while knowing that the economy won’t explode as Paul Krugman has warned it would.

And if House Speaker John Boehner had to choose between a clean debt ceiling increase (one with no limits, allowing Obama to keep raising it ad nauseum) and no debt ceiling increase at all, I am told he would take the former by conservatives in the House of Representatives.

So the establishment Republican mind-set says, “More debt is better than a melt-down, but at least get something in return, even if it doesn’t mean much, we have something to run against the Democrats with.” What do they want in return? They know they don’t have the votes to get much in the way of budget cuts, so they can at least keep the base happy with talk about “economic growth.”

When Cruz, who is anything but your traditional freshman back-bench Senator, said he didn’t trust Republicans, the party establishment, led by John McCain, howled in response. But where is the Republican leadership’s credibility? When they last held real power, these Republicans goosed up domestic discretionary spending faster than it rose under Bill Clinton and piled on the debt.

It was under a Republican president and Congress that we got Medicare Part D, the biggest new entitlement since LBJ’s Great Society. The prescription drug benefit added trillions to Medicare’s unfunded liabilities, passed only when party bosses needed to violate normal procedures to get the votes to pass it. Former U.S. Comptroller David Walker called it “the most fiscally irresponsible piece of legislation since the 1960s.”

Medicare’s chief actuary, Richard Foster, later said he was threatened not to reveal that the drug benefit’s price tag would exceed $400 billion in the first ten years. This figure was necessary under congressional rules to keep the bill from being blocked on a point of order. Foster estimated the real price tag was in excess of $500 billion. Several GOP congressmen would also recount arm-twisting tactics from the party leadership that went beyond the norm.

Instead of reducing the federal role in education, the Bush Administration and Republicans in Congress gave us No Child Left Behind, which helped double the size of the Department of Education, a Cabinet-level agency Republicans had pledged to abolish as recently as 1996. John Boehner, now the speaker of the House, was an NCLB sponsor and described its enactment as “one of the proudest accomplishments of my tenure in Congress.”

Under a Republican president and Congress, a $128 billion surplus was replaced by a $455 billion deficit. By the time George W. Bush left office, the shortfall was $1.2 trillion. Discretionary spending went up faster in Bush’s first term than it did in eight years under Bill Clinton. Under Bush’s watch, the federal budget exceeded $2 trillion, and then $3 trillion, for the first time. Most of these milestones were reached before the Democrats retook Congress. Federal spending rose from 18.4 percent of GDP to an average of 20.51 percent under Bush.

Bush and the Republican establishment bailed out the Wall Street banks with the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program (with Democratic support, naturally). They bailed out the auto industry. They even pioneered a pre-Obama stimulus program, with similar results. The deficits and government growth would later endanger the Bush tax cuts, one of the signature conservative policy achievements of the period.

The Republicans who would negotiate the debt ceiling with the Democrats in a conference will be the same people who voted for all this big government and their successors. This unfortunately includes even Paul Ryan. What faith can we have that the results will be different this time?

So is there any doubt at all why Ted Cruz doesn’t trust Republicans? He explained that he thinks “a whole lot of Americans likewise don’t trust the Republicans and the Democrats because it is leadership in both parties that has gotten us in this mess.”

Maybe we need new leadership."

Their favorable ratings are terrible and getting worse. But there is broad concern it could go from worse to an unmitigated disaster this fall. Most urgently, according to a slew of key Republicans we interviewed, conservative GOP senators have got to give up their insistence that the party allow the government to shut down after Sept. 30 if they don’t get their way on defunding Obamacare.

The quixotic drive — led by Rubio, Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee — is part of Rubio’s effort to make up with the conservative base after he was stunned by the backlash over his deal-making on immigration. Pollsters say the funding fight makes Republicans look even more obstructionist, and causes voters to worry about the effect a shutdown would have on their own finances.

Whit Ayres of North Star Opinion Research, who has been drilling down on this issue for the conservative public-opinion group Resurgent Republic, said: “Shutting down the government is the one way that Republicans can turn Obamacare from a political advantage to a political disadvantage in 2014.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/ethics-committee-extends-michele-bachmann-probe-185336600.html,,[],Ethics committee extends Michele Bachmann probe,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Allegations surrounding Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann and her brief presidential campaign are getting further examination from the House Ethics Committee.

The panel said in a brief statement Friday it is extending until at least September a review of Bachmann's case, which was referred to it by the Office of Congressional Ethics, an independent investigative body. The panel said it would announce any further action by Sept. 11.

The committee announced similar extensions of OCE investigations for three other members of Congress: Reps. Tim Bishop, D-N.Y., Pete Roskam, R-Ill., and John Tierney, D-Mass. The panel said it would announce further action on those cases, too, in September.

William McGinley, a lawyer for Bachmann, acknowledged the OCE investigation in March, saying it was tied to her presidential bid and that the tea party favorite was cooperating with the investigation. Bachmann has denied any wrongdoing but announced in May she would not seek re-election.

In a statement Friday, McGinley said the committee's extension was routine and expressed confidence that Bachmann will be vindicated.

""Today's statement by the House Ethics Committee emphasizes that its customary 45-day extension does not 'indicate that any violation has occurred, or reflect any judgment on behalf of the Committee,'"" McGinley said. ""It does not speak to the merits of this matter, and any inference to the contrary is false.""

He added, ""We are confident the committee will discover, upon proper review, that the highly politicized allegations made at the OCE level were baseless and without merit.""

The OCE is an independent House panel run by a board of directors who are outside Congress, although some of them are former lawmakers. The OCE's investigative reports and recommendations for further investigation go to the member-run House Ethics Committee, the panel that decides whether rules were violated. The committee can then vote to continue investigations, launch its own formal investigations or dismiss cases outright.

Story continues

OCE referred each of the investigations to Ethics Committee in June, recommending full investigations. The House committee was required to take action on the cases or release the full reports of the OCE by Sunday. Instead, it will continue to look into all of the cases for another 45 days.

Because not all of the OCE reports were revealed Friday, it's not clear what specifically some of the investigations of the lawmakers entail.

In a statement, Tierney said he believed the OCE investigation involving him was related to his personal financial disclosure reports.

""I welcome the opportunity to finally put this issue to rest after many years of my opponents attacking me,"" Tierney said.

Ethicial questions surrounded Tierney's bruising 2012 re-election campaign against former State Sen. Richard Tisei.

Tierney's wife, Patrice Tierney, served one month in federal prison in 2011 after admitting she was ""willfully blind"" to the source of millions of dollars in income for her brothers, Robert and Daniel Eremian, who were running an illegal, offshore gambling operation.

Patrice Tierney managed a checking account for her brother Robert and helped him to prepare a false tax return, according to her plea agreement.

John Tierney has always denied any involvement in his wife's activities and was re-elected last year. He also has defended his wife, saying she was wronged by her brothers and believed the income in the account she managed was from legal businesses and services.

Bishop also faced ethics complaints during his 2012 re-election campaign. He was criticized by his Republican opponent for helping a constituent — who later donated $5,000 to his campaign — to obtain a fireworks permit.

""As I have said many times, I welcome a fair-minded review of the facts because I have done nothing wrong,"" Bishop said.

Roskam's office said in a statement the OCE investigation into him involved a trip he took to Taiwan. Roskam spokeswoman Stephanie Kittredge said he informed the Ethics Committee about the trip and his planned activities on it before he left.

Roskam took the unusual step of publicizing his OCE report on Friday because he said he had done nothing wrong.

""The record reflects that Rep. Roskam fully complied with all laws, rules, and procedures related to privately sponsored travel,"" Kittredge said. ""The trip was vetted and approved by the House Ethics Committee, the body legally authorized to make determinations on congressional conduct.""

Bachmann's White House bid ended quickly after a disappointing sixth-place finish in the Iowa's leadoff presidential caucuses but has caused lingering problems for her.

In January, a former Bachmann aide sent a letter to the Federal Election Commission alleging that Bachmann made improper payments to an Iowa state senator who served as her state chairman. A suit by a different aide alleging that someone in her team stole a private email list of home-school supporters for use in the campaign was dismissed last month.

Earlier this month, Javier Sanchez, a former top aide to Bachmann, was arrested and charged with thefts that took place in a House office building. Sanchez has left Bachmann's office and is charged with theft of money or goods less than $1,000 in value."

Most Americans think the IRS broke the law by targeting Tea Party groups for harassment.

But only 17%25 think it is even somewhat likely that anyone will be charged.

The lesson for the country is that trust in the government is very low.

So last week, while most of the country was talking about football or fears of a government shutdown, Rasmussen released a poll that should worry everyone -- but especially incumbent Democrats in Congress. According to Rasmussen's survey, most Americans think the IRS broke the law by targeting Tea Party groups for harassment, but few expect it to be punished. Fifty-three percent think the IRS broke the law by targeting the Tea Party and other conservative groups like the voter-integrity outfit True The Vote; only 24% disagreed. But only 17% think it is even somewhat likely that anyone will be charged, while 74% think that criminal charges are unlikely.

So a majority of Americans think that government officials who exercise an important trust broke the law, but only a very small number think anything will be done to punish them.

There are a couple of lessons to draw from this. One is bad for the country in general, but the other is bad for congressional Democrats.

The lesson for the country is that trust in the government is very low. (In another Rasmussen poll, 70% think that government and big business often work together against consumers and investors. According to Gallup, trust in government is lower than during Watergate.) But it's worse than that.

Believing that government officials break the law is one thing; believing that they face no consequences when they're caught and it becomes public is another. Not only is this a sort of ""broken windows"" signal to other bureaucrats -- hey, you can break the law and get away with it -- but it's particularly damaging where the IRS is concerned.

America's tax system, despite the feared IRS audit, is fundamentally based on voluntary compliance. If everyone starts cheating, there aren't enough IRS agents to make a dent. Beyond taxes, that's true regarding compliance with the law in general. Moral legitimacy is what makes honest people obey the law even when they can get away with breaking it. Undermine that and you get a country like, say, Italy, where tax evasion is a national sport.

Meanwhile, there's another bit of bad news buried in that poll, this time for Democrats. The bad news is that a majority of Americans thinks the IRS broke the law even though the news media have consistently downplayed the scandal. But as the scandal has dragged on for months, word has filtered out anyway. Come 2014, the government's damaged brand will reflect poorly on members of the president's party, regardless of media efforts to protect them.

Beyond that, the Wall Street Journal's James Taranto has begun calling President Obama ""President Asterisk,"" saying that IRS efforts to weaken his opposition in the run-up to the 2012 election devalue Obama's victory the way illegal steroid use devalues an athlete's record-book standing. Taranto writes that this puts Obama in a situation that is in some ways worse than Nixon after Watergate: ""We now know that government corruption -- namely IRS persecution of dissenters -- was a factor in Obama's re-election.

To be sure, Obama himself has not, at least so far, been implicated in the IRS wrongdoing as Nixon ultimately was in Watergate. On the other hand, Nixon's re-election victory was so overwhelming that no one could plausibly argue Watergate was a necessary condition for it. The idea that Obama could not have won without an abusive IRS is entirely plausible.""

Of course, the press hated Nixon, while it is still doing everything it can to protect Obama. But, as we see, word filters out. Stay tuned.

http://news.yahoo.com/dem-congressman-compares-tea-party-to-ku-klux-klan-190728183.html,,[],Dem congressman compares tea party to Ku Klux Klan,"Controversial Democrat Alan Grayson has set off a flurry of criticism from conservatives after the Florida congressman sent out a fundraising email to supporters in which he compared the tea party to the Ku Klux Klan.



Grayson’s original comments came during a recent appearance on MSNBC’s “Politics Nation with Al Sharpton.” Grayson was discussing the tea party’s influence on the Republican Party when he said, “At this point, the tea party is no more popular than the Klan.”

And rather than shy away from that comment, Grayson included them in bold letters on his website with the quote taking readers directly to a fundraising page for Grayson’s re-election campaign.

Grayson’s fundraising page includes the image of a burning cross; it uses the cross as the letter “T” and spells out “tea party” in flaming letters:

""As a black Tea Party activist, I could say that there's nothing more offensive than equating the Tea Party with the Ku Klux Klan,” Jennifer Burke, National Outreach Director for TheTeaParty.net said in a statement emailed to Yahoo News. “The hate speech uttered by sitting congressman Alan Grayson is deplorable, even by the low levels reached in recent years when Democrats routinely call us racists and suicide bombers.""

Grayson’s comments were also criticized by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).

There’s no excuse for the hateful words and imagery used by Congressman Grayson,” NRCC spokesman Matt Gorman said in a statement. “House Democrats should swiftly and strongly condemn him and return the money he has raised for them. This hate-filled rhetoric has Americans fed up with Washington.”

Grayson is no stranger to controversy. First elected to Congress in 2008, he regularly was an outspoken critic of Republicans and conservatives in general. He was voted out of office after his first term, and many observers expected him to take a role as an activist outside of government. However, Grayson was re-elected in 2012 and is considered a strong favorite for re-election in 2014.

Despite the criticism over his KKK comparison, Grayson has stood by his comments and subsequent fundraising effort. He pointed to offensive comments and signage that appeared at past tea party rallies to justify his own comments.

“Tea Party members have circulated countless altered pictures depicting President Obama and the First Lady as monkeys. Tea Party members also called my fellow Member of Congress, civil rights hero John Lewis, a ‘n***ger,’ and Rep. Barney Frank a ‘faggot,’” Grayson said in a statement. “One could go on and on, because there is overwhelming evidence that the Tea Party is the home of bigotry and discrimination in America today, just as the KKK was for an earlier generation. If the shoe fits, wear it.”"

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/26/connor-boyack-police-reform_n_4149410.html,2013-10-26 00:00:00,"['Senior Writer', 'Investigative Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']",Meet The Activist Who's Bringing Conservatives On Board The Police Reform Movement,"This article is the third in a six-part series about the drug war and police reform. Read Part 2 here.

SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah is one of the reddest and most culturally conservative states in America. The statehouse would seem to be about as fertile ground for reining in the drug war and curbing police abuse as the briny marshes and salt flats just outside the capital. But if anyone can bring Utah's conservatives on board with police reform, it's probably Connor Boyack, a clean-cut Mormon with a Republican background who is also pushing the state to nullify the Affordable Care Act.

Boyack, 31, is the founder and president of the Libertas Institute, a state think tank with a libertarian bent. ""Utah politics is basically a debate between conservatives and libertarian-minded conservatives,"" he says. ""We help conservatives hone their free-market ideas, but we also want to persuade them to be more deferential to civil liberties. That I think is our niche.""

Boyack wrote about public policy for several years on his personal blog, built up a readership, and in August 2010 was hired to lead the Utah chapter of the Tenth Amendment Center, an advocacy group that pushes returning federal power to the states. The boyish-looking student of political philosophy also worked on the 2010 campaign of Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee. His credentials on the right are sound.

But he felt that more could be done on the state level, and in December 2011, he founded Libertas.

""One thing I noticed at the Tenth Amendment Center is that while liberty-minded Utah legislators could join arms to push back the federal government, they weren't nearly as skeptical of the government here in Utah,"" Boyack says. ""But if the government violates your rights, you haven't been any less violated if it came from state or local government instead of the federal government. The thing we try to stress at Libertas is consistency.""

He ran the organization part-time for about a year, but by January he had attracted enough funding that he was able to commit to it fully.

""What makes Connor unique -- and most effective -- is that he's willing to take on issues that the mainstream political right is generally afraid to touch,"" says Michael Boldin, executive director of the Tenth Amendment Center. ""They might even agree with him on the issues, but don't want to upset the status quo, so they do and say nothing. Connor, on the other hand, recognizes that it takes risk to get things done. And he certainly takes risks.""

Boyack gradually became interested in police reform as he was exposed to police abuse stories on social media. ""You can't really be active on Twitter or Facebook without seeing these stories, really on a daily basis,"" he says. ""And it isn't just the misconduct, it's that bad police officers are so rarely held accountable.""

After law enforcement officials raided the Ogden, Utah, home of Matthew David Stewart in response to a tip that he was growing marijuana plants in his basement, leading to a gun battle that left one officer dead and five others wounded, Boyack watched closely to see whether that type of scenario would play out.

""That case really catalyzed my focus. I watched at first from the sidelines -- followed the story closely. I'm not an activist or a protester. I tend to come at things from an education or legislative angle,"" he says.

""As it unfolded the way that it did, I was really disappointed. Once again, the police weren't being held accountable. The media narrative was that Matthew was this evil cop-killer. My concern was with the underlying policy, from a legislative standpoint. The police should not have come in to Stewart's house the way they did, all over a few plants. The law just shouldn't allow that to happen.""

As Stewart's supporters -- led by members of his family, as well as progressive activist Jesse Fruhwirth -- protested at Ogden city council meetings, Boyack took a broader view.

""I think what the protesters were doing was important,"" he says. ""But my thinking was that this wasn't just happening in Ogden. Police militarization is happening everywhere. So we were more interested in looking at the state as a whole.""

Boyack began reaching out to legislators, police organizations and activists to craft a bill that would restrict the use of SWAT teams to emergency scenarios, ones in which lives are at risk.

The policy he's pushing is relatively straightforward. Currently, police in Utah may forcibly enter any home, at any time, so long as they've obtained a search warrant. Under Boyack's proposal, officers would be permitted to break into a home only when there is an imminent threat of a violent crime.

The police would no longer be permitted to use battering rams or ""dynamic entry"" -- the term used to describe forcible entry, the use of flash grenades, and other paramilitary tactics -- to serve drug warrants. In Utah and across the country, drug investigations comprise the overwhelming majority of instances in which such tactics are used.

Last August, the Standard-Examiner ran an editorial in support of Boyack's cause. ""Certainly, the use of a battering rams to combat minor offenses is something that should not occur,"" the paper wrote. ""These raids, as conducted now, are too dangerous.""

""We're interested in saving lives,"" Boyack says. ""And we're as interested in saving the lives behind the gun as those in front of it.""

Boyack uses that line often. It hints at the realpolitik that may help explain why his message is finding a receptive audience. A cop died during the Stewart raid, and several more nearly joined him. Particularly in conservative Utah, saving the lives of police officers is a more effective sales pitch than saving the lives of suspected drug offenders.

""I don't think there's any question about it. If this law had been in place in 2011, both Officer [Jared] Francom and Matthew Stewart would still be alive,"" Boyack says. Stewart committed suicide in his jail cell while awaiting trial.

Boyack says many of the lawmakers he's talked to about his bill have been supportive. Indeed, several told The Huffington Post that they see the need for police reform, though they would not say so for attribution.

""The response has been surprisingly favorable,"" Boyack says. ""I think most lawmakers want to wait to see the final language, though. The bill should be collaborative, rather than combative. Few legislators will support a bill that's seen as anti-cop, but they're generally supportive of the higher idea.""

Ideally, Boyack would like to get a conservative lawmaker who otherwise supports the drug war to sponsor the bill.

""I think drugs should be decriminalized, but this bill isn't about legalization,"" he says. ""We can still keep drugs illegal, but enforce those laws in a way that doesn't put lives at risk. So I think it would be helpful to get a sponsor for the bill who has drug war bona fides, but understands that sending police officers to break into homes in the middle of the night creates unnecessary danger.""

But he worries that many politicians may be reluctant to publicly embrace the bill, even if they think it's the right thing to do, because they fear retribution.

""A few years ago, we tried to outlaw DUI checkpoints, which I think are a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and really are more about issuing citations and raising revenue for police departments than keeping the roads safe,"" he says. ""Law enforcement groups came out aggressively against the bill. But they also went after the bill's sponsor, [state Rep.] David Butterfield, when he ran for reelection.""

That bill passed the Utah House, but died in the Senate in February 2012. State police groups organized to support Butterfield's primary opponent in the 2012 election, and Butterfield lost.

""They got their scalp,"" Boyack says. ""I understand the concern about micromanaging police departments. I do. But everything police officers do is under authority given them by the legislature, through the people. It's the legislature's job to set the terms under which the laws will be enforced, and its the legislature's job to make sure our rights are protected, not just our safety.""

Boyack is the bridge-builder in Utah's burgeoning police reform movement. His task is to forge ties between the state's legislators and other policymakers, and activists and the families of those killed by police.

""By sticking his neck out and taking on a golden calf, he's able to bridge the divide with traditional political opponents,"" says The Tenth Amendment Center's Boldin.

He's also the pragmatist. For the moment, the bill he and his organization have proposed addresses only forced-entry police raids. It would have had no effect on the police shootings, beatings, and other allegations of misconduct around Utah that weren't the result of drug raids.

Some activists want to go further. They would like to see police get more training in interacting with the mentally ill, and they have called for the creation of civilian review boards with the teeth to issue subpoenas and force the termination of bad cops. Some, including Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank, think police need more instruction in conflict resolution, and that training and agency policy put too little emphasis on de-escalation, and too much on how and when to use force.

But Boyack says that for now, focusing on forced-entry is a more realistic goal.

""Our main goal here is to enact substantive reform. We don't just want a token bill that does more in name than in substance,"" Boyack says. ""But we also need a bill that will pass, and that will be reasonable. So for now, I think it makes sense to focus on the one area that will do the most good, and that in my opinion will save the most lives.""

I Got Tested For My Job,"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution

What this means is the government has to have "" information sufficient to warrant a prudent person's belief that the wanted individual had committed a crime (for an arrest warrant) or that evidence of a crime or contraband would be found in a search (for a search warrant) "". A person walking down the street can't be stopped or their house can't be searched unless the police have a concrete reason to stop the person or search the house. The police have to go before a judge and explain their probable cause and if the judge agrees then a warrant is issued for a search or an arrest.

Testing welfare recipients violates that principle because the government is searching a person without knowledge that the person is in fact taking drugs. The common saying is that it would be a ""fishing expedition"". Courts tend to frown on fishing expeditions.

Even police at traffic stops for drug interdiction have to ask the driver for permission to search their vehicle and only if they refuse do they bring a dog in to sniff the outside of the car. If the dog gets a hit then the police have probable cause to search the car.

As the ACLU states concerning drug testing for welfare recipients:

The ACLU challenged the mandatory drug testing program as unconstitutional, arguing that drug testing of welfare recipients violates the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches. The case, Marchwinski v. Howard, concluded when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld a lower court's decision striking down the policy as unconstitutional. In halting the implementation of Michigan's drug testing law, U.S. District Court Judge Victoria Roberts ruled that the state's rationale for testing welfare recipients ""could be used for testing the parents of all children who received Medicaid, State Emergency Relief, educational grants or loans, public education or any other benefit from that State.""[18] Indeed, any of the justifications put forth to subject welfare recipients to random drug testing would also by logical extension apply to the entirety of our population that receives some public benefit and/or that is a parent. It is clear that our constitution – and common sense – would object to the random drug testing of this large group of people, making the drug testing of an equally absurd category of people – welfare recipients – unconstitutional as well. Drug Testing of Public Assistance Recipients as a Condition of Eligibility

But Doug, you are saying, I got tested before I got hired at my job? Fair is fair, right?

The ACLU also is opposed to pre-employment drug testing, but sometimes people forget our Bill of Rights don't always apply to private businesses.

The court has read the Fourth Amendment to prohibit only those government searches or seizures that are ""unreasonable."" Because of this, businesses that are in an industry that is ""closely regulated"" can be searched more frequently and can be searched without a warrant. In one case, an auto parts dealer at a junkyard was charged with receiving stolen auto parts. Part of his defense was to claim that the search that found incriminating evidence was unconstitutional. But the court found the search reasonable, because the dealer was in a ""closely regulated industry."" Note again that constitutional guarantees like the Fourth Amendment apply to governmental action. Your employer or any private enterprise is not bound by constitutional limits. For example, if drug testing of all employees every week is done by government agency, the employees may have a cause of action to object based on the Fourth Amendment. However, if a private employer begins the same kind of routine drug testing, employees have no constitutional arguments to make; they can simply leave that employer, or they may pursue whatever statutory or common-law remedies are available. Introduction to the Law of Property, Estate Planning, and Insurance (4.5 Business and the Bill of Rights)

It is kind of ironic that some of the same friends supporting random drug testing of poor people are the same ones who objected when the story about employers asking for Facebook passwords came out . They claimed the same arguments I'm using here against drug testing to oppose giving up their passwords. I don't see the difference between drug testing and giving up passwords although the 4th amendment is stronger for drug testing than giving up passwords.

I haven't even addressed the fact that drug testing of poor people is both a waste of tax dollars and only catches a insignificant number of drug users.

The state of Florida passed an almost identical testing procedure that ran from 1999 to 2001 and was reintroduced in July of 2011 that was struck down by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta the following month, citing the fact: ""there is nothing inherent to the condition of being impoverished that supports the conclusion that there is a `concrete danger' that impoverished individuals are prone to drug use."" The Tampa Tribune investigated the results of those July 2011 drug tests and found that ""96 percent proved to be drug free"", another 2 percent never bothering to complete the lengthy application process, and 2 percent actually failing drug testing. At an average cost of $30 per test, the state was hemorrhaging tax dollars at a rate of ""$28,800-$43,200 monthly""... FAR out pacing the supposed ""savings"" from preventing drug-abusers from gaming the system to buy drugs. Texas Senate Unanimously Votes to Drug Test Welfare Applicants

Drug testing is expensive. The average cost of a drug test is about $42 per person tested,[8] not including the costs of hiring personnel to administer the tests, to ensure confidentiality of results and to run confirmatory tests to guard against false positives resulting from passive drug exposure, cross-identification with legal, prescription drugs such as codeine and legal substances such as poppy seeds.

Another way to measure the cost is by counting what it costs to ""catch"" each drug user. Drug testing is not used by many private employers because of the exorbitant cost of catching each person who tests positive. One electronics manufacturer, for example, estimated that the cost of finding each person who tested positive was $20,000, since after testing 10,000 employees, only 49 tested positive. A congressional committee also estimated that the cost of each positive drug test of government employees was $77,000, because the positive rate was only 0.5%.[9] Mandatory drug testing is an ineffective means to uncover drug abuse. An Oklahoma study found that a questionnaire was able to accurately detect 94 out of 100 drug abusers. The questionnaire was also useful in detecting alcohol abusers, something drug tests fail to accomplish.[10]

Certain counties in Oregon experimented with drug testing on some welfare recipients, but the process was halted when it was found that drug testing was less effective in identifying drug abuse than less invasive, cheaper methods.[11]

Most types of drug tests fail to detect alcohol abuse – the most commonly abused substance among Americans – and are most likely to detect marijuana use since the active ingredient in marijuana stays in the body's system longer than any other illicit substance. Therefore, drug tests often fail to identify people who are using more powerful, more addictive and more dangerous drugs like methamphetamine or cocaine, which exit the body's system in a matter of hours or days.[12] Many states have rejected the random drug testing of welfare recipients as impractical and fiscally unjustifiable. For example, New York and Maryland each considered a program to randomly drug test those receiving welfare, but abandoned the plan as not cost-effective, given that urinalysis is almost exclusively a barometer of marijuana use and that welfare recipients are required to undergo regular supervision, allowing for effective monitoring absent the cost and intrusion of mandatory drug testing.[13]

Louisiana passed a law in 1997 requiring drug testing for welfare recipients. However, a task force set up to implement the law found more limited drug testing of individuals identified by a questionnaire to be more cost-effective than mandatory drug testing.[14]

Alabama decided against drug testing because it found that focusing on job training programs was a more effective method of moving individuals off of welfare.[15] Drug Testing of Public Assistance Recipients as a Condition of Eligibility

Sen. Tim Schaffer plans to introduce legislation today that would establish a drug-testing pilot program for Ohio Works First applicants. ""It is time that we recognize that many families are trying to survive in drug-induced poverty, and we have an obligation to make sure taxpayer money is not being used to support drug dealers,"" Schaffer said. ""We can no longer turn a blind eye to this problem."" The proposal comes as Ohio's public welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in decades. As of June, slightly fewer than 25,000 adults received cash assistance. Children, who make up the bulk of recipients, about 107,000, would be exempt from drug testing under Schaffer's proposal. Schaffer, R-Lancaster, said he hopes to avoid similar lawsuits by requiring applicants to be tested only if they indicate on a questionnaire that they have used drugs in the past six months. Michigan's drug-testing law, he said, was found unconstitutional because it required all applicants to undergo screenings regardless of whether there was reason to believe they were using illegal drugs. Drug tests for welfare pushed

Ohio State Senator Tim Schaffer (R) has decided again that Ohio needs drug testing. He still doesn't know how public assistance works but he is reaching to show his bigoted constituents he can punch a poor person like a good Republican:There must be an election coming up. That's when we get these silly ""bash the poor"" laws. The simple fact is most people who have little to no money don't buy drugs and the idea that all welfare recipients use drugs is not supported by the evidence. It is a bigoted idea and drug testing is unconstitutional.Thanks for putting this post on the rec list. I appreciate it and the good comments I've been reading. -- dlb

(Marlon Correa/The Washington Post)

The illuminated billboard in the Judiciary Square Metro station near the F Street entrance was strategically placed.

Prospective jurors who take the subway to D.C. Superior Court and exit near the National Building Museum see these words: “Good jurors nullify bad laws” and “You have the right to ‘hang’ the jury with your vote if you cannot agree with other jurors.”

Since the billboard went up this month, District prosecutors have been worried that the message could sway their cases. In the past week alone, they have asked judges in three ­cases to ensure that jurors had neither seen nor been influenced by the billboard.

The billboard is part of a growing national campaign to encourage jurors who disagree with a law, or think a punishment is too harsh, to vote for acquittal. Kirsten Tynan of the Montana-based Fully Informed Jury Association, whose name and Web address is included on the billboard, said the nonprofit group generally challenges crimes it calls “victimless,” such as vandalism by graffiti or gun possession.

James Babb, a Philadelphia-based graphics artist who organized a fundraising campaign to put up the billboard, said he raised $3,000 in about a week through Facebook and other ­social-media sites. He said he is concerned about laws that he thinks are too restrictive.

“People are going to jail for weed,” Babb said. “Things are getting so weird. There needs to be this final safeguard to protect us from a tyrannical government.”

Babb’s group has added a similar message on two pillars in Archives station, another Metro stop near the courthouse. Both displays are scheduled to be up for about a month. Babb said he also plans to place signs in other cities, including Chicago and Los Angeles.

Supporters of jury nullification in several cities have raised the ire of judges and prosecutors. In New York last year, an 80-year-old man was charged with jury tampering after passing out fliers about jury nullification to courthouse visitors; the case was later dismissed by a federal judge.

Locally, prosecutors have been scrambling to ensure that the billboard’s message doesn’t influence their ­cases.

In a gang-related murder trial set to begin this week, prosecutors filed a motion asking the judge to question potential jurors about whether they had seen the billboard. They also requested that the judge remind jurors that their verdict should not be influenced by whether they agree or disagree with the law.

In their memo, prosecutors Todd Gee and Emily Miller wrote that jurors who see the billboard may think “they don’t have to abide by an oath” and that it could encourage them “to hang and to learn about the concept of jury nullification.”

In another recent murder case, the jury had already been sworn in and the trial was underway when prosecutors alerted Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon to the billboard. Dixon, according to people familiar with the case, then asked the jurors if they had seen the billboard. No one said they had.

Days later, the jury found the defendant, Grant Johnson, 39, of Bladensburg, Md., guilty of first-degree murder in the slaying of 32-year-old Ricardo Lancaster during a drug deal in 2012, prosecutors said.

And in a trial involving an assault with a deadly weapon, Assistant U.S. Attorney Brittain Shaw asked the judge to question potential jurors about the billboard. Days later, the jury found the defendant, Charles Link, 53, guilty in a knife attack in November that left one man injured.

The billboard also comes as Adam Kokesh, a Fairfax County-based gun rights activist, is preparing to go to trial after posting an Independence Day video on YouTube of himself apparently loading a shotgun in Freedom Plaza. He had been scheduled to go to trial Thursday, but the case was pushed back to at least Nov. 18.

Kokesh’s supporters have advocated for jury nullification in his case.

Tynan said the Metro billboard was not directly aimed at the Kokesh, who pleaded not guilty to carrying a pistol without a license, but she said that his case was the kind her organization targeted. “It’s a victimless trial,” Tynan said.

A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office said there has been no organized effort by prosecutors to address the billboard, but instead prosecutors have raised the issue on a case-by-case basis.

“Jurors in the District of Columbia play an important role in holding accountable the criminals who threaten and harm the people who live, work and visit our city,” U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. said in a statement. But he added, “Jurors who ignore the law or refuse to follow the judge’s instructions embolden criminals who believe that they can get away with breaking the law and do harm to the community without any repercussion.”"

In a statement, Obama said they'd been sentenced under an ""unfair system."" In 2011, Congress passed a law that effectively reduced the federal government's mandatory penalties for people convicted of crack offenses, but commuting the sentences represents the first time the reform has been applied to those convicted before it was adopted. ""If they had been sentenced under the current law, many of them would have already served their time and paid their debt to society,"" Obama explained in the statement.

Three of the inmates -- Reynolds Wintersmith Jr., Clarence Aaron and Stephanie George -- were featured in a recent report by the American Civil Liberties Union about the thousands of people serving life in prison for nonviolent offenses. The report, which received attention from a range of media outlets, including The Huffington Post, revealed that more than 3,000 inmates were serving life without parole for drug, property and other nonviolent crimes as of 2012, comprising about 6 percent of the total life-without-parole population.

Reynolds Wintersmith Jr., 39, has spent half of his life in prison, according to the report. He was arrested at 19 for dealing drugs and declined a plea offer of 10 years, choosing to go to trial. He was a street dealer, but opened himself up to the life-without-parole sentence because he was held accountable for the entire amount of cocaine sold as part of a conspiracy in which he had a small role.

Clarence Aaron, 43, was sentenced to three life-without-parole sentences as a college student for playing a minor role in two large, planned drug deals. He wouldn't testify against his co-conspirators, but they testified against him and received reduced sentences.

Stephanie Yvette George, 43, was sentenced to life in prison without parole at age 26 after the father of one of her children used her attic to store drugs and cash. The harshness of the sentence was due, in part, to prior convictions for selling small amounts of crack. Though George said she didn't know the drugs were hidden in her home, six cooperating witnesses testified that she was paid to store cocaine.

Prior to Thursday, Obama had pardoned only 11 people for drug crimes, and had used his powers of clemency to provide relief to just 40 people in all -- fewer than any other modern president. In recent months, his administration has portrayed the country's tough drug policies as unjust, but his decision to commute these sentences may be the most significant step to curtail the war on drugs. In addition to the eight people convicted of crack offenses, he also pardoned 13 others for various crimes.

Vanita Gupta, the deputy legal director of the ACLU, called the decision an ""incredibly important development.""

""The president took the enormous step of giving hope and new life to people who were doomed to die behind bars for nonviolent offenses,"" she said. ""Of course, we know there are thousands who are in similar situations in prison, and so now we really need to do the work to change the laws around the country to prevent these sorts of extreme sentences from taking place on our soil.""

CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated that the president had commuted the sentences of only 11 drug offenders prior to Thursday; that is in fact the previous number of pardons granted to drug offenders."
http://news.yahoo.com/court-rejects-routine-no-warrant-dui-blood-tests-142337206.html,,[],Court rejects routine no-warrant DUI blood tests,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that police usually must try to obtain a search warrant from a judge before ordering blood tests for drunken-driving suspects.

The justices sided with a Missouri man who was subjected to a blood test without a warrant and found to have nearly twice the legal limit of alcohol in his blood.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood is generally not sufficient reason to jettison the requirement that police get a judge's approval before drawing a blood sample.

Missouri and the Obama administration were asking the court to endorse a blanket rule that would have allowed the tests without a warrant.

Eight of the nine justices rejected that plea. Only Justice Clarence Thomas would have held that a warrantless blood test does not violate a suspect's constitutional rights.

The case stemmed from the arrest of Tyler McNeely in Missouri's rural Cape Girardeau County. A state trooper stopped McNeely's speeding, swerving car. The driver, who had two previous drunken-driving convictions, refused to submit to a breath test to measure the alcohol level in his body.

He failed several field sobriety tests. The arresting officer, Cpl. Mark Winder of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, said McNeely's speech was slurred and he was unsteady on his feet.

There seemed little dispute that Winder had enough evidence to get a warrant for a blood test, but chose not to. Instead, he drove McNeely to a hospital. A technician drew blood from McNeely, who was handcuffed throughout the process.

McNeely's blood-alcohol content was 0.154 percent, well above the 0.08 percent legal limit.

But the Missouri Supreme Court upheld a lower court order that threw out the results of the blood test. The state high court said the blood test violated the Constitution's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. Police need a warrant to take a suspect's blood except when a delay could threaten a life or destroy potential evidence, the Missouri court said.

Story continues

About half the states already prohibit warrantless blood tests in all or most suspected drunken-driving cases.

The Supreme Court did not offer much guidance Wednesday about when police may dispense with a warrant. Justice Anthony Kennedy, in a separate opinion, said a later case may give the court to opportunity to say more on that subject.

The case is Missouri v. McNeely, 11-1425."

WASHINGTON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - A secretive U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration unit is funneling information from intelligence intercepts, wiretaps, informants and a massive database of telephone records to authorities across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.

Although these cases rarely involve national security issues, documents reviewed by Reuters show that law enforcement agents have been directed to conceal how such investigations truly begin - not only from defense lawyers but also sometimes from prosecutors and judges.

The undated documents show that federal agents are trained to ""recreate"" the investigative trail to effectively cover up where the information originated, a practice that some experts say violates a defendant's Constitutional right to a fair trial. If defendants don't know how an investigation began, they cannot know to ask to review potential sources of exculpatory evidence - information that could reveal entrapment, mistakes or biased witnesses.

""I have never heard of anything like this at all,"" said Nancy Gertner, a Harvard Law School professor who served as a federal judge from 1994 to 2011. Gertner and other legal experts said the program sounds more troubling than recent disclosures that the National Security Agency has been collecting domestic phone records. The NSA effort is geared toward stopping terrorists; the DEA program targets common criminals, primarily drug dealers.

""It is one thing to create special rules for national security,"" Gertner said. ""Ordinary crime is entirely different. It sounds like they are phonying up investigations.""

THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS DIVISION

The unit of the DEA that distributes the information is called the Special Operations Division, or SOD. Two dozen partner agencies comprise the unit, including the FBI, CIA, NSA, Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Homeland Security. It was created in 1994 to combat Latin American drug cartels and has grown from several dozen employees to several hundred.

Today, much of the SOD's work is classified, and officials asked that its precise location in Virginia not be revealed. The documents reviewed by Reuters are marked ""Law Enforcement Sensitive,"" a government categorization that is meant to keep them confidential.

""Remember that the utilization of SOD cannot be revealed or discussed in any investigative function,"" a document presented to agents reads. The document specifically directs agents to omit the SOD's involvement from investigative reports, affidavits, discussions with prosecutors and courtroom testimony. Agents are instructed to then use ""normal investigative techniques to recreate the information provided by SOD.""

A spokesman with the Department of Justice, which oversees the DEA, declined to comment.

But two senior DEA officials defended the program, and said trying to ""recreate"" an investigative trail is not only legal but a technique that is used almost daily.

A former federal agent in the northeastern United States who received such tips from SOD described the process. ""You'd be told only, 'Be at a certain truck stop at a certain time and look for a certain vehicle.' And so we'd alert the state police to find an excuse to stop that vehicle, and then have a drug dog search it,"" the agent said.

""PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION""

After an arrest was made, agents then pretended that their investigation began with the traffic stop, not with the SOD tip, the former agent said. The training document reviewed by Reuters refers to this process as ""parallel construction.""

The two senior DEA officials, who spoke on behalf of the agency but only on condition of anonymity, said the process is kept secret to protect sources and investigative methods. ""Parallel construction is a law enforcement technique we use every day,"" one official said. ""It's decades old, a bedrock concept.""

A dozen current or former federal agents interviewed by Reuters confirmed they had used parallel construction during their careers. Most defended the practice; some said they understood why those outside law enforcement might be concerned.

""It's just like laundering money - you work it backwards to make it clean,"" said Finn Selander, a DEA agent from 1991 to 2008 and now a member of a group called Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, which advocates legalizing and regulating narcotics.

Some defense lawyers and former prosecutors said that using ""parallel construction"" may be legal to establish probable cause for an arrest. But they said employing the practice as a means of disguising how an investigation began may violate pretrial discovery rules by burying evidence that could prove useful to criminal defendants.

A QUESTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY

""That's outrageous,"" said Tampa attorney James Felman, a vice chairman of the criminal justice section of the American Bar Association. ""It strikes me as indefensible.""

Lawrence Lustberg, a New Jersey defense lawyer, said any systematic government effort to conceal the circumstances under which cases begin ""would not only be alarming but pretty blatantly unconstitutional.""

Lustberg and others said the government's use of the SOD program skirts established court procedures by which judges privately examine sensitive information, such as an informant's identity or classified evidence, to determine whether the information is relevant to the defense.

""You can't game the system,"" said former federal prosecutor Henry E. Hockeimer Jr. ""You can't create this subterfuge. These are drug crimes, not national security cases. If you don't draw the line here, where do you draw it?""

Some lawyers say there can be legitimate reasons for not revealing sources. Robert Spelke, a former prosecutor who spent seven years as a senior DEA lawyer, said some sources are classified. But he also said there are few reasons why unclassified evidence should be concealed at trial.

""It's a balancing act, and they've doing it this way for years,"" Spelke said. ""Do I think it's a good way to do it? No, because now that I'm a defense lawyer, I see how difficult it is to challenge.""

CONCEALING A TIP

One current federal prosecutor learned how agents were using SOD tips after a drug agent misled him, the prosecutor told Reuters. In a Florida drug case he was handling, the prosecutor said, a DEA agent told him the investigation of a U.S. citizen began with a tip from an informant. When the prosecutor pressed for more information, he said, a DEA supervisor intervened and revealed that the tip had actually come through the SOD and from an NSA intercept.

""I was pissed,"" the prosecutor said. ""Lying about where the information came from is a bad start if you're trying to comply with the law because it can lead to all kinds of problems with discovery and candor to the court."" The prosecutor never filed charges in the case because he lost confidence in the investigation, he said.

A senior DEA official said he was not aware of the case but said the agent should not have misled the prosecutor. How often such misdirection occurs is unknown, even to the government; the DEA official said the agency does not track what happens with tips after the SOD sends them to agents in the field.

The SOD's role providing information to agents isn't itself a secret. It is briefly mentioned by the DEA in budget documents, albeit without any reference to how that information is used or represented when cases go to court.

The DEA has long publicly touted the SOD's role in multi-jurisdictional and international investigations, connecting agents in separate cities who may be unwittingly investigating the same target and making sure undercover agents don't accidentally try to arrest each other.

SOD'S BIG SUCCESSES

The unit also played a major role in a 2008 DEA sting in Thailand against Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout; he was sentenced in 2011 to 25 years in prison on charges of conspiring to sell weapons to the Colombian rebel group FARC. The SOD also recently coordinated Project Synergy, a crackdown against manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers of synthetic designer drugs that spanned 35 states and resulted in 227 arrests.

Since its inception, the SOD's mandate has expanded to include narco-terrorism, organized crime and gangs. A DEA spokesman declined to comment on the unit's annual budget. A recent LinkedIn posting on the personal page of a senior SOD official estimated it to be $125 million.

Today, the SOD offers at least three services to federal, state and local law enforcement agents: coordinating international investigations such as the Bout case; distributing tips from overseas NSA intercepts, informants, foreign law enforcement partners and domestic wiretaps; and circulating tips from a massive database known as DICE.

The DICE database contains about 1 billion records, the senior DEA officials said. The majority of the records consist of phone log and Internet data gathered legally by the DEA through subpoenas, arrests and search warrants nationwide. Records are kept for about a year and then purged, the DEA officials said.

About 10,000 federal, state and local law enforcement agents have access to the DICE database, records show. They can query it to try to link otherwise disparate clues. Recently, one of the DEA officials said, DICE linked a man who tried to smuggle $100,000 over the U.S. southwest border to a major drug case on the East Coast.

""We use it to connect the dots,"" the official said.

""AN AMAZING TOOL""

Wiretap tips forwarded by the SOD usually come from foreign governments, U.S. intelligence agencies or court-authorized domestic phone recordings. Because warrantless eavesdropping on Americans is illegal, tips from intelligence agencies are generally not forwarded to the SOD until a caller's citizenship can be verified, according to one senior law enforcement official and one former U.S. military intelligence analyst.

""They do a pretty good job of screening, but it can be a struggle to know for sure whether the person on a wiretap is American,"" the senior law enforcement official said.

Tips from domestic wiretaps typically occur when agents use information gleaned from a court-ordered wiretap in one case to start a second investigation.

As a practical matter, law enforcement agents said they usually don't worry that SOD's involvement will be exposed in court. That's because most drug-trafficking defendants plead guilty before trial and therefore never request to see the evidence against them. If cases did go to trial, current and former agents said, charges were sometimes dropped to avoid the risk of exposing SOD involvement.

Current and former federal agents said SOD tips aren't always helpful - one estimated their accuracy at 60 percent. But current and former agents said tips have enabled them to catch drug smugglers who might have gotten away.

""It was an amazing tool,"" said one recently retired federal agent. ""Our big fear was that it wouldn't stay secret.""

DEA officials said that the SOD process has been reviewed internally. They declined to provide Reuters with a copy of their most recent review. (Edited by Blake Morrison)"
http://news.yahoo.com/di-blasio-daughter-drugs-video-204158370.html,,[],NYC mayor-elect's daughter reveals drug abuse,"

Just days before her dad is set to take office, Chiara de Blasio, the 19-year-old daughter of New York City Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio, is opening up about her battle with substance abuse and depression.



In a video released by Bill de Blasio's transition team Tuesday, Chiara says she abused alcohol and marijuana to deal with clinical depression and anxiety before she was able to get treatment — and get sober.



""Every kid who grows up in New York grows up pretty fast,"" Chiara says in the five-minute video. ""It made it easier the more I drank and did drugs to share some common ground with people I wouldn't have.""



Chiara says she used ""fake rationale"" to justify her substance abuse: ""I would be like, 'Okay, I won't drink.' I would just smoke weed. And then I would be like, 'I'm not gonna smoke weed, I'll just drink.' It was kind of like bartering for equally bad outcomes.""



She said her therapist referred her to outpatient treatment, and that her therapy continued during her father's mayoral campaign.



""My mom was trying really hard to help me,"" Chiara said. ""My dad was doing the same, but obviously he was very busy. But they were both very emotionally committed to try and figure out some way to get me better.""



The 19-year-old urged others like her to seek help.



""Removing substances from my life has opened so many doors for me,"" she said. ""Like, I was actually able to participate in my dad's campaign, and that was like the greatest thing ever.""



""Her courage to speak out demonstrates a wisdom and maturity far beyond her 19 years, and we are grateful every day for her commitment to lifting up those who need to know that they are not alone,"" de Blasio and his wife, Chirlane McCray, said in a statement accompanying their daughter's video.

USA TODAY

Several companies offer tours that supply marijuana

Marijuana may be smoked by adults but only in private

Most ski areas are on leased federal lands where marijuana use remains illegal

Colorado's ski resorts and mountain towns are bracing for an influx of tourists seeking a now-legal Rocky Mountain high.

Last year, the state legalized the possession and use of small amounts of recreational marijuana, and on Jan. 1 special stores will be allowed to sell pot to anyone 21 and over. Voters had previously approved a medical marijuana system, but last fall's vote threw the doors wide open by requiring state officials to regulate pot like alcohol.

With several companies offering marijuana tours — sightseeing tours of the state's high country, with marijuana supplied — police and ski area operators worry that tourists who don't understand the rules will be sparking up on the slopes.

""We're delving into truly uncharted territory here,"" said Summit County Sheriff John Minor, whose jurisdiction covers the Arapahoe Basin, Keystone and Breckenridge ski areas. ""We do have this misperception in Summit County where people have smoked in public, been charged, and were under the perception that it's a free-for-all.""

Under the law, marijuana may be smoked by adults but only in private. But exactly what ""private"" means is still the subject of debate. Minor says a private vehicle on a public road, for example, is considered ""in public.""

Marijuana tour operator Timothy Vee of Colorado High Life Tours says to get around those rules, his drivers sometimes pull into a parking lot, allowing tour guests to partake of the pot he offers. Under current law, it's legal to give another adult marijuana as long as there's no direct payment for it. Vee and other operators charge people to rent the limo and driver and say the pot, snacks and soda are free.

For $1,200 a day, tourists can rent a chauffeured minibus from Vee to pick them up at their hotel and drive them to the slopes while they use marijuana during the ride. Vee said concerns about impaired skiers and riders are overblown. After all, he says, every ski area has a bar at the bottom of the slope. And for decades, skiers and snowboarders in Colorado have been ducking into the trees for a mid-run toke. Many ski areas are home to illicitly built ""smoke shacks"" tucked between the slopes, and locals often refer to gondola ski lifts as ""ganja-las.""

""What I'm getting are a lot of old stoners, and a lot of wealthy people who want to come do it safely with a concierge,"" Vee said. ""Now the kids are gone, they're 60 years old and they want to get high.""

Ski resorts worry their slopes' family-friendly image will take a hit if out-of-state tourists start thinking their kids will be exposed to marijuana smoke in lift lines and gondolas. At Arapahoe Basin in October, mountain manager Al Henceroth confiscated passes from several skiers he caught publicly sharing a joint.

In a series of blog posts that drew sometimes-vitriolic responses, Henceroth made a key point: Because most ski areas are on leased federal lands, marijuana use remains illegal.

""We will not hesitate to call the cops on this issue,"" wrote Henceroth, who declined to be interviewed.

Jenn Rudolph, a spokeswoman for the industry group Colorado Ski Country USA, said people who smoke in lift lines and on the slopes will be prosecuted, either by federal forest rangers or local law enforcement working with the resorts. Getting caught smoking pot by a ranger brings a minimum $250 citation, Forest Service officials said. Last year, rangers wrote 112 tickets for marijuana use at Colorado ski areas. This year, they had already written 93 through this September.

""Colorado is a family-friendly ski destination, and the law is clear that you can't smoke marijuana in public,"" Rudolph said. ""Resorts are going to do what they need to do to enforce that.""

Hughes also reports for the Fort Collins Coloradoan."

Two weeks ago, an appeals court in Italy convicted a C.I.A. station chief and two other Americans for kidnapping a radical cleric in Milan in 2003 and sending him to Egypt. The decision means all 26 Americans tried in absentia for the abduction have been found guilty. On Tuesday, Italy’s former military intelligence chief was sentenced to 10 years in prison for complicity in the case. In December, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the kidnapping and treatment of Khaled el-Masri, a German citizen mistaken for a terrorist and brutalized by a C.I.A. team at the airport in Macedonia in 2003, amounted to torture. He was never charged with a crime or given access to a lawyer. The case was brought against Macedonia because the European court does not have jurisdiction over the United States. Both judgments are important condemnations of C.I.A. tactics under the Bush administration. They are also a warning to Mr. Obama that pressure for the United States and its partners to acknowledge and make amends for gross violations of international legal and human rights standards is unlikely to subside.

Today, the United States has less equality of opportunity than almost any other advanced industrial country. Study after study has exposed the myth that America is a land of opportunity. This is especially tragic: While Americans may differ on the desirability of equality of outcomes, there is near-universal consensus that inequality of opportunity is indefensible.

In a bow to the gun lobby, Obama has endorsed an exception to universal background checks for transfers of firearms within families. The argument is that a father who wants to pass on to his son a beloved rifle shouldn't be burdened by having to conduct a background check. And family members, who are most at risk, should have every incentive to refuse to give a felon or dangerously mentally ill person a gun. The data, however, suggest the opposite. It's precisely those closest to a prohibited purchaser we should trust the least. In studies of prison inmates, nearly 35% obtained their guns from friends and family members — the largest single source of criminals' guns.

Leonard Pitts Jr. at the Miami Herald joins a growing chorus in On use of drones, Obama overreaches:

[T]the Justice Department says its definition of “imminent threat” doesn’t require “clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future.” [...] The idea of a secret killing program, answerable to no one, is jarringly inconsonant with who and what we are supposed to be. One fears that, in the name of expedience, we will become what we abhor. Indeed, the danger is imminent. Whatever that means.

Drugs are ubiquitous in this country, and yet we know that some people have the privilege of doctor-prescribed intoxication, while others are thrown into dungeons for seeking the same relief. We know that the war on drugs is heavily inflected with Jim Crow–ism, economic inequality, gun culture myths and political opportunism. We know that Adam Lanza’s unfortunate mother was not the sole Newtown resident stocking up on military-style weapons; plenty of suburban gun owners keep similar weapons to protect their well-kept homes against darkly imagined, drug-addled marauders from places like Bridgeport. We divert resources from mental health or rehab, and allocate millions to militarize schools. The result: the war on drugs has metastasized into a war on children. Best publicized, perhaps, is the plight of young people in Meridian, Mississippi, where a federal investigation is probing into why children as young as 10 are routinely taken to jail for wearing the wrong color socks or flatulence in class.

If the bill passed, Georgia would be the first state to endorse repealing the 17th Amendment, but the idea has gained traction among conservatives over the last few decades. Texas Gov. Rick Perry supports it; so do GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

Just before the November election, news leaked that the Congressional Research Service had been strongarmed by Senate Republicans into withdrawing a report that analyzed the last six decades of economic data and found, contrary to deeply held Republican dogma, that there was no correlation between top marginal tax rates and economic growth. Six weeks later, after the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting, we were reminded that 15 years ago the National Rifle Association successfully lobbied to kill all federal funding of gun research, leaving the public without solid information with which to debate gun control. Now, as House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has begun calling for an end to federal funding for social science research, Paul Krugman has labeled the modern GOP “the ignorance caucus.”

Soldiers and veterans are keenly aware of the ethical damage of war and which they've instigated, each in their own way. Everyone reacts differently, but guilt and shame are hard to avoid. Sharing such feelings is immensely hard, as many fear being condemned and consequently feel exiled in society."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/02/08/1185554/-Drug-tests-for-welfare-bills-come-to-three-more-states,2013-02-08 00:00:00,"['Daily Kos Staff', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",Drug tests for welfare bills come to three more states,"The Ohio State Senate held a second hearing Thursday night on a proposal to establish pilot drug-testing programs in three counties. Under the proposal, applicants would be required to submit a drug test if they disclose that they have used illegal substances. The proposal was first introduced in the spring, but pressure from opponents led Gov. John Kasich to squash the bill in May. Virginia Republicans are also reviving a bill that was shelved earlier this year. The 2012 version failed after the state estimated it would cost $1.5 million to implement while only saving $229,000. The bill’s sponsor, Delegate Dickie Bell, has not introduced the updated version yet, but says he’s found more cost effective options.

Looking at the range of drug testing-for-benefits bills being pushed in state legislatures across the country, you almost have to suspect Republicans of some kind of urine fetish. In addition to all the states that are debating or have passed bills requiring people applying for unemployment insurance benefits to pee in cups, drug-testing bills aimed at welfare applicants are being introduced in three states. The specifics would be ripe for comedy if we weren't talking about a concerted effort by the powerful to stigmatize vulnerable people as drug addicts, as if that's the only reason a person might need help in an economy in which there are still more than three job-seekers for every job opening:Those would have to be some pretty damn significant changes to the cost structure to erase a nearly $1.25 million deficit. Virginia wasn't the first to run into that kind of problem; a Florida law mandating drug-testing of welfare applicants cost the state money because so few people's tests were positive, leaving the cost of the tests higher than the savings from denying people benefits. And that's leaving aside the cost of the lawsuits for a law that was ultimately found unconstitutional.

Both Ohio and Kansas legislators are trying to pretend the goal is to help people rather than to associate welfare recipients with drug abuse in the public debate, claiming that they just want to be sure people get the help they need. Bear in mind that in Florida, just 2.6 percent of applicants didn't pass their drug tests. So when you have Republican legislators who don't show any signs of wanting to help any kind of working-class or middle-class people, even, suddenly dripping with concern for welfare applicants ... well, you just have to call bullshit."

(CNN) —

Last year, voters in Colorado approved legalizing recreational marijuana, and on Tuesday night, they resoundingly supported taxing it.

With nearly all votes counted, 65% supported the new tax, while 35% opposed it. The measure would impose a special 15% excise tax on marijuana to help fund school construction, along with a 10% sales tax to bolster marijuana-related law enforcement efforts.

The passage was widely expected, despite opponents arguing it’s unfair to single out marijuana for higher taxation than products such as beer.

Strong support for the measure is pegged largely to the money it is expected to bring in. The nonpartisan Colorado Legislative Council projects that the measure will generate nearly $70 million in additional state tax revenue next year.

There were 30 other measures on the ballot in six states Tuesday, all of which were too early to call for CNN. Here are highlights from a few:

Colorado: secession

Voters in 11 counties in northern Colorado are being asked if they want to secede from the state. Ten counties in conservative, rural northeastern Colorado would theoretically form a 51st state known as North Colorado. Moffat County, located in the northwest corner of the state, would become a panhandle for neighboring Wyoming.

The plan has no chance of becoming reality. Among other things, it would also require statewide and congressional approval. But approval or even a close vote at the county level would send a loud message of growing grassroots conservative anger toward a more liberal Denver-based Democratic establishment that has taken up controversial measures related to gun control, gay rights and green energy.

With more than 50,000 votes counted in Weld County, the most populated county of those trying to secede, 58% of votes were against secession and 42% were in favor of it. CNN, however, does not yet have a projection on this measure.

Similar secession measures have been floated in a number of other states in recent years in a reflection of the country’s growing ideological and partisan divide.

Washington: Labeling genetically modified food

Voters in Washington state are considering a hotly contested initiative that would require labeling all foods containing genetically modified ingredients. The measure pits local consumer advocates, who argue that the measure is needed for consumers to make better informed choices, against large agribusinesses such as Monsanto, which argue that such a law would spook potential customers and unfairly imply that such products are unsafe.

Washington is the second state to consider such a ballot measure. A similar proposal was narrowly rejected by California voters last year.

With more than 800,000 votes counted, 53% of Washington State voters opposed the labeling, while 47% supported it. It is still, however, too early for CNN to call this race.

According to the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures, 95 bills relating to the issue have been introduced in various legislatures so far this year – a reflection of growing public interest in the controversy surrounding genetically modified foods.

Other noteworthy measures

Voters in New Jersey are considering whether to amend their constitution to raise the state minimum wage from the federal level of $7.25 to $8.25 per hour. Future annual increases would be tied to changes in the cost of living. Eighteen states have a minimum wage that exceeds the federal requirement, according to the NCSL.

New York voters are being asked to revise their constitution to allow the legislature in Albany to authorize seven casinos, with the goal of generating new revenue for public schools and potentially cutting property taxes.

Jerry Brown holds strong hand on prisons,"SACRAMENTO — Three liberal federal judges — relics of the Jimmy Carter era — are trying to force Gov. Jerry Brown to release nearly 10,000 criminals from state prisons. Politically, it doesn’t get much better for a governor.

The judges are threatening to hold Brown in contempt of court if he refuses to free the felons.

Advertisement

Go ahead, to paraphrase a former Carmel mayor, make his day. Fine him.

That’s one fine, I suspect, most California taxpayers would gladly pay for a governor trying to keep bad guys behind bars.

Except if I were an ambitious state controller like John Chiang, I’d refuse to write the check.

Then what? The federal government could retaliate by withholding funds from the state, such as money to help pay for poor people’s medical care. Would President Obama really allow that? He has more political smarts. You’d think.

Advertisement

The judges could order federal marshals to open the cell doors. Brown then could stand in one, a la segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace. That certainly didn’t hurt Wallace politically.

And Wallace was shamefully standing in the schoolhouse door trying to protect a university’s bigotry from integration by black students. Brown would be heroically protecting citizens from thugs.

Advertisement

The marshals could slap cuffs on the governor and drag him off to jail. Can’t visualize that, either. But there’d be no better way for him to campaign for reelection next year.

Although a recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll found that most voters favor the early release of low-level, nonviolent offenders, they also don’t want to sacrifice public safety by dumping more criminals on the street.

Brown clearly holds a solid hand politically in this escalating confrontation. It’s long past time, however, to pull the curtain on the little drama.

“Enough already!” Brown told reporters, and that was in January. “Our prisons are not overcrowded.”

Advertisement

The three-judge panel since then has emphatically disagreed and recently ordered Brown to shed 9,600 inmates — about 8% of the prison population — by year’s end. And by the way, the judges said, commence “forthwith, notwithstanding any state or local laws.”

Brown is asking the panel for a stay while he appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court, which two years ago ruled that California prison conditions amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.

Advertisement

The federal panel consists of three liberals originally appointed by President Carter: U.S. District Judges Thelton Henderson, 79, of San Francisco and Lawrence Karlton, 78, of Sacramento; and U.S. 9th Circuit appellate Judge Stephen Reinhardt, 82, of Los Angeles.

Their jurisdiction over the state’s prison population stems from two separate class-action suits, one filed in 1990 on behalf of mentally ill inmates, the other in 2001 for medically ill prisoners. The jurists have ruled that overcrowding caused inadequate healthcare.

Advertisement

And for many years that was hard to dispute.

In 2007, the state had 173,000 inmates crammed in prisons built for fewer than 100,000. They were stacked like cordwood in some lockups — triple bunked in gyms, day rooms and hallways, leaving little space for rehab, education or drug treatment. But that’s no longer the case, prison officials assert.

Advertisement

“The prison systems were screwed up,” Brown admitted in January. But “we’ve done a lot to fix them.... Most people in prison get better [healthcare] inside the prison than they’ll get once they’re released.”

But the federal judges aren’t buying it. In a recent ruling, they accused the Brown administration of “defiance,” “intransigence” and “deliberate failure” to provide inmates with adequate care.

“The judges aren’t giving the state enough credit for everything it’s done,” insists Jeff Beard, the governor’s new corrections secretary.

“This is really a huge states’ rights issue. Maybe there needs to be more attention to this before we just start releasing people or go to contempt citations.”

Advertisement

In 2008, Beard was Pennsylvania’s prisons chief and testified as an expert witness against California’s lockups in federal court. After he retired in 2010, Beard was hired as a California prisons consultant and became impressed.

He doesn’t think the federal judges have been doing their homework and are focused on outdated numbers, stuck in old assumptions.

Advertisement

“The state has spent almost $2 billion since 2008 on upgrades,” he says. “The prison population also has been reduced quite a bit more than the judges seem to recognize.”

Beard says it’s down by 43,000 inmates from the peak, partly because of Brown’s controversial “realignment” program that places many low-level felons under county control.

Advertisement

The governor has sent the Legislature a plan to further reduce the prison population by leasing beds in county jails and private pens. It would cost $450 million over two years. But not even Brown likes the idea. And it’s DOA in the Legislature.

California already is planning to spend nearly $9 billion on prisons during the new fiscal year. That’s more than 9% of the general fund.

Advertisement

“We get criticized regularly for spending more than we have,” says Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento). “I don’t want to put more money into building prisons or jails. That’s throwing money down a rat hole.”

“If we’re really serious about overcrowding,” Steinberg continues, “we have to keep people out of prison once they leave. The crying need is for more mental health services.”

Advertisement

But who knows what would satisfy these federal judges.

“Will they take three-fourths of a loaf?” asks UC Davis law professor Gabriel Chin. “That wouldn’t surprise me.”

Advertisement

The judges should find a way to declare victory and move on. Proclaim their mission accomplished.

If not, they’ll be tossing Brown a fat pitch down the middle, one he can’t miss.

http://news.yahoo.com/casinos-pot-secession-among-us-ballot-measures-215238421--politics.html,,[],"Casinos, pot, secession among US ballot measures","Voters faced ballot measures Tuesday including whether to approve seven casinos in New York and the fate of Houston's iconic Astrodome. Some of the questions:

___

MARIJUANA AND ALCOHOL

COLORADO: Voters approved a 25 percent tax on newly legal recreational marijuana to fund school construction. Opponents argued the tax rate would benefit black market sales.

MAINE: Voters in Portland, Maine's largest city, declared victory on a measure to legalize possession of recreational amounts of marijuana.

MICHIGAN: Voters in the cities of Ferndale, Jackson and Lansing approved proposals offering some legal protection to users of small amounts of marijuana.

UTAH: Residents in Hyde Park voted to allow beer sales in a proposal that divided the conservative, mostly Mormon city, which had been one of a handful of dry towns left in the state. The ordinance, which passed with 64 percent of the vote, only allows the sale of beer with the alcohol content of 3.2 percent.

___

SECESSION

COLORADO: Eleven rural Colorado counties delivered a divided vote on an effort to form a 51st state called North Colorado. Six counties voted against the idea — including Weld County, whose commissioners spearheaded the effort, citing frustration with the Democrat-led state government that they claim neglects rural interests. Five counties voted for it.

___

GAMBLING

NEW YORK: New York voters bet big on casino gambling as an economic energy shot, agreeing to let seven Las Vegas-style gambling palaces be built around the state, including eventually in New York City.

MASSACHUSETTS: Voters in Palmer rejected Mohegan Sun's plan for a $1 billion resort casino and entertainment complex. And Suffolk Downs says it will reassess plans to build a resort casino at the 78-year-old thoroughbred race track after voters in a Boston neighborhood rejected its proposal and residents of a neighboring community approved it.

___

ASTRODOME'S FUTURE

TEXAS: Voters rejected a plan to authorize bonds to turn the Houston Astrodome, the world's first multipurpose domed stadium, into a giant convention and event center and exhibition space. The outcome means the stadium is likely to be torn down.

Story continues

___

MINIMUM WAGE

WASHINGTON STATE: Early returns showed voters in the small Seattle suburb of SeaTac were passing a measure that would raise the minimum wage for workers at Seattle-Tacoma Airport and nearby large hotels to $15 an hour. Washington state already has the highest minimum wage at $9.19. Washington has a vote-by-mail system in which ballots must be postmarked by Tuesday, so more are left to count.

NEW JERSEY: Voters approved a constitutional amendment raising the state's minimum wage by $1, to $8.25 an hour, and to provide for automatic cost-of-living increases, as 10 other states already do.

___

HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

MAINE: Residents of South Portland rejected a proposal aimed at blocking the flow of tar sands oil from western Canada to the city. Environmentalists say the thick, gooey oil is more difficult to clean up than conventional crude oil, contains harmful chemicals and releases more greenhouse gases. Supporters of a pipeline say a ban would hamper the growth of existing petroleum-based businesses.

WASHINGTON STATE: A measure that would require mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods was failing with more than 980,000 ballots counted in unofficial returns. Washington would be the first state to put such requirements in place, and the campaign has shaped up to be one of the costliest in state history. Washington has a vote-by-mail system in which ballots must be postmarked by Tuesday, so more are left to count.

___

GAY RIGHTS

MICHIGAN: Residents of the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak approved an ordinance making it illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation and a number of other factors.

___

SCHOOL FUNDING

COLORADO: A kindergarten-through-12th-grade school-finance overhaul was rejected; it would have increased income taxes about $1 billion a year and revived a progressive income tax structure abandoned in the 1980s."

Campylobacter Bacteria

If so, antibiotics could do the same thing to humans. In support of this idea, a paper published last month in Nature, identifies a correlation between diversity of gut microflora and human obesity. A nine-year study, led by Dr. S. Dusko Ehrlich of France’s National Institute for Agricultural Research, compared microbiotas–the 100-trillion-member microbial ecosystems that populate the body–of slim and obese people. The team found obese people have lower microbial diversity in their bellies. This is consistent with earlier research in mice, as well as a paper published last year in Journal of Obesity that found a strong correlation between young children’s exposure to antibiotics and later obesity. Perhaps more significantly, the team behind the Nature study found a correlation between low microbial diversity and heart disease, diabetes and cancer, regardless of weight. “Even lean people who are poor in bacterial species have a higher risk of developing these pathologies,” Ehrlich told NPR.

For decades, livestock producers have used low doses of antibiotics to expedite animal growth. The practice lowers feed costs while increasing meat production, and nearly 80 percent (you read that right!) of the antibiotics used in the United States are for this purpose. The evidence that low dose use of antibiotics in livestock encourages the growth of antibiotic-resistant “superbugs,” such as MRSA becomes stronger everyday. For that reason it’s banned in many countries, but remains common in the U.S. Although prophylactic antibiotic use in livestock has been in use since the 1950s, how it works has long been a mystery. But evidence is mounting that it might be due to antibiotics killing microorganisms that populate animals’ guts.All this supports the ideas that eating a poor diet or taking lots of antibiotics may be factors in the obesity epidemic and associated health problems, in part, because of the way they affect our gut microbes, Ehrlich says."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/09/15/Christian-Leaders-Meet-with-Pentagon-on-Religious-Liberty-Violations,2013-09-15 00:00:00,['Ken Klukowski'],Christian Leaders Meet with Pentagon on Religious Liberty Violations,"On Sept. 12, religious-liberty leaders met with Pentagon officials to discuss the rapidly-escalating incidents of religious-liberty violations in the military under the Obama administration.

On Apr. 28, Breitbart News broke the story of Pentagon brass meeting with anti-Christian activist Mikey Weinstein to discuss religious-liberty policies. Quoting Weinstein in his own printed words, this activist has a record of calling observant Christians “fundamentalist monsters” who seek impose “theocratic terror” on America, and that evangelizing (sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ) in the military is an act of “sedition and treason” against this country, making those who do it “enemies of the Constitution.” He says those who do so should be court-martialed (criminally prosecuted).

As this story developed, the Obama-Hagel Pentagon defended its policy, and changed its story several times, as it was revealed that these meetings with Weinstein had been going on for years. In the following months there were additional incidents, such as removing Christian patriotic artwork at a military base, censoring a Christian chaplain, and a Christian service member reportedly being relieved of duty by his lesbian commander because he refused her order to say that it is wrong not to support gay marriage.

Now leaders from Restore Military Religious Freedom–a coalition to protect service members of faith–met with Pentagon officials. Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin (ret.) of the Family Research Council, Col. Ron Crews (ret.) of the Chaplains Alliance for Religious Liberty, Kellie Fiedorek of the Alliance Defending Freedom, and nationally-known Christian talk radio host Sandy Rios took with them two petitions calling on Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to protect religious liberty. One was a general petition with 170,000 signatures, and the other–with 50,000 signatures–was sparked by the last incident mentioned above, where Air Force Senior Master Sergeant Phillip Monk was relieved of duty by Maj. Elisa Valenzuela, allegedly because of Monk’s Christian beliefs on marriage. Monk now faces possible court martial.

These Christian leaders met with Lt. Gen. Richard C. Harding, the three-star judge advocate general of the Air Force (the top lawyer in that branch of the military), and Maj. Gen. Howard D. Stendahl, the two-star Air Force chief of chaplains.

Gen. Boykin said after the meeting:

The meeting included a productive discussion on the issue of religious freedom in the military as a whole and not just the U.S. Air Force. After delivering the petitions, we explained our concerns regarding the trend towards infringements on the constitutional liberties of service members in all uniformed services. We appreciate their offer to review decisions that do not reflect Air Force policy made by commanders at various bases. At their request, we will report future events and concerns directly to Air Force leadership. After reviewing a series of troubling incidents involving chaplains, the coalition members were assured in the meeting that chaplains would not be forced to do anything that violates the tenets of their faith. We also requested that the Department of Defense and the Air Force issue a definitive statement regarding the ability of service members to share their faith publicly. Previous statements on the subject have been confusing and contradictory. Additionally, we asked that the Department of Defense move quickly to implement the religious freedom protections enacted in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act. Given new incidents of military personnel facing career reprisals for their religious beliefs, it is vital that regulations preventing discrimination be issued by the Secretary of Defense as demanded by law. We intend to remain in contact with the Air Force to ensure that the law’s implementation is consistent with the intent of Congress.

Congress is working on new statutory language to protect such religious speech in the military, which has passed the House and is pending in the Senate. President Obama threatens to veto this legislation.

http://news.yahoo.com/bulgers-defense-begins-testify-070624513.html,,[],As Bulger's defense begins: Will he testify?,"BOSTON (AP) — Lawyers for James ""Whitey"" Bulger acknowledged he ran a lucrative criminal enterprise that took in millions through illegal gambling, extortion and drug trafficking. Now, they must defend him against those crimes and charges of 19 murders at his racketeering trial.

But one big question remains: Will Bulger testify in his own defense?

Some lawyers not connected to the case say Bulger has too much baggage to testify, including a previous criminal record and a long reputation as an organized crime figure.

But others say Bulger's case is different because, at age 83, he knows he is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison and may be more interested in settling scores than being acquitted.

Boston attorney Martin Weinberg said because Bulger's lawyers have admitted to some charges, he is likely to be convicted of enough counts to keep him in prison for the rest of his life.

""He's going to have a narrower set of objectives,"" Weinberg said. ""It makes it more likely for him to testify if his objectives are something other than a complete acquittal because he can admit to things that other defendants couldn't and attempt to persuade a jury that, 'You heard what I admitted to, please respect those specific areas as to which I deny guilt.'""

Bulger as much as said he wanted to settle scores in letters he wrote to a friend from prison after he was captured in Santa Monica, Calif., following 16 years on the run.

Bulger told his friend he wanted to set the record straight on two fronts: First, he was not an FBI informant, as prosecutors and many trial witnesses have claimed, and second, he did not kill women, according to a book called ""Whitey Bulger: America's Most Wanted Gangster and the Manhunt That Brought Him to Justice,"" written by Boston Globe reporters Shelley Murphy and Kevin Cullen.

""This whole trial is an effort on his part to overcompensate for his informant label,"" said Boston attorney Anthony Cardinale, who helped expose the corrupt relationship between the FBI and Bulger while he represented former New England Mob boss Francis ""Cadillac Frank"" Salemme.

Story continues

""He's doing anything he can to have some shred of a reputation left,"" Cardinale said.

But despite the impulse to want to rebut testimony that he ratted on the Mafia and members of his own gang, Bulger would open himself up to even more damaging evidence if he decides to take the witness stand, Cardinale said. He said prosecutors could then bring in evidence that when he was charged in a string of bank robberies in the 1950s, he ratted out his co-defendants in that case.

""He would be a grease spot on the floor after cross-examination,"" Cardinale said.

In the months before the trial, Bulger's lawyers said he was eager to testify to support his claim that he received immunity from crimes from a former federal prosecutor. But after Judge Denise Casper ruled that Bulger couldn't use that as a defense, his lawyers sidestepped the questions about his possible testimony.

On Friday, when the judge asked attorney J.W. Carney Jr. if Bulger might testify, he said only that he would let her know after his other witnesses testify. The first defense witnesses are to be called Monday.

Late Sunday, Bulger's attorneys filed a motion to have the jury sequestered when it begins deliberations.

The motion urged Casper to keep jurors away from media coverage, saying articles published about the defendant ""have extended far beyond mere recounting of testimony and have characterized the defendant in an extremely prejudicial manner.""

The motion said the defense wants ""to ensure that deliberations are not tainted by the opinion of anyone outside of the jury"" and singled out some statements made by media columnists.

During the prosecution's case, Bulger's lawyers spent a great deal of time trying to knock down the informant claim by suggesting that Bulger's FBI handler, retired Special Agent John Connolly Jr., attributed information from other informants to Bulger in an attempt to advance his own career. At the time, bringing down the Mafia was a national priority for the Justice Department, and Connolly's recruitment of top-echelon informants against the group won him numerous accolades. Connolly is now in prison.

Bulger has vehemently denied being an informant. Carney told the jury that it went against Bulger's Irish heritage to be an informant and that Bulger loathed anyone who ratted on friends or enemies.

So it would not be a complete surprise if Bulger wanted the jury to hear that from his own mouth.

But Bulger runs a high risk of prosecutors bringing in more damaging evidence if he testifies.

""He might insist that he wasn't a rat, he wasn't an informant. ... But is it worth it for him to hold his head high and say, 'I wasn't an informant for the government, or I never killed women' when he will be forced to admit other things on the stand?"" said Boston College law professor Michael Cassidy.

Ultimately, the decision will be up to Bulger.

Cassidy said Bulger could decide to testify simply to deny claims made by three once-loyal cohorts who became government witnesses and testified against him.

""He has to sit and listen to them without telling his version of the story,"" Cassidy said. ""Maybe he just insists on (testifying). 'You know, I'm going to jail for the next 10 years anyway, I'm going to die in prison. At least I'm going to have my time on the stand.' That's his right."""

After the Boston attacks%2C security was tight

Up to 80%2C000 people were expected to attend

Despite legalization%2C public consumption is still banned

DENVER (AP) — Authorities are hunting for suspects after shooting broke out during a massive marijuana celebration in Denver, leaving two people with gunshot wounds.

The gunfire scattered thousands attending Saturday's 4/20 counterculture holiday, the first since Colorado legalized marijuana.

A man and a woman each suffered non-life threatening gunshot wounds, officials said. Local media reports said a third person was grazed.

Denver Police spokesman Sonny Jackson said investigators are looking for one or two suspects, asking festival attendees for possible photo or video of the shootings.

He said police had no motive for the gunfire.

Witnesses described a scene in which a jovial atmosphere quickly turned to one of panic at the downtown Civic Center Park just before 5 p.m. Several thought firecrackers were being set off, then a man fell bleeding, his dog also shot.

""I saw him fall, grabbing his leg,"" said Travis Craig, 28, who was at the celebration, saw the shooting and said he used a belt to apply a tourniquet to the man's leg.

""He was just screaming that he was in pain, and wanted to know where his girlfriend was. She was OK. And then the cops showed up real quick, like, less than a minute. They put him on ambulance and left.""

The annual pot celebration this year was expected to draw as many as 80,000 people after recent laws in Colorado and Washington made marijuana legal for recreational use.

A sizable police force on motorcycles and horses had been watching the celebration since its start earlier Saturday. But authorities, who generally look the other way at public pot smoking here on April 20, didn't arrest people for smoking in public, which is still illegal.

Police said earlier in the week that they were focused on crowd security in light of attacks that killed three at the finish line of the Boston Marathon.

""We're aware of the events in Boston,"" said Denver police spokesman Aaron Kafer, who declined to give specifics about security measures being taken. ""Our message to the public is that, if you see something, say something.""

Stephanie Riedel, who traveled to the pot celebration from Pittsburgh, said she was dancing with a hula hoop when she heard pops. A man ran past her, then she said the crowd started screaming and running away. She was about 20 feet from the shooting and heard four or five shots.

""I couldn't make sense of what it was at first,"" she said. ""We were all having a good time and I was in the mindframe of, we're here at a peace gathering. I thought it some guys playing.""

Rapper Lil' Flip was performing when the shootings occurred.

Aerial footage showed the massive crowd frantically running from the park.

Ian Bay, who was skateboarding through Civic Center Park when shots erupted, said he was listening to music on his headphones when he looked to his right and saw a swarm of hundreds of people running at him.

""I sort of panicked. I thought I was going through an anxiety thing because so many people were coming after me,"" he said.

Before the shooting, reggae music filled the air, and so did the smell of marijuana, as celebrants gathered by mid-morning in the park just beside the state Capitol.

Group smoke-outs were planned Saturday from New York to San Francisco. The origins of the number ""420"" as a code for pot are murky, but the drug's users have for decades marked the date 4/20 as a day to use pot together.

Colorado and Washington are still waiting for a federal response to the votes and are working on setting up commercial pot sales, which are still limited to people with certain medical conditions. In the meantime, pot users are free to share and use the drug in small amounts.

A citizen advocacy group that opposes marijuana proliferation, Smart Colorado, warned in a statement that public 4/20 celebrations ""send a clear message to the rest of the nation and the world about what Colorado looks like.""

""Does the behavior of the participants in these events reflect well on our state?"" asked the head of Smart Colorado, Henny Lasley.

A smaller Sunday event scheduled at the park was canceled.

Saturday's attack recalled a similar shooting that left a police officer dead at a crowded jazz concert in Denver's City Park last summer.

The 22-year-old suspect in that case pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and faces at least 16 years in prison when he is sentenced at a hearing scheduled for June 21.

His attorneys said he was being pursued by gang members when he drew his weapon and fired.

Ever since the massacres in Newtown%2C Conn.%2C this idea has been repeated like some surreal requiem.

Both its underlying assumptions are contradicted by data.

True security in our schools and other designated gun-free places might require more.

Editor's note: This column originally appeared in March.

Ever since the massacres in Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., this idea has been repeated like some surreal requiem: The reason that mass gun violence keeps happening is because the United States is full of places that ban guns.

Second Amendment activists have long floated this theme, and now lawmakersacross the nation are using it, too. During a recent floor debate in the Colorado legislature, Republican state Rep. Carole Murray put it this way: ""Most of the mass killings that we talk about have been affected in gun-free zones. So when you have a gun-free zone, it's like saying, 'Come and get me.'""

The argument claims to explain both the motive behind mass shootings and how they play out. The killers deliberately choose sites where firearms are forbidden, gun-rights advocates say, and because there are no weapons, no ""good guy with a gun"" will be on hand to stop the crime.

Sound bite sophistry

With its overtones of fear and heroism, the argument makes for slick sound bites. But here's the problem: Both its underlying assumptions are contradicted by data. Not only is there zero evidence to support them, our examination at Mother Jones of America's mass shootings indicates they are just plain wrong.

Among the 62 mass shootings over the past 30 years that we studied, not a single case includes evidence that the killer chose to target a place because it banned guns. To the contrary, in many of the cases there was clearly another motive for the choice of location. For example, 20 were workplace shootings, most of which involved perpetrators who felt wronged by employers and colleagues. Last September, when a troubled man working at a sign manufacturer in Minneapolis was told he would be let go, he pulled out a 9mm Glock and killed six people and injured another before putting a bullet in his own head. Similar tragedies unfolded at a beer distributor in Connecticut in 2010 and at a plastics factory in Kentucky in 2008.

Or consider the 12 school shootings we documented, in which all but one of the killers had personal ties to the school they struck.

Or take the man who opened fire in suburban Milwaukee last August: Are we to believe that a white supremacist targeted the Sikh temple there not because it was filled with members of a religious minority he despised, but because it was a place that didn't allow firearms?

Suicide factor

Proponents of this argument also ignore that the majority of mass shootings are murder-suicides. Thirty-six of the killers we studied took their own lives at or near the crime scene, while seven others died in police shootouts they had no hope of surviving (aka ""suicide by cop""). These were not people whose priority was identifying the safest place to attack.

No less a fantasy is the idea that gun-free zones prevent armed civilians from saving the day. Not one of the 62 mass shootings we documented was stopped this way.

Shooting wrong person

Veteran FBI, ATF and police officials say that an armed citizen opening fire against an attacker in a panic-stricken movie theater or shopping mall is very likely to make matters worse. Law enforcement agents train rigorously for stopping active shooters, they say, a task that requires extraordinary skills honed under acute duress.

In cases in Washington state and Texas in 2005, would-be heroes who tried to take action with licensed firearms were gravely wounded or killed. In the mass shooting in Tucson, Ariz., in 2011, an armed citizen admitted to coming within a split second of gunning down the wrong person — one of the bystanders who had helped tackle and subdue the actual killer.

True security in our schools and other designated gun-free places might require more. Forbidding firearms alone clearly won't keep violence away — not least because of how easily bad guys can get their hands on guns. Nearly 80% of the mass shooters we documented obtained their weapons legally.

Indeed, America is anything but gun-free. We have more than 300 million firearms in private hands. In the past four years, nearly 100 state laws have loosened restrictions on them. To varying degrees, every state except Illinois now allows guns to be carried in public.

All of which raises an obvious question: If more guns in more places is a solution to the bloodshed, then why did we just witness the worst year for mass shootings in recent history?

Source: United States Fish and Wildlife Service

Source: United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

Nullification is the idea that in a system of state and federal laws, one law passed by a government can be overruled by another.

For example, if the state of New Jersey barred watching reality TV shows and an amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the rights to watch “Storage Wars,” one law trumps the other.

In the case of gun control, a Pennsylvania state lawmaker, State Senator John H. Eichelberger Jr., is introducing a law that makes it illegal for the federal government to enforce its gun control laws within his state.

Eichelberger joins another state legislator, Daryl Metcalfe, in proposing Pennsylvania laws that seek to nullify the enforcement of federal laws. Other states have also proposed their own nullification laws that would trump federal gun laws.

And in the case of marijuana, nine former leaders of the Drug Enforcement Administration said in a statement that they want the federal government to nullify newly passed state laws in Colorado and Washington, which legalize recreational marijuana use under controlled circumstances.

Former DEA administrator Peter Bensinger said nullification was a “no brainer.”

“It is outrageous that a lawsuit hasn’t been filed in federal court yet,” said Bensinger.

What each story has in common is the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Article VI, Clause 2, states that in a conflict of state and federal laws, the federal law is the supreme law of the land:

“This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.”

Story continues

Some proponents of states’ rights and the 10th Amendment don’t agree with the concept. But when challenged, the Supreme Court has decided that federal laws can’t be nullified by the states.

During the 1950s, a group of Southern states passed laws to block the desegregation of public schools. The court ruled in Cooper v. Aaron that the state of Arkansas couldn’t nullify a federal law and that the court had the power to make that decision.

States can contest the constitutionality of a federal law through the court system, and hope that a law is overturned. But they can’t decide to ignore a federal law—at least in theory.

That’s where the marijuana controversy comes into play in Colorado and Washington state, and in states that have passed their own medical marijuana laws.

The current federal statute on controlled substances makes medical and recreational marijuana a Schedule 1 controlled substance that is illegal nationally.

However, 18 states have made medical marijuana legal, and Colorado and Washington are now allowing people to smoke pot for fun under certain circumstances.

The administration of President Barack Obama faces a problem. Attorney General Eric Holder hasn’t made a decision yet about taking Colorado and Washington to court to invalidate their recreational marijuana laws.

If Holder does go to court, what does that mean for the states that have medical marijuana laws on the books? The attorney general has targeted medical marijuana dispensaries in recent years, but not smokers. Will those states also face lawsuits?

What if the Obama administration reaches a compromise with Colorado and Washington to let parts of their recreational marijuana laws stand?

Those state laws effectively nullify federal law, which isn’t exactly a precedent that the Justice Department would want to set for states that ignore possible federal gun control laws.

There’s some hope that Congress may act to change the federal statutes about marijuana use. And it seems unlikely, at this point, that major gun control laws will be coming from Congress in the near future.

But that could change if a compromise is reached in Congress on background checks on gun purchases. Several states strongly oppose the idea, and some local lawmakers have proposed state nullification laws to make gun registration illegal.

In some cases, the proposed state laws provide for the arrest of any federal official trying to enforce a gun-control law.

The agreement is the third-largest pharmaceutical settlement in United States history and the largest in a string of recent cases involving the marketing of antipsychotic and anti-seizure drugs to older dementia patients. It is part of a decade-long effort by the federal government to hold the health care giant — and other pharmaceutical companies — accountable for illegally marketing the drugs as a way to control patients with dementia in nursing homes and children with certain behavioral disabilities, despite the health risks of the drugs.

The settlement, which requires the approval of a federal judge, will also resolve accusations that the company inappropriately promoted two other drugs, the heart-failure drug Natrecor and Invega, a newer antipsychotic drug.

Much of the conduct highlighted in the case, which for Risperdal extends from 1999 through 2005, occurred while Alex Gorsky was vice president for sales and marketing and later president of the company’s pharmaceutical unit, Janssen. Mr. Gorsky became chief executive of Johnson & Johnson last year. Risperdal, which has lost its patent protection, was once one of the company’s best-selling drugs."

The 61-57 vote for a four-year pilot program was cheered by supporters who say the House has long been the highest hurdle for legalization; the Senate has previously passed similar legislation and Gov. Pat Quinn said Wednesday he was “open-minded” about the proposal.

Illinois would become the 19th state to legalize medical marijuana and proponents say it would be the most restrictive program in the country, with conditions on qualifying illnesses, physician approval and production of the drug.

“Ladies and gentlemen, this is not about getting high, it’s not about dope, it’s not about what our mothers told us when we went to college,” said Rep. Lou Lang, D-Skokie, the chief sponsor. “This is about providing a product at no expense to the taxpayers to provide better health care to people who desperately need this product.”

National opinion polls have suggested Americans are increasingly comfortable with marijuana for medical use, but opponents pointed out that many in law enforcement and medicine, as well as the federal government, are not on board.

“This bill is absolutely a wrong piece of legislation,” said Republican Rep. Jim Sacia, a former FBI agent from Pecatonica who added that many Illinois sheriffs oppose the proposal.

Lang implored fence-sitting lawmakers to stop forcing people who need relief into “some back alley” to score their pot, saying “we’re turning granny into a criminal.”

The most persuasive arguments may have been those from lawmakers who related personal stories.

With her voice breaking, Rep. JoAnn Osmond, R-Antioch, told colleagues she opposed the measure in the past but changed her mind because of an ill friend and his wife who spent time at Osmond’s home while the man battled chronic pain tied to complications from cancer. Osmond wouldn’t let him use marijuana in her house. Now, two years since his death, she said she wonders about her decision because he was in a daze from a painkiller prescription that “made him extremely sick, very sick.”

North Side Democratic Rep. Kelly Cassidy told colleagues the story of a brother-in-law who suffers from terminal cancer and “would not be with us if not for making use of cannabis.” Pain pills were “sucking the life out of him,” but now he and her sister can “enjoy what will be his last days,” she said.

“My sister and my brother-in-law, who I love dearly, are able to make the best of an absolutely horrific situation as a result of this product,” Cassidy said.

Rep. Deb Mell, D-Chicago, said she has taken medication for pain since having an August mastectomy and can relate to the suffering. “There's a real panic that comes in because it's like, 'I can't live with this pain, but I can't keep taking these pills,’” she said.

Under the bill, an individual could be prescribed no more than 2.5 ounces of marijuana over two weeks. A doctor who prescribes marijuana must have had a prior and ongoing relationship with the patient.

Patients would have to buy the marijuana from one of 60 dispensing centers throughout the state rather than be allowed to grow their own. Workers at dispensing centers would undergo criminal background checks, the stores would be under around-the-clock camera surveillance, and users would carry cards that indicate how much they had purchased to prevent stockpiling.

Marijuana would be grown inside 22 cultivation centers registered with the Illinois Department of Agriculture.

A previous version of the legislation had allowed patients to grow their own, but that provision was removed to make the bill more restrictive, said Sen. Bill Haine, D-Alton, who sponsored similar legislation that passed the Senate in 2009 and will be the lead sponsor of the current measure.

The bill also says a person who uses medical marijuana would be required to take a field sobriety test if police pulled over a car. Refusal would lead to a one-year driver’s license suspension and revocation of the medical marijuana privilege, Haine said.

Currently, field sobriety tests in police stops for driving under the influence of marijuana generally can be inadmissible in court cases. The legislation now would allow field sobriety tests to be admissible as evidence at trial in a case of driving under the influence of marijuana, Haine said.

Haine acknowledged “there is a question as to how much marijuana impairs a driver.” Current Illinois law says a driver with a trace of marijuana in his system can be convicted of driving under the influence.

Haine, a former Madison County state’s attorney, dismissed the argument that “this can be abused, it’s a gateway drug. The people who are using it, many of them are terminal. I don’t know what gateway they’re talking about.”

The bill goes to the Senate, where President John Cullerton, D-Chicago, supported the previous medical pot bill that passed the upper chamber in 2009. The House vote came only hours after Quinn said he was impressed by the story of an injured military veteran who maintained marijuana provided him relief from war wounds.

Outside the capital, some opponents to the bill expressed their dismay.

“It’s really, strongly unfortunate,” said Dr. Eric A. Voth, a Topeka, Kan., physician who is chairman of the Institute on Global Drug Policy. He said he’s watched pro-marijuana lobbying groups work the medical marijuana angle for years.

“I think it’s unfortunate that Illinois fell into their clutches,” Voth said.

Voth’s biggest concern, echoed by John Kennedy, the executive director of the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police, is that the law would allow medical marijuana to bypass FDA regulation, which could jeopardize consumers, he said."

The person resided at Pavillon Beau-Lieu, a special care home in Grand Falls, where there's an outbreak involving the variant first reported in South Africa. Health Minister Dorothy Shephard said she is saddened by the news. ""I join all New Brunswickers in sharing sincere condolences with this person's loved ones during this difficult time,"" she said in a statement. On Sunday, Public Health announced another resident of the special care home, someone in their 80s, had died in hospital ""as a result of COVID-19."" With the 15 new cases, there are now 142 active cases of respiratory disease in the province. Six people are in hospital, including two in intensive care. The breakdown of the new cases is as follows: Moncton region, Zone 1: one case: A person 30 to 39 This case is a contact of a previously confirmed case. Saint John region, Zone 2: three cases: A person 30 to 39 A person 40 to 49 A person 50 to 59 One case is under investigation, one case is travel-related and the other is a contact of a previously confirmed case. Fredericton region, Zone 3: five cases: A person under 19 A person 30 to 39 A person 40 to 49 Two people 60 to 69 Three of the cases are contacts of a previously confirmed case and two are travel-related.

New Brunswick has had 1,954 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started just over a year ago. There have been 1,773 recoveries so far. A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/17/world/americas/toronto-mayor-crack-allegations/,2013-05-17 00:00:00,['Ashley Fantz'],Reports: Video appears to show Toronto mayor using crack pipe,"Story highlights Toronto Star, Gawker: Toronto mayor seen in video appearing to smoke from crack pipe

Video given to reporters by someone claiming they gave Rob Ford the drugs

Ford calls allegations ""ridiculous"" and ""untrue""

Toronto's mayor has purportedly been filmed on cellphone video smoking crack cocaine, the Toronto Star reported.

The footage appears to show Rob Ford ""sitting in a chair, wearing a white shirt, top buttons open, inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe,"" the newspaper says.

Two of the newspaper's reporters were shown the footage May 3 by someone who claims to have supplied the crack and shot the video. This person told the Star that they have previously given the mayor crack. The reporters watched the video three times.

The newspaper reports that the 90-second video allegedly shot last winter shows Ford ""incoherent, trading jibes with an off-camera speaker who goads the clearly impaired mayor by raising topics including Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and the high school football team Ford coaches.""

""I'm f---ing right wing,"" Ford seems to mutter, the report says. ""Everyone expects me to be right wing. I'm just supposed to be this great ... ""

The newspaper says that the mayor appears to refer to the players on the football team as ""just f---ing minorities.""

The Star claims the video ends when the smartphone rings and the mayor says, ""That phone better not be on.""

The video is being shopped around by a group of men involved in the drug trade, the Star reported Thursday.

The newspaper says that it has no way to verify the authenticity of the tape, and reports that its attempts to get comment from the mayor or his staff Thursday about the video were unsuccessful.

Thursday night, Ford's chief of staff, Mark Towhey, would not listen to questions by the Star and hung up on a reporter, the newspaper reports.

CNN cannot confirm the video's authenticity.

Ford spoke Friday morning to reporters, but did not answer questions. He denied allegations, calling them ""ridiculous"" and ""not true.""

CNN has calls into the mayor and the mayor's lawyer, Dennis Morris.

Also Thursday, the news site Gawker also ran a story about the video. A Gawker journalist says he was contacted by a tipster who described the tape, and the Gawker reporter flew to Canada to see the video in person. The journalist met with two men, one of whom showed the video -- still on the phone -- to the journalist, and then demanded money for the tape. The Gawker reporter did not pay for it and the man with the phone took off.

Morris called Gawker's report ""false and defamatory,"" the Star reported.

Morris told the Star that it's impossible to know from watching a video what a person is actually smoking or drinking.

By Friday morning, reporters swarmed Toronto's City Hall hoping to interview the mayor, but instead interviewed deputy mayor Doug Holyday about the allegations. Holyday, the mayor's closest political ally, said he had not heard from the mayor Friday and didn't know where he was.

A reporter asked Holyday whether he believes the allegations are false.

""I hope so,"" he replied. The mayor should address the accusations ""sooner than later,"" he said. ""I would advise the mayor to speak to the media but I think he has to do it in a prepared way.""

Another reporter asked whether the scandal makes it possible Ford to continue to govern.

Holyday said he still has confidence in Ford, but said that he is willing to step up and replace the mayor if that becomes necessary.

Regardless, the scandal is hurting the city's reputation as the Star and Gawker's coverage is reposted around the world, the deputy mayor said.

""Whether you can blame the mayor or not blame the mayor depends on whether the story is true,"" Holyday said. ""I don't know that and I don't know that any of you do.""

He added: ""Certainly we all know that videos can be altered and we certainly know that drug dealers can't be trusted.""

CNN has been trying to interview the mayor for several months regarding the recommendation that Toronto create supervised injection centers for drug addicts. The mayor has declined all of CNN's requests."

USA TODAY

They're at it again at Spirit Airlines, where the discount airline's marketing staff has rolled out its latest in a growing list of off-color ads pegged toward unseemly current events.

Spirit's newest target is Toronto's mayor, who recently reversed months of denials and admitted that he smoked crack. Even since that admission, Mayor Rob Ford has remained in the news by offering what seems like an endless offering of tactless public statements. And on Friday he was stripped of key executive powers by the Toronto City Council.

The episode has been an embarrassment for Toronto, Canada's largest – and usually low-drama – city. But while Ford's behavior may be unwanted publicity for locals, Spirit sees an opportunity to sell airline tickets.

""We're not smoking crack...our fares REALLY are this low!"" Spirit crows in an advertisement for flights to New York's Niagara Falls International, a little-used airport 90 miles from Toronto that the ultra low-cost carrier bills as an alternative to the Canadian metropolis.

The ad shows the shadowy image of a man whose silhouette could pass for Ford's. The man depicted in the ad then exhales a puff of smoke, though the carrier stops short of showing an actual pipe.

Spirit's Ford-themed ad is just the latest in a long line of edgy ads that play off current events. Previous targets have ranged from Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and a perceived debate gaffe to Anthony Weiner, who eventually admitted to texting lewd photos of himself to women other than his wife.

Not even airline rivals have been safe. Spirit mocked American Airlines by having a ""7.57% off"" sale when American had problems with seats coming loose on its Boeing 757 jets.

The latest ad targeting Toronto may be of questionable taste. But it could help Spirit raise its awareness in the populous southern Ontario region that abuts Toronto.

Spirit's ads already have drawn attention in Canada's largest media market, including a mention in some of the nation's most-read newspapers. Since Spirit doesn't actually fly to Toronto -- or even Canada -- any attention is likely helpful in getting the carrier to have customers consider Niagara Falls as an alternative for Toronto's Pearson and Billy Bishop airports.

In a trend that's developed during the past few years, a large number of Canadians living near the U.S. border have opted to make the drive to U.S. airports, where fares often are markedly lower than from those in Canada.



But even in its own home market of western New York, the Niagara Falls airport is a distant second to much-busier Buffalo Niagara International -- which itself counts on Canadians for more than a third of its passenger traffic.

The Niagara Falls airport has regular service on just two airlines: Spirit and leisure-oriented Allegiant."

The Associated Press reported this month in an investigative article that Washington in 2011 authorized $1.3 billion for U.S. military electronics in Honduras. This is happening while the post-coup regime of Honduran President Porfirio Lobo is more out of control than ever, especially since the Honduran Congress staged a “technical coup” in December.

But as the Obama administration deepens its partnership with Honduras, ostensibly to fight the drug war, Democrats in Congress are increasingly rebelling. Here’s a message, then, for new Secretary of State John Kerry: Recast U.S. policy in Honduras and the murderous drug war that justifies it.

In the last few years, the U.S. has been ramping up its military operations throughout Latin America in what the Associated Press called “the most expensive initiative in Latin America since the Cold War.” The buildup has cost U.S. taxpayers more than $20 billion since 2002, for troops, ships, clandestine bases, radar, military and police training and other expenses.

U.S. military expenditures for Honduras in particular have gone up every year since 2009, when a military coup deposed democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya. At $67.4 million, 2012 Defense Department contracts for Honduras are triple those of 10 years ago. The U.S. spent $25 million last year to make the U.S. barracks at the Soto Cano air base permanent, and $89 million to keep 600 U.S. troops based there. U.S. direct aid to the Honduran military and police continues to climb as well.

But the Obama administration’s escalating military commitment in Honduras only deepens its support for the corrupt and repressive Lobo government. State security forces still enjoy near-complete impunity for thousands of alleged human rights abuses and even murders since the 2009 coup. The government hasn’t paid many of its teachers for at least six months, and the country is close to bankrupt.

On Dec. 13, in a clash of two equally corrupt groups of competing elites, the Honduran Congress illegally deposed four members of the Supreme Court, swearing in new justices within hours. Since then, the congress has run roughshod over the constitution, rapidly repassing a series of laws that had been overruled by the court, including a much-criticized mining law and a notorious law authorizing so-called model cities in which the constitution itself doesn’t apply.

These actions blatantly disregard the rule of law. Yet the U.S. State Department looked the other way at this “technical coup.”

In pouring U.S. military resources into the corrupt Honduran government, Washington argues that it is helping fight drug trafficking, which is indeed rampant, murderous and growing. But the Honduran government and the elites who control it are widely alleged to be implicated in the drug trafficking.

The drug war, though, does provide cover for a new wave of U.S. aggression in Latin America. Honduras, with the only large U.S. Air Force base between the United States and South America, has long been important as a linchpin of U.S. military domination of the region, including, most famously, U.S. involvement in the 1954 coup in Guatemala and the 1980s Contra war against the Nicaraguan government. Today, the expanding U.S. role poses an enormous threat to the whole region, and to Honduras’ sovereignty.

Moreover, as the media have reported, the Obama administration’s drug war in Honduras has been a disaster. In May 2012, agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration participated in an operation in which four Afro-indigenous villagers were killed and several others injured in the Mosquitia region of Honduras. The DEA acknowledges that it killed two alleged drug traffickers in separate incidents in June and July. In July, after the Honduran military shot down two supposed drug planes in violation of international protocol, the U.S. suspended radar cooperation for drug flights. In January, in the first joint operation after cooperation resumed, the Honduran coast guard killed an alleged drug trafficker utilizing intelligence provided by DEA agents.

Many Democrats in Congress have had enough. On Jan. 30, 58 members of the House, led by Reps. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), Karen Bass (D-Los Angeles), John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) sent a letter to Kerry and Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. demanding that the May 2012 incident involving the DEA be investigated, calling attention to state-sponsored repression of Afro-indigenous Hondurans and questioning the drug war. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt. ) has on hold about $30 million in U.S. aid to Honduran security forces, pending answers to questions about abuses of civilians and corruption.

That’s a start, but Kerry and the administration need to reverse U.S. policy in Honduras altogether. End the bloody drug war and focus on job creation and social justice instead. Stop treating the current Honduran government like a friendly partner; instead, forthrightly denounce its human rights abuses and corruption of the rule of law. Help guarantee a free presidential election in November by condemning the assassinations of at least five opposition party activists and candidates in the last year, and demand adequate protection for the hundreds of Hondurans in the opposition who have received death threats.

In other words, stop arming Honduran thugs and allow those in the opposition the space to define their own future, free of U.S. interference.

At least one gunman and possibly more burst into the party Sunday evening and opened fire with assault rifles on about 30 people who were marking the tournament win of the Cardinals baseball team, the regional prosecutor’s office said.

Prosecutors said they did not know the motive behind the massacre. But it bore grim resemblance to the 2010 killing of 15 mostly young people at a soccer party, the kind of violence once commonplace along the border.

In that event, one of the drug gangs operating in Ciudad Juarez mistook the celebrants for a rival cartel. It was a time when traffickers were fighting for control of Juarez and its lucrative smuggling passageways to the U.S., turning the border city into the deadliest in the Americas.

The killings subsided significantly last year, after the Sinaloa cartel and its allies prevailed over other gangs. Although homicides are down, other cartel-related crimes, including kidnapping and extortion, continue largely unabated.

Sunday’s slaughter, however, revived dark memories.

Bodies lay strewn outside the modest house in the Juarez suburb of Loma Blanca, suggesting some had tried to flee when the shooting started. Survivors identified the victims as a 7-year-old girl, her mother and at least one 15-year-old boy. Several seemed to be from the same family, gathered to celebrate a rare baseball victory.

“They never won, never, and then suddenly yesterday they win, 19-3, and look how this all ended up,” the sister of the slain 15-year-old, Luis Alonso Frayre Alarcon, told El Diario newspaper.

Alberto Carrillo Fuentes, named by Mexican authorities as a leader of the Juarez cartel, was captured late last month. Known by the alias “Ugly Betty,” Carrillo Fuentes was remanded to prison on weapons charges and had been considered the head of an effort to revive the cartel after its recent losses.

http://news.yahoo.com/us-angry-over-released-mexican-drug-lord-051722166.html,,[],US angry over released of Mexican drug lord,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — U.S. law enforcement officials expressed outrage over the release from prison of Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero and vowed to continue efforts to bring to justice the man who ordered the killing of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent.

Caro Quintero was sentenced to 40 years in prison for the 1985 kidnapping and killing of DEA agent Enrique Camarena but a Mexican federal court ordered his release this week saying he had been improperly tried in a federal court for state crimes.

The 60-year-old walked out of a prison in the western state of Jalisco early Friday after serving 28 years of his sentence.

The U.S. Department of Justice said it found the court's decision ""deeply troubling.""

""The Department of Justice, and especially the Drug Enforcement Administration, is extremely disappointed with this result,"" it said in a statement.

The Association of Former Federal Narcotics Agents in the United States said it was ""outraged"" by Caro Quintero's early release and it blamed corruption within Mexico's justice system for his early release.

""The release of this violent butcher is but another example of how good faith efforts by the U.S. to work with the Mexican government can be frustrated by those powerful dark forces that work in the shadows of the Mexican 'justice' system,"" the organization said in a statement.

The DEA, meanwhile, said it ""will vigorously continue its efforts to ensure Caro-Quintero faces charges in the United States for the crimes he committed.""

But experts say the case against Caro Quintero was flawed from the beginning and his release is the result of a stronger federal justice system in Mexico, and it's not likely to have an impact in U.S.-Mexico relations.

Caro Quintero was a founding member of one of Mexico's earliest and biggest drug cartels. He helped establish a powerful cartel based in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa that later split into some of Mexico's largest cartels, including the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels.

Story continues

But he wasn't tried for drug trafficking, a federal crime in Mexico. Instead, Mexican federal prosecutors, under intense pressure from the United States, hastily put together a case against him for Camarena's kidnapping and killing, both state crimes.

""What we are seeing here is a contradiction between the need of the government to keep dangerous criminals behind bars and its respect of due process,"" said Raul Benitez, a security expert at Mexico's National Autonomous University.

""The United States wants Mexico to comply with due process but it is likely that due process was not followed when many criminals were caught 10 or 15 years.""

Mexican courts and prosecutors have long tolerated illicit evidence such as forced confessions and have frequently based cases on questionable testimony or hearsay. Such practices have been banned by recent judicial reforms, but past cases, including those against high-level drug traffickers, are often rife with such legal violations.

Mexico's relations with Washington were badly damaged when Caro Quintero ordered Camarena kidnapped, tortured and killed, purportedly because he was angry about a raid on a 220-acre (89-hectare) marijuana plantation in central Mexico named ""Rancho Bufalo"" — Buffalo Ranch — that was seized by Mexican authorities at Camarena's insistence.

Camarena was kidnapped in Guadalajara, a major drug trafficking center at the time. His body and that of his Mexican pilot, both showing signs of torture, were found a month later, buried in shallow graves. American officials accused their Mexican counterparts of letting Camarena's killers get away. Caro Quintero was eventually hunted down in Costa Rica.

Times have changed since then, and cooperation has strengthened and this is likely to have little impact on the overall relationship between Mexico and the United States, said Tony Payan, an expert on U.S.-Mexico relations at the University of Texas-El Paso.

The U.S. and Mexico ""will scramble for a bit, but in the end they will understand this is a very complex relationship and nothing is going to happen,"" Payan said. ""They are not going to jeopardize the overall relationship over this.""

Caro Quintero still faces charges in the United States, but Mexico's Attorney General's Office said it was unclear whether there was a current extradition request.

Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam later said in a statement that his office is analyzing whether there are any charges pending against Caro Quintero.

The U.S. Department of Justice said it ""has continued to make clear to Mexican authorities the continued interest of the United States in securing Caro Quintero's extradition so that he might face justice in the United States.""

Samuel Gonzalez, Mexico's former top anti-drug prosecutor, said the U.S. government itself has been promoting, and partly financing, judicial reforms in Mexico aimed at respecting procedural guarantees for suspects, an approach Gonzalez feels has weighted the balance too far against prosecutors and victims.

""This is all thanks to the excessive focus on procedural guarantees supported by the U.S. government itself,"" Gonzalez said. ""I warned them (U.S. officials) that they were going to get out, and they are all going to get out,"" he said referring to long-imprisoned drug lords such as Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, who is also serving a sentence related to the Camarena case."

The United States' Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) has offered to help Jamaica's anti-doping team because they feel the island's athletes have been ""let down"".

Usada's chief executive Travis Tygart said talks had already begun over a possible partnership with Jamaica.

""Jamaican athletes deserve a robust anti-doping programme,"" said Tygart.

Six Jamaican athletes have tested positive this year and the country has already been accused of ""losing its way"" on drug testing for athletes.

Drug testing in Jamaica After the World Anti-Doping Agency visit, Jamaican sport minister Natalie Neita Headley vowed to increase the current annual testing budget of around £380,000

Extra money will be used to hire more senior executives to run the anti-doping programme and to hire and train additional testers

Number of tests conducted by Jadco will be raised from 300 this year to 400 in 2014

John Fahey, president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), earlier this week said his organisation had been aware of difficulties in Jamaica for some time, revealing one of the solutions was for the country's anti-doping team to be mentored by a more successful agency.

Paul Wright, Jamaica's most senior drug tester, also warned that the recent rash of failed tests might be the ""tip of an iceberg"".

Former Jadco (Jamaica's anti-doping commission) executive director Renee Anne Shirley raised concerns when she said the agency had conducted only one out-of-competition test in the six months leading up to the 2012 Olympic Games in London.

Her comments followed a series of positive tests for Jamaican athletes and resulted in Wada visiting the country at the end of October to assess its doping policies.

Former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell, three-time Olympic gold medallist Veronica Campbell-Brown and Olympic relay gold medallist Sherone Simpson are among six Jamaicans who have tested positive this year.

""Right now, the athletes in Jamaica are being let down by their organisation,"" said Tygart.

""Having one test out of competition prior to the London Olympic Games, if what is being reported is accurate, is unacceptable. No blood test, no human growth hormone test - that's an injustice to the fairness of the sport and tremendously letting down those athletes.

""A firm, committed play to moving forward is what we're all after.

""There have been discussions. We've talked to Wada, we've met with the Jamaican officials.

""We'll sort through whether there's a role for us to play. We're happy to help some other programmes that need some assistance."""

(CNN) —

Explosive new allegations surfaced about embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford in court documents released Wednesday – the same day the city council voted to ask him to take a leave of absence.

The court report, more than 500 pages long, alleges a pattern of drug use, and erratic and sometimes abusive behavior by the mayor. A judge ordered the report’s release late last month.

The documents include police interviews with former staff members, information obtained from surveillance crews and cameras, and even an examination of the mayor’s garbage.

The documents were used by Canadian police to get a search warrant for Alexander Lisi, Ford’s friend and occasional driver, whom police accuse of marijuana possession and trafficking.

Several staffers said they were asked to buy alcohol for the mayor. One incident described by a former staffer alleged that Ford, while driving, stopped the vehicle, guzzled some vodka, and drove on.

Chris Fickel, who worked as a special assistant to Ford, said the mayor would ask him to perform odd jobs at his house. Fickel said he would be called “to change light bulbs in the front lawn, change batteries in his children’s toys, buying cartons of cigarettes, bleach, laundry detergent and diet Coke for the mayor’s wife.”

One staffer told police the mayor was inebriated on St. Patrick’s Day in 2012 and got into a physical altercation with two staff members. He alleges the mayor was verbally abusive and inappropriate with a female staff member.

Another staffer said the same night, he saw a woman who may have been an escort or prostitute in the mayor’s office.

Ford’s former press secretary George Christopoulos also said women often came to the mayor’s office, “and told staffers that they have smoked a joint with the mayor on the street outside of the bar. These women were told by the mayor that they could have a job.” Christopoulos would then have to interview these women and try to talk them out of a job.

None of the allegations against Ford has been proven, and he faces no criminal charges.

Ford vows to stay on the job

Despite the Toronto City Council’s motion, the mayor of Canada’s largest city insists he will stay on the job.

Wednesday’s vote is largely symbolic – it does not have the power to force Ford from his post.

The tense council meeting came more than a week after Ford admitted smoking crack cocaine.

Days after that admission, a new video showed a ranting, swearing Ford threatening to kill someone.

Toronto mayor’s rant caught on video

During Wednesday’s meeting, Ford made a further confession to the council.

He said he has purchased illegal drugs within the past two years, while he was in office.

Despite his escalating troubles, Ford insists he has been a good mayor and that voters will decide during next year’s election whether to keep him.

“I have made a mistake. I am human,” he said. “I apologize. I want to move on.”

Ford said that he is being subjected to a “public flogging” and that the experience has been the most humiliating thing in his life, maybe the worst week in his life next to his father’s death.

Despite the admission of drug use and of heavy drinking, Ford flatly denied that he is addicted to alcohol or drugs.

“The reason I drank or did drugs was not because of stress, it was out of sheer stupidity,” he said. “That’s all it was.”

Ford’s brother, Councilor Doug Ford, and other family members have defended the embattled mayor.

On Wednesday, Doug Ford appeared on CNN and blamed the scandal on politics.

“Rob does not come into work drunk,” he told CNN. “He said he’s tried illicit drugs under a drunken stupor.”

“And he’s not doing drugs. And he’s not drinking. So he’s moving in the right direction, in my opinion, but the public flogging, never seen anything like it. This man has apologized profusely. He’s asked for forgiveness, and the rest is sheer politics down here.”

He’s not Teflon, but to ‘Ford Nation,’ Toronto mayor is still their man

Rubin'],Afghanistan Bristles at U.S. Ban on Kam Air Airline,"KABUL, Afghanistan — A recent move by the United States military to bar one of Afghanistan’s major airlines from contracts because of allegations of narcotics smuggling has caused a diplomatic firestorm, with Afghan officials angrily demanding proof and some American officials quietly criticizing the timing of the decision.

The blacklisting of the airline, Kam Air, is said to have started early this month and was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Friday. The article quoted American military officials as saying the ban on American military contracts was based on information that the airline had carried “bulk quantities” of opium out of the country as well as within it.

Kam Air officials deny the accusation, and the Afghan government says it has no knowledge of such activities. President Hamid Karzai’s spokesman, Aimal Faizi, demanded that the American military hand over any evidence it had so that the government could act on the charges.

“We have to get to the bottom of this in order to take action,” Mr. Faizi said. “We need evidence and proofs in this regard. We cannot make inquiries based on a newspaper article.”"

USA TODAY

The Obama administration is protesting the release of convicted murderer and drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero.

A statement from Caitlin Hayden:

""We are deeply concerned by the release of Rafael Caro Quintero from prison in Mexico. He had been serving a 40-year prison term for the 1985 kidnapping, torture and murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena.

""We have seen reports that another individual connected to Camarena's killing could also be released.

""We remain as committed today in seeing Quintero and others involved in this crime face justice in the United States as we were in the immediate aftermath of Kiki Camarena's murder and will work closely with the Mexican authorities on this.""

Some background from the Associated Press:

""Infamous drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero walked free Friday after 28 years in prison when a court overturned his 40-year sentence for the 1985 kidnapping and killing of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent, a brutal murder that marked a low point in U.S.-Mexico relations. ...

""Mexico's Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said in a statement that he was 'worried' about the court's decision, adding that his office is analyzing whether there are any charges pending against Caro Quintero.

""Caro Quintero, 60, was a founding member of one of Mexico's earliest and biggest drug cartels. The court ruled Wednesday that he had been improperly tried in a federal court for a crime that should have been treated as a state offense. Prison officials were notified of the ruling on Thursday, and an official at the Jalisco state prosecutors' office said the drug lord left prison before dawn on Friday. The official was not authorized to speak on the record.

""News media were not alerted until hours after the release, and U.S. authorities apparently received no prior notification."""

USA TODAY

Allegedly pointed blame at husband before she was charged on Friday

A TV actress was arrested and charged Friday in connection with ricin-laced letters sent to President Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The arrest of Shannon Rogers Guess Richardson, 35, comes two weeks after Richardson contacted the FBI claiming that her husband, Nathan Richardson, had sent the letters last month to Obama, Bloomberg and Mark Glaze, head of a gun-control organization co-founded by Bloomberg.

Richardson, according to a federal criminal complaint, is charged with mailing a threatening communication to the the president. An arrest affidavit says Richardson mailed the letters on May 20. She made an initial court appearance in Texas Friday afternoon. If convicted, she faces up to 10 years in prison.

Nathan Richardson, a 33-year-old Army veteran, was questioned by the FBI last week. He's been married to Ms. Richardson, a former Dallas beauty queen, since 2011. She has had minor roles in cable TV series The Walking Dead and The Vampire Diaries.

Richardson contacted agents after she said she found a suspicious substance in her refrigerator and ricin-related Internet searches on the couple's computer. But investigators said she had sent the letters.

Attorney John Delk, who represents Nathan Richardson, said his client is divorcing his wife and claimed she was trying to set him up when she contacted authorities about the letters. ""There are a lot of factors I'm aware of that indicate (he) was set up in this deal by her,"" Delk said.

Delk said Nathan Richardson came to him to discuss a potential divorce a year ago and finally hired him on May 6, weeks before the ricin incident came to light. The couple is expecting their first child in October. Shannon Richardson has five children ranging in age from 4 to 19 from other relationships, Delk said.

FBI agents in hazardous material suits were seen at her home earlier this week in New Boston, Texas, a small community near the Oklahoma-Arkansas border.

%22He was completely normal%22

Students in Tsarnaev%27s dorm say the alleged bomber did not appear radical

Bomb suspect described as likeable%2C friendly%2C often high on pot

DARTMOUTH, Mass. -- Friends and classmates of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev can't grasp how the pot-smoking, party boy they knew is the same young man now accused of carrying out a terrorist attack.

Tsarnaev was funny, sarcastic, liked to party and frequently reeked of marijuana, said students in a sophomore residence at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth where the alleged bomber lived.

Several students on Tuesday described a shared shock and disbelief as classmates discovered that Tsarnaev faces federal charges of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction.

""It's like finding out your best friend is a serial killer,"" said Jennifer Mendez, who met Tsarnaev last year in their freshmen dorm. ""He was really social and hilarious. He was one of those people who would crack one joke and make your night.""

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, carried out two explosions that rocked the Boston Marathon on April 15, federal officials say. The bombs left three people dead and more than 260 others injured.

Last Thursday, the two allegedly gunned down Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier as they were being sought by authorities. The older brother was killed in a confrontation with police early Friday morning. The younger Tsarnaev brother now faces criminal charges that carry a possible death sentence.

Mendez, 20, grew close with Dzhokar Tsarnaev. Both moved into Pine Dale Hall to start their sophomore year.

On Sunday, the FBI searched Tsarnaev's dorm room in that building and seized BBs, a large pyrotechnic, and ""a black jacket and a white hat of the same general appearance as those worn by Bomber Two at the Boston marathon on April 15,"" according to the criminal complaint filed against Tsarnaev.

Mendez can't imagine the motives behind Tsarnaev's alleged actions. Like many in Pine Dale Hall, she didn't connect the blurry picture of Suspect Two to their classmate.

In the years she knew him, Mendez said Tsarnaev just enjoyed playing soccer, talked about his years wrestling and mulled over the demands of college life: professors, classes, and homework. Partying and drinking filled their days, she said, and Tsarnaev did not show signs he was becoming radical or changing in any way.

Her best memories are of the two sitting outside Maple Ridge Hall, the freshman dorm they shared, talking about school and the excitement of being in college.

Mendez, a biology and chemistry double major, last partied with Tsarnaev last semester. The demands of her studies slowed her partying down this semester, but Tsarnaev seemed normal when she sat in politics class with him or when she passed him on the way to his third-floor dorm.

Tsarnaev shared that third-floor dorm room with another student, said Patrick Yaghoobian, 20, who lived next -door to the pair all school year.

""He smoked a lot of pot,"" he said of Tsarnaev on Tuesday afternoon. ""He smelled like it every day.""

A strong smell of marijuana emanated from the room throughout the school year while Tsarnaev, himself, reeked of the drug, Yaghoobian said. The smell was absent last Monday when the bombing took place.

He said Tsarnaev was a quiet kid who walked around with the same blank, emotionless expression seen in many of the photos released by the FBI.

The Millbury, Mass., native added that there were no signs of radicalism: ""I've looked into his room a few times, and there was nothing religious or nothing that screamed out he was Muslim."""

Former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, are battling a 14-count public-corruption indictment that alleges they lent the prestige of the governor’s office to a Richmond area businessman in exchange for gifts and loans.

Gov. Robert F. McDonnell was supposed to be in the thick of the race to succeed him. Instead, the Republican found himself relegated to the role of passive observer, keeping busy with other engagements amid a gifts scandal. Here are some photos of McDonnell’s time in office as his four-year term comes to a close.

Gov. Robert F. McDonnell was supposed to be in the thick of the race to succeed him. Instead, the Republican found himself relegated to the role of passive observer, keeping busy with other engagements amid a gifts scandal. Here are some photos of McDonnell’s time in office as his four-year term comes to a close.

Federal prosecutors told Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell last week that he and his wife would be charged in connection with a gift scandal, but senior Justice Department officials delayed the decision after the McDonnells’ attorneys made a face-to-face appeal in Washington, according to people familiar with the case.

Dana J. Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, told the McDonnells’ legal teams that he planned to ask a grand jury to return an indictment no later than this past Monday, people familiar with the conversations said.

McDonnell (R) and his wife, Maureen, would have been charged with working together to illegally promote a struggling dietary-supplement company in exchange for gifts and loans from its chief executive, the people said.

The plan to seek the felony charges this week changed, however, after attorneys for the state’s first couple met with Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole on Dec. 12.

The attorneys argued that the governor had done nothing improper to assist businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr. In particular, they focused on the credibility of a key witness, said a person familiar with the presentation. They also argued that if prosecutors proceeded with charges, they should wait until after McDonnell left office Jan. 11 to allow a smooth transition of power to Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe (D).

Some element of the lawyers’ arguments apparently persuaded the Justice Department to delay, according to people with knowledge of the case. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.

On Friday, the day after the meeting, McDonnell’s attorneys were told that the decision would be put on hold, the people said. A final decision about whether to press charges is now not expected before Jan. 2 and could come as late as February, they said.

Jason Miyares, a spokesman for McDonnell’s legal team, and William A. Burck, an attorney for McDonnell’s wife, declined to comment. Boente and a spokesman for the Justice Department also declined to comment. McDonnell has maintained that he has done nothing wrong.

It is not unusual that a high-profile target, especially a sitting governor, would be allowed a chance to appeal a U.S. attorney’s charging decision to top officials of the Justice Department. It would be very rare, however, for the Justice Department to ultimately overturn a decision made by a U.S. attorney.

Relationship probed

Federal prosecutors have been investigating the McDonnells’ relationship with Williams for most of this year. Williams provided more than $165,000 in gifts and loans to the governor and his family. The gifts came as the McDonnells took steps to promote Williams’s company, Star Scientific Inc., including hosting a lunch at the Executive Mansion to mark the launch of a new product. The McDonnells also helped company executives secure meetings with state officials.

McDonnell has apologized for the relationship, but he insisted that he treated Star just as he would have any other Virginia-based business. The company received no state grants, contracts or board appointments.

He has said in several recent interviews that he would like to see the investigation concluded as quickly as possible.

“I’m hoping it will all be resolved in the very near future,” he told The Washington Post last month.

But privately, as prosecutors signaled their intent to file charges, McDonnell’s attorneys have been pressing Justice Department officials to reconsider or delay — at least long enough for McDonnell to complete his four-year term and avoid becoming the first sitting governor in state history to face criminal charges.

The investigation has focused on whether McDonnell violated the Hobbs Act, which makes it a federal crime for a public official to receive payments or other financial gifts, knowing that those payments are in return for the official’s promise to take action in his government role.

To prove the crime, it is not necessary to show that the public official actually took the steps or that any of the official acts resulted in benefits to the person making the payments. Private citizens can also be charged under the law if they caused the public official to take actions or make such promises.

McDonnell is also the subject of a state investigation into whether his annual financial disclosures complied with Virginia law. It is a misdemeanor under Virginia law for an elected official to knowingly submit false or incomplete information on annual financial disclosure forms.

McDonnell has said he complied with state law, which allows elected officials to accept gifts of any value provided they disclose those worth more than $50; they are not required to disclose gifts to their families or loans to their businesses.

Attorneys working for Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R) learned in March 2012 of allegations that McDonnell’s forms might be incomplete. As required by law, Cuccinelli designated a local prosecutor to conduct a full investigation, turning the case over to Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Michael Herring in November 2012.

But Virginia law requires prosecutors to press charges within a year of being alerted to possible legal violations. That statute of limitations is expiring, which has become a factor in both the state and federal investigations.

Herring had reached an agreement with McDonnell’s attorneys to extend the statute of limitations into this month, said a person familiar with its terms. But the state probe has been on hold while federal prosecutors decided whether to proceed with more serious felony charges, and federal prosecutors felt pressured by the looming state deadline, the person said.

On Friday, all sides agreed to extend the deal on the state charges — known as a tolling agreement — into early February. That allows more time for federal authorities to make a final decision.

Herring would not comment on the federal probe other than to say that he is “awaiting a final decision from the Justice Department.”

“But,” he added, “I have to plan for other contingencies as well, such as the matter being returned back to my office.” Herring would not provide information on the tolling agreement.

Witnesses at issue

The McDonnells’ attorneys argued to the Justice Department last week that key witnesses were problematic, a person close to the case said.

Among other issues, the attorneys have been telling federal prosecutors that there could be weaknesses in the testimony of Mary Shea Sutherland, the former chief of staff to Maureen McDonnell.

E-mails obtained under a freedom of information request show that Sutherland was intimately involved in the planning of an event held at the governor’s mansion in August 2011 that marked the launch of a Star Scientific dietary supplement called Anatabloc.

Prosecutors believe that the luncheon event was one way the couple helped Williams’s company, people with knowledge of the case said.

Attorneys for the McDonnells have argued that they could convince a jury that Sutherland was trying to curry favor with Williams, including by helping to organize the mansion event, according to a person close to the case.

Sutherland corresponded with Star Scientific executives before the company issued a news release touting the event. She also urged the governor’s scheduler to ensure that the governor attended. When the scheduler suggested that McDonnell might be busy, Sutherland wrote back, “The [first lady] isn’t going to be happy about it.”

In that same time frame, Sutherland was given an expensive dress by Williams on a New York City shopping trip during which Williams also bought $15,000 in high-end clothing for the first lady, the people said.

The defense attorneys also point to a draft of a 2011 contract they said shows that Williams and Sutherland were in negotiations for Sutherland to leave her government job and work for Williams through an independent event planning firm.

The employment contract was never executed. Ted Bruns, an attorney for Sutherland, declined to comment. He has previously said Sutherland never worked for Williams and has called the idea that Sutherland attended a Star event without the first lady’s knowledge “curious.”

The event was held at the governor’s 200-year-old official residence, and the first lady served as host. The governor attended as well. It was paid for by the governor’s political action committee.

Asked about the Star Scientific mansion event in March, a spokesman for the governor said all requests for use of the mansion are approved by the governor’s chief of staff. “The decision to have the event was based solely on the benefit to the Commonwealth,” spokesman Jeff Caldwell said in a statement then.

Jerry Brown.

Schools will now be allowed to suspend students for bullying classmates on social networking sites, including Facebook. Assemblywoman Nora Campos (D-San Jose) introduced the legislation to update California’s anti-bullying laws.

“The increase in popularity of social networks has also brought an increase in abuse, and in some instances depression and suicide,” she said in a statement.

There was no organized opposition to her bill, AB 746, which was backed by the California State PTA and the California Teachers Assn.

Brown also signed a bill written after The Times reported on felons working in a state-financed program providing care for the elderly and disabled in their homes. The recipients were allowed to sign waivers accepting felons — often relatives or acquaintances — as their home aides. Existing law also allowed the aides to sign the waivers on the client’s behalf.

The new law, by Assemblyman David G. Valadao (R-Hanford), forbids a caregiver who has a criminal record to represent a recipient in signing such a waiver unless that person is a parent, guardian, spouse or conservator.

“The state of California should not facilitate the abuse of the elderly and disabled by convicted felons,” Valadao said in support of his measure, AB 876.

The governor also signed legislation that forces elected officials to forfeit their office if convicted of falsely claiming they have been awarded military decorations. Assemblyman Paul Cook (R-Yucaipa), a veteran of the Marines, created the measure to plug a loophole in the law.

“When politicians misrepresent themselves and make false claims of military rank and heroism, it does a tremendous disservice not only to our vets but to the public,” Cook said.

His bill, AB 167, comes a year after an appeals court struck down a federal law that made it illegal to lie about receiving military decorations. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said the federal law was an unconstitutional restraint on free speech.

Brown vetoed legislation that would have allowed senior citizens, the blind and the disabled to postpone their property tax payments. A law allowing the postponements was suspended in 2009 by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger because of the state’s budget problems.

“Given the very significant cuts to state and local core public services that are occurring, the state cannot afford the $19.3 million that the Department of Finance estimates this bill would cost” this year, Brown wrote in vetoing ABX1 29 by Assemblyman Bob Blumenfield (D-Woodland Hills).

Story highlights Benjamin Jealous: Rand Paul's attempt to heal rift between blacks and GOP fell short He says if GOP wants to draw black votes, it can start by committing to civil rights One way is criminal justice reform, Jealous says Jealous: Sentencing reform, education would bring down spending. GOP, get on board

Editor’s Note: Benjamin Todd Jealous is president and CEO of the NAACP.

(CNN) —

Earlier this month Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) visited Howard University to take a swing at repairing relations between African Americans and the Republican Party.

As famed sportscaster Harry Kalas would have said, it was largely a swing and a miss.

Paul struck out when he tried to equate today’s Republican Party with the party of Abraham Lincoln, while ignoring much of the 150 years in between. (He even acknowledged his mistakes shortly after). But his willingness to step up to the plate can provide a lesson for a GOP struggling to get on top.

Republicans will not win black votes by paying lip service to party history while attacking social programs and voting rights. But they can make inroads by showing a commitment to civil rights, something Paul managed to do briefly in his remarks.

Paul received applause when he told the Howard crowd, “We should not have drug laws or a court system that disproportionately punishes the black community.” He illustrated using one issue where the GOP can connect with black voters: criminal justice reform.

Benjamin Todd Jealous

Just before the 2012 elections, the NAACP took a nonpartisan survey of black voters in key swing states. We found that 55% of African Americans believe Republicans “don’t care at all about civil rights” while another 32% think the party “just says what minorities want to hear.” But 14% said they would be more likely to vote for a Republican in the future, if they found a candidate who demonstrated a strong commitment to civil rights.

Mass incarceration is a fundamental civil rights issue. African Americans make up 40% of the 2.4 million people in America’s bloated prison system. That includes the vast majority of those in prison for nonviolent drug offenses. If current trends continue, one in three black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during his life.

As Paul demonstrated, mass incarceration is also a fundamental conservative issue. State spending on prisons has tripled over the last 30 years, reaching $70 billion in 2008. Federal prisons are at 139% capacity, often thanks to harsh mandatory minimum sentences. And who pays for all these guards, beds and three square meals a day? Taxpayers.

In fact, some red states have led the way on criminal justice reform. In Georgia, South Carolina and Texas, Republican legislatures have teamed up with progressives to increase options for parole and reduce mandatory minimums. In Texas, the NAACP and progressive activists worked with leaders of the Tea Party to pass a dozen reform measures. Last year, Texas scheduled the first prison closure in state history.

Rand Paul is not the first national Republican leader to speak up, either. Newt Gingrich and Jeb Bush are both members of the conservative think tank Right on Crime. And in 2011, Gingrich joined Grover Norquist and other unlikely allies - including Mike Jiminez, the president of California’s prison guard union – to endorse the NAACP’s report, Misplaced Priorities: Over Incarcerate, Under Educate. The report revealed how the rise in prison spending has caused states to spend less on education.

These alliances should draw the attention of Republican leaders. Many Democrats shy away from talking about criminal justice reform, for fear of being labeled “soft on crime.” According to the NAACP’s election survey, 42% of African American voters believe the Democratic Party is failing them on criminal justice. The GOP has a chance to fill the leadership vacuum and demonstrate their civil rights bona fides.

Paul is poised to lead the conversation on criminal justice reform. At Howard he touted the “Justice Safety Valve Act of 2013,” which he recently introduced with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, the Democratic senator from Vermont. The bill would allow federal judges to bypass federal mandatory minimum sentences if the sentence is too lengthy or if it simply does not fit the crime.

Paul told students that his friends called him “either brave or crazy” for showing up at Howard University, a statement that says more about his friends than the audience at Howard. Nonetheless, Paul and his Republican Party would display true bravery, and political savvy, by taking this opportunity to walk Lincoln’s walk and take on the new Jim Crow.

Moving from “tough on crime” to “smart on crime” would be good for this country. It would also be a smart move for the Republican Party if they ever hope to get on base with black voters.

Some of the inmates are being forced to comply with medication orders; others are to be moved to new cells.

The six tapes, created by guards abiding by a state policy to record all cell extractions, were shown in court in October as part of a lawsuit by inmates’ lawyers seeking a ban on the use of pepper spray against the mentally ill. The tapes were ordered released by U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton, who is holding hearings on the issue in Sacramento.

In one tape shot in July of last year at California State Prison at Corcoran, a screaming, naked prisoner is sprayed five times in 15 minutes before being tackled to the ground by about half a dozen guards and then strapped to a gurney.

His prison psychiatrist testified that the psychotic inmate had lost touch with reality and needed emergency medication.

“When we order involuntary medications, the inmate is told they will receive medications whether they like it or not,” said the psychiatrist, Dr. Ernest Wagner.

Lawyers representing some 30,000 mentally ill prisoners say the tapes show excessive force, the abuse of men who may have little understanding of what is happening to them or why.

“The mentally ill are being punished for their mental illness,” Jeffrey Bornstein, a San Francisco attorney representing inmates, told the judge.

Witnesses for the state, including California’s director of adult prisons, said in court that in all of the taped incidents guards followed proper procedure. It is safer to remove prisoners from their cell at a distance rather than use physical force, they said.

The corrections department filed the videos with the court Thursday and issued a statement calling the use of force “always a last resort for our staff.”

Extracting inmates from their cells is typically done to keep them “from harming themselves or others and to ensure that they are placed in a more appropriate mental health setting,” the statement said.

“What you don’t see on these videos,” it said, “is the hours of discussions that take place between the inmate and clinical staff before a cell extraction is ordered and the video camera starts rolling.”

The agency said that it is in the process of revising rules to limit the amount of pepper spray used at any one time.

The 31-year-old inmate in the footage from Corcoran last July had been suicidal, Wagner testified — refusing to eat food, consuming his feces and hearing voices. Eventually the court ordered the man medicated, and he was brought out of his cell to have the drugs administered.

Without the medication, Wagner told the court, the prisoner “would have died.”

After being removed from his cell, the inmate remained strapped down, under Wagner’s orders.

He was released when a different doctor came on duty and then was moved to an isolation cell, according to medical files read in court. His prison sentence was extended by three months as punishment for refusing orders.

In November of last year, the inmate was admitted to a prison psychiatric hospital, where his condition improved, court documents show. He was then returned to the general prison population and paroled in February, according to courtroom testimony.

Karlton had ordered that the names of prisoners be removed or covered up in the videos, out of concern for their medical privacy. The state also obscured the names of all staff involved in the incidents.

Three of the six tapes were aired in court without editing. The others had only the names of inmates blocked or erased.

http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-01-01-public-housing_N.htm,2009-01-01 00:00:00,['The Associated Press'],Many illegal immigrants live in public housing,"Untold thousands of illegal immigrants live in public housing at a time when hundreds of thousands of citizens and legal residents are stuck waiting years for a spot. Illegal immigrants make up a tiny portion of the 7.1 million people in federal housing, according to government statistics. But authorities may be unaware of thousands more, and critics say no illegal immigrant should get housing benefits. The issue made headlines in November with news that Zeituni Onyango, an aunt of President-elect Barack Obama, was living in Boston public housing while in the country illegally. The federal government, which funds the lion's share of the nation's public housing, requires only that illegal immigrants share a home with at least one family member who is in the country legally and pay their share of the rent. While there are no hard numbers on illegal immigrants in public housing, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reports that 29,570 people — 0.4% of all those in federally funded housing — are ""ineligible noncitizens."" Some may be on temporary visas, such as highly educated workers or college students, but many are believed to be illegal immigrants. Frank Bean, director of the University of California, Irvine's Center for Research on Immigration, Population and Public Policy, estimates at least half of ineligible noncitizens — or about 15,000 — are illegal immigrants with U.S.-born children. Anyone born on U.S. soil is automatically a citizen, making their families eligible for federal housing. The HUD tally does not offer a full picture of how many illegal immigrants are in public housing. It doesn't include housing funded by state and local governments, where eligibility requirements vary. Massachusetts, where Obama's aunt occupied one of about 50,000 state-funded units, doesn't ask immigration status under a 1977 federal consent decree in a class-action lawsuit that prohibits the state from denying the benefit to illegal immigrants. Other illegal immigrants may live in public housing without notifying authorities. ""It seems that the larger concern would be those who we don't know about that may be in the U.S. illegally and living in federal housing, yet never risk presenting themselves to HUD,"" said Jonathan Graffeo, a spokesman for Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala. Some prospective tenants and advocates of immigration restrictions are angry about U.S. citizens waiting for housing aid that some number of illegal immigrants are enjoying. New York City has about 260,000 people in line for housing aid. Chicago recently opened its waiting list for the first time in about 10 years and collected 259,000 names in four weeks for 40,000 slots. ""As long as that waiting list includes American citizens or legal immigrants, there's no reason an illegal alien should occupy any of that housing,"" said Rosemary Jenks, director of government relations for NumbersUSA, a group that supports curbs on immigration. In San Diego, applicants are told they can expect to wait five to seven years. ""I don't think we should take a second seat to anyone,"" said Daryl Ford, who applied for housing aid last year and lives in a San Diego homeless shelter. ""We send money to everyone else in the world but we're struggling here."" Some say the costs of illegal immigration in public housing are overstated. Tanya Broder, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, said illegal immigrants are reluctant to seek government benefits because they keep low profiles. Even some legal immigrants shun public housing, fearing reprisals against them or their families, she said. Illegal immigrants get free public education through high school and emergency medical care, but are denied many other services, like food stamps and broad Medicaid coverage. Elliotte Skinner, 48, applied for public housing in San Diego in 2000 and lives in a cramped studio with a shared shower. He says focusing on illegal immigrants misses the point. ""There's too much blame on illegals for the country's problems,"" he said. ""Their numbers are so small (in federally funded housing) they don't even make a difference. The real problem is we don't have enough affordable housing."" Elena Salmon, 45, lives at a San Diego home where about 30 women share four bathrooms while she waits for public housing, but she said it would be inhumane to deny housing to illegal immigrants. ""That's not what America is about,"" she said. ""Why should we kick them out, even if they are taking up some space?"" HUD declined to break down the number of ineligible noncitizens by city or state. The New York City Housing Authority reports 2,471 families with at least one ineligible noncitizen, or 0.9% of the 289,000 households on vouchers or in housing developments. The San Diego Housing Commission reports 658 of the 37,120 people on federal housing vouchers are ineligible noncitizens, or 1.8%. The San Francisco Housing Authority has 148 ineligible noncitizens among its 28,611 people in federal housing, or 0.5%. Housing agencies in Miami-Dade County and Chicago each reported serving less than 50 ineligible noncitizens. The Boston Housing Authority reports 288 of its 45,100 families on federal housing assistance are ineligible noncitizens, or 0.6%. Onyango, the half-sister of Obama's late father, applied for public housing in 2002 while she was in the country legally seeking asylum from her native Kenya, said Lydia Agro, spokeswoman for the Boston Housing Authority, which has a waiting list of nearly 20,000 people. Onyango moved into federally funded housing in 2003 and stayed there after 2004, when, The Associated Press learned, an immigration judge denied her asylum application and ordered her to leave the country. Onyango transferred to an apartment funded only by the state, which cannot ask about immigration status under the court order. In November, her attorney said she was staying with relatives in Cleveland and would fight her deportation order. Copyright 2009 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

http://news.yahoo.com/promises-promises-social-security-pledge-173052710.html,,[],"PROMISES, PROMISES: Social Security pledge at risk","The issue:

As the population gets older, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are eating up more and more of the federal budget, squeezing the ability of the government to pay for other programs. Today, the three massive benefit programs account for 44 percent of federal spending. Left unchanged, they will account for more than 60 percent in 25 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Unless Congress acts, the trust fund that supports Social Security is projected to run out of money in 2033. At that point, the retirement and disability program would collect only enough in payroll taxes to pay about 75 percent of benefits.

Medicare's hospital insurance fund is in worse shape. It is projected to run out of money in 2024. At that point, it would only be able to pay 87 percent of costs, according to projections by the trustees who oversee Medicare and Social Security.

___

The campaign promise:

Obama rarely mentioned Social Security during his 2012 re-election campaign. Four years earlier, he was more forthcoming.

In a 2008 speech to AARP: ""John McCain's campaign has suggested that the best answer for the growing pressures on Social Security might be to cut cost-of-living adjustments or raise the retirement age. Let me be clear: I will not do either.""

On Medicare, Obama told the Democratic convention on Sept. 6, 2012: ""Yes, we will reform and strengthen Medicare for the long haul, but we'll do it by reducing the cost of health care, not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more.""

___

The prospects:

Obama has already offered to break part of his 2008 pledge on Social Security. Twice in negotiations with GOP leaders, he agreed to adopt a new measure of inflation that would result in smaller cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, for Social Security recipients. Both deals fell apart. But now Obama has put forward the idea in his own proposed federal budget. If adopted, it would gradually trim benefit increases in Social Security, Medicare and other programs while raising taxes.

Story continues

His proposed changes, once phased in, would mean a cut in Social Security benefits of nearly $1,000 a year for an average 85-year-old, $560 for a 75-year-old and $136 for a 65-year-old.

Obama and Republican leaders in Congress have held off-and-on talks about possible changes to entitlement programs since 2011, as part of their efforts to reduce government borrowing. But a deal remains elusive. Republicans insist any agreement must include deep spending cuts, while Obama says any deal must include more tax revenue. And many Democrats in Congress are protective of the entitlement programs that Obama now is willing to touch.

This year, House Republicans passed a budget that would eventually turn Medicare into a voucher-like program for people younger than 55. But Obama says he is dead-set against the plan, which is championed by Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Ryan was the Republican candidate for vice president.

Obama's approach to Medicare savings, known during the campaign, is different. He'd cut payments to drug companies, hospitals and other service providers. He's also proposing to have a growing share of seniors pay higher premiums over time, based on their incomes. As well, richer people will pay a higher Medicare payroll tax.

On Medicaid, though, the government has offered to foot more than 90 percent of the bill for states that expand the program to bring in millions of uninsured low-income adults. States worry Washington might shift costs back to them later.

For years, budget hawks have insisted that huge entitlements must be on the table for meaningful fiscal discipline to be achieved in Washington. Whether the effort to rein in their spending succeeds or fails, it's clear they're on the table now.

More than 3 million people were living in the United States after crossing the border illegally or overstaying their visas.

A new law signed by President Ronald Reagan gave legal status and a path to citizenship to most of those unauthorized residents — helping many secure a slice of the American dream but also giving fuel to critics who sought to turn “amnesty” into a pejorative.

Less than 30 years later, the number of immigrants living in the country illegally is thought to have nearly quadrupled, and the freighted baggage of amnesty looms over new efforts to reform the nation’s immigration laws.

With four times as many people potentially eligible, today’s mass legalization would occur on a much larger scale. The specifics of the current proposal are different, the global economy is different, and the immigrants themselves are different, hailing from South Korea as well as Mexico and fanning out from traditional enclaves like Los Angeles to populate small towns across America.

Still, the reams of post-1986 studies offer an indication of what might happen if millions of immigrants receive legal status. And there is broad agreement on one thing: The flow of illegal immigration must somehow be stanched, so there is never a need for an amnesty again. In that respect, 1986 was an utter failure.

“The goal’s got to be that people come with visas, not with smugglers, that they come for jobs that we need people to come fill,” said Angela Maria Kelley, an immigration policy expert with the pro-reform Center for American Progress.

The 855-page Senate bill, currently in committee, contains a path to citizenship taking at least 13 years, with provisional status to be granted almost immediately to those who were in the country before 2012. Proponents avoid calling it amnesty, even as they tout the moral imperative of bringing 11 million people out of the shadows. Opponents wield the word as a weapon, decrying amnesty as a free pass to lawbreakers that should not have been doled out in 1986, nor again in 2013.

Both camps trot out economic projections. Higher immigrant wages will pad tax coffers and boost the domestic product by billions of dollars, one argument goes. Opponents predict a drain on public funds as newly legalized immigrants apply for government benefits, and harm to American workers as immigrants get better jobs.

“After legalization, they’ll be eligible for virtually every job in the country,” said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the anti-legalization Federation for American Immigration Reform. “People whose jobs are not threatened right now will find themselves in competition with these workers.”

Juan Manuel Niebla arrived in Los Angeles in 1976 with a third-grade education and a dollar in his pocket. He found a job at a factory, where his salary was many times the $5 a day he made as a construction worker in Mexico. He raised a family, learned English and bought a house, all while living in the country illegally.

For Niebla, the 1986 amnesty meant freedom from fear. He no longer had to worry about being deported if he was pulled over while driving to work. He was finally able to visit his parents in Mexico.

Initially, he stayed at the same job, working his way up from machine operator to supervisor. Then, his boss ordered him to accept a pay cut or be laid off. Niebla chose the latter, knowing that as a U.S. citizen, he could tide himself over with unemployment benefits. He immediately found work as a landscaper with the city of Los Angeles, where he now makes $24 an hour and looks forward to a pension when he retires.

“This country is for everybody, especially if they’re hardworking, honest people,” said Niebla, 63, of Highland Park. “I have everything — good health, a good job.”

James P. Smith, a labor market expert at Rand Corp., believes that legalizing the 11 million unauthorized immigrants — 1 in 4 of whom live in California — is the right thing to do.

But unless the new legislation succeeds in stopping illegal immigration through a combination of more work visas, border security and workplace enforcement, the cycle may repeat. A new generation of illegal border crossers and over-stayers may find inspiration in stories like Niebla’s.

“The very fact that it was successful in that way was a signal that this will happen again, that this is the American solution to the immigration problem, legalizing those who are here and dealing with it again 15, 20 years in the future,” Smith said of the 1986 amnesty.

Many studies have found that wages increased for amnesty recipients as a group — as much as 15% in the first five years, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. If immigrants earn more, they will spend more and pay more taxes, potentially creating more jobs.

“It’s the freedom to say, ‘I can do this, and I’m free to do that,’” said Antonia Hernandez, who was head of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund at the time. “By that same token, it was the employers knowing that was the case and treating employees differently.”

According to the Center for American Progress, the lengthy path to citizenship outlined by the Senate bill could add 121,000 jobs per year and inject $832 billion into the economy over the next decade. Legalized immigrants would pay billions more in local, state and federal taxes on top of what they already pay, according to the center’s estimates.

Others counter that newly legalized immigrants could be a huge drain on Social Security, Medicare, food stamps and other government programs. A study last week by the conservative Heritage Foundation showed that a mass legalization could cost the government $6 trillion over the immigrants’ lifetimes. It came under fire from both Republicans and Democrats, and a co-author quit after his earlier assertions questioning immigrants’ intelligence surfaced.

Still, other research suggests that immigrants as a group may use more government services than they pay in taxes, since they are more likely to be low-income and have more children in public schools than native-born families.

Under the Senate proposal, immigrants would stay in provisional status for at least 10 years, remaining ineligible for most federal benefits, including subsidized health insurance, during that time.

With improved job prospects, legalized immigrants may be less likely to commit crimes. At the same time, a Cornell University study suggests that some immigrants who were ineligible for the 1986 amnesty resorted to crimes like burglary because they were increasingly shut out of the labor market.

The better immigrants do, the more likely they are to take jobs that U.S. workers would want. But some researchers believe the post-1986 job gains were confined to the relatively small number of amnesty recipients who were well-educated and spoke good English, and that few U.S. workers want to be farmworkers, house cleaners or busboys.

“I don’t think this legalization is going to be a switch flipper and dramatically grow the size of the economy or improve things for the workers or the American economy in general really quickly,” said Laura Hill, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. “Granting legal status isn’t going to suddenly make for a new group of competitors in the labor force. They’re already here, and they’re already maximizing their earning potential in terms of their skill sets.”

Niebla became a U.S. citizen in 1996 and has voted in just about every election since then, including a recent Los Angeles municipal contest that drew a dismal 21% turnout.

Ana Etelvina Villalobos never misses an election, either. She came to Los Angeles in the early 1980s to escape the civil war in her native El Salvador, raising her daughters as a single mother. When she got her papers, she was working as a cook on a food truck. She later became a housekeeper for Hollywood celebrities and earned a college degree in accounting.

“Now, I’m at liberty to go everywhere without the fear you have when you don’t have papers,” said Villalobos, 56. “I’m not afraid to fight for my rights, to travel.”

Advertisement

Niebla and Villalobos may be more the exception than the rule. By 2010, about 40% of amnesty recipients, or 1.1 million people, had become U.S. citizens, according to a federal study. The legalized immigrants faced the same obstacles as other green card holders who delay citizenship: a steep application fee, lack of English, and not enough time or knowledge to navigate the process.

In November, Latinos and Asian Americans put immigration reform on the national agenda by overwhelmingly supporting President Obama. Despite the low naturalization rates, some researchers believe the 1986 amnesty added enough voters to be a major factor in that result, 26 years later. The future political effect of a much larger cohort is unknown.

“All we know is that this is going to alter society in innumerable ways,” said Muzaffar Chishti of the Migration Policy Institute, who is an expert on the 1986 law. “If 11.2 million new people enter the body politic, that has to shake it. What it will do to political parties, we don’t know. What it will do to local elections, we don’t know.”

Steve Stockman says that he not only ""debunked"" the claim that poor families could go hungry if Congress cuts billions in funding for food stamps, but that the program could use an additional 12% cut.

Being poor is easy, especially when you’re not. Or at least that seems to be the lesson from a Republican House aide’s experiment with the Food Stamp Challenge.

On Tuesday, Donny Ferguson—the communications director and agriculture policy adviser for Texas Rep. Steve Stockman—”debunked” the claim that poor families would go hungry if Congress cut billions in funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), according to a statement by Stockman’s office. In order to prove his point, Ferguson spent a week living off a food budget of only $31.50, roughly a quarter of the $133.42 which the average food stamp recipient receives in a month.

“I wanted to personally experience the effects of the proposed cuts to food stamps,” said Ferguson in the statement. “I didn’t plan ahead or buy strategically, I just saw the publicity stunt and made a snap decision to drive down the street and try it myself. I put my money where my mouth is, and the proposed food stamp cuts are still quite filling.”

Ferguson’s self-imposed $31.50 food budget emulated a similar challenge undertaken by 26 House Democrats last week. But those lawmakers took on the challenge as a way of protesting the $20.5 billion in cuts to SNAP benefits currently being debated in the House.

“Feeding a family on SNAP is difficult as it is, and it would become virtually impossible if these cuts are implemented,” said Rep. Doris Matsui, D-Calif., in a statement. “That is why I am taking the SNAP Challenge to promote awareness for hunger and highlight the importance of this critical program.”

But according to Ferguson, there’s plenty of room for cuts.

“Not only did I buy a week’s worth of food on what Democrats claim is too little, I have money left over,” he said. “Based on my personal experience with SNAP benefit limits we have room to cut about 12% more.”

New York City Coalition Against Hunger executive director Joel Berg, who has undergone similar challenges twice, called Ferguson’s claims “preposterous.”

“If he’d like to swap lives with a food stamp recipient for a year, I can find 47 million people who would like to take him up on that offer,” he said. The problem is that living on a SNAP-level budget does not provide any sense of what it’s truly like to rely on the program.

“The longer you do this, the harder it is to do, the harder it is to make time to shop, and the further you go into debt,” said Berg. SNAP benefits are allotted monthly, and the average recipient usually runs low on funds after the second week.

In part, that’s because the average recipient isn’t young, healthy, single and employed. About 47% of all households receiving SNAP benefits include children, according to the USDA [PDF]. Additionally, 16.5% of households on food stamps include elderly individuals, and 20% of households include disabled people. Ferguson’s press release gives no indication that he’s feeding anyone other than himself.

“If he had kids, would he be proud feeding his family with what he bought? I suspect not,” said Berg, who noted that Ferguson’s shopping list included no fresh fruit or vegetables. “He seems to be promoting a pretty unhealthy diet, a strong recipe for heart disease and diabetes.”

Ferguson posted online a photo of his shopping receipts along with a spreadsheet of a meal-by-meal breakdown of what he ate during the week. Included in his shopping list were two liters of root beer, a large box of popsicles, eight cups of applesauce and two cans of refried beans.

“I could have bought cheaper vegetables instead of prepared red beans and rice, but I like red beans and rice,” said Ferguson in his statement. “Folks aren’t buying fast food instead of vegetables because of benefit limits, they’re buying fast food because fast food tastes great and vegetables taste like vegetables.”"

A law is advancing through the Wisconsin state legislature that would double the job-seeking requirements for people collecting unemployment and which would allow the government to peer into their bank accounts and freeze them if they believe the account holder has received overpayments in their benefits. According to the Wisconsin State Journal, the co-authors of the bill, which was introduced in the state Assembly and Senate on Friday, insist that the changes would be for workers’ own good. “This is to protect the workers and lessen the burden on employers who are paying all the bills,” said state Rep. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown). ------- Democratic state Rep. Christine Sinicki (Milwaukee) said that the law is another salvo by Republicans against working people and the middle class. She also worried that Republicans would make the bill even more intrusive and draconian during the legislative mark-up process.

This is yet another outrageous assault on working people and the unemployed.

I was working last week. I got my layoff/separation notice Friday. I am unemployed Monday. It's the 6th time I have been laid off in 20 years and the 4 time since I bought my home and the 3rd time since I got married.

Republicans have elevated blaming the victims of capitalism to a high art. And the Unemployed are VICTIMS of GOP economic policies.

It would force job applicants to apply for twice as many jobs to remain eligible for benefits. Currently employment seekers must apply for two jobs per week to keep unemployment benefits flowing. The new law raises that number to four.

There are no jobs. Republicans worked to kill jobs the Obama administration had set up - killed rail projects as a 2-fer: no rail for efficient transport (aids big oil and big auto and big credit) and killed jobs.

Wall Street and the 1% are off-shoring TRILLIONS of dollars, APPLE wants laws changed so it can bring billions of untaxed dollars into the US and republicans want to spy on back accounts of the POOR?

It's wholly mean-spirited, part of the GOP agenda to be as mean and awful to the poor as possible.

It is unacceptable."

USA TODAY

Dr. King%27s ringing%2C rhythmic speech brought tears to my eyes.

The speech reinforced the themes that drove Dr. King%27s work.

Dr. King%27s vivid language forced white Americans to see the issue in both moral and personal terms.

Most of us who are old enough remember exactly where we were on Aug. 28, 1963. I watched the March on Washington unfold on national television from a reclining chair in the den of my house in Hot Springs, Ark. Dr. King's ringing, rhythmic speech brought tears to my eyes, and I remember thinking that, when it was over, my country would never be the same.

By late August, the summer of 1963 had already been a memorable one for me; I'd turned 17, and I'd shaken hands with President Kennedy during a Boys Nation event at the White House.

Personal commitment

But the march and the speech had an even more profound impact on me and millions of others all across the country who felt a deeper, more personal commitment to racial equality and justice than they ever had before.

The speech reinforced the themes that drove Dr. King's work: that we are bound together in an inescapable web of ""mutuality,"" and, whether we like it or not, when basic human rights and economic security are denied to some of us, we all suffer; that true equality and justice can best be achieved through determined, non-violent action, as Gandhi demonstrated; and that building a world of shared opportunities and responsibilities requires us to reconcile with our adversaries to create an inclusive community.

'Jobs and Freedom'

The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom — its full name — was a demand for both racial equality and economic justice. ""We're in this together,"" rather than ""You're on your own,"" meant that all Americans willing to work hard should have a chance to build a decent life together in what Georgia Rep. John Lewis — who as a young man marched alongside Dr. King that day — describes in his wonderful memoir as ""the beloved community.""

John Lewis must have felt one step closer to his beloved community when he and other Freedom Riders were welcomed back to Montgomery, Ala., this spring, where 52 years ago they had been abused and beaten while attempting to desegregate the interstate bus system.

In 1961, the Montgomery police refused to protect the Freedom Riders from the mob. In 2013, Police Chief Kevin Murphy not only apologized on behalf of his predecessors, he presented John with a medal from his own uniform.

Seeing anew

Dr. King's vivid language — the longing to see ""the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners sit down together at the table of brotherhood,"" to see his four children judged ""not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character"" — forced white Americans to see the issue in both moral and deeply personal terms.

Like Lincoln's second inaugural address, the ""I Have a Dream"" speech lives on as a hymn to the ""better angels of our nature,"" its words still inspiring and spoken by children whose parents were not even born then.

God willing, their grandchildren will also be inspired and moved to become better and bigger because of what was said and done on that distant summer day.

Bill Clinton was the 42nd president of the United States.

From The Nation:



“I don’t want these individuals to die,” Obama told reporters on April 30, adding that “the Pentagon is trying to manage the situation as best as they can.” He also recommitted to closing Guantánamo, calling on Congress to “step up and help.” It’s true that lawmakers on both sides have fought hard to make transfers impossible. But Obama’s words ignored how his own policies set the stage for the crisis. “He has said the right thing before,” Guantánamo lawyer Pardiss Kebriaei of the Center for Constitutional Rights told The Nation. “It’s time now for action.” The CCR is calling on Obama to end his “self-imposed moratorium” on releasing Yemenis and resume prisoner transfers. It has also called for Obama to appoint a senior official to “shepherd the process of closure.” As the hunger strike approaches its hundredth day on May 17, more than 100 of Guantánamo’s 166 prisoners are refusing food. The president must start living up to his rhetoric about closing the prison, the CCR warns, or “the men who are on hunger strike will die, and he will be ultimately responsible for their deaths.”

Some progress has been made. The detainee population is down to 166 from a peak of nearly 800. Of the prisoners who remain, 46 are deemed too dangerous to let go but impossible to prosecute, even under the looser standards of military commissions, for lack of evidence or because evidence is compromised by torture. If released or repatriated, there's a high probability they'd resume jihad. What to do with this group — prisoners of war in a war without end — is a question with no satisfactory answer. They have to be held. But both Obama and Congress could do more to winnow down the rest, including 86 prisoners cleared for transfer three years ago who remain incarcerated. If Obama is still serious about closing Guantanamo, there are obvious steps he can take, many without congressional assent.

More analysis below the fold."

“[That was] a really good speech by President Obama, but what Mexico was he talking about?” said Jose Carlos Cruz, 24, a graduate student in international relations. “Unfortunately in our country, the situation is terrible: There’s poverty, unemployment, and even worse, the future is anything but promising.

“How nice that he came to give inspiring speeches, but what’s happening in Mexico is far from what he talked about today,” Cruz said.

Alberto Rios Lara, 26, who is studying to be an economist, said: “Obama is a great speaker — it’s really impossible not to feel excited. However, the reality is different in Mexico. We need more action and fewer speeches.”

In the speech, delivered at National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, Obama described Mexico as a nation that is “creating new prosperity,” has “lifted millions from poverty” and has institutions that are “more accountable to you.”

Many of his rosy assertions about Mexico weren’t incorrect. The media — in Mexico City, at least — are indeed feistier than in decades previous, when they were often subservient to government interests. Political parties do, in fact, “compete vigorously” and “transfer power peacefully.” And the country has emerged, as Obama noted, as an important manufacturer of automobiles, appliances and other goods, helping many Mexicans enjoy new middle-class lifestyles.

But the story is considerably more complicated. This week, the nonprofit Freedom House, in its annual report on the state of journalism globally, lumped Mexico in the category of nations where the press is “not free,” due to persistent threats and violence directed against reporters and news organizations.

Last year’s election of President Enrique Peña Nieto was marred by allegations of vote-buying by his Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. And the World Bank notes that 46% of Mexicans continue to live in poverty.

In the tightly crafted, upbeat speech, which made references to the late Mexican writer Octavio Paz and 19th century Mexican hero Benito Juarez, Obama largely steered clear of the negative, making only a passing reference to the pervasive and often gruesome violence that continues to plague much of the country. Many of the attendees were high-school students, whom Obama described as “part of something new — a nation remaking itself.”

Rosa Castro, a 43-year-old college professor, said that the upbeat tone sounded curiously similar to the messaging of the new government, which has been seeking to downplay the issue of violence and drug cartels in favor of a narrative of modernization, reform and economic growth.

“My question is: Who wrote Obama’s speech — Enrique Peña Nieto’s team?” Castro asked. “Obama is fantastic, but I believe that today, he was talking about another country, not ours.”

Others were moved by Obama’s vision of a Mexico leaving behind its old ways and heading toward a brighter future. There was also a palpable sense of fascination with, and admiration for, the man himself: Obama, according to one recent poll, enjoys a 54% approval rating among Mexicans.

“It was incredible to see Obama; he really impressed me,” said student Maria Velazco, 18. “His way of speaking, of walking, of smiling. ... And I think that, like he said, a change is possible. A new Mexico is possible.”

Over time the program, just one piece of the bill, would open up many new opportunities for foreigners to settle in the United States based on their skills, a shift from the focus on family ties that is the main foundation of the current immigration system.

But the bill will also include a host of measures to eliminate, over 10 years, a backlog of 4.7 million immigrants who have applied to come here legally and have been languishing in the system, waiting for permanent resident visas known as green cards. As a result, during the next decade, millions of immigrants who have been waiting patiently for legal documents will be united with their family members here.

The bill, an intricate combination of many interlocking parts, also provides a path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally. Under the plan, those immigrants would wait at least 13 years before they could apply to become citizens."

He is on Twitter.

The First Amendment protects political speech and the use of resources (printing presses, the Internet, money) to facilitate that speech. Yet when someone wants to engage in the most obvious kind of political speech — supporting election campaigns — the government restricts this important constitutional right. These limits on political donations aren’t supported by any compelling governmental interest.

In a free society, people should be able to give whatever they want to whomever they choose, including candidates for public office.

In the seminal 1976 case of Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court held that such limits are justified when tied to preventing quid pro quo corruption or the appearance thereof. But the court also decided that restrictions on campaign spending put a heavier burden on political expression, one which the government couldn’t justify. One of the plaintiffs’ arguments in McCutcheon v. Federal Elections Commission is that contribution limits are simultaneously a limit on expenditures — a position that the Cato Institute supports in our amicus brief.

We argue that Buckley’s distinction between contributions and expenditures is problematic. Not only does it allow infringements on the freedom of speech, but it has led to an unbalanced and unworkable campaign finance system.

Various justices over the years have engaged this point. Justice Clarence Thomas in particular has assailed the distinction, pointing out that both contributions and expenditures implicate First Amendment values because they both support political debate. Moreover, candidates spend an inordinate amount of time fundraising instead of legislating because they face an unlimited demand for campaign funds but a tapered supply. At the same time, money has been pushed away from politically accountable parties and candidates and toward unelected advocacy groups, leading to a warping in political competition.

In a free society, people should be able to give whatever they want to whomever they choose, including candidates for public office. The Supreme Court should strike down contribution limits and give those who contribute money to candidates and parties as much freedom as those who spend money independently to promote campaigns and causes."

A law is advancing through the Wisconsin state legislature that would double the job-seeking requirements for people collecting unemployment and which would allow the government to peer into their bank accounts and freeze them if they believe the account holder has received overpayments in their benefits. According to the Wisconsin State Journal, the co-authors of the bill, which was introduced in the state Assembly and Senate on Friday, insist that the changes would be for workers’ own good. “This is to protect the workers and lessen the burden on employers who are paying all the bills,” said state Rep. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown). ------- Democratic state Rep. Christine Sinicki (Milwaukee) said that the law is another salvo by Republicans against working people and the middle class. She also worried that Republicans would make the bill even more intrusive and draconian during the legislative mark-up process.

This is yet another outrageous assault on working people and the unemployed.

I was working last week. I got my layoff/separation notice Friday. I am unemployed Monday. It's the 6th time I have been laid off in 20 years and the 4 time since I bought my home and the 3rd time since I got married.

Republicans have elevated blaming the victims of capitalism to a high art. And the Unemployed are VICTIMS of GOP economic policies.

It would force job applicants to apply for twice as many jobs to remain eligible for benefits. Currently employment seekers must apply for two jobs per week to keep unemployment benefits flowing. The new law raises that number to four.

There are no jobs. Republicans worked to kill jobs the Obama administration had set up - killed rail projects as a 2-fer: no rail for efficient transport (aids big oil and big auto and big credit) and killed jobs.

Wall Street and the 1% are off-shoring TRILLIONS of dollars, APPLE wants laws changed so it can bring billions of untaxed dollars into the US and republicans want to spy on back accounts of the POOR?

It's wholly mean-spirited, part of the GOP agenda to be as mean and awful to the poor as possible.

It is unacceptable."
http://news.yahoo.com/advocates-criticize-senate-immigration-bill-171005921.html,,[],Advocates criticize Senate immigration bill,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A sweeping immigration bill in the Senate ran into criticism Tuesday from advocates who complained it puts up undue barriers to citizenship for millions here illegally.

Officials from several immigrant rights' groups and the Catholic church held a conference call to highlight their concerns about the bill, including a cutoff date that excludes people who arrived here after 2011, and provisions disqualifying anyone with a felony conviction or more than two misdemeanors. President Barack Obama praised the Senate bill generally, though he said he would prefer to see some changes.

Immigrants would also have to pay $2,000 in fines and hundreds more in fees along the bill's 13-year path to citizenship, and meet income and employment requirements designed to ensure they have resources above 125 percent of the federal poverty line and won't need to draw on public welfare programs.

Advocates said the policies taken together could exclude hundreds of thousands or even a million or more of the 11 million immigrants here illegally. The Senate Judiciary Committee is to begin voting on the legislation next week.

""If you're going to leave several hundred thousand behind and leave them in the shadows you're not solving the problem,"" said Kevin Appleby, director of migration and refugee policy for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.

""We're very concerned that what the bill does is it punishes people for being poor,"" Appleby said.

Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, said that after reading the 844-page bill, advocates have concluded it needs ""major improvements.""

Advocates are also concerned that the bill requires certain goals on border security to be met before anyone can get a green card qualifying them for legal permanent residence and ultimately citizenship, and some say that the path to citizenship takes too long.

Despite their concerns, advocates said they continued to support the overall goals of the bill and promised to fight for its passage even as they try to make it better. And it's not clear that they have much hope of getting a more favorable agreement.

Story continues

The bill written by four Republican and four Democratic senators is a delicately crafted compromise meant to balance liberal with conservative goals, and the authors have promised to stick together to oppose any amendments that significantly alter the legislation. And the legislation already is seen as too permissive by many in the conservative-controlled House, which also will have its say.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who helped write the bill, told radio host Mike Gallagher on Tuesday: ""The bill that's in place right now probably can't pass the House. It will have to be adjusted.""

Several of the bill's authors have said the American public only is willing to accept citizenship, still derided by some as amnesty, if it comes with tough conditions. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., defended the bill's approach.

""Becoming a United States citizen should not be easy, it's never been easy for anyone who came here from another country,"" McCain said Tuesday at a forum at the University of Southern California Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy. Republicans such as Rubio have indicated they won't be able to support the bill if border security and enforcement provisions are weakened.

Obama, who's embraced immigration legislation as a top second-term priority, also praised the Senate bill Tuesday even though it is stricter in some areas than his own approach on immigration. For example, Obama has not supported making the citizenship pathway contingent on border security.

""The bill that they produced is not the bill that I would have written, there are elements of it that I would change, but I do think that it meets the basic criteria that I laid out from the start,"" Obama said at a news conference Tuesday. Those criteria are more effective border security, cracking down on employers who would hire immigrants here illegally, enacting improvements to the legal immigration system, and creating a pathway to citizenship, Obama said.

Obama said he was open to different solutions that might be proposed by the House, but only if his basic criteria still are met.

""And if they meet those criteria but they're slightly different than the Senate bill, then I think that we should be able to come up with an appropriate compromise,"" Obama said. ""If it doesn't meet those criteria, then I will not support such a bill. So we'll have to wait and see.""

Florida%27s lieutenant governor did ads for non-profit now under scrutiny

Federal investigators say only 2%25 of proceeds from non-profit went to charity



Nearly 60 people in 6 states arrested in connection with gambling investigation

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Wednesday's resignation of Florida's lieutenant governor and the arrests of almost five dozen people in six states shows the need for a crackdown on Internet cafes in Florida, a prominent state senator said.

Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll, 53, submitted her resignation letter Tuesday afternoon amid a state and federal investigation into a chain of Internet cafes she once represented called Allied Veterans of the World, a charity based in St. Augustine, Fla.

Carroll, a Navy veteran who served in the Gulf War, appeared in a TV ad in 2011 promoting the organization's charitable work on behalf of veterans and their families, and her public-relations firm once represented Allied Veterans. Federal agents arrested the owner of an Oklahoma software company and his wife Tuesday, accusing them of supplying illegal gambling software to Allied Veterans, and law-enforcement agencies in Florida and five other states arrested nearly 60 people in connection with the investigation.

""You can see people are having problems,"" said Sen. John Thrasher, a Republican from St. Augustine, adding that law enforcement has told him the Allied Veterans investigation has led to the confiscation of $50 million. ""I think this is a system that they need to justify.""

Last month, Thrasher pitched a bill that would place a moratorium on Internet cafes, saying they harbored illegal gambling. Carroll's resignation and the investigation of Allied Veterans of The World proves changes must be made, he said.

Thrasher pitched a similar idea for a moratorium on the cafes last year, but the bill did not pass.

The Coalition of Florida's Internet Cafes, an informal trade group, said the promotions they offer have been legal in the state since 1971 and are not gambling, according to their website. They say the games promote the sale of telephone minutes and Internet time.

To play games at one of the Internet cafes, a customer gets a prepaid card and then goes to a computer to play ""sweepstakes."" The games, with spinning wheels similar to slot machines, have names such as ""Captain Cash,"" ""Lucky Shamrocks"" and ""Money Bunny,"" according to the Internal Revenue Service.

Winners go back to a cashier with their cards and cash out.

According to an IRS affidavit filed in federal court, Allied Veterans evolved from a charitable organization in 1979 that ran bingo games and had bake sales for veterans to a group suspected of operating more than 40 illegal for-profit gambling locations around Florida. The veterans' charity was a fraud, according to the IRS.

The federal investigation alleges that Allied Veterans of the World, operating as a non-profit corporation since 2007, misled the public about the amount of money it donated to charity. The company claimed to donate ""anywhere from 70% to all of the net proceeds or profits from its gambling operation.""

From 2007 to early 2012, investigators say they found evidence of more than $6 million in what appear to be charitable donations, about 2% of net proceeds of $290 million.

Carroll's resignation brought a wave of reactions around the state Capitol.

""Lt. Gov. Carroll has been a great leader for our party and our state. She was a terrific advocate for Florida's military and economic development efforts,"" Lenny Curry, chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, said in a statement. ""Her resignation is disappointing, but she made the right decision to protect both her family and the work she has done to move our state forward over the last few years.""

While one major category of claimants — those who said their loan applications had been unfairly denied — remained eligible for payments of up to $50,000 without any documentation, others were required to produce written evidence that they had complained of bias at the time. The Hispanic plaintiffs were indignant.

Adam P. Feinberg, who represents some of them, said: “Once the government puts a program in place for one racial group, even if it decides it is too generous, it cannot adopt a different set of restrictions for another racial group. It’s outrageous.”

The claims process opened in late September, six weeks before the election. In the weeks before the March 25 deadline, facing far fewer claimants than expected, the Agriculture Department instructed processors to call about 16,000 people to remind them that time was running out, despite internal disquiet that the government was almost recruiting claims against itself. The deadline was then extended to May 1.

So far, about 1,900 Hispanics and 24,000 women have sought compensation, many in states where middlemen have built a cottage industry, promising to help win payouts for a fee.

Last October, a court-appointed ombudsman wrote that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people had given money to individuals and organizations in the belief that they were reserving the right to file a claim under the second settlement for black farmers, only to learn later that their names had never been forwarded to the authorities. People familiar with that statement said it was directed in part at Thomas Burrell, a charismatic orator and the head of the Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association, based in Memphis.

Mr. Burrell has traveled the South for years, exhorting black audiences in auditoriums and church halls to file discrimination complaints with his organization’s help, in exchange for a $100 annual membership fee.

In an interview last month, Mr. Burrell said he had dedicated his life to helping black farmers after biased federal loan officers deprived him of his land and ruined his credit. He said his organization had misled no one, and had forwarded the names of all those eligible and willing to file claims."

The landmark civil rights protest on Aug. 28, 1963, drew more than 200,000 people to the District and is remembered most for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech.

William P. Jones is a history professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and the author of “The March on Washington: Jobs, Freedom, and the Forgotten History of Civil Rights.” On Aug. 28, 1963, the March on Washington, featuring Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech, became the touchstone of the American civil rights movement. But our focus on one man and one speech has obscured some of the history and meaning of the event. As we mark this milestone, let’s take a closer look at popular misconceptions about what brought hundreds of thousands of people to Washington 50 years ago.

1. Martin Luther King Jr. organized the march.

The March on Washington was initiated and directed by A. Philip Randolph, a 74-year-old black labor leader who first called for a march on the Capitol to protest employment discrimination in 1941. Though that event never happened, Randolph’s organization, the Negro American Labor Council, initiated another protest in January 1963, then reached out to King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and other civil rights and labor groups.

This iconic protest had many fathers. In addition to Randolph and King, the 10 official chairmen of the event included John Lewis of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Roy Wilkins of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, as well as another labor leader and three religious leaders. The National Council of Negro Women also supported the march, but Randolph and other male leaders refused to include its president, Dorothy Height, in the official leadership. Despite vigorous protest from black women, they insisted that women could be represented by men.

2. The main goal of the march was to eliminate Jim Crow laws.

Marchers demanded equal access to public accommodations, housing, education and voting rights, but in an official list of demands, they also called on federal authorities to create “meaningful and dignified jobs at decent wages” for unemployed workers and raise the minimum wage to a level that would “give all Americans a decent standard of living.”

For many participants, the most important demand was a federal Fair Employment Practices Act banning government agencies, private employers, unions and contractors from discriminating against workers. The act had been a central aim of the civil rights movement since Randolph first envisioned a march — and it was realized with the creation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

3. The rhetoric of the march was manipulated and softened by white liberals and the Kennedy administration.

This charge was first made by Malcolm X, who famously dismissed the demonstration as a “Farce on Washington,” and taken up by Black Power and New Left activists in the late 1960s and early 1970s. While the March on Washington gained support from liberals — both black and white — and reluctant acceptance from the Kennedy administration, Randolph, King and other activists retained control over its goals and tactics.

MYTH: Lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables is responsible for the obesity epidemic. “The Obama administration’s Healthy Food Financing Initiative is meant to help low-income communities that lack access to fresh food,” writes Deborah Cohen in “ Five myths about obesity .” “Although the U.S Department of Agriculture estimates that fewer than 5 percent of Americans live in these ‘food deserts,’ about 65 percent of the nation’s population is overweight or obese.” Here, a meal at a Shake Shack restaurant in Moscow. Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg Wait 1 second to continue.

When some liberals objected to Lewis’s use of the words “revolution” and “masses,” Randolph dismissed them, saying, “I’ve used them many times myself.” Lewis did agree to add a mild endorsement of President John F. Kennedy’s civil rights bill to his speech and to drop a plea to “burn Jim Crow to the ground.” Objections to such charged language, however, came from Randolph, King and other black leaders who saw it as a departure from the legislative goals and nonviolent principles at the core of the civil rights movement.

4. Media coverage of the “I Have a Dream” speech focused on interracial harmony, overlooking demands for economic justice and full employment.

King’s speech won widespread praise for its power and eloquence, but it was not seen at the time as the most important expression of the demonstration’s objectives. There were many other players on the stage at the Lincoln Memorial that August day, and they were well covered by the media.

The three major television networks broadcast the entire event live, and it was one of the first events transmitted by satellite to Europe. Newspapers and magazines covered the march extensively, giving particular attention to Randolph and detailing the list of demands. Only after King’s assassination in 1968 did “I Have a Dream” come to be seen as the singular expression of the demonstration’s goals and objectives, overshadowing its economic aims.

5. The march awakened white Americans to the injustices faced by African Americans but had little direct impact on law or policy.

While political leaders and the media praised the march for presenting a peaceful, respectable side of the civil rights movement, the march had little measurable impact on public opinion toward segregation and racial equality. White Americans had grown more tolerant of African Americans and racial integration in the two decades before the March on Washington, and while the demonstration reinforced that trend, it also hardened the opinions of those who remained committed to segregation and white supremacy.

On the other hand, the march did have a direct impact on policy. It solidified a political coalition behind the effort to strengthen and pass the civil rights bill that Kennedy had introduced to Congress in June 1963. In addition to bolstering the enforcement provisions of the law, this coalition added the employment discrimination measures that Kennedy had rejected. Now considered the most important feature of the Civil Rights Act, Title VII was not likely to have been created without the influence of what was officially the “March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.” Even the abbreviated name by which we remember the march obscures its true meaning.

It should begin by tackling comprehensive immigration reform.

After all, much of the heavy lifting on this complicated and controversial issue has been done. Earlier this year, the Senate passed a sweeping bipartisan bill that calls for allowing more high-skilled and low-skilled workers into the U.S. while also establishing a new guest-worker program that includes additional protections for farm workers. It would set out a 13-year path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, but only after they paid fines and passed a background check, and after additional border security measures were put in place. It’s not a perfect plan, but it takes the kind of broad approach that is needed to restructure the dysfunctional system.

The Republican-led House, however, has not signed on, opting instead for a piecemeal approach. Among the separate proposals waiting to reach the floor are an enforcement bill, known as the SAFE Act, which would for the first time designate as criminals all immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and would allow states such as Arizona to enforce their own immigration laws. Another bill would create a new guest-worker program that would likely please growers but leave farm laborers unprotected from abusive employers. Two other bills would expand the use of federal databases to verify the immigration status of new employees.

The two sides are far apart, obviously. But there is some reason for hope after months of stalemate. In an effort to repair some of the political damage the GOP inflicted on itself during the shutdown, some House Republicans apparently are calling for action on immigration reform to win back moderate support. If the House approved just one of its piecemeal bills, it could move to a conference committee, where Senate and House members could begin to reconcile their differences. If it goes that route, the House should pass its border security measure, which is the best of the bills introduced so far. But it’s unclear whether Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) will allow any of the bills to move forward.

The reality is that the current immigration system isn’t working for American employers, who rely on the low-wage labor that comes in over the border, or for the millions of immigrants stuck in the underground economy. That’s why a broad coalition of religious, law enforcement and business leaders has repeatedly called for a compromise.

Immigration reform can still be achieved, if only GOP lawmakers stop stalling, stop grandstanding and get to work."

Mo Brooks has introduced legislation that would fire any federal employee who refuses to answer questions or gives false testimony at a congressional hearing.

The legislation was introduced in response to Lois Lerner, the IRS employee who revealed the agency's practice of targeting of tea party groups and subsequently declined to answer questions at congressional hearing on the issue, The Hill reported.

The proposed bill would require the termination of ""any federal employee who refuses to answer questions in a congressional hearing after being granted immunity,"" according to the report.

If three-fourths of the congressional body to whom the testimony was given finds that a federal worker ""willfully or knowingly gave false testimony"" during a hearing, then that employee would be fired under the legislation.

Lerner cited her Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination in refusing to testify at a congressional hearing in May. The move angered many who say she should have been forced to answer why the tax agency targeted conservative groups applying for tax exempt status.

""This is a statement which should not be made by federally appointed officials before a congressional hearing if they are faithfully carrying out the duties of their office,"" Brooks told The Hill of Lerner's decision to refuse to testify.

Brooks added that the proposed bill is ""constitutional and necessary to enable Congress to provide proper oversight for the American people.""

A yearlong audit by the agency's inspector general found that IRS agents had improperly targeted conservative political groups for additional and sometimes onerous scrutiny when those groups applied for tax-exempt status.

The audit found no evidence that Washington officials ordered or authorized the targeting. But the IRS watchdog blamed ineffective management by senior IRS officials for allowing it to continue for nearly two years during the 2010 and 2012 elections.

Since the revelations became public last month, much of the agency's leadership has been replaced and the Justice Department has started a criminal investigation. Both Lerner and Holly Paz, who until recently was a top deputy in the division that handles applications for tax-exempt status, have been replaced.

The presidential library could transform whatever community is chosen as its site

Chicago politicians and activists make pitches to locate Obama%27s library in their neighborhoods

The University of Hawaii is also launching a bid

CHICAGO — President Obama probably won't make a final decision on where his presidential library and museum will be located until near the end of his second term in the White House.

But here In his adopted hometown — particularly the neighborhoods where Obama made a name for himself as a community organizer before entering politics — the issues of race and class play a central role in the debate over where in the city the shrine to the first African-American president's legacy belongs.

""I think he has certainly benefited from his ties to the African-American community in terms of how of how he built his political career,"" said John Owens, a community organizer on the city's South Side who worked closely with a young Obama when he arrived in Chicago in the 1980s. ""I am not saying that he owes everything to the African-American community, but he did get his start here, and this community was his political base. This is an opportunity for him to help the community where he started from.""

There's no guarantee that Obama will even settle on the Windy City to host the library and museum. The president grew up in Honolulu, and the University of Hawaii has launched its own bid to win the library. The state has set aside one of the last undeveloped oceanfront plots in Honolulu to try to lure Obama.

What is clear to politicians and activists here is that the library has the potential to offer a huge economic boom that could transform whatever community the president settles on.

The William J. Clinton Presidential Library and Museum spurred $1 billion in real estate investment in downtown Little Rock. The George W. Bush Presidential Center on the Southern Methodist University campus, which opened in April, is projected to inject $50 million annually into the local economy, said Phillip Jones, chief executive officer of the Dallas Visitors and Convention Bureau.

It's that potential that draws activists and politicians in Obama's old stomping grounds to make the case that the president should remember the economically deprived neighborhoods he sought to change as a young man.

The University of Illinois-Chicago — the state's second-largest university on the city's Near West Side — confirmed last week that it has launched an exploratory committee to see how it might persuade Obama to build his library there. University officials declined to speak in detail about the effort.

Chicago State University, which is in the heart of the South Side neighborhood where Obama worked as a community organizer in the 1980s, announced in May it would make a spirited pitch to Obama that the school — a historically black university that draws students from some of the city's most impoverished communities — was the perfect place for Obama to bring his library.

Wayne Watson, Chicago State's president, recruited former state senator Emil Jones, who served as Obama's mentor when he was in the state Legislature, to join the exploratory committee. Watson dispatched one of his deans to Washington to talk to National Archives officials about the process and to Little Rock to pick the brains of the Clinton library officials.

The area around Chicago State, which has an unemployment rate that hovers around 30% and is among the city's most violent neighborhoods, would be resurrected by the economic jolt that would come from the hotels, restaurants and other economic development that would follow the library, Watson said.

""His political roots are right here on the South Side, pretty much in a 2-mile radius of where we are,"" Watson said. ""Secondly, President Obama represents hope. … If there is one community in Chicago that needs to have hope reinforced, it's the community where the president got his start.""

The private University of Chicago, a leafy island in the city's Hyde Park neighborhood on the hard-scrabble South Side, is running a quiet campaign for the library with the assistance of Susan Sher, a former chief of staff to first lady Michelle Obama.

The Obamas have deep ties to the university. The president worked there for 12 years as a senior lecturer at its law school, and the first lady served as an executive at the university's medical center. In addition to Sher, David Axelrod, Obama's former political adviser, was hired by the university to lead a program intended to encourage students' interest in politics and public service.

The university declined to comment about its bid, saying it is premature to discuss the library. Sher and other university leaders have met with officials at the National Archives and Records Administration and have visited with officials at the recently opened George W. Bush library in Dallas.

Don Rose, a Chicago political consultant, said the University of Chicago has a long, complicated history with the surrounding poor and working-class African-American communities that have been pushed out as the university has expanded over the years. Rose suggested that the university, with its deep ties to the Obamas and proximity to downtown, is the favorite to win the library.

""From a practical sense, the University of Chicago seems like the logical choice,"" Rose said. ""But on the other hand, if he wanted to make a bolder stroke, he could place it elsewhere on the South Side.""

Anthony Beale, an alderman on the city's far South Side, said Obama choosing the University of Chicago — which boasted a $6.57 billion endowment at the end of the past fiscal year — was tantamount to ""fattening up the frog.""

""I think it would send a wonderful message if he could bring it on home and reward the community where he got his start rather than just giving it to the University of Chicago that already has everything,"" said Beale, who is on the Chicago State University exploratory committee.

Beale advocates for the project to be built a few miles off the Chicago State campus on the grounds of the dilapidated George Pullman state historic site, where the relics of the 19th-century sleeper car factory sit behind a chain-link fence.

Lester Coney, who helped raise more than $1 million for Obama's two presidential campaigns, has suggested building the library on yet another site on the South Side, the grounds of the former U.S. Steel plant , an enormous site several miles south of downtown that developers are eyeing to turn into a residential and retail hub.

Coney said the University of Chicago — with its political clout and track record on handling projects of this magnitude — is the right partner for Obama to work with on the library, ""but I just struggle with seeing it as the right place to have that grand effect that his library can have.""

Some residents in the city's Bronzeville neighborhood — an area steeped in the city's blues and jazz scene — want the library to be built on the site of a shuttered hospital.

The site, near the McCormick Place convention center and about 2 miles north of the University of Chicago, had been floated as the site to build the Olympic Village when the city made an unsuccessful bid for the 2016 Olympics.

More recently, during a community meeting, developers floated the possibility of building a casino there, said Harold Lucas, president of the Black Metropolis Convention & Tourism Council.

""Obama came to Chicago to learn how to be a community organizer,"" said Lucas, who wants the presidential library to be built on the old hospital site. ""If he's truly that, the least he could do is put the presidential library somewhere in the black community where it can act as a catalyst."""

Assuming the government shutdown doesn't get in their way, the justices also will deal with a case that goes to the heart of the partisan impasse in Washington: whether and when the president may use recess appointments to fill key positions without Senate confirmation.

The court was unaffected for the first few days of the government shutdown and there was no expectation that arguments set for October would have to be rescheduled.

The new term that starts Monday may be short on the sort of high-profile battles over health care and gay marriage that marked the past two years. But several cases ask the court to overrule prior decisions — bold action in an institution that relies on the power of precedent.

""There are an unusual number of cases going right to hot-button cultural issues and aggressive briefing on the conservative side asking precedents to be overruled,"" said Georgetown University law professor Pamela Harris, who served in President Barack Obama's Justice Department.

Paul Clement, a frequent advocate before the court and the top Supreme Court lawyer under President George W. Bush, agreed that the opportunity exists for dramatic precedent-busting decisions. But Clement said each case also offers the court ""an off-ramp,"" a narrower outcome that may be more in keeping with Chief Justice John Roberts' stated desire for incremental decision-making that bridges the court's ideological divide.

There is a familiar ring to several cases the justices will take up.

Campaign finance, affirmative action, legislative prayer and abortion clinic protests all are on the court's calendar. The justices also will hear for the second time the case of Carol Anne Bond, a woman who was convicted under an anti-terrorism law for spreading deadly chemicals around the home of her husband's mistress.

The justices probably will decide in the fall whether to resolve competing lower court decisions about the new health care law's requirement that employer-sponsored health plans include coverage of contraceptives.

An issue with a good chance to be heard involves the authority of police to search the contents of a cellphone found on someone they arrest. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said over the summer that the right to privacy in the digital age ""is bound to come up in many forms"" in the coming years.

The court may hear its first abortion case since 2007, a review of an Oklahoma law that would restrict the use of certain abortion-inducing drugs such as RU-486.

The campaign finance argument on Tuesday is the first major case on the calendar. The 5-4 decision in the Citizens United case in 2010 allowed corporations and labor unions to spend unlimited sums in support of or opposition to candidates, as long as the spending is independent of the candidates.

The new case, McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, is a challenge to the overall limits on what an individual may give to candidates, political parties and political action committees in a two-year federal election cycle, currently $48,600 to candidates and $123,600 in total. The $2,600 limit on contributions to a candidate is not at issue.

Since the Buckley v. Valeo decision in 1976, the court has looked more favorably on contribution limits than on spending restrictions because of the potential for corruption in large contributions. The big issue in the current case is whether the justices will be just as skeptical of limits on contributing as on spending.

Three justices, Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have signaled their willingness to do so. It remains to be seen whether Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, the other two members of the Citizens United majority, are willing to go along.

Among other top cases already set for review:

— Greece, N.Y., a suburb of Rochester, is asking the court to uphold its practice of opening town council meetings with a prayer, despite an appeals court ruling that found the invocations a violation of the First Amendment because they almost always were Christian prayers. The court could use the case to rule that courts should take a more hands-off approach to religion in the public square or it could hold more narrowly that the town's practice is consistent with a 1983 decision upholding prayer at the start of government meetings.

— Mount Holly, N.J., is defending a plan to demolish and redevelop a rundown neighborhood against claims that it discriminates because it disproportionately affects African-American and Latino residents. At issue is whether there also must be an intent to discriminate under federal housing law. The issue affects a range of transactions involving real estate and applies to banks and mortgage companies as well as governments, such as the one involved in this case.

— Michigan is fighting to preserve a constitutional amendment that bans the use of racial preferences in education after a federal appeals court ruled that the constitutional ban is itself discriminatory. This case, unlike last term's look at a University of Texas admissions plan, does not involve the viability of affirmative action, but rather whether opponents of racial preferences can enshrine that ban in the state constitution.

— Massachusetts is defending a law that creates a 35-foot buffer zone at abortion clinics to limit protesters' ability to interact with patients. The court upheld a buffer zone law in Colorado in 2000, but Roberts and Alito have replaced members of that majority and are considered more sympathetic to the free-speech claims of the protesters.

While several cases call into question high court precedents, the justices will be writing on a blank slate when they take up the president's recess appointment power under the Constitution.

In that case, the court will confront an appeals court ruling that effectively would end the president's ability to make such appointments, if it is left standing.

Former Justice Department official Peter Keisler said that justices often ask a lawyer for the best case in support of his argument. ""No one is going to ask that question because 't'aint none.' No Supreme Court decisions are material here,"" said Keisler, a partner at the Sidley, Austin law firm in Washington.

The impasse that led Obama to install members of the National Labor Relations Board and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director Richard Cordray in office without Senate confirmation has been resolved. So what remains of the issue is whether Obama and his successors will be constrained in the future.

The topic splits Democrats and Republicans, but their view of the matter is almost entirely dependent on which party controls the White House.

In another area, little drama is expected. Four justices are over the age of 75, but none is expected to retire in the coming year.

Ginsburg, at 80, is the oldest member of the court. Scalia and Kennedy are 77, and Justice Stephen Breyer is 75.

Ginsburg made clear in a series of media interviews this summer that she will stay on the court as long as she is able to do the work. Before the summer, Ginsburg had said she wanted to emulate Justice Louis Brandeis and stay on the bench as long as he did, 22 years. She will reach that mark in 2015, which also coincides with what is widely believed to be Obama's last opportunity to name her replacement because the presidential election year of 2016 is an unlikely time to fill a high court vacancy, especially in the eighth and final year of a presidency."

Pat McCrory delivers the State of the State address at the Legislative Building in Raleigh, N.C., Monday, Feb. 18, 2013. (AP Photo/Ted Richardson)

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., Feb 19 (Reuters) - North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory on Tuesday signed into law a measure that will cut benefits for jobless workers by about one-third and reduce how long they can collect any aid in a state with the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country.

The Republican governor said the legislation, the second bill he has signed since taking office at the start of the year, marked an important step toward fixing the state's unemployment insurance system.

The overhaul will allow North Carolina to repay $2.5 billion borrowed from the federal government for unemployment benefits at a quicker pace.

The law, which takes effect on July 1, cuts maximum weekly benefits to $350 from $535 and caps benefits at 12 to 20 weeks, depending on the unemployment rate, instead of the current 26 weeks.

McCrory said the measure ""will protect our small businesses from continued over-taxation, ensure our citizens' unemployment safety net is secure and financially sound for future generations, and help provide an economic climate that allows job creators to start hiring again.""

Critics said the harsh nature of the cuts would harm some of the state's most vulnerable residents. North Carolina has more than 400,000 jobless workers, making its 9.2 percent unemployment rate higher than the national average of 7.9 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

""Hundreds of thousands of jobless workers thrown out of work through no fault of their own will face deepening poverty as a result of this decision,"" the North Carolina Justice Center, a social justice advocacy group, said in a statement after the bill signing on Tuesday.

""North Carolina's legislature and governor chose to permanently cut benefits, reduce employers' contributions over time, and reject $700 million in federal extended benefits,"" the center said.

About 170,000 long-term unemployed workers in North Carolina will lose out on extra federal funds under the new law, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

The suits were filed June 11 by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which last year issued new guidelines that cautioned against rejecting minority applicants who have committed a crime and recommended businesses eliminate policies that “exclude people from employment based on a criminal record.”

The suits have re-ignited concerns over such issues as potential federal overreach, the overlap of state and federal law and companies losing their rights to protect customers, workers and assets while trying to adhere to fair hiring practices.

“Employers are unsettled over the EEOC’s questionable practices and its litigation tactics,” Kevin Connell, chairman of the Florida-based employment and tenant screening company AccuScreen.com, told FoxNews.com on Friday night. “I am fed up with the EEOC’s arrogance and their 'sue first, ask questions later' mentality. … The EEOC has already tried re-writing the rules that they are charged with enforcing, so we have the hiring police, the EEOC, writing, revising very confusing rules and regulations with their infamous (April 2012) update.”

BMW spokesman Kenn Sparks said the company cannot comment on the specifics of pending litigation.

“However, BMW believes that it has complied with the letter and spirit of the law and will defend itself against the EEOC’s allegations of race discrimination,” he said.

Dollar General responded to the suit by saying the discount retailer prohibits discriminatory hiring in its employment practices but its criminal background checks are ""structured to foster a safe and healthy environment for its employees, its customers, and to protect its assets in a lawful, reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner,"" according to The Wall Street Journal.

The EEOC alleges Dollar General violated the civil rights of two applicants. In the one case, the person allegedly was denied employment even though a felony conviction was incorrectly attributed to her. And the commission alleges BMW’s policy doesn't consider the nature of the crimes or how old they are.

EEOC alleges that when BMW required contract employees at the South Carolina plant to reapply for their jobs in 2008 a disproportionate percentage of those terminated were black, including some who had already worked for company contractors.

“The BMW plant in South Carolina employs thousands of people, and providing a safe work environment is one of the company’s highest priorities,” Sparks said.

All of the claimants are black, and both cases are filed in federal court, according to the EEOC.

The EEOC said upon updating the policy that civil rights laws already prohibit different treatment for job applicants with different ethnic backgrounds but identical criminal histories.

However, the update was issued out of concern that employers might disproportionately exclude minorities from getting hired because more African Americans and Hispanics are getting arrested and going to prison, according to the guideline report.

While the percentage of working-age Americans with a criminal record has increased significantly over the past 20 years, African Americans and Hispanics are arrested two to three times as much compared with the rest of the U.S. population, according to a commission report at the time of the vote.

The guideline, though not legally binding, direct employers to consider the crime, its relation to an applicant's potential job and how much time has passed since the conviction. Employers should review each case individually and allow applicants to show why they should be hired despite a conviction, the guidelines state.

Strong objections to the policy changes began when the five-member commission approved them last April.

“The only real impact … will be to scare business owners from ever conducting criminal background checks,” said Commissioner Constance Barker, who cast the lone nay vote and was one of two George W. Bush appointees on the Democrat-controlled commission at the time.

She also said the EEOC in making the changes “far exceeded its authority.”

Carol Miaskoff, the commission’s acting associate legal counsel, said the 4-1 vote proved, at least for the four commissioners voting yes, that they had not overstepped their authority.

Because the commission is not a regulatory commission, the outcome of the court cases will be a key first test for whether the guidelines will have teeth.

“The lawsuits are certainly a very public demonstration” of the EEOC’s decision to change the guidelines, Elizabeth Milito, of the National Federation of Independent Business, told FoxNews.com. “Background checks are essential to businesses large and small. And now they feel like they are in a no-win situation.”

Milito lays out the dilemma in which a company does not run a criminal check and risks having a new hire with a violent criminal history assault a co-worker, or run a check and face a federal lawsuit.

“People are confused, afraid and saying I could get sued either way,” she said.

Milito did not want to speculate on the outcome of either case but argued the commission, not exactly awash in resources, clearly picked cases it thought it could win and “two very big employers.”"
http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/the-family-unfriendly-act/,2013-05-10 00:00:00,['Teresa Tritch'],The Family Unfriendly Act,"There are two good things to say about the Working Families Flexibility Act, which passed the House this week with 220 Republican and three Democratic votes.

One, the bill is bound to go nowhere in the Senate and, two, even if it did advance, the White House has threatened to veto it.

The bill, in brief, is worse than meritless; it is a fraud. According to its Republican backers, it’s an expression in legislative form of how much they care for families, work-life balance and, in particular, working women. If this is caring, I would hate to see what contempt looks like.



The bill would amend long-standing labor law by allowing private-sector employers to offer compensatory time off in lieu of time-and-a-half pay for overtime. Employers and workers are supposed to agree on the arrangement, but there is nothing to stop an employer from discriminating against those who prefer payment by cutting back on their overtime hours. Nor would employers face any real deterrent against forcing unpaid overtime on workers who fear losing their jobs if they object. The recourse for coerced workers would be to sue, a far-fetched and unaffordable option for most people.

For employers, then, the bill is a way to impose extra work at no additional cost, effectively shifting what would otherwise be worker pay into corporate profits.

For employees who won’t work overtime without extra compensation, the likely result would be fewer hours and overall less pay. For those who will, the likely result would be greater unpredictability in scheduling, which only creates more work stress, as well as higher costs for work related expenses like child care, but with no additional money to meet those expenses.

Now, what about having more time off? Under the bill, employees can use their comp time only at the employer’s convenience. If employees are unable to get timely approval for using the comp time, or decide not to use it, they can ask to cash it in, at which point the employer has 30 days to pay up.

The bill’s Republican supporters have stressed that government workers can accrue comp time in place of overtime pay, implying that private sector workers are missing out on a perk enjoyed by cossetted public sector workers. Wrong. Government employers don’t need to turn a profit, and thus do not have the same incentive as private sector employers to push workers into unpaid overtime. Government employees, who tend to be in unions — as well as private sector unionized workers — also have contracts with safeguards around alternative work and pay arrangements.

For the record, there are many ways for Congress to improve both worker pay and work life balance, including raising the minimum wage, instituting paid sick leave, ending discriminatory pay practices, easing the formation of unions and promoting advance notice for worker scheduling. The House bill ignores what is helpful and embraces what is harmful."

At an immigration reform rally in San Francisco Monday, President Obama confronted a heckler who demanded that he stop all deportations. (Associated Press)

The young man’s plea was direct: Stop the deportations, he urged President Obama, of the 11.5 million illegal immigrants in the United States.

“You have the power to stop deportations for all,” the man said as he interrupted Obama’s immigration policy speech here Monday afternoon.

“Actually,” the president replied, “I don’t. And that’s why we’re here.”

He added, “The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I’m proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve — but it won’t be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done.”

Hecklers have become a staple at Obama’s public events, but it’s rare that one underscores the message that the president is trying to deliver — in this instance, that the American people support a path to citizenship for those here illegally but that Congress is blocking comprehensive immigration reform.

Obama came to San Francisco’s Chinatown on Monday to argue that overhauling the immigration system would bring an economic windfall for the Bay Area and other communities nationwide. In remarks at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center, Obama said 35 percent of business owners in San Francisco are immigrants, many of them Asian Americans.

“You don’t have to be an economist to figure out that workers will be more productive if they’ve got their families here with them — they’re not worried about deportation, they’re not living halfway around the world,” Obama said. “This isn’t just the right thing to do. It’s the smart thing to do.”

Obama urged House Republicans to take up the Senate’s compromise immigration bill, saying that progress on this front is being held up by a faction of the Republican Party. He also reiterated his support for a piecemeal approach in the House if that is what it would take to pass a package of reforms.

But Obama also said, “Just because something is smart, fair, good for the economy and supported by business, labor, law enforcement and faith leaders, Democratic and Republican governors, including the governor of this state — just because all that is in place doesn’t mean we’ll actually get it done because this is Washington, after all, that we’re talking about, and everything’s looked at through a political prism.”

Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), said, “The speaker is sincere in wanting to get something done, and we’re pleased the president said he can accept the step-by-step approach we’re taking in the House.”

In addition to immigration, Obama touched briefly on the troubled rollout of the federal government’s health insurance exchange. California has signed up tens of thousands of people through its own exchange.

“Even as we’re getting this darn Web site up to speed — and it’s getting better — states like California are proving the law works,” Obama said, referring to the federal insurance Web site."

The court ruled that the law, which in effect sought to bully undocumented immigrants into leaving the state, was an unconstitutional intrusion by a state government into an arena — immigration policy — that is the responsibility of the federal government.

But apparently the high court’s decision has done little to diminish support for such laws in Hazleton, Pa., and Farmers Branch, Texas, where officials have spent millions defiantly defending local housing ordinances intended to regulate immigration.

In Hazleton’s case, the city adopted an ordinance in 2006 that would have turned landlords into criminals if they rented to immigrants lacking legal status. Two courts, including the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, have struck down the measure, finding it both discriminatory and an infringement on the federal government’s sole authority over immigration.

And an en banc review by the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Farmers Branch law, which required city officials to deny “occupancy licenses” to renters if it was found they were in the country illegally, similarly interfered with the federal government’s authority.

Now both cities are asking the Supreme Court to review the lower-court decisions that invalidated their ordinances. Supporters argue that these laws regulate housing, not immigration, and therefore do not interfere with federal authority. They cite a Nebraska law allowing such housing restrictions that was upheld this year by a circuit court.

That argument is specious. Laws that punish immigrants who are in the country illegally for trying to find a place to live, or that require landlords to check the immigration status of prospective tenants, or that mandate that renters register with the city and provide proof of their legal status, are clearly intended to regulate immigration. In fact, these laws rely on the same “attrition by enforcement” strategy that Arizona employed when it tried to force immigrants out of the state by making their day-to-day lives so harsh that they would self-deport.

Local regulations certainly can and do interfere with the federal government’s authority. As District Judge James Munley wrote in 2007, when he struck down Hazleton’s ordinance, it “is difficult to conceive of a more effective method of ensuring that persons do not enter or remain in a locality than by precluding their ability to live in a place.” If the federal government is to have authority over who stays and who is deported, it must have that power in every state and city.

The Supreme Court should deny both cities’ requests for review, and in so doing remind local officials that immigration reform is Congress’ job — if only lawmakers would step up and do it."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/22/obama-administration-files-suits-against-businesses-using-criminal-background/,2013-06-22 00:00:00,['Joseph Weber'],Feds file civil rights suits on companies using criminal background checks for hires,"The Obama administration is suing Dollar General and a BMW facility in South Carolina for the alleged unfair use of criminal background checks for job applicants, months after warning companies about how such screenings can discriminate against African Americans.

The suits were filed June 11 by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which last year issued new guidelines that cautioned against rejecting minority applicants who have committed a crime and recommended businesses eliminate policies that “exclude people from employment based on a criminal record.”

The suits have re-ignited concerns over such issues as potential federal overreach, the overlap of state and federal law and companies losing their rights to protect customers, workers and assets while trying to adhere to fair hiring practices.

“Employers are unsettled over the EEOC’s questionable practices and its litigation tactics,” Kevin Connell, chairman of the Florida-based employment and tenant screening company AccuScreen.com, told FoxNews.com on Friday night. “I am fed up with the EEOC’s arrogance and their 'sue first, ask questions later' mentality. … The EEOC has already tried re-writing the rules that they are charged with enforcing, so we have the hiring police, the EEOC, writing, revising very confusing rules and regulations with their infamous (April 2012) update.”

BMW spokesman Kenn Sparks said the company cannot comment on the specifics of pending litigation.

“However, BMW believes that it has complied with the letter and spirit of the law and will defend itself against the EEOC’s allegations of race discrimination,” he said.

Dollar General responded to the suit by saying the discount retailer prohibits discriminatory hiring in its employment practices but its criminal background checks are ""structured to foster a safe and healthy environment for its employees, its customers, and to protect its assets in a lawful, reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner,"" according to The Wall Street Journal.

The EEOC alleges Dollar General violated the civil rights of two applicants. In the one case, the person allegedly was denied employment even though a felony conviction was incorrectly attributed to her. And the commission alleges BMW’s policy doesn't consider the nature of the crimes or how old they are.

EEOC alleges that when BMW required contract employees at the South Carolina plant to reapply for their jobs in 2008 a disproportionate percentage of those terminated were black, including some who had already worked for company contractors.

“The BMW plant in South Carolina employs thousands of people, and providing a safe work environment is one of the company’s highest priorities,” Sparks said.

All of the claimants are black, and both cases are filed in federal court, according to the EEOC.

The EEOC said upon updating the policy that civil rights laws already prohibit different treatment for job applicants with different ethnic backgrounds but identical criminal histories.

However, the update was issued out of concern that employers might disproportionately exclude minorities from getting hired because more African Americans and Hispanics are getting arrested and going to prison, according to the guideline report.

While the percentage of working-age Americans with a criminal record has increased significantly over the past 20 years, African Americans and Hispanics are arrested two to three times as much compared with the rest of the U.S. population, according to a commission report at the time of the vote.

The guideline, though not legally binding, direct employers to consider the crime, its relation to an applicant's potential job and how much time has passed since the conviction. Employers should review each case individually and allow applicants to show why they should be hired despite a conviction, the guidelines state.

Strong objections to the policy changes began when the five-member commission approved them last April.

“The only real impact … will be to scare business owners from ever conducting criminal background checks,” said Commissioner Constance Barker, who cast the lone nay vote and was one of two George W. Bush appointees on the Democrat-controlled commission at the time.

She also said the EEOC in making the changes “far exceeded its authority.”

Carol Miaskoff, the commission’s acting associate legal counsel, said the 4-1 vote proved, at least for the four commissioners voting yes, that they had not overstepped their authority.

Because the commission is not a regulatory commission, the outcome of the court cases will be a key first test for whether the guidelines will have teeth.

“The lawsuits are certainly a very public demonstration” of the EEOC’s decision to change the guidelines, Elizabeth Milito, of the National Federation of Independent Business, told FoxNews.com. “Background checks are essential to businesses large and small. And now they feel like they are in a no-win situation.”

Milito lays out the dilemma in which a company does not run a criminal check and risks having a new hire with a violent criminal history assault a co-worker, or run a check and face a federal lawsuit.

“People are confused, afraid and saying I could get sued either way,” she said.

Milito did not want to speculate on the outcome of either case but argued the commission, not exactly awash in resources, clearly picked cases it thought it could win and “two very big employers.”"

More than 3 million people were living in the United States after crossing the border illegally or overstaying their visas.

A new law signed by President Ronald Reagan gave legal status and a path to citizenship to most of those unauthorized residents — helping many secure a slice of the American dream but also giving fuel to critics who sought to turn “amnesty” into a pejorative.

Less than 30 years later, the number of immigrants living in the country illegally is thought to have nearly quadrupled, and the freighted baggage of amnesty looms over new efforts to reform the nation’s immigration laws.

With four times as many people potentially eligible, today’s mass legalization would occur on a much larger scale. The specifics of the current proposal are different, the global economy is different, and the immigrants themselves are different, hailing from South Korea as well as Mexico and fanning out from traditional enclaves like Los Angeles to populate small towns across America.

Still, the reams of post-1986 studies offer an indication of what might happen if millions of immigrants receive legal status. And there is broad agreement on one thing: The flow of illegal immigration must somehow be stanched, so there is never a need for an amnesty again. In that respect, 1986 was an utter failure.

“The goal’s got to be that people come with visas, not with smugglers, that they come for jobs that we need people to come fill,” said Angela Maria Kelley, an immigration policy expert with the pro-reform Center for American Progress.

The 855-page Senate bill, currently in committee, contains a path to citizenship taking at least 13 years, with provisional status to be granted almost immediately to those who were in the country before 2012. Proponents avoid calling it amnesty, even as they tout the moral imperative of bringing 11 million people out of the shadows. Opponents wield the word as a weapon, decrying amnesty as a free pass to lawbreakers that should not have been doled out in 1986, nor again in 2013.

Both camps trot out economic projections. Higher immigrant wages will pad tax coffers and boost the domestic product by billions of dollars, one argument goes. Opponents predict a drain on public funds as newly legalized immigrants apply for government benefits, and harm to American workers as immigrants get better jobs.

“After legalization, they’ll be eligible for virtually every job in the country,” said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the anti-legalization Federation for American Immigration Reform. “People whose jobs are not threatened right now will find themselves in competition with these workers.”

Juan Manuel Niebla arrived in Los Angeles in 1976 with a third-grade education and a dollar in his pocket. He found a job at a factory, where his salary was many times the $5 a day he made as a construction worker in Mexico. He raised a family, learned English and bought a house, all while living in the country illegally.

For Niebla, the 1986 amnesty meant freedom from fear. He no longer had to worry about being deported if he was pulled over while driving to work. He was finally able to visit his parents in Mexico.

Initially, he stayed at the same job, working his way up from machine operator to supervisor. Then, his boss ordered him to accept a pay cut or be laid off. Niebla chose the latter, knowing that as a U.S. citizen, he could tide himself over with unemployment benefits. He immediately found work as a landscaper with the city of Los Angeles, where he now makes $24 an hour and looks forward to a pension when he retires.

“This country is for everybody, especially if they’re hardworking, honest people,” said Niebla, 63, of Highland Park. “I have everything — good health, a good job.”

James P. Smith, a labor market expert at Rand Corp., believes that legalizing the 11 million unauthorized immigrants — 1 in 4 of whom live in California — is the right thing to do.

But unless the new legislation succeeds in stopping illegal immigration through a combination of more work visas, border security and workplace enforcement, the cycle may repeat. A new generation of illegal border crossers and over-stayers may find inspiration in stories like Niebla’s.

“The very fact that it was successful in that way was a signal that this will happen again, that this is the American solution to the immigration problem, legalizing those who are here and dealing with it again 15, 20 years in the future,” Smith said of the 1986 amnesty.

Many studies have found that wages increased for amnesty recipients as a group — as much as 15% in the first five years, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. If immigrants earn more, they will spend more and pay more taxes, potentially creating more jobs.

“It’s the freedom to say, ‘I can do this, and I’m free to do that,’” said Antonia Hernandez, who was head of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund at the time. “By that same token, it was the employers knowing that was the case and treating employees differently.”

According to the Center for American Progress, the lengthy path to citizenship outlined by the Senate bill could add 121,000 jobs per year and inject $832 billion into the economy over the next decade. Legalized immigrants would pay billions more in local, state and federal taxes on top of what they already pay, according to the center’s estimates.

Others counter that newly legalized immigrants could be a huge drain on Social Security, Medicare, food stamps and other government programs. A study last week by the conservative Heritage Foundation showed that a mass legalization could cost the government $6 trillion over the immigrants’ lifetimes. It came under fire from both Republicans and Democrats, and a co-author quit after his earlier assertions questioning immigrants’ intelligence surfaced.

Still, other research suggests that immigrants as a group may use more government services than they pay in taxes, since they are more likely to be low-income and have more children in public schools than native-born families.

Under the Senate proposal, immigrants would stay in provisional status for at least 10 years, remaining ineligible for most federal benefits, including subsidized health insurance, during that time.

With improved job prospects, legalized immigrants may be less likely to commit crimes. At the same time, a Cornell University study suggests that some immigrants who were ineligible for the 1986 amnesty resorted to crimes like burglary because they were increasingly shut out of the labor market.

The better immigrants do, the more likely they are to take jobs that U.S. workers would want. But some researchers believe the post-1986 job gains were confined to the relatively small number of amnesty recipients who were well-educated and spoke good English, and that few U.S. workers want to be farmworkers, house cleaners or busboys.

“I don’t think this legalization is going to be a switch flipper and dramatically grow the size of the economy or improve things for the workers or the American economy in general really quickly,” said Laura Hill, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. “Granting legal status isn’t going to suddenly make for a new group of competitors in the labor force. They’re already here, and they’re already maximizing their earning potential in terms of their skill sets.”

Niebla became a U.S. citizen in 1996 and has voted in just about every election since then, including a recent Los Angeles municipal contest that drew a dismal 21% turnout.

Ana Etelvina Villalobos never misses an election, either. She came to Los Angeles in the early 1980s to escape the civil war in her native El Salvador, raising her daughters as a single mother. When she got her papers, she was working as a cook on a food truck. She later became a housekeeper for Hollywood celebrities and earned a college degree in accounting.

“Now, I’m at liberty to go everywhere without the fear you have when you don’t have papers,” said Villalobos, 56. “I’m not afraid to fight for my rights, to travel.”

Advertisement

Niebla and Villalobos may be more the exception than the rule. By 2010, about 40% of amnesty recipients, or 1.1 million people, had become U.S. citizens, according to a federal study. The legalized immigrants faced the same obstacles as other green card holders who delay citizenship: a steep application fee, lack of English, and not enough time or knowledge to navigate the process.

In November, Latinos and Asian Americans put immigration reform on the national agenda by overwhelmingly supporting President Obama. Despite the low naturalization rates, some researchers believe the 1986 amnesty added enough voters to be a major factor in that result, 26 years later. The future political effect of a much larger cohort is unknown.

“All we know is that this is going to alter society in innumerable ways,” said Muzaffar Chishti of the Migration Policy Institute, who is an expert on the 1986 law. “If 11.2 million new people enter the body politic, that has to shake it. What it will do to political parties, we don’t know. What it will do to local elections, we don’t know.”

About half had gathered to express their frustration with ongoing deportations of immigrants and with the immigration bill that is pending in Congress.



Some of the others waved red signs opposing the Keystone XL Pipeline. About a dozen abortion opponents also were gathered at the protest site, on the east side of the 700 block of South Michigan Avenue, with signs depicting aborted fetuses.



The protesters voiced a range of complaints against the president.



""I don't know what he has in his head to come in and fundraise for politicians a week after 50 schools got shut down in Chicago,"" said Esteban Burgoa, an Iraq war vet who was born in Mexico and carried a sign that urged an end to deportations, among other things. ""Why doesn't he raise money for the educators?""



The demonstration was organized in part by immigration activists, including Undocumented Illinois, a coalition of groups across the state that want deportations halted as Congress works out an immigration reform bill.



""We're seeing people that would qualify for the reform be deported and displaced,"" said Xanat Sobrevilla, 25, an organizer from Chicago Ridge. ""They are community members, they are parents, they are workers.""



Twelve protesters who were expressing that message were arrested earlier today after they staged a sit-in outside the hotel, Sobrevilla said.



The eight female and four male protesters were taken into custody a little after 9:45 a.m. after they blocked traffic and refused to move, said Police News Affairs Officer John Mirabelli.



They were expected to be charged with reckless conduct, obstructing or resisting the actions of a police officer, and obstructing a roadway, all misdemeanors, Mirabelli said.



Alfonso Seiva, of Pilsen, said he was there to ""remind Obama of the Latino people.""



""Nothing happened in the last four years and nothing is happening now,"" Seiva said as he held a large sign that said ""Stop Deportation.""



Others said they disapprove of the immigration bill under consideration in the Senate.



""We don't accept it; we believe it's not a just reform,"" said Vicki Cervantes, of the Coalition for Migrant Justice. ""It creates semi-legal status where people don't have full rights. It leaves people still vulnerable.""



Obama is in town for two fundraisers hosted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. After speaking at the Hilton this evening, he will attend the second fundraiser at a private residence.

(Updated)","If you've been following current events in North Carolina you know the recently empowered GOP legislature (and GOP governor) have been on a roll to slash and burn healthcare, unemployment benefits, taxes on the wealthy and corporations, and more. Yesterday they attached, and passed in the Senate, a very restrictive abortion clause to a bill about ""Sharia Law."" (This particularly odious action was cleverly designed to hopefully pass below the horizon of public view and opinion, but did not...although the protestors were told to be quiet because the only voices that mattered were those of the Senators.)

In response, thousands of North Carolinians have gone to the capital building to peacefully protest. Hundreds have been arrested...booked, finger-printed...mug shots...the whole banana. These are the Moral Monday protestors we're talking about...good citizens from all walks of life.

Lo and behold, the Civitas Institute..a right-wing ""think tank"" and public policy influence organization founded and financed by Gazillionaire retailer Art Pope...who is also the appointed NC Budget Director...immediately put up several web pages with all the collected info on the arrested protestors.

You can see it here, but I ask that you read on before going back to the Civitas site...

http://www.nccivitas.org/...

When you do visit this steaming pile of crap, be sure to page through the various options to see how they've turned intimidation into a game.

So...you're a good citizen peacefully protesting...you're arrested for trespassing...and now here you are on the intertoobs...your name, address, sex, age, race, party, occupation, employer, salary if available, alleged voter registration violation (address not matching registration)....etc. There has been some speculation as to just how the Civitas folks were able to get all the data so rapidly...implying possible cooperation from someone in government.

Now, just for fun, imagine if the Civitas folks had all your postal, internet, email, and financial ""meta data"" and they listed some carefully selected magazines you subscribe to..web sites you visit...places where you've made purchases and how much you spent, you name it. Innocent or not...and none of their business...they could twist this to make anyone look like whatever they choose.

John Q. Smith...subscribes to xyz magazine, spent money at the xyz club, was delinquent on property taxes last year, buys books on the following subjects...mother in nursing home under medicaid yet purchased a $900 xyz last week....sends emails twice a week to woman in Soviet Union... You name it... A totally misleading picture could be constructed to try someone in the court of public opinion. Doesn't matter if the magazine is Playboy or Forbes, the club is a ""gentlemans club"" or a golf club...it all depends on the story they're trying to construct for their audience. Heck, they could make someone look bad or suspicious for darn near anything...and it's none of their damn business even if technology has made it available.

Now...go look at the Civitas stuff. Then decide whether or not you want to let the government, and by association those entities involved with the government or politics ...who might not like you for some reason....to have unfettered, unjustified, and pervasive access to your daily life and activities.

BTW...when some NC activists used the Civitas' listing of their directors and employees and constructed a compilation of their names and addresses, etc., on the web...Civitas immediately removed the names of their people from their web site... Gee...probably because that was uncalled for and invasive.

***UPDATE: Thank you allowing me on the Rec List. What's happening in North Carolina is beyond despicable. The GOP and their allies are using every dirty trick they can to ram thru their regressive legislation...and they ARE stooping to intimidation by use of both personal data and law enforcement. They make the rules...you break 'em...jail or intimidation for you...or both. Young people here want to help, but arrest records don't portend well for their future."

Republicans have two choices: Support comprehensive immigration reform or keep losing elections. Even the Tea Party darling Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., now supports reform. The other day, he stated that deporting 11 million people is not going to happen.

Steve Silversmith

For years, politicians have been milking illegal immigration while doing nothing. They keep talking about securing the border, but they never do. I think many more Americans would be in the mood to talk about ""immigration reform"" if we knew the southern border was actually secure.

Jim Antista

It is against the law to hire illegal immigrants; both parties share the blame equally for that law not being enforced.

I think if immigrants are not criminals and want to become citizens, then there should be options open to them. They shouldn't be fast-tracked, and there shouldn't be blanket amnesty, but there should be some options.

Letters to the editor:

The U.S. is lucky to have Texas. Between New York City's attempt to ban large sizes of sugary drinks and Los Angeles County's rule against throwing a Frisbee on the beach without a lifeguard's permission, we have the common-sense advice of Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas (""Immigration enforcement key to success: Column""). His plan to reform immigration is so simple that even members of Congress can understand it.

Whether they will implement a plan that's so practical, emphasizing enforcement of existing law, is most likely beyond them.

Chuck Curtis; Dallas

Amnesty will depress the wages of U.S. workers and encourage more illegal immigration and lax policies. Strong workplace enforcement, on the other hand, will deny them the ability to make a living in the U.S., rendering it unfeasible for many to remain here. This is the real solution to illegal immigration.

James Bowen; Lawrence, Kan.

Coming to this country is difficult for many; pursuing stronger legislation that will penalize the children of illegal immigrants only makes the issue worse.

America was once considered the great melting pot, but assimilation seems to have become the standard.

We force immigrants to know English and take a citizenship test that many Americans could not pass, and penalize young illegal immigrants who are trying to work or get an education. We must realize our nation is one of immigrants.

Rep. Jeff Duncan%2C R-S.C.%2C has been aggressive in trying to lure firms

A Colorado ammunition manufacturer has been targeted by states

Texas Gov. Rick Perry has written to at least 13 companies

States claiming to be friendly to the Second Amendment are trying to poach gun and ammunition makers and related manufacturers from other states, especially those that have passed or are contemplating tougher gun laws.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, this month has written at least 13 manufacturers in states from Oregon to New York saying his state would not impose ""unwarranted government intrusion into your business.""

Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., has written manufacturers in New York and Colorado inviting them to relocate. Idaho economic development officials and Mississippi's Republican speaker of the House also have written similar letters.

""The enemies of freedom are waging an all-out assault on the Second Amendment to the Constitution, which we have sworn to protect and defend,"" said Duncan's letter to George Kollitides, chief executive officer of Freedom Group Inc., whose Remington Arms division has a manufacturing plant in Ilion, N.Y. ""At a time when our government is consistently thwarting the ability of individuals to own businesses, voluntarily trade goods and services, and grow our economy, South Carolina is committed to a different story. In South Carolina, we believe in the right to keep and bear arms.""

Duncan also wrote the chief operating officer of Magpul, a Colorado company that makes ammunition magazines, gun stocks and other custom add-ons for semi-automatic rifles that President Obama and some members of Congress, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., want to ban. Colorado's legislature is contemplating several gun-control measures, including limiting ammunition magazines to 15 rounds.

When the legislation first came to light, Magpul officials told the Denver Post they would consider leaving the state if the measure to limit rounds in magazines became law, saying it would be difficult doing business in a state that banned its products. Other companies that supply Magpul have since said they would follow if Magpul left.

Repeated attempts to reach Magpul officials were unsuccessful. So were attempts to reach a spokesperson for Remington Arms, which was founded in upstate New York but is now headquartered in North Carolina.

New York last month passed one of the most restrictive gun laws in the nation, which among other things banned assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. When he signed it, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, stressed that the new restrictions would not affect rifles and shotguns used by hunters.

In an interview, Duncan said that was not the point.

""This isn't about deer hunting,"" he said. ""The Second Amendment is about our right to keep and bear arms to defend ourselves.""

Rob Godfrey, a spokesman for South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican, said that ""while we appreciate Congressman Duncan's leadership and economic development efforts, we don't discuss details of ongoing talks with any company that may be interested in moving to South Carolina.""

The Colorado House has passed several gun-related measures, including limiting ammunition magazines to 15 rounds. Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, has said he would sign such legislation if it passes the state Senate.

Eric Brown, a spokesman for Hickenlooper, said that if a company left the state because of gun restrictions, ""that would be unfortunate.

""But Colorado is growing,"" he said. ""We are adding a lot of jobs.""

One company approached by Perry, the Texas governor, already has said no.

Crimson Trace Corp. of Wilsonville, Ore., which makes laser-sighting systems for handguns, will stay put. Kent Thomas, director of marketing for the company, said the firm is happy with the ""entrepreneurial spirit of Oregon"" and that ""there is no reason for us to move.""

Bills to ban the sale of high-capacity magazines and assault rifles were introduced in the Oregon legislature but they have stalled. State Sen. Floyd Prozanski, a Democrat and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said last week he would not take up either bill because they were issues that Congress should deal with.

Some states that have robust outdoors industries have been trying to attract gun and ammunition manufacturers for years.

Even before the most recent escalation in the gun-violence debate following the murder of 20 children and six adults in December in Newtown, Conn., Idaho was trying to attract companies ""not only within the arms and ammunition sector, but broader — companies that fall within what we call recreational technology,"" said Megan Ronk, spokeswoman for the Idaho Department of Commerce. The best way to explain the state's business targets, she said: makers of any products sold at Cabela's, a leading outdoors, hunting and fishing retailer.

Ronk said that as other states consider gun restrictions, ""that creates some advantages for us. We in this state have traditionally been very friendly to companies within this industry, and will continue to be so. Certainly looking at other states that are imposing more restrictive laws"" is part of a business-recruitment strategy.

Today’s example: the long, tortuous road to bringing more retirement security to working-class Californians.

In September, the state launched a plan to enable these workers to put aside about 3% of their wages a year for retirement. As enacted by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, the program’s goals would be modest indeed.

The best thing about the plan is that it would allow workers to build up retirement stakes at low cost and low risk; their contributions would be pooled with other enrollees’ for the purpose of making investments, which would cut down on fees. Workers would be signed up automatically, though they could opt out at any time. They’d be protected against the loss of their contributions and guaranteed a modest investment gain — say about 3% over inflation. When they retire, their nest eggs would be turned into annuities designed to last to the end of their lives, presumably at a conversion cost lower than they might incur in the commercial annuity market.

There would be no cost to state taxpayers. Employers with five or more workers would be required to offer the plan to their workforce and to allow contributions to be withheld through their payroll systems, as they do for taxes. They’d be free of any other legal or administrative burdens.

It’s a great deal. It’s also necessary, given the decades-long assault on employer-sponsored defined-benefit pensions, which were once an important pillar of retirement security for average Americans. “This could be a real model for the nation,” Karen Friedman, policy director at the Pension Rights Center in Washington, told me.

But it’s going to take at least two more years to get off the ground, which is ridiculous. That’s chiefly because the legislation requires that a feasibility study be done first to determine the demand for such a plan and the best way to avoid sticking taxpayers with the costs of an investment guarantee, and a few other details. The kicker is that the feasibility study has to be financed from privately raised funds, and that takes time.

“I’m going door to door in Echo Park to get people to chip in dollars,” says the plan’s creator, state Sen. Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles). He’ll soon widen his appeal to big unions in the hope of more rapidly amassing the $500,000 or more he’ll need to finance the study. As it stands now, he hopes to start the study next year and get the program launched in 2015. But he says the privately financed study was the price of securing Brown’s support.

You may ask why the state should step in and help workers obtain pensions. The answer is that fewer and fewer employers offer pension plans of any sort. The problem is acute among mid-size and small businesses, and even worse among those with relatively low-paid workforces.

A 2011 conference at Berkeley found that California does poorly by its working class according to this measure. Nearly half of all the state’s workers aren’t offered retirement plans at work, and only 44% participate even if they have the opportunity.

“If we don’t get these people into a retirement savings mode, we are going to have a retirement insecurity tsunami,” De Leon says. “Folks are going to retire when their arms, their legs, their shoulders give out, and they’ll only have Social Security because they’ll have built up no assets over time. There’s nothing for working folks.”

It’s fashionable nowadays to portray retirees as an affluent class, doing much better financially than their offspring currently in the workforce. The goal is to promote the idea that it’s OK to hack away at Social Security and Medicaid because our plutocratic seniors can suck up the cuts. This is a dangerous fantasy promulgated by congressmen and Washington pundits who will never have to fear landing on the wrong side of the miscalculation.

The truth is that today’s retirees are the last beneficiaries of a bygone world, as Jacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale University, observed at the Berkeley meeting. A quarter-century ago, 80% of large and mid-size employers offered a defined-benefit pension, the model that imposed the least risk on the worker and supplied the longest-lasting retirement income stream. Today that figure is about 30%. Some of those plans have been replaced by 401(k)-style plans, to which workers contribute out of their wages (sometimes supplemented by the employer) and then cross their fingers that their investment choices will yield decent returns over the decades.

These are a thin reed, however. The vast majority of workers don’t contribute the maximum permitted, or even enough to build up a secure nest egg; the median 401(k) balance for households approaching retirement is only about $60,000, which will barely be enough to flavor the potatoes over an average post-career life span — and that’s among households that have any 401(k) at all (fewer than 70%, according to researchers at Boston College).

Don’t forget that many of today’s seniors cashed in historic gains in asset values before retirement, including their homes and stock portfolios. We haven’t begun to see the full effect of the housing crash and two successive stock market crashes on the wealth profile of newly retiring workers; but we can be sure that it will be ugggggly.

“Since World War II, we’ve never had a cohort that did worse in retirement than the cohort before,” says Teresa Ghilarducci, a retirement expert at the New School for Social Research who participated in the Berkeley meeting. That’s about to change.

The California program is the first gingerly attack on that dismal trend line. De Leon has worked carefully around the possible pitfalls — he’s made several visits to Washington to get the Internal Revenue Service to certify that contributions will be tax-exempt, as are 401(k) contributions. He’s also seeking an agreement from the Labor Department that the plan will be exempt from ERISA, the paperwork-heavy law safeguarding pension plans sponsored by employers. (That’s why California won’t accept employer contributions.) Most experts think the program will get the agency’s green light.

The plan is aimed at low-income workers, the group with the lowest participation rate in 401(k)s and the smallest nest eggs of any kind. The minimum investment guarantee would be set low enough that the pool’s investments could be low-risk and the chances of missing the mark over the course of a career’s contributions would be almost nil. Any residual risk of falling short would be covered by an insurance policy to be purchased by the program’s board, not by the taxpayers. The state’s role would be limited to pooling all the contributions to keep costs down, though every participant would have a claim on his or her individual account.

This won’t make anyone rich. But for many working-class retirees it would be an important supplement to Social Security, which today pays an average retirement stipend of $1,230 a month. It’s the first step toward restoring the retirement security that used to come from defined-benefit pensions, especially for the working class.

“It’s not as good as a good defined-benefit plan,” says Monique Morrissey, an economist at the progressive Economic Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, “but better than what they have now.”

She says government guaranteed programs like California’s are a hot topic in the pension community right now. “Everyone’s trying to figure out something workable.”

Massachusetts is developing a plan to cover employees of small nonprofits, and Oregon and Connecticut are considering their own programs.

Advertisement

De Leon says he’s amazed that his unassuming first step is being hailed in Washington as a breakthrough, even before all the Ts are crossed and the I’s dotted. That speaks volumes about how Congress has ceased even to pretend to care about the American worker.

“When people there tell me I’ve done more to advance this idea than anyone in the nation,” he says, “it’s a little surreal.”

New York City Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez rallies with fired Domino's workers.

Employees of a Washington Heights Domino's claim they were fired from their delivery jobs after complaining to management about unfair wages. Workers at the 181st street chain participated in last Thursday's nationwide walkout in solidarity with the country's underpaid fast food workers, which included strong numbers of workers and supporters in New York City. Following the walkout, delivery workers—who are paid under $6 an hour and rely on tips to make a living wage—were asked to work extended hours inside the restaurant but were not offered increased hourly pay for their time inside the store. After bringing the issue to management's attention, the 24 employees were fired.

In response to last week's strike by fast food workers, Manhattan Domino's Pizza provided a crystal-clear example of why fast food workers are striking and organizing for better wages and working conditions:To recap: Some workers staged a walkout because of inadequate pay. Management's response was to get other workers to work atto keep the store staffed. And when they complained—about something illegal, mind you—they were fired.

Wage theft is very common at New York City fast food outlets, with 84 percent of workers saying they've experienced things like being forced to work off the clock, not being paid overtime, or, as in this case, being made to work at the tipped worker minimum wage while doing work that won't get them any tips. And given how common these forms of lawbreaking are, it's clear that corporate management tacitly condones wage theft.

Sign the petition telling Domino’s Pizza to reinstate the 20 employees they fired."

Marvin Horne of Raisin Valley Farms in Kerman has been breaking the obscure law since 2002 and owes the government 1.2 million pounds of unpaid raisins, which is roughly about the size of his entire harvest for four years, The Washington Post reported.

""I believe in America. And I believe in our Constitution. And I believe that eventually we will be proved right,"" Horne told the newspaper. ""They took our raisins and didn’t pay us for them.""

At the center of the dispute is a law passed by Congress in 1937 aimed at protecting impoverished farmers by controlling supply and demand for dried grapes after the Great Depression.

The law established the Fresno, Calif.-based Raisin Administrative Committee, which is allowed to set prices for raisins by determining how much of the crop will be sold domestically.

The committee is overseen by the Department of Agriculture and is allowed to sell off a portion of raisins it collects from farmers for free, according to The Washington Post. It reportedly generated over $65 million in one recent year.

""The hell with the whole mess,"" Horne told the paper. ""It’s like being a serf.""

Horne handed over part of his crop to the government-controlled raisin ""reserve"" until 2002. He has since embarked on a mission to overturn the specific regulation that he has been defying.

Brian Leighton, the lawyer representing Horne, argued in initial hearing before an administrative officer that the program was ""basically theft"" and violated the Fifth Amendment clause against private property being taken without just compensation, The Post reported.

When Horne's case reached the Supreme Court in June, the justices unanimously ordered a federal appeals court in California to take a new look at claims brought by Horne and his wife, Laura, about the program.

Marvin Horne told The Washington Post that he would likely be liable for about $3 million, including fines and the cash value of raisins, if he loses his case.

""If we lose, we’re bankrupt. We won’t have a pot to piss in,"" Horne told the paper. ""No. I don’t want to even think about it. Would you?""

Additional cost-cutting measures may result in a smaller cut, around 10 percent. Although the cuts are widespread across the government, public defenders say the reductions are hitting them particularly hard. Unlike other federal programs, the public defenders say, they have little fat to trim since most of their costs are for staff and rent. Just 10 percent of their budgets are devoted to expert witnesses, investigative costs and travel.

Already, federal defenders said they have cut back on staff members and their workloads.

Almost all offices have had to furlough or lay off workers. In Virginia, a chief public defender said he had to lay off five lawyers, about 10 percent of his staff. Two other staff members retired to help save the office money, while another voluntarily went on active duty in the military.

In Delaware, public defenders had to take 15-day furloughs. In Illinois, a public defender’s office cut two lawyers and a computer technician.

“We were already defending cases with one hand behind our backs before the sequester,” said Jonathan Hawley, a federal public defender in Peoria, Ill. “Now we will have to operate with both hands behind our back.”

The cuts have made for some hard choices.

Michael S. Nachmanoff, a federal public defender for the Eastern District of Virginia, who has represented Somali pirates and illegal arms and drug dealers, said he faced a difficult decision this year when he had to choose between paying staff members or continuing a case without adequate resources."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/03/ap-stylebook-drops-illegal-immigrants-from-its-manual/,2013-04-03 00:00:00,[],Associated Press under scrutiny for nixing term 'illegal immigrant' from Stylebook,"The Associated Press is being accused of trying to influence the immigration debate following a decision to stop using the term ""illegal immigrant"" in its coverage -- despite the fact it is still being used by U.S. government officials including Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.

The decision comes as a bipartisan group of senators prepares to introduce sweeping immigration legislation which is expected to propose a pathway to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants.

Indeed, the move by the influential wire service is being hailed as a victory by immigrant advocacy groups.

The conservative Media Research Center, though, described the change as a ""politically-correct mumble.""

The new style guideline was first announced this week on the wire service’s blog by Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll, who said the change came out of conversations with people who opposed the term.

“Our goal always is to use the most precise and accurate words so that the meaning is clear to any reader anywhere,” Carroll said.

“The Stylebook no longer sanctions the term ‘illegal immigrant’ or the use of ‘illegal’ to describe a person,” Carroll said. “Instead, it tells users that ‘illegal’ should describe only an action, such as living in or immigrating to a country illegally.”

Still, some are wondering why the AP decided to nix the phrase when high-ranking government officials don’t seem to have a problem with it.

Last week, Napolitano told reporters that she didn’t “really get caught up in the vocabulary wars.”

“They are immigrants who are here illegally, that’s an illegal immigrant,” she said.

Previously, the AP rejected the term “undocumented immigrants,” favored by some activists, as inaccurate.

Changes to the AP Stylebook, which is updated annually, have important and widespread repercussions in the media. The changes don't just influence the AP's writing, which is found in publications around the world. The book is the primary writing style guide for journalists in both print and broadcast.

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, a group of 27 House Democrats, applauded the AP’s decision and called it “a great step forward.”

On a more tongue-in-cheek note, ALIPAC announced Wednesday it would be changing its “style” preference in all future articles to ""illegal invaders"" -- ""in response to the totalitarian steps by the Associated Press to make 'illegal immigrants' disappear with the stroke of a pen just days before legislation attempting to do the same is expected to be filed in Washington, DC, by the 'Gang of 8.'""

Comedian Jay Leno joked that the phrase should be replaced with ""undocumented Democrat.""

The AP said its decision to stop using the term “illegal immigrants” is part of a broader shift away from labeling people and toward labeling behavior -- for example, referring to people “diagnosed with schizophrenia” instead of “schizophrenics.”

In 1986, the AP’s then-stylebook editor Christopher French used the same reasoning to support the wire service’s decision to use “anti-abortion” instead of “pro-life,” and abortion rights instead of “pro-abortion” or “pro-choice.”

“Until a specific rule is agreed upon at AP, the following existing guideline is being applied: Avoid labeling groups or individuals and instead spend an extra sentence on a more specific description,” French said at the time.

In February, it reversed a decision on gay marriage, saying people in same-sex marriages could now be referred to as “husbands” and “wives.”

Several news organizations are also dropping the term “illegal immigrant” from their reporting. CNN, ABC News and NBC News have all parted ways with the phrase in the past few years.

The debate on whether to change the term at The New York Times is still being debated, public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote in an article Tuesday.

“The Times, for the past couple of months, has also been considering changes to its stylebook entry on this term and will probably announce them to staff members this week,” she wrote.

“From what I can gather, The Times’s changes will not be nearly as sweeping as The AP’s,” Sullivan said, adding, “I would be surprised to see The Times ban the use of ‘illegal immigrant,’ as the AP has done.”"

Young'],Chicago marchers urge Obama to come home to address gun violence,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and relatives of victims of fatal shootings in Chicago urged President Barack Obama on Saturday to come back to his hometown and address the gun violence plaguing the city.

Before a march on the city’s South Side, Jackson, a former Democratic presidential candidate, said America’s third most populous city needed more help than Mayor Rahm Emanuel and police superintendent Garry McCarthy could offer.

“When the president shows up, it shows ultimate national seriousness,” said Jackson, a Chicago resident. He also called for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to help patrol the streets of Chicago.

Gun violence in Chicago has been in the national spotlight over the past year, with 506 murders in 2012, an increase of 17 percent from the previous year. As of Thursday, there were 42 homicides and 157 shootings so far this year, according to Chicago police.

The issue received new urgency with the killing this week of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, an honors student who performed with her high school band at Obama’s inauguration on January 21.

News of her death near Obama’s old home in the Kenwood neighborhood came before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee began hearings on gun control on Wednesday. Obama’s spokesman, Jay Carney, has said the Obamas are praying for Pendleton’s family.

Anita Crittenden, who lost a nephew to gun violence last year, said Obama, by coming to Chicago, would “get the leaders to think and step up and make some changes.”

A petition posted on the White House’s “We the People” website calls for Obama and his family to attend Pendleton’s funeral on February 9. The petition must have at least 100,000 signatures to receive an official response from the White House.

Jackson led nearly 150 people on a march from Martin Luther King Jr. College Prep High School, where Pendleton was a student, to the park where she died a few blocks away.

“My greatest fear about the gun violence in Chicago is that we’re adjusting to it,” he said.

Police said Pendleton was shot to death on Tuesday as she and her friends were shielding themselves from rain under a canopy in the park. Police have called it a case of mistaken identity and are offering a $40,000 award for information leading to her killer.

Emanuel announced plans on Thursday to take 200 police officers now serving in administrative positions and deploy them on the streets.

“Hadiya wanted to make a difference in the world,” said Shatira Wilks, a spokeswoman for the family, and cousin of Cleopatra Cowley, Pendleton’s mother. “It’s unfortunate that it would be like this, but we still hope that this can make a difference.”

Not everyone participating in the march agreed that Obama should come home. Matthew McGill said the president should address the violence issue, but need not single out Chicago, “because what you see in Chicago happens in other cities as well.”"

In reality, the chained CPI is a benefit cut for the oldest and most vulnerable Americans who would be least able to afford it.



Cutting benefits by adopting the chained CPI would cut the COLA by 3% for workers retired for ten years and 6% for workers retired for twenty years. This cut targets both current and future retirees. Three years after enactment, this translates to a benefit cut of $130 per year in Social Security benefits for a typical 65 year-old. The cumulative cut for that individual would be $4,631 or more than three months of benefits by age 75. While supporters claim the chained CPI is more accurate; you have to ask yourself, if this chained CPI really is more accurate, then why the need to offer an incremental benefit “bump” to some beneficiaries? The answer is simple. The chained CPI does not accurately measure these groups’ expenses; in fact, it makes most of the same errors as the current formula and adds a few. Adoption of this new formula is really about cutting benefits and raising taxes on average Americans to reduce the deficit. While supporters, including the White House, have attempted to wrap this benefit cut in promises to ‘preserve or protect’ Social Security, the stark truth is it’s actually a direct assault on the safety net millions of middle-class and poor seniors and their families depend on.”

“The current formula, the CPI-W, reflects the expenditures of about 31 percent of households nationally; specifically, wage and clerical households in urban areas. By definition, this population is employed, unlike most retired Social Security beneficiaries. Research has shown that spending patterns differ between the elderly and the general population, especially on health care. Seniors 65 and older spend more than twice as much on health care, and those 75 and older spend nearly three times more than younger consumers. Not only do health care expenditures steadily increase with age but health care costs consistently rise much faster than general inflation. The current price index (CPI-W) does not take these critical differences in the elderly population into consideration. The chained CPI doubles-down on that flaw. Even worse, the proposed chained CPI will cut COLAs immediately for current and future retirees, veterans, the poor and people with disabilities.



For millions of seniors living on fixed incomes and the average $14,000-per-year Social Security benefit, it's frankly unimaginable that some in Washington believe those benefits are too generous. Our nation faces an impending retirement crisis yet rather than address that issue head-on, Washington is instead proposing cuts to the only guaranteed source of income for many retirees, Social Security. It simply makes no sense -- unless your true goal is austerity not accuracy.” Max Richtman, Huffington Post

Draft legislative language released by the House Social Security Subcommittee last night would cut benefits for millions of middle-class and poor Americans still struggling in this economy by adopting a new formula to calculate cost of living adjustments. NCPSSM President, Max Richtman, reacted this way:Seniors won’t be fooled by Orwellian language which attempts to portray austerity as “accuracy”.This chained CPI proposal is just the first of many benefit cutting proposals the House Social Security subcommittee are expected to release in coming weeks. Incredibly, Chairman, Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI) says he wants your feedback. So we say, let’s give it to him. Email Chairman Camp at:

Tell him how losing thousands of dollars in Social Security benefits will hurt you and your family. Tell the House GOP leadership “NO” to the chained CPI.

They're not done exerting more control over womens bodies and one State Senator is promising ""all out hell"" if they proceed.



A Democratic state senator promised ""all out hell"" next week if Republicans stick to their plan to take up a controversial bill restricting abortion for public workers and limiting access to contraception for employees of religious organizations. Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) said Tuesday's session could mirror one in June, when Senate President Mike Ellis (R-Neenah) broke the base of his gavel as he slammed it down to quiet Democrats upset over passing a different abortion bill. Footage of those raucous proceedings was featured in an ad targeting Ellis run by Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin. Republicans who run the Senate are tentatively planning to approve two abortion bills on Tuesday. One would ban any abortions that are sought because of the sex of the fetus. The other would prevent public employees' health plans from covering most abortions, and would also strictly limit the ability of employees of religious organizations to get contraception through their insurance plans.

That's right. If you're a public employee, you won't be able to get an abortion and if you work for a religious organization (like a hospital), no birth control for you.

In case you've forgotten, this is how Republicans rammed through these bills in June with only 1 speaker and no debate:

Yes, Mike Ellis broke his gavel telling Democrats to sit down and shut up. After the ram through, the State Senate, as you can see, quickly adjourned. Democracy doesn't exist for the GOP."

Deprived of a crucial witness, members of Congress from both parties alternately grilled and scolded former Commissioner Douglas Shulman about the Internal Revenue Service’s improper screening of conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status.

Although new details and documents have emerged about how IRS staff scrutinized organizations for political activity, the three hearings on three different days turned up no evidence that the aggressive screening stemmed from partisan motives or was ordered from above, either by the White House or by senior IRS management.

DOCUMENT: Inspector General’s IRS report

The hearings, launched by the release last week of a scathing inspector general’s report, instead have painted a picture of a bungling agency in which top managers in Washington were largely out of touch with how their staff in a Cincinnati field office was handling applications for tax exemptions.

Many questions have not been answered, including how the improper screening started, why it continued on and off for two years, and why top IRS officials did not reveal it for more than a year despite pointed questions from Congress and loud complaints from the targeted conservative groups.

Lerner, who still supervises the IRS staff that handles those applications, and Shulman appeared Wednesday before the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, but provided little illumination.

Lerner, who revealed the inappropriate targeting two weeks ago, read a statement saying she did nothing wrong, then invoked her 5th Amendment right to not answer questions. “Because I’m asserting my right not to testify, I know that some people will assume that I’ve done something wrong. I have not,” she said.

Her decision did not sit well with Republicans angered that conservative groups, including local tea party organizations, faced intrusive questions and long delays when they applied for nonprofit status.

“Ms. Lerner has invoked her constitutional rights not to answer our questions about her involvement or the IRS’ involvement, ironically, about denying others their constitutional rights,” Rep. Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio) said.

Lerner, noting that the Department of Justice had launched a criminal investigation, said her lawyer advised her not to testify. It is relatively rare for witnesses to invoke the 5th Amendment. In April 2012, a federal official refused to answer questions about a lavish conference in Las Vegas. And a year earlier, executives of Solyndra invoked the right during a congressional probe of federal grants to their failed solar-energy firm.

The oversight committee chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), excused Lerner, but said he may ask her to appear again, on the grounds that she may have waived her rights by first offering a defense of her actions.

Legal experts were divided on the question. Stanley Brand, former general counsel to the U.S. House, said other witnesses have made introductory statements before invoking the 5th. But Paul Rothstein, a professor of judicial process at Georgetown University Law Center, said Lerner is on “pretty thin ice” because her remarks touched on the subject of the hearing.

The IRS did not respond to questions about Lerner.

“It’s important to find the facts before you hold people accountable,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday when asked why Lerner was still at the IRS.

The new acting commissioner, Daniel Werfel, started Wednesday. President Obama asked him to report back in 30 days on what action he had taken to hold accountable staff who acted inappropriately. “There is a commitment here to get to the bottom of what happened,” Carney said.

Also testifying Wednesday was the first Obama administration official, Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal S. Wolin. He said he learned an inspector general’s audit was underway in 2012, but did not learn any details from J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration. “I told him that he should follow the facts where they lead. I told him that our job is to stay out of the way and let him do his work,” he said.

Republicans and Democrats on the oversight committee, without Lerner to question, focused most of their attention on Shulman, who ran the IRS for five years before leaving in November 2012.

Shulman, who also testified on Tuesday, again said that he never knew much about what his staff was doing to look for political activity in organizations seeking tax exemptions. He said he didn’t take action when he learned about it in early 2012 since he was told the problem had ended.

“People in your own internal operation knew,” Issa told Shulman. “If you didn’t know, you were derelict in your duty, or your management style was such that you didn’t get informed. Either way, that is certainly not something you should be proud of.”

Shulman repeatedly parried questions about why he didn’t do more. “At the time I learned about this list I felt I was taking the appropriate actions and I felt my course was the right one, and I still feel that way today,” he said.

Many of the exchanges were testy. Some Republicans, trying to build a trail to the White House, asked Shulman what he talked about during his frequent visits to the executive mansion.

One, he pointedly noted, was “the Easter Egg roll with [his] kids.” But he said he steered clear of the subject: “It would not have been appropriate to have a conversation with anyone at the White House about the subject of discriminating against conservative groups in any part of our operations.”

Advertisement

The oversight committee staff has begun questioning IRS officials who were directly involved with supervising screeners and obtaining emails from the staff in Cincinnati who dealt with the issue.

One of those officials, Holly Paz, an attorney who worked under Lerner in Washington, said she first uncovered the improper screening in June 2011. She said the employees in Cincinnati didn’t realize that using terms such as “tea party” to single out applications crossed the line.

Advertisement

“They were not even aware of, you know, politics,” she said, according to committee staff. “Being outside of Washington, it was not something that they followed or had interest in.”

Many of the groups were sent letters with intrusive requests for information, such as lists of donors and details of their conversations at their events. Paz told the staff that no IRS managers looked at those letters before they went out, a practice that has since been changed.

Oxon Hill, Maryland (CNN) - Sarah Palin, igniting a crowd of conservatives, says it's time to stop ""preaching to the choir"" and instead evangelize a grass-roots, anti-Washington message to all Americans, even those who disagree with the right.

""They're not our enemies. They're our sisters and our brothers. They're our neighbors, they're our friends. It's imperative to reach out and to share that conservative message of liberty and less government and lower taxes,"" the former Alaska governor said, urging growth of the movement.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

Saturday marked Palin's second time to address the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. With the gathering serving as a time for introspection among the Republican Party, Palin bucked party leadership and said only real reform can come from the bottom up.

""We're not here to re-brand a party, we're here to rebuild a country,"" she said. ""We're here to restore America and the rest is just theatrics. The rest is sound and fury. It's just making noise.""

Palin's comments come two days before the Republican National Committee is scheduled to unveil its conclusions from a months-long ""autopsy"" of the party, following its big election losses in November.

Walking out to Shania Twain's ""She's Not Just a Pretty Face,"" the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee easily got the crowd on their feet. Her speech was rife with her folksy tough talk and snipes at President Obama. And of course, no Palin speech is complete without references to her hunting and outdoors life in Alaska.

Take, for example, an anecdote about her husband buying her a rifle rack for Christmas, while she bought him a gun.

""This go-around, he's got the rifle, I've got the rack,"" she said.

She spurred another wave of cheers and applause while pausing to take a sip from a Big Gulp, a not-so-veiled swipe at New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's push against large sugary drinks. ""We're cool. Shoot, it's just pop with low calorie ice cubes in it. I hope that's OK.""

Not known for pulling her punches, Palin also took the opportunity to blast the president and Senate Democrats for failing to get a budget passed in four years.

""Barack Obama promised the most transparent administration ever,"" she said. ""You lied.""

The president, she said, has turned from ""no drama Obama"" to ""all drama Obama"" in a city that she said operates like a reality television show. She also dinged the president's support for background check legislation.

""And background checks, yeah, I guess to learn more about a person's thinking and associations and intentions? More background checks?"" she said. ""Dandy idea, Mr. President. Should have started with yours.""

But Palin's most forceful criticism was directed against GOP leaders in Washington.

She chided establishment attempts to shape the last election, especially in congressional races. While she didn't say his name, Palin seemed to take aim at Karl Rove, the former top political adviser to George W. Bush who was dubbed the ""architect"" of the former president's campaigns.

""If these experts who keep losing elections and keep getting rehired and raking in millions, if they feel that strongly about who gets to run in this party, then they should buck up or stay in the truck,"" she said. ""The architects can head on back.""

Rove's groups, American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, spent millions in Senate races but had little success in getting their supported candidates elected. They're now facing push-back from tea party conservatives for starting a new group aimed to help electable candidates sail through Republican primaries.

Critics say the new move is simply a way to push out conservative voices. For her part, Palin was active in backing the more conservative candidate in several Republican primaries last year. Many of her preferred candidates went on to win, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska.

With 20 months until the 2014 mid-terms, Palin said Washington should not be in the game of hand-picking candidate. She urged the audience to change the ""top-down political process"" and create their own search for the next best crop of contenders.

""Now is the time to furlough the consultants, tune out the pollsters, send the focus groups home, and toss the political scripts, because if we truly know what we believe we don't need professionals to tell us,"" she said, adding one final message to Washington.

""Get over yourself,"" she said. ""It's not about you."""

A Lake County Judge has ruled Indiana's Right-To-Work Law Unconstitutional.

This is unbelievably huge news and a victory for Labor.

Judge John Sedia ruled the law unconstitutional last week because the state constitution calls for just compensation for services, according to an order. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed in February 2013 on behalf of members of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150 AFL-CIO, who argued the law violated the constitution.

Here's the legal conflict: The so-called ""right to work"" law makes it a criminal offense for unions to receive compensation for services federal law requires them to provide to workers even if they are not dues paying members.

HOWEVER, the Indiana Constitution mandates that no one's services can be demanded without just compensation.

The Indiana Attorney General's office has said they will appeal directly to the Indiana Supreme Court, calling the judgement incorrect because Judge Sedia dismissed four other counts in the suit.

Here is a .pdf copy of the 7-page decision for your perusal.

All eyes are now on the Indiana Supreme Court. If successful, this could mean the first step in tearing down the ""right to work"" laws all over the country."
http://news.yahoo.com/don-t-hem-him-in---liberal--can-t-define-the-obama-presidency--154423941.html,,[],Don't hem him in: 'Liberal' can't define the Obama presidency,"By Walter Shapiro



Is Barack Obama a liberal?



That question might have aroused spirited debate, especially among Democrats, during the president’s vague-is-in-vogue re-election campaign. But since the polls closed on Nov. 6, President Obama has undeniably positioned himself to the left of Candidate Obama.



Amid the national grieving over the Sandy Hook shootings, Obama suddenly found the gumption to stare down the NRA and put gun control back on the national agenda. His inaugural address will be remembered for the stirring endorsement of gay rights and the sudden rediscovery of climate change. Then before the inaugural glow wore off, the Pentagon announced that it would drop its ban on women in combat. And immigration reform—another explosive topic—is likely to receive a star turn in the upcoming State of the Union address.



But before we dust off right-wing commentator Dinesh D’Souza’s absurd claim that Obama is really a Kenyan socialist, let’s look more closely at the president’s sudden liberal fervor.



Make no mistake, Obama is indeed a transformational 21st-century leader when it comes to any issue that touches on individual rights and equality. He reflects the end of the white-bread politics that elected both Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan to two terms. Rather than defying the demographic and attitudinal shifts that produced the America of 2013, Obama embodies them.



Some of his liberal statements and actions are undoubtedly payback to the electoral coalition that gave the president a second term despite the stagnant economy. When the first wave of Obama White House memoirs are published, it will be fascinating to read about the internal debates over the gay-rights portion of the inaugural address. But maybe, in reality, there was little dissent. Maybe Obama and his top advisers simply understood that it was time.



Any discussion of Obama’s newly expressed passion for gun control has to begin with the fact that this Chicago-shaped politician is our first urban president since John Kennedy. Unlike, say, Bill Clinton, Obama never came from a place where guns are equated with hunting rather than violent shootouts. Remember, during the 2008 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, Obama in a private fundraiser derided rural voters who “cling to guns or religion.”



When it comes to regulating guns, political geography matters. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg may be the nation’s most zealous proponent of gun control, but it is hard to describe this billionaire plutocrat, who endorsed George W. Bush for president in 2004, as a dangerous left-winger.



Immigration reform is another issue with a bipartisan pedigree. The plan that Obama is likely to highlight in his State of the Union address will bear a close resemblance to the legislation that John McCain and Ted Kennedy introduced in 2005 with the blessing of George W. Bush and Karl Rove. It is hard to describe the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has consistently backed immigration reform, as a hotbed of left-wingers.



Painting an ideological portrait of any incumbent president is tricky since the subject keeps moving rather than holding a fixed position. All presidencies are filled with contradictions: Ronald Reagan raised taxes; Bush dramatically expanded the social safety net by adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare; and Obama, for a while, dramatically increased troop levels in Afghanistan.



Even now, there is a zigzag quality to Obama’s foreign policy. In his inaugural address, the president declared, “A decade of war is now ending.” But not the vastly expanded drone attacks, which have become Obama’s favored way of battling terrorists. To the consternation of liberals, Obama has refused to make public the legal justification for this airborne war conducted by robots.



The president’s economic orientation can be equally confounding. In an interview after the election, Obama claimed, “My policies are so mainstream that if I had set the same policies that I had back in the 1980s, I would be considered a moderate Republican.” Of course, this contention is self-servingly hyperbolic. But Obama’s words do underscore how the political pendulum on economic issues (but decidedly not on social issues) has moved to the right in the past three decades.



How liberal is a president who signed the “fiscal cliff” legislation that made permanent the Bush tax cuts for roughly 99 percent of Americans? How liberal is a president who at various points in his budget negotiations with the Republicans has toyed with raising the eligibility age for Medicare and cutting back the inflation adjustment for Social Security? How liberal is a president who allowed the Wall Street masterminds behind the economic collapse to go unpunished for their flagrant misdeeds?



Even the big-government complexity of Obamacare was created in large measure because the president refused to endorse the liberal cause of a single-payer system like Medicare. And while not beating the drums for the president’s claim to be a moderate Republican, didn’t a Massachusetts governor named Mitt Romney enact an analogous health-care plan?



The point is that an inaugural address and a few post-election gestures do not, by themselves, define who Obama is as a political leader. So far the liberalism of Obama in the personal sphere has been tempered by the centrism of Obama in the economic and foreign-policy realm.



This ideological blurriness comes with the keys to the Oval Office. To steal a line from Walt Whitman, Obama can rightly say, “I am large, I contain multitudes.”"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/22/Groups-Tied-To-Catholic-Bishops-Immigration-Activists-At-Odds-With-Catholic-Teachings,2013-08-22 00:00:00,['Dr. Susan Berry'],Groups Tied to Catholic Bishops Immigration Activists at Odds with Catholic Teachings,"The massive, coordinated initiative by the Catholic Church to push for comprehensive immigration reform is being run by a group that has the support of the most far-left corners of the Church who often seem to be at odds with actual Catholic doctrinal teachings.

As Breitbart News’ Mike Flynn wrote Thursday, Kevin Appleby, Director of Migration Policy for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) is coordinating the Church’s initiative to apply political pressure to Congress to pass an immigration reform law that will include a pathway to citizenship.

According to its USCCB website, Migration and Refugee Services (MRS) “is charged with assisting the bishops in the development and promotion of migration policy positions within the context of the Church’s social teaching:”

MRS works with grassroots Catholic networks across the US to promote fair immigration and refugee policies, advocates for the passage of comprehensive immigration reform, engages in the fight against human trafficking, develops initiatives aimed at educating Catholics on the Church’s teaching on migration, and assists the U.S. Catholic bishops in carrying the voice of the Church to Congress and the Administration.

Among the coalitions with which MRS/USCCB is closely aligned is the Justice for Immigrants Campaign which is the “boots on the ground” group that is “designed to unite and mobilize a growing network of Catholic institutions, individuals, and other persons of good will in support of a broad legalization program and comprehensive immigration reform.”

Even though support of amnesty is not a doctrinal matter for the Catholic Church, Justice for Immigrants has been so successful in its media campaign that it has positioned even the most conservative Catholic bishops, who have rebuked the Democrat-led federal government on Catholic doctrinal matters, such as abortion and marriage, to place their trust in essentially the same politicians in the area of comprehensive immigration reform and amnesty.

Even Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who heads the USCCB, publicly criticized Republicans during an MSNBC interview in May of 2012.

“You need to get your house in order when it comes to immigration,” Dolan said to the GOP. “You have the reputation of being fairly tough on immigrants…you’d better come up with a much saner, more civil, more just immigration policy.”

However, some of the founding member organizations of Justice for Immigrants are groups whose actions have not been aligned with Catholic doctrinal teachings, such as those on abortion and marriage.

Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) has been under scrutiny for several years for its ties to pro-abortion leaders.

A Planned Parenthood lobbyist, Alisa LaPolt Snow, recently drew national condemnation when she told Florida state representatives that, if a baby is born alive during a botched abortion, the decision about whether to save its life “should be left up to the woman, her family, and the physician.”

LaPolt Snow’s biography, however, indicated that she served “on the board of Catholic Charities of Northwest Florida – Tallahassee.”





In July of 2011, CCUSA also confirmed to LifeSiteNews that it had hired the firm of gay lobbyist Tom Sheridan, the Sheridan Group, to work on its behalf.

Earlier that year, Catholic Charities of San Francisco had invited a number of pro-abortion lawmakers to its annual Loaves and Fishes fundraiser, including several with 100 percent pro-abortion voting records with NARAL. In addition, it had been previously discovered that the director of programs of San Francisco Catholic Charities had adopted children with his gay partner and was publicly supported by the charity’s leaders.

According to LifeSiteNews, Sister Jeannine Gramick, founder of New Ways Ministry, a dissident group, said, “Catholic Charities in general have been the most progressive wing of the church other than the nuns.”

CCUSA also pressed the Catholic faithful to support passage of ObamaCare “immediately,” even though the law lacked a provision that excluded funding of abortion.

Pope Benedict XVI had issued an apostolic letter last December that directed Caritas Internationalis, the umbrella group that represents CCUSA and Catholic Relief Services, to cease practices that are inconsistent with Church teaching. The former pope warned diocesan bishops and parish priests about the increase in charitable services to the poor becoming integrated with practices that are inconsistent with Church doctrine.

Catholic Relief Services (CRS), a Justice for Immigrants member organization, has also been at the center of a scandal this year regarding the funding of organizations that promote abortion and birth control. According to LifeSiteNews, CRS has denied any direct involvement in either funding or the distribution of items related to abortion or contraception.

Last week, LifeSiteNews reported, however, that CRS is a dues-paying member and on the board of directors of MEDiCAM, an organization that has supported the individual training of abortion providers, and CORE Group, which has devoted half of its total budget to “family planning.”

CRS reportedly admitted this fact, and responded, “We acknowledge our differences, air our disagreements on these issues, and contribute our Catholic voice to the conversation.”

Similarly, in July, CRS reportedly gave $2.7 million to a population control organization that uses its work to distribute anti-malaria drugs and mosquito nets as a means of spreading its population control programs.

The Catholic Health Association (CHA), also a founding member of Justice for Immigrants, last month announced that it would accept the White House’s “accommodation” for religious employers that opposed the HHS contraception and abortifacients mandate, even though the bishops said the final rule failed to resolve several key concerns for them.

Sister Carol Keehan, president and CEO of CHA had also supported the passage of ObamaCare, even after the USCCB withdrew its backing because of concerns about whether the health reform law would be used to subsidize abortions.

Though not specifically mentioned as a “member organization” of Justice for Immigrants, the Nuns on the Bus, a group of Catholic nuns that espouses liberal social policies, held a national bus tour for comprehensive immigration reform this summer.

Last year, the Nuns spoke out against Congressman Paul Ryan’s budget proposal which, they said, favored wealthy Americans at the expense of the poor. Following that tour, Sister Simone Campbell, leader of the Nuns, appeared on “The Colbert Report” and was a prime-time speaker at the Democrat National Convention, despite the fact that the DNC openly promoted abortion and same-sex marriage.

Given the backing of many well-known “Catholic” organizations, the Church’s political advocacy for immigration is significant. As Breitbart News’ Flynn noted, the “support of amnesty seems broader and more coordinated than its actions against an ObamaCare mandate requiring coverage of contraception. In recent years, the Church has been more vocal in its criticism of abortion, but even that seems muted in comparison with current plans on immigration reform.”"

Ground is %22fertile%22 for immigration revisions when Congress returns in 2014

Republicans have said immigration legislation is a priority in the new year

However%2C some Republicans in the House still opposed to amnesty

WASHINGTON — If the Senate manages to pass a long-term budget deal Tuesday, the next item on the agenda for Congress could be even harder: immigration.

Republican leaders, led by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, have deemed immigration legislation a priority in the new year. The Senate is expected to pass Tuesday a bipartisan budget deal for the next two years that would clear the legislative calendar and eliminate the threat of a government shutdown in January. And even Bob Dane, whose Federation for American Immigration Reform strongly opposes a bill, concedes that at this point, ""the ground is very fertile"" for an immigration bill.

""It's going to happen,"" Vice President Biden said during a webinar last week.

However, whether that momentum leads to a sweeping rewrite of the nation's immigration laws could have more to do with the 2014 elections than current conditions.

The biggest roadblock to legislation has been, and will continue to be, Republicans in the House who oppose a deal similar to that passed by the Senate allowing the nation's 12 million undocumented immigrants to apply for U.S. citizenship. Dane says an already-fractured GOP must stand firm in opposition if it wants to have any success come election day.

""Opposing amnesty next year is probably the last hope for the GOP to save itself from losing a core group of its voters,"" Dane said.

Despite their public support of immigration revisions, Republican House leaders accomplished little in 2013.

The Senate passed its comprehensive rewrite of the nation's immigration laws in June, including $46 billion in border security and an overhaul of the legal immigration system to bring in more high-tech and low-skilled workers.

House committees have approved five bills that focus on immigration enforcement and expanding the legal immigration system to bring in more foreign workers. But the last of those bills was approved in June; none of them have been brought to the House floor. No Republicans have introduced a bill that deals with the undocumented population.

Some House Republicans are pushing their colleagues to get those bills moving.

Reps. David Valadao, R-Calif., and Jeff Denham, R-Calif., have been pressing Republicans to sign onto a letter they hope to present to Boehner in January supporting action on immigration legislation.

Denham would not specify how many signatures they've garnered so far, but he said there is a surprising level of interest among his GOP colleagues.

""We've been getting a good percentage of our conference signing on,"" he said.

Denham said they'd have even more signatories, but some supportive Republicans are reluctant out of fear of primary season. Conservative groups have made clear that they will support more conservative GOP candidates against lawmakers who back the Senate bill, so adding their name to the letter could lead to easy attack ads.

""It puts a target on their back,"" Denham said.

Some also see Boehner's repudiation of outside conservative groups as his chamber passed the budget deal last week as evidence that he might be willing to push an immigration bill that isn't supported by the Tea Party wing of his party.

""It shows that Boehner wants to get things done and he's not going to be held hostage by the extreme right,"" said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a group that supports the Senate bill and has spent the past year encouraging rank-and-file Republicans to embrace it. ""You win the conference, you win leadership, and we're getting closer and closer to winning the conference.""

In the meantime, immigration advocates have turned up the pressure on Republicans in the House.

Supporters completed a weeks-long fast for immigration changes on Friday, with several members of Congress joining for 24-hour, water-only fasts. But the tactics of immigration supporters have grown more and more confrontational.

Young undocumented immigrants interrupted Boehner while he was having breakfast several weeks ago, they've staked out the home of Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., and have held nearly constant protests outside Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy's office in California.

Last week, immigration supporters held sit-ins in the congressional offices of two-dozen representatives.

Those moves irked some in Congress. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., has been pushing for new immigration laws for years and said protests aimed at so many members of Congress – including himself and other supporters – are ""not exactly contributing to get this done.""

But others, like Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said he's not surprised by their impatience and expects it to continue when Congress returns to Washington in January.

""They're angry, they're disillusioned, they're hurt, so you shouldn't expect them to come bringing flowers and roses,"" Gutierrez said. ""You should expect them to come here angry."""

After the boos erupted, a contingent of Obama supporters countered with cheers.

Obama also golfed on Saturday for the first time since the sequester cuts went into effect at the beginning of March and then took some of his foursome–and his Secret Service detail–to watch Syracuse oust Marquette and secure a trip to the Final Four.

One would have expected a friendlier crowd for the President, but there are still several possible explanations for the boos. Obama and his White House team had supported Georgetown (Syracuse’s rival) in the past, and the President had forecast Indiana (who was eliminated by Syracuse) to win the East Regional and go on to win the national title, for example. Or, perhaps they booed because POTUS had gone to the game with Secret Service agents while the White House remains closed to tours.

The Obama administration canceled the popular White House tours citing Secret Service costs. Throughout the week, Obama has been scrutinized because of Secret Service expenditures for the First Daughters’ vacations to the Bahamas and Sun Valley, Idaho.

But, of course, there is an important difference between the First Daughter and other students. When Malia Obama takes a trip, the American taxpayers get stuck with a hefty bill. How hefty? That’s what we’ve been trying to find out.

As you know, JW has kept close watch on the First Family’s extravagant personal trips for the American people, since we’re the ones footing the bill. And last week we released records detailing the government funds expended on Malia’s March 2012 Spring Break vacation to Mexico. According to the records, obtained from the U.S. Secret Service as a result of a Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed on September 20, 2012, the total cost of the trip amounted to $115,500.87.

The following is a breakdown of the costs as detailed in the documents, which are available in full here:

Ground transportation: $23,964.81

Lodging: $21,682.92

Airfare: $47,767.34

“Vouchers”: $21,636.14 (not itemized)

Support Charges: $449.66 (travel for one from Mexico City to Oaxaca, not itemized)

Malia Obama’s Spring Break trip evoked a significant amount of controversy after the Obama White House reportedly ordered the removal of press reports detailing the trip.

On March 19, 2012, numerous online press outlets reported on Malia Obama’s Mexico trip, noting the fact that she was accompanied by 25 U.S. Secret Service Agents and as many as 12 of her friends. However, shortly after the press reports surfaced, they were quickly removed from the Internet.

As reported by Politico:

The AFP, the Huffington Post and other websites have scrubbed a report about first daughter Malia Obama’s school trip. On Monday, the AFP reported that Obama’s daughter was on a school trip along with a number of friends and 25 Secret Service agents. The story was picked up by Yahoo, the Huffington Post, and the International Business Times, as well as UK publications like the Daily Mail and the Telegraph and other overseas publications like The Australian. But on Monday night, the story had been removed from those sites.

In an update to this story, Politico published a statement issued by Kristina Schake, Communications Director to the First Lady, indicating that the removal of these news stories was “a White House effort:”

“From the beginning of the administration, the White House has asked news outlets not to report on or photograph the Obama children when they are not with their parents and there is no vital news interest. We have reminded outlets of this request in order to protect the privacy and security of these girls.”

The trip reportedly took place shortly after the Texas Department of Public Safety issued a statement advising students on Spring Break “to avoid Mexico.”

I think we can all agree that in these economic times, with huge public debt and high unemployment, spending $115,000 in taxpayer funds on a Spring Break trip to Mexico is inappropriate. Is this what Americans are being asked to pay higher taxes for?

This is far from the first time the Obamas have taken advantage of the American taxpayer to enjoy expensive vacations.

We previously obtained records from the United States Air Force and the United States Secret Service detailing Michelle Obama’s February 2012 President’s Day weekend ski vacation to Aspen, Colorado, with her two daughters. The records indicate U.S. Secret Service costs, including accommodations at the Fasching Haus deluxe condominium and the Inn at Aspen, were $48,950.38.

Judicial Watch also obtained documents from the United States Air Force and the United States Secret Service detailing costs associated with Michelle Obama’s controversial August 2010 vacation to Spain. According to a Judicial Watch analysis, the records indicate a total combined cost of at least $467,585.

Judicial Watch also obtained documents detailing costs of a June 21-27, 2011, trip taken by Michelle Obama, her family and her staff to South Africa and Botswana. Judicial Watch received mission expense records and passenger manifests for the Africa trip that described costs of $424,142 for the flight and crew alone. Other expenses, such as off-flight food, transportation, security, etc. were not included.

That’s a total of four trips at a cost of almost $1 million. And these are the trips we know about.

Rest assured, JW will continue to monitor these First Family excursions in a second Obama term. I suspect they will continue."

(CNN) —

One of the most perverse results of the IRS’s lame, overzealous – and possibly criminal – behavior in looking into the tax-exempt applications of assorted advocacy groups is this: They’re a lot safer from scrutiny today than they were yesterday.

After this IRS mess, who in government is going to be in a rush to take on – or try to regulate – the groups they should actually be looking at as political operations, overt or covert? Um, not many.

Here’s the real deal: It’s an open secret in Washington that some of these groups, which spent huge amounts of money during presidential campaigns, are politically aligned. Whatever their “labels,” as the IRS might call them, they have been tax-exempt because they claim to be dealing with issues rather than elections. That is, policy, not political candidates. But in the heat of a general election, when policy is politics, how can anyone tell the difference?

CNN Gloria Borger

Priorities USA is a Democratic brand; Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS isn’t likely to do anything other than help the GOP. To gain their tax-exempt status, they’re supposed to promote the “social welfare.” What, exactly, does that mean?

It’s a complicated question that has become infinitely more complex in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, which allowed corporations to start donating directly to activist groups. Suddenly, the potential of getting some dibs on their considerable money grew larger. The groups designated as 501(c)(4) became the perfect pots to hold the dough, and they swelled, literally and figuratively. And the IRS didn’t do much about it.

It might have been a better idea, rather than embarking on what seems like a potentially criminal political fishing expedition, to actually take a look at the huge amounts of money being spent out in the open during the last campaign.

Why wasn’t the IRS “scrutinizing the big fish,” asks Paul Ryan, the chief lawyer for the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group that has pushed (unsuccessfully) for the IRS to investigate these groups. “The IRS needs to be focused on the big fish and not on the little Mom and Pop tea party groups, and certainly not based on their political ideology.”

Ah, but that’s exactly what happened – and, as a result, these groups that, according to some estimates, collectively spent over $250 million on candidates during the last election are still tax-exempt. Can it be that the IRS investigators were so silly, clueless and unaware of their appropriate role? Alas, yes.

But the legal eagles reading and interpreting the IRS laws are obviously a lot smarter. In its description of the 501(c)(4) category, the IRS lays it out pretty plainly. “Examples” of organizations under this statute that would be considered tax-exempt, it says, are “civic associations and volunteer fire companies.” Hmmm. Not exactly political in any way, shape or form. What’s more, the IRS also makes it clear that, in order to qualify, the burden is to prove that “your organization is organized exclusively (italics mine) to promote social welfare.”

But according to Ryan, the gremlins (i.e. the lawyers) have managed to figure out a way to get around this. The new “perceived line,” he explains, is that all these groups need to do is spend less than half of their money on politics. He calls it the “tax lawyer community interpretation.” Huh? Is that how we’re running the government?

So if these groups spend less than half of their money on politically related activism, the dough they collect from big corporations and donors can be used for campaign activities, all without disclosure of where the money came from.

This has not escaped the notice of Congress, especially Democrats who have been outgunned by Republican-leaning groups.

“We urge you to protect legitimate section 501(c)(4) entities by preventing non-conforming organizations that are focused on federal election activities from abusing the tax code,” seven Democratic U.S. senators wrote then-IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman last year.

What makes sense is for the IRS to make sure that its laws are followed. Citizens can at least expect that their government might know the difference between quashing political dissent and legitimate inquiry. Fishing expeditions on political-sounding names is just stupid, if not venal.

And now, the obvious – and perverse – consequence of the IRS bungling: It has just made the world safer for tax lawyers. Your taxpayer dollars at work.

Well, Mr. President, look in the mirror for the faults in yourself that you attributed to Mr. Romney. According to the online Urban Dictionary, “Obamanesia” is, “A questionable commander in chief's partial or total loss of memory regarding the actual sequences of events in an attempt to not take responsibility for them. It is the opposite of Truman's famous phrase: ‘The Buck Stops Here!’ It is a strategy in politics where the one in power attempts to attribute to another person or group the responsibility for one's own lack of leadership or mistakes. Made famous by Barack Hussein Obama's denial of certain emails regarding the Libya incident 2012; after being caught with his pants down, he later tried to pin it on Hillary Clinton.”

A partial list of the president’s acts of “Obamanesia” include:

ObamaCare. The President’s mother of all health care reforms has turned into the mulligan of all health care reforms. Worrying that ObamaCare will hurt Democrats in the 2014 elections, the President keeps amending and delaying it, ignoring his constitutional obligation to fully implement and enforce a law he already signed.

The more we learn about ObamaCare from sources, including the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the more we learn how it will damage job creation (especially full-time jobs) and business growth, cost way more than advertised, grant special exemptions (e.g. to Congress), deny us the choices we were promised to keep our health care plans and doctors, raise taxes, increase our wait time for medical treatments while eroding the quality of care, and cause doctors and hospitals to cut back, or eliminate, services.

[pullquote]

In a recent Fox News poll of American voters, 57 percent said the way ObamaCare is being rolled out is “a joke,” 63 percent said the law needs to be changed, 71 percent believed ObamaCare will increase their taxes, 62 percent believe it will increase the cost of their premiums and 65 percent believe implementing the law will add to the federal deficit. Gallup and Rasmussen Reports polls show similar negativity by American voters concerning ObamaCare’s future impact on their families and the country.

But in his August 17 radio address, the President continued to blame Republicans regarding ObamaCare, rather than accept personal responsibility for the law’s flaws. He said, “A lot of Republicans seem to believe that if they can gum up the works and make this law fail, they’ll somehow be sticking it to me. But they’d just be sticking it to you.”

(Mis)handling of the economy. In a recent Gallup poll of American adults, just 35 percent give the President thumbs up on his leadership regarding the economy. On Townhall.com, columnist Katie Pavlich writes, “While Obama claims America is ‘back,’ 50 million people are on food stamps and 23 million people are unemployed. After claiming the country was on the right track economically, Obama proceeded to blame Republicans for ‘distractions’ and ‘phony’ scandals coming out of Washington.”

Lack of candor on a range of matters. In an ABC/Washington Post poll (in English and Spanish) of American adults, “. . . a vast 74-20 percent see the IRS’ behavior (targeting conservatives) as inappropriate, with most feeling that way strongly -- and 56 percent see it as a deliberate attempt to harass conservative organizations, not a mere administrative error.” The poll also found that “. . . on the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, last fall, suspicions of a coverup rise to a majority, 55 percent. And in this case, only a third of Americans are persuaded that the Obama administration is disclosing honestly what it knows about what occurred.”

Another poll discovery: “Americans by 54-38 percent say they think the government is doing more to threaten the rights of average Americans than to protect those rights. Americans by 69-29 percent in this poll say they’re concerned that in trying to protect classified information the federal government will improperly intrude on the freedom of the press.”

When the President claims that criticisms of him and his policies are partisan and bogus, his attitude can be summed up by another Urban Dictionary definition: of “fuhgeddaboudit.”

1. Forget about it -- the issue is not worth the time, energy, mental effort, or emotional resources.

2. Definitively ""no.""

3. The subject is unequivocally excellent; further thought and analysis are unnecessary.

Is a president with “Obamanesia” who says “fuhgeddaboudit” serving the best interests of the country? Polls indicate no."

USA TODAY

White House spokesman says aim of whatever actions the U.S. takes will be limited.

Obama has long called for Assad to step down%2C but response options %22are not about regime change.%22

Intelligence report on last week%27s chemical attack may be released this week.

WASHINGTON — As President Obama weighs with his national security team how he will respond to Syria's suspected use of chemical weapons, his chief spokesman said Tuesday that the actions Obama is contemplating won't lead to the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad.

The White House continued to publicly maintain Tuesday that Obama has made no decision on the nature of his response to the Assad regime, even as lawmakers and government officials warned that a limited military strike against Syria is imminent.

At the same time, the White House sought to make clear that whatever Obama decides, the aim of his actions will be limited.

Obama has long called for the ouster of Assad and his administration has demanded accountability in the aftermath of last week's chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus. But White House spokesman Jay Carney stated plainly that Obama is not considering using American military might to oust Assad.

""I want to make clear that the options that we are considering are not about regime change,"" Carney said while reiterating that Obama continues to believe the 2½-year conflict must end with Assad out of power. ""They are about responding to a clear violation of international standard that prohibits the use of chemical weapons.""

Pressed by reporters on why Obama has ruled out using U.S. action to topple Assad, Carney responded, ""It is not our policy position to respond to this through regime change. We will take an appropriate response, and the president and his team are evaluating the options to them. And the president will make an assessment and an announcement in due time.""

Meanwhile, Carney said that an intelligence report detailing what the administration knows about last week's chemical attack would likely be released this week. The report could provide Obama with the legal and moral evidence to carry out a strike without seeking approval from United Nations or Congress.

Carney sidestepped questions on whether Obama felt there was a need to seek backing from the U.N. before carrying out its response to Syria. At the same time, Carney stressed that ""there isn't any doubt"" that chemical weapons were use on a ""significant scale"" establishing Syria's transgression

""Broadly speaking, I think it's important to note that it's in the clear national security interests of the United States that the use and proliferation of chemical weapons on this scale not go unanswered,"" Carney said.

Obama and Vice President Biden continued to reach out to allies Tuesday to discuss the situation in Syria. The president spoke by phone with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper while Biden called Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to discuss the situation.

Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke with his counterparts in Great Britain and France — two close allies who have called for intervention in Syria — to discuss the recent chemical weapons attack, raising speculation that a military strike against the Assad regime is imminent."

USA TODAY

IRS sorted tax-exempt applications based on names of group%2C not actual political activity

WASHINGTON -- An inspector general report into the Internal Revenue Service's heightened scrutiny of Tea Party groups blames ""ineffective management"" at the agency, but does not address whether the policy was politically motivated.

The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration's report, released Tuesday, was an audit -- not an investigative report. It made recommendations about how tax-exempt applications should be processed in the future. It did not blame specific employees or suggest disciplinary action.

The report found the IRS office in Cincinnati, which processes all applications for tax-exempt status, singled out ""Tea Party,"" ""Patriot"" and ""9/12"" groups based solely on their names. The applications were singled out for further review of whether they were involved in political campaign activity. The groups were applying for tax exempt status reserved for groups that conduct ""social welfare"" activities as the bulk of their work.

The IRS's special treatment of Tea Party applications led to long processing delays, the inspector general said. For 13 months beginning in October 2010, the Cincinnati office stopped working on potential political cases entirely.

The report said 170 groups received IRS letters asking for additional information, and in 98 of those cases the questions asked were later determined to be inappropriate or unnecessary. Those questions included the names of donors, the political affiliation of officers, and their employment outside the organization.

In a response to the draft report, the IRS defended its decision to separate out groups involved in potential political activities. ""While centralization was warranted, the manner in which we initially designated cases for centralization was inappropriate,"" wrote Joseph H. Grant, the acting commissioner for tax exempt and government entities.

He also said determining which groups are engaged in prohibited political activity is difficult: ""There are no bright line tests for what constitutes political campaign intervention ... or whether an organization is primarily engaged in social welfare activities,"" Grant said.

Republicans Mike Kelly (PA-03) and Jim Renacci (OH-16) circulated a letter Thursday requesting Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to release documents detailing the process and methodology the Automotive Task Force used to shut down General Motors dealerships in 2009 during the automotive industry crisis.

Renacci’s Northeast Ohio Chevrolet dealership was closed in 2010 after losing a battle with General Motors. Congress loaned General Motors $50 billion in 2009 after GM declared bankruptcy, which resulted in the federal government owning a majority share of the company. Roughly 2000 dealerships received “wind-down” agreements, and while hundreds were able to survive an exhaustive arbitration process, Renacci-Doraty Chevrolet in Wadsworth did not. Renacci, then a Congressional candidate challenging incumbent John Boccieri, placed the blame squarely on President Obama.

Mike Kelly has a similar story. He decided to run for Congress when it was announced that Obama’s Automotive Task Force slated Wayland Chevrolet in Butler, Pennsylvania for closure. The dealership was started by Kelly’s father in 1953.

Now that it has been confirmed that the Treasury Department unfairly profiled conservatives around that time, the Congressmen are wondering if that could have been a factor in the selection of certain dealerships for closure.

The IRS scandal “raises serious questions about past decisions made by the [Treasury] Department regarding auto dealership closures that occurred in 2008 and 2009,” reads the letter. “We formally request that the Treasury Department provide all e-mails, phone records, notes, memoranda, reports, and other communications regarding the decision-making process for dealership closures from the Automotive Task Force headed by Car Czars Steve Rattner and Ron Bloom.”

The letter also notes that while the Automotive Task Force claimed to have objectively evaluated each dealership, a Special Inspector General Report found that there was “little or no documentation” that proves objective criteria were used.

prev Image 2 of 2

Saturday, August 10 marks the third month of the IRS scandal.

On May10, when Lois Lerner, the former Director of the IRS Exempt Organizations Division, answered a question at a legal conference – a question she arranged to have asked in advance -- she clearly had no idea what would happen next.

When she admitted that the IRS had targeted conservative groups, simply because of their political beliefs, she touched off a national firestorm. Her inept attempt to apologize for the Agency’s blunder, and put it to rest, backfired.

In the past three months, we have learned that the Obama administration repeatedly tried to downplay this unlawful targeting scheme which is an unprecedented breach of the public’s trust by the IRS.

[pullquote]

We also know that the scandal continues to expand. And we know that the Obama administration is doing very little to get to the bottom of what happened, despite the president's promise to the American people that the administration would “hold the responsible parties accountable.”

Today, after all this time, it’s clear that the Obama administration isn't really interested in the facts about how this could happen at the IRS or about holding anyone accountable.

In fact, President Obama has moved on, calling the IRS targeting scheme a “phony” scandal and acting as if corrective action has been taken and problem solved.

Not so fast.

From the beginning, the facts did not square with the excuses offered up to the American public by the Obama administration.

It did not take long to punch holes in the IRS’ story that the scheme to target conservatives began in a small office run by just a couple of rogue agents.

In our lawsuit against the IRS, on behalf of 41 conservative organizations in 22 states, the evidence is very clear: documents have revealed that IRS offices coast-to-coast were involved in the scheme, including Lois Lerner herself! In fact, she sent more than a dozen letters to conservative organizations asking them intrusive and inappropriate questions.

The White House has also claimed that the unconstitutional targeting of conservative organizations ended in May 2012. Again, our documents clearly show that the IRS abuse continued through May of 2013 with the most recent letter dated May 6, 2013 – just four days before Lerner's admission.

And we now know, thanks to the testimony of former IRS attorneys, that the office of the IRS Chief Counsel (a political presidential appointee) was involved in the scheme, too. This testimony raises important questions about President Obama’s knowledge or involvement in the scheme.

Now, there’s new information to suggest that the IRS may have been providing taxpayer information to the Federal Election Commission, something that violates federal law and the IRS's own regulations.

An FEC commissioner says he has seen previously undisclosed emails between the IRS and FEC about the targeting scheme. And lawmakers are now demanding the FEC turn over records of more than five years of communications with the IRS.

All of this information comes as the Obama administration continues to stonewall Congress about the scandal -- providing just a fraction of the information requested.

Noting the three month mark since the scandal began, Reps. Darrell Issa (Calif.) and Dave Camp (Mich.), chairmen of the House committees on Oversight and Ways and Means have voiced their concern, saying in a statement, “The American people demand and deserve accountability from their government, not to live in fear of being subject to an audit or other extra scrutiny for reasons unrelated to the content of their filing. So far, the IRS and this administration have provided no assurances that oversight and accountability is in place to prevent such abuses from happening again.”

The president did order the new Acting IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel to conduct a 30-day review of the IRS scandal. Yes, you read that right, just a 30-day review to investigate a scheme that had been underway for years. It’s no surprise that Werfel claims the 30-day review turned up no “evidence of intentional wrongdoing by anyone in the IRS.”

It’s been 3 months since the American public learned about this outrageous behavior by the IRS. No one has been fired. Lerner and a handful of others are on leave and still being paid.

And what has happened to the investigations underway by the FBI and Department of Justice? Three months later, not one of our clients has been contacted by investigators at the FBI or Justice Department.

It’s difficult to imagine how anyone could claim that a thorough investigation -- or any investigation for that matter – has been conducted without even bothering to interview the taxpayers who were targeted.

So, the IRS scandal continues. It’s been three months and counting. The last three months have produced many more questions and very few answers.

Where’s the accountability, Mr. President?"

Rep. Charles Boustany Jr., R-La., spoke minutes before the committee was holding Congress' first hearing on the IRS's targeting of conservatives.

""We've asked for documents for two years now, and all we've gotten is stonewalling from the IRS,"" Boustany, who heads the Ways and Means oversight subcommittee, said on C-SPAN television.

""We need specific information about who made these decisions, why were these decisions made, why wasn't there proper oversight, what was the chain of command and who knew what,"" Boustany said, previewing questions lawmakers planned to pursue.

With the scandal joining a parade of political troubles buffeting President Barack Obama, the committee planned to question the agency's ousted chief, Steven Miller, on Friday.

Miller, acting director until he resigned Wednesday, seems sure to get a hostile reception. Members of both parties have spent the past week bitterly chastising the agency for abandoning its charge of making nonpolitical decisions about which groups should qualify for tax-exempt status, which makes it easier for them to collect contributions from donors.

Lawmakers have said that even though they asked the IRS repeatedly about complaints from conservative groups that their applications were being treated unfairly, the agency — including Miller — never told them the groups were being targeted. They said this continued even after May 2012, when the agency says Miller was briefed on the practice. Miller was previously a deputy commissioner whose portfolio included the unit that made decisions about tax-exempt status.

Also to testify Friday was J. Russell George, the Treasury Department's inspector general for tax administration.

A report George issued this week concluded that the IRS office in Cincinnati, which screened applications for the tax exemptions, improperly singled out tea party and other conservative groups for tougher treatment. The report says the practice began in March 2010 and lasted more than 18 months.

Republicans have spent the past few days trying to link the IRS' improper scrutiny of conservatives to Obama. The president has said he didn't know about the targeting until last Friday, when Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups, acknowledged at a legal conference that conservative groups had been singled out. She said it was wrong and apologized.

""I promise you this, that the minute I found out about it, then my main focus was making sure that we get the thing fixed,"" Obama said Thursday.

Even so, less than four months into his second term, the president has been on the defensive for the IRS controversy, along with questions about last September's attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, and the government's seizure of The Associated Press' telephone records as part of a leaks investigation.

In one of the latest GOP attacks, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, wrote Obama on Thursday asking whether the White House or Treasury Department pressured the IRS on the treatment of conservative groups. In the letter, Portman accused the administration of ""policies that threaten to chill disfavored political speech.""

The inspector general's report said all IRS officials questioned said their actions ""were not influenced by any individual or organization outside the IRS.""

The report blamed ""ineffective management"" for letting IRS officials craft ""inappropriate criteria"" to review applications from tea party and other conservative groups, based on their names or political views. It found that the IRS took no action on many of the conservative groups' applications for tax-exempt status for long periods of time, hindering their fundraising for the 2010 and 2012 elections.

Many of the groups were applying for tax-exempt status as social welfare organizations, which are allowed to participate in campaign activity if that is not their primary activity. The IRS judges whether that imprecise standard is met.

Friday's hearing was just the start of Congress' probe of the IRS' actions, with the Senate Finance and House Oversight committees planning hearings next week.

In addition, Attorney General Eric Holder has said the FBI was investigating whether the IRS may have violated applicants' civil rights.

Obama has rejected the idea of naming a special prosecutor to investigate the episode, saying Thursday that the probes by Congress and the Justice Department would get to the bottom of who was responsible.

Obama has named Daniel Werfel, a top White House budget officer, to replace Miller.

Also Thursday, Joseph Grant, one of Miller's top deputies, announced plans to retire June 3, according to an internal IRS memo. Grant is commissioner of the agency's tax exempt and government entities division, which includes the agents that targeted tea party groups for additional scrutiny.

Grant joined the IRS in 2005 and took over as acting commissioner of the tax exempt and government entities division in December 2010. He was just named the permanent commissioner May 8.

When asked whether Grant was pressured to leave, IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge said Grant had more than 31 years of federal service and it was his personal decision to leave.

Before he joined the IRS, Grant was a top official at the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

Grant's predecessor at the IRS was Sarah Hall Ingram, who is now director of the agency's Affordable Care Act Office. Ingram was in charge of the tax exempt division when IRS agents first started targeting conservative groups.

The IRS said Ingram was assigned to help the agency implement the health care law in December 2010, about six months before the Treasury inspector general's report said her subordinate, the director of exempt organizations, learned about the targeting."

With no agreement on a funding bill in sight, Republicans and Democrats continue to spar on Capitol Hill, while federal workers sit at home and the American public watches as an even more critical deadline on raising the federal debt limit nears.

The Senate rejected House amendments to a short-term spending bill Monday, pushing the government toward its first shutdown in nearly two decades.

The U.S. government began to shut down for the first time in 17 years early Tuesday, after a Congress bitterly divided over President Obama’s signature health-care initiative failed to reach agreement to fund federal agencies.

Hours before a midnight deadline, the Republican House passed its third proposal in two weeks to fund the government for a matter of weeks. Like the previous plans, the new one sought to undermine the Affordable Care Act, this time by delaying enforcement of the “individual mandate,” a cornerstone of the law that requires all Americans to obtain health insurance.

The new measure also sought to strip lawmakers and their aides of long-standing government health benefits.

The Democratic-led Senate quickly rejected that plan on a party-line vote. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) urged House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to abandon the assault on the health-care law and pass a simple bill to keep the government open. Otherwise, Reid warned, “the responsibility for this Republican government shutdown will rest squarely on his shoulders.”

Boehner refused to yield. He instead won approval, in a 1 a.m. largely party-line roll call, requesting a special House-Senate committee to meet in the coming days to resolve differences between the two parties, leaving in limbo the fate of millions of federal workers and the services they provide.

Shortly before midnight, the White House budget office issued a memo instructing agencies to “execute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations.”

The impasse means 800,000 federal workers will be furloughed Tuesday. National parks, monuments and museums, as well as most federal offices, will close. Tens of thousands of air-traffic controllers, prison guards and Border Patrol agents will be required to serve, but their pay may be delayed. And many congressional hearings — including one scheduled for Tuesday on last month’s Washington Navy Yard shootings — will be postponed.

In a last-minute ray of hope for active-duty troops, Congress on Monday approved and sent to the White House an agreement to keep issuing military paychecks. But Obama warned that the broader economy, which is finally starting to recover from the shocks of the past six years, would take a substantial hit if congressional gridlock shutters “America’s largest employer.”

“Keeping the people’s government open is not a concession to me. Keeping vital services running and hundreds of thousands of Americans on the job is not something you ‘give’ to the other side. It’s our basic responsibility,” Obama said in a statement Monday evening at the White House.

Privately, senior Republicans predicted that the closure would last at least a week. A fraction of today’s House Republicans were on Capitol Hill in 1995 and 1996 when a Republican-led Congress last shut down the government in a dispute over the budget with a Democratic president. Younger lawmakers don’t remember the pain the shutdown caused constituents, senior Republicans said. And many of them now question the conventional wisdom that the closures weakened the GOP presidential candidate in 1996 and nearly cost the party control of the House.

Democrats predicted that if the shutdown stretches into the weekend, the government-funding dispute could be rolled into an even more serious battle over the $16.7 trillion federal debt limit. The Treasury Department will begin running short of cash to pay the nation’s bills as soon as Oct. 17 unless Congress approves additional borrowing authority. With so little time remaining to avoid what would be the nation’s first default, Democratic aides predicted that negotiations to reopen the government may be merged into the debt-limit talks.

On Monday evening, Obama telephoned Boehner to urge him to reconsider his stance on the health-care law. In a call that lasted nearly 10 minutes, according to Boehner’s office, the president reiterated his insistence that there would be no negotiations over the debt limit, and that Congress must pay the bills it has incurred.

Boehner responded by mocking Obama in a speech on the House floor.

“ ‘I’m not going to negotiate,’ ” he said, quoting Obama. “I would say to the president: This is not about me. It’s not about Republicans here in Congress. It’s about fairness.”

The speech drew applause for the embattled speaker, who argued passionately that Republicans were merely seeking “fairness” for working people. Obama has delayed a mandate for employers to insure workers and delayed other requirements for big unions, Boehner said. “Yet they stick our constituents with a bill they don’t like and a bill they can’t afford,” he said.

Despite the show of unity, Republicans on both sides of the Capitol remain deeply divided about the attack on the health-care law. In the House, a group of more moderate Republicans was seething about the decision to bow to the forces that oppose the Affordable Care Act, led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and his allies on the right, including such outside groups as Heritage Action for America.

On Monday, some publicly urged Boehner to drop the issue and seek the help of House Democrats to pass the simple government-funding bill that the Senate approved last week.

“I don’t want to shut down the government,” said Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), who is trying to become her state’s first GOP senator since the 1950s, adding that she was inclined to support a “clean” funding bill.

Frustrations also were simmering among Senate Republicans, who complained that House leaders were pressing the attack in direct opposition to public opinion. Polls show that voters overwhelmingly disapprove of using the threat of a shutdown to defund the health-care law and that blame for a shutdown will fall squarely on Republicans.

“By wanting to repeal Obamacare using this method, it defies what the popular will is,” said Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, who campaigned last year on behalf of his party’s national ticket.

“I campaigned in 2012 all over this country for months: ‘Repeal and replace Obamacare.’ That was not the mandate of the voters,” McCain said. “If they wanted to repeal Obamacare, the 2012 election would have been probably significantly different.”

Adding to the tension Monday was Boehner’s decision to add the provision that would strip lawmakers, congressional staff members and White House aides of the employer subsidies for health insurance they have received for many years.

Now that lawmakers and their aides must join the new health-insurance exchanges, some conservative groups have criticized the subsidies, worth about $5,000 a year for individual coverage and $10,000 for families, as a “special exemption” from the new law. By including the provision, House leaders hoped to attract conservative support and put pressure on Senate Democrats, who faced the choice of shutting down the government to protect their own perks.

“On what flooding peninsula can you stand when it’s a question of delaying the individual mandate, ending member subsidies and funding the government?” said Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.). If Reid kills it, “the senators he’s going to protect become the subject of incredible scrutiny.”

Even some Republicans were uneasy about the prospect of dealing their aides — and some of their colleagues — the equivalent of a big pay cut. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) called it an “outrage,” adding that Boehner had worked directly with Reid and the Obama administration to make sure the subsidies would stay in place when congressional employees join the exchanges next year.

Boehner and his team presented the proposal to rank-and-file Republicans in a closed-door meeting Monday. For more than an hour and a half, lawmakers argued about the plan. They emerged with an unusual number of public dissenters, including Rep. Peter T. King (N.Y.), one of a dozen Republicans who ultimately voted against the proposal.

“I don’t want to be the facilitator of a disastrous process and plan,” he said.

Still, most Republicans endorsed the deal, even if somewhat reluctantly. “I think this is a principled call by leadership and it has the support of the con­ference,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), one of Boehner’s closest friends.

Democrats, meanwhile, were united against any attempt by Republicans to extract concessions now, especially with the larger fight over the debt limit swiftly approaching.

“The bottom line is very simple,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “You negotiate on this, they will up the ante for the debt limit.”

And then there’s ridiculous.

Into the last category goes the decision to close the nation’s monuments to make sure that the government shutdown strikes the hearts of all The American People, whose constant invocation by pandering politicians fills one with self-loathing. (Who wants to be an “American People,” given the quality of our spokesfolksen?)

Then again, ridiculous is perhaps too generous a word. Closing the monuments, especially the World War II Memorial, can be reduced, fittingly, to a single syllable: Dumb. It is fitting because the seated patron of the Mall, Abraham Lincoln, was famously monosyllabic. In trivia you can use, more than 70 percent of the words in the Gettysburg Address are of one syllable.

In more recent history, when a group of World War II veterans recently faced barriers blocking entry to the memorial — an open space requiring not so much as an attendant — these elderly warriors took a page from their Normandy playbook and stormed the barricades.

Can there be an image more inspiring than members of this venerable club, whose living roll declines each day by about 640, pushing their way through flimsy, useless, pointless barriers to roam among pillars erected to their heroism? What was Washington thinking?

Dumb, dumb, dumb.

President Obama, whose grandfather was a World War II veteran, might have known better. We may have to close down the government, he could have said, but don’t touch the monuments.

Instead, the Office of Management and Budget ordered the barricades.

That’ll show ’em.

Among the many reasons this was so clumsy, one stands out starkly: It isn’t as though the WWII guys can always come back another day. All are in their late 80s and early 90s, and time is of the essence. Moreover, most plan these trips well in advance and at considerable expense.

Thanks to the monument liberators, Washington officials were forced to rethink their decision and removed the barriers. The American People are now free to roam their public spaces that remember sacrifices beyond most imaginations.

Optically, symbolically and every other way, this seems too little too late. Shutting out veterans from their memorial touchstone was more than a bad call, a lapse of judgment, a mere moment of tone-deafness. In reality, it may have been the tidy effort of a box-checking bureaucrat, but it reeked of the small work of a petty bully.

Ditto the closing of the D-Day cemetery in Normandy, France, where more than 9,000 Americans are buried. And this is the president who recently declared that The American People are not political pawns to be used to score political points?

Barack Obama must have been an inkling in the prescient mind of H.L. Mencken when the curmudgeon from whom all op-eds flow once described democracy as “the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.”

While one may sympathize with Obama’s contempt for his congressional adversaries, he may have cut off his own nose with an unforced error of magnified proportions. Spite is unbecoming a president, as Richard Nixon proved in another era of national disruption. But beyond personality, it is baffling to imagine anyone thinking that the way to winning hearts and minds is by disrespecting the nation’s most beloved demographic.

I’ve often lamented the prospect of a world without my parents’ generation, not because they were perfect but because these mothers and fathers take with them a national treasure — their personal experiences and memories of the Great Depression and World War II and the lessons of sacrifice, thrift, courage and duty that defined them.

In their place, we have a bickering, twittering, snarling, snarky, toxic public square that has contaminated even our highest offices. How surreal it must seem to our oldest and wisest citizens to witness the breaking bad of America.

Nearly any but the die-hardest tea party member regrets the shuttering of the U.S. government. It was unnecessary, counterproductive and punishes all the wrong people — including federal employees, who do yeoman’s work for which they receive little credit.

Tying the defunding of Obamacare to the shutdown was folly, which sensible House Republicans knew even as they ignored their better judgment. Even so, the White House and Democrats seem determined to prove their own toughness by punishing the least deserving.

As we approach the next battle, over the debt ceiling, would that all of Washington remember the rule of the savvy negotiator: Always leave your opponent an exit.

Lois Lerner, the head of the exempt organizations division of the IRS, won’t answer questions about what she knew about the improper screening — or why she didn’t disclose it to Congress, according to a letter from her defense lawyer, William W. Taylor III. Lerner was scheduled to appear before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.

“She has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course,” said a letter by Taylor to committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Vista). The letter, sent Monday, was obtained Tuesday by the Los Angeles Times.

Taylor, a criminal defense attorney from the Washington firm Zuckerman Spaeder, said that the Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation, and that the House committee has asked Lerner to explain why she provided “false or misleading information” to the committee four times last year.

Since Lerner won’t answer questions, Taylor asked that she be excused from appearing, saying that would “have no purpose other than to embarrass or burden her.” There was no immediate word whether the committee will grant her request.

According to an inspector general’s report, Lerner found out in June 2011 that some staff in the nonprofits division in Cincinnati had used terms such as “Tea Party” and “Patriots” to select some applications for additional screening of their political activities. She ordered changes.

But neither Lerner nor anyone else at the IRS told Congress, even after repeated queries from several committees, including the House Oversight panel, about whether some groups had been singled out unfairly.

USA TODAY

Democrat resigned in 2008 after admitting he hired prostitutes

Spitzer has until Thursday to collect voter signatures to get on ballot

He declared interest in NYC comptroller%27s race during interview with %27The New York Times%27

Former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, who resigned five years ago amid a prostitution scandal, said he's running for New York City comptroller because he misses the policy fights and wants a chance to help shape the city's budget.

Spitzer, a Democrat, did a round of media interviews on Monday morning as New York City residents awoke to his surprising interview in The New York Times that he will ask voters for ""forgiveness."" Spitzer has until Thursday to collect the 3,750 signatures he needs from voters to get on the ballot for comptroller -- a job for which he said he believes he has the right ""skill set.""

""I sinned, I owned up to it, I looked them in the eye, I resigned, I held myself accountable,"" Spitzer said on CBS' This Morning program. ""It's now five years later. I hope they (voters) look back at what I did as attorney general, as governor, as a prosecutor and say, 'hey, this guy was ahead of the curve on Wall Street issues.' ""

On the Bill Press radio show, Spitzer said running for comptroller ""is an opportunity to participate in the budget of the city."" He told WCBS that he wants a chance to tell the public, ""here's what I can do."" For the past few years, Spitzer has worked as a political commentator on TV and has taught at City College of New York.

The self-described ""steamroller"" who once cracked down on Wall Street became the first New York governor since the 1970s to step down. In a memorable news conference with his wife, Silda, standing somberly at his side, Spitzer admitted in 2008 that he was a client of a high-end prostitution ring while governor.

On CBS, Spitzer denied that he and his wife are separated and said he discussed with his family his political plans -- which were made final this weekend. Asked if running for New York City comptroller was a step down from governor, Spitzer said, ""Service is service.""

""I think anybody who's been through what I've been through, sure, you want redemption,"" he said. ""If that's what I wanted I don't think this is the path to do it. But what I am seeking is service ... the most satisfying thing for me ever is public service.""

Spitzer is now the third high-profile politician derailed by scandal to seek public office this year. Democrat Anthony Weiner, who resigned from Congress amid a sexting scandal in 2011, is running for New York City mayor and is at or near the top of some public opinion polls on the race.

Republican Mark Sanford was elected in May to a congressional seat in South Carolina, four years after admitting an extramarital affair.

Spitzer has set up a new Twitter account, @SpitzerforNYC, to promote his candidacy and had more than 1,600 followers as of Monday morning.

Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer is among the most prominent candidates seeking the comptroller's job, which is responsible for the city's finances. The comptroller also serves as the city's chief auditor. Kristin Davis, who ran the prostitution ring that Spitzer was accused of frequenting, is also running.

Members of the House Ways and Means Committee grilled Steven Miller, who has resigned as acting commissioner but is still on the job until Wednesday, why he made no mention of the problems in letters and testimony to Congress, despite being aware of the issue.

“How can we conclude that you did not mislead this committee?” asked a visibly agitated Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.)

“I did not mislead the committee,” Miller said. “I stand by my answer then. I stand by my answer now.”

Miller said the queries from lawmakers in 2012 asked if the IRS was “targeting” conservative groups for intensive questioning and prolonged delays in their applications for 501(c)4 nonprofit status.

“When you talk about targeting, it’s a pejorative term,” Miller said. He later said “targeting” was a “loaded term,” ascribing partisan motives to what he said was a flawed work process.

“I can say generally, we provided horrible customer service here,” Miller later said. “I will admit that. We did horrible customer service. … Whether it was politically motivated or not is a very different question.”

The agency did not publicly disclose the problem until May 10, when Lois Lerner, director of the IRS’ exempt organizations division, apologized at a tax law conference, an unorthodox venue for such an admission.

Lerner was asked by Celia Roady, a member of the agency’s advisory board for tax-exempt entities, how the agency was dealing with applications from 501(c)4 groups.

Miller said Friday that the question was anticipated and Lerner’s answer was prepared in advance.

Though he and his brother were charged with stealing a car in the 1970s, prosecutors later dropped charges, and Issa said he was a victim in the incident, according to a New Yorker profile of Issa from 2011. After a suspicious fire at his business’s factory, the company’s former owner said he suspected Issa set the fire for insurance, but a cause of the fire was never determined and no charges were filed, according to the profile.

House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) claimed on Sunday that political officials in the Obama administration directed Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agents in Cincinnati to target conservative groups applying for 501 (c)(4) status, but his charge fell apart when probed by CNN host Candy Crowley.

CROWLEY: The investigator said “So is it your perspective that ultimately the responsible parties for the decisions reported by the [Inspector General] that is the decision that target tea party and patriot applications, are not in the Cincinnati office?

The employee says, ‘I don’t know how to answer that question. I mean, from an agent standpoint, we didn’t do anything wrong. We followed directions based on other people telling us what to do.’

Investigator, ‘And you ultimately followed directions from Washington, is that correct?

The employee, ‘if direction had come down from Washington, yes.’

The investigator, ‘But with respect to the particular scrutiny that was given to tea party applications, those directions emanated from Washington, is that right?’

The employee answers, ‘I believe so.’ It’s totally not definitive. ISSA: This one isn’t. But I will tell you, one of the agents asked for and got a transfer because that person was so uncomfortable that they wanted out of it.

It's kind of a cheap shot, but certainly no worse than Issa calling Jay Carney a ' paid liar' , and at least some people will know what kind of person is leading GOP 'investigations"" into Democratic ""scandals"". Here is Politico hilariously coming to Issa's defense:A lot more complicated so it won't fit into 140 characters is the story he links to in his tweet: Candy ("" Please Proceed Governor "") Crowley's takedown yesterday of Darrell Issa's claim that 'orders were coming from Washington to target teaparty groups, which is now an official news story, unchallenged by anyone else. (Forget about the fact that conservative groups weren't targeted at all, rather comprised only 30% of those investigated. It's now a truth by repetition that the Tea Party was targeted. The White House is working on distancing themselves from 'ordering' it).At least someone in the media seems to be still working at their job."

“‘You’ll regret.’ Come on,” he said. “I think if Obama himself saw the way they’re dealing with some of this, he would say, ‘Whoa, we don’t tell any reporter ‘you’re going to regret challenging us.’”

In an interview with CNN, Woodward said:

Because of the implicit promise of bailouts, Moody’s Investors Service, the second-largest U.S. ratings company, has boosted the scores for the six banks. Each increase in credit grade makes borrowing less expensive.

In a March 27 report, Moody’s displays a bar chart of its credit ratings for the banks in blue. In green bars, it shows Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo would be rated two grades lower if the taxpayer backstop didn’t exist. Moody’s boosted Morgan Stanley’s score by two grades for the same reason, even though it had downgraded that bank in June 2012.

The scores for Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan (JPM) are three grades lower in the green bars.

Debt sold by the holding companies of Bank of America and Citigroup (C), the second- and third-biggest U.S. banks by assets, would fall to junk status without the implicit government guarantee, Moody’s Senior Vice President David Fanger says.

Bruce Malkenhorst took home more than $911,000 a year as city manager of the tiny city of Vernon. His reign ended shortly before he was convicted of misappropriating public funds, and he walked away with an annual pension that eventually topped $500,000, the largest in the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.

But CalPERS last year decided to cut his pension to $115,000, concluding he’d derived some of his hefty salary improperly.

So now the 78-year-old Malkenhorst is suing Vernon to make up the difference. His lawyers are making a novel if improbable argument: Because it paid him a high salary, the city is responsible for keeping his retirement benefits at the higher level even though CalPERS balked.

Vernon now faces a potentially costly legal battle as attorneys face off with the city’s onetime power broker, who for years was thought to be the highest paid public official in the country.

It could turn into a test case for other city leaders who have seen their hefty pensions cut by CalPERS.

Bell’s former city administrator, Robert Rizzo, was poised to receive a pension of about $650,000. But CalPERS cut it to $50,000 after Rizzo and seven other city officials were accused of corruption. His assistant, Angela Spaccia, had her projected pension cut from $250,000 to $43,000.

Last year CalPERS found that Vernon improperly boosted the retirement benefits of nearly two dozen top employees, resulting in the largest public pension reduction in state history. Malkenhorst’s successor, Eric T. Fresch, who made as much as $1.6 million in 2008, had his pension stripped completely. Fresch died last year.

Malkenhorst’s attorney has already presented hundreds of pages of exhibits as evidence of what he says are the city’s vows to fund his rich pension. In the suit, Malkenhorst describes his pension as a promise from the city based on his “highest earnings at Vernon.” He notes that eight years ago, when CalPERS first raised issues about his pension, the city supported Malkenhorst. That changed last year, he said, when CalPERS reduced his pension.

Vernon officials argue that Malkenhorst had been paid more than enough.

“The exhibits well document that Mr. Malkenhorst made a pile of money working for Vernon when he ran the show and was lord of the manor,” said City Atty. Nicholas Rodriguez. “We intend to litigate it and believe that he is entitled to nothing further from Vernon.”

CalPERS alleges that Vernon improperly boosted Malkenhorst’s retirement benefits, arguing that his pension was “illegally based on unpublished pay rates, overtime and an inflated longevity allowance.” Although Malkenhorst held as many as 10 positions during his 29-year tenure in the city’s government, CalPERS determined that only his pay as city clerk was properly reported for purposes of his pension. Malkenhorst filed two lawsuits to prevent his pension from being reduced. He lost both but is appealing.

Malkenhorst was squired around in limousines, and it often seemed that he oversaw the City Council, not the other way around. Those who know Malkenhorst said they are not surprised he is fighting back.

“Bruce Malkenhorst can’t be called shy,” said Steve Freed, president of the Vernon Property Assn., a business advocacy group. “He’s an aggressive guy with an aggressive personality. If he thinks he truly earned this money, then he absolutely will make every effort to attain that money.”

Freed said he has little sympathy for Malkenhorst.

“He set his own salary, he set his own benefits package, then swept it through the City Council,” he said. “He was coming close to $1 million a year, which is just irresponsible for a city to be paying one person.”

Advertisement

John Kruissink, a former Vernon historian, said Malkenhorst never tried to hide that he was getting paid a huge salary, which a compliant City Council readily awarded him.

“Bruce believes in himself and that he didn’t do anything wrong…. He’s going to go down swinging,” Kruissink said.

Malkenhorst did not return a call seeking comment, nor did his attorney.

Malkenhorst retired in 2005. The next year, Los Angeles County prosecutors filed public corruption charges against him, accusing him of spending $60,000 in city money for personal use, including massages, golf outings, meals and political contributions. He pleaded guilty in 2011. He was sentenced to three years’ probation and ordered to pay $35,000 in fines and penalties, as well as $60,000 in restitution to Vernon.

Malkenhorst was already the highest-paid public official in California by the late 1980s. In an interview with The Times in 1989, he declared his salary of $162,000 at the time to be a bargain for Vernon.

“I always thought if I made this much money I’d be rich,” he quipped.

President Obama hasn’t begun to fix the big problem of Washington dysfunction, but he moved Wednesday to respond to public anger and reposition his sinking administration. He fired the acting IRS commissioner, released a blizzard of e-mails on Benghazi and backed a shield law to protect journalists. It was fancy footwork in public-relations terms but not a reaction to what’s really ailing the federal government.

The crippling problem in Washington these days isn’t any organized conspiracy against conservatives, journalists or anyone else. Rather, it’s a federal establishment that’s increasingly paralyzed because of poor management and political second-guessing.

What should frighten the public is not the federal government’s monstrous power but its impotence.

Firing officials has its place in bringing accountability. What’s really needed, as these latest episodes show, is adult supervision of the bureaucracy. This requires senior officials who are properly sensitive to political issues. But such officials have become so afraid of seeming to meddle that mistakes happen.

Where was the senior manager who should have stopped IRS employees from writing outrageous questionnaires and search queries targeting “Patriots” and “We the People”? Perhaps that person was wading through congressional messages urging IRS investigations of tax-exempt political groups.

Where was the top Justice Department official who should have checked a runaway prosecutor from issuing an over-broad subpoena to the Associated Press? The attorney general recused himself because of fear of a perceived conflict of interest. Perhaps lower-level officials were chilled by congressional demands for leak investigations — and insinuations the administration was itself the guilty party.

The principal activity of the federal government these days is investigating itself. No panel is bipartisan and independent enough to escape the charge that it is covering something up. This accusation has been leveled against the review panel on Benghazi headed by Tom Pickering, former undersecretary of state, and Adm. Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Good grief, if these two are part of a conspiracy, I’m moving to Moscow.

If you unpack the various scandals swirling around Washington this week, you find a common theme of bad decisions by government officials, compounded by finger-pointing and second-guessing from Congress. Here are some moments in this chain of error.

● The IRS investigations of tea party-related conservative groups that began in March 2010 came a couple of months after the Supreme Court in Citizens United opened the way for corporate contributions to political causes. Garance Franke-Ruta, in her blog for the Atlantic, has identified congressional pressure on the IRS to investigate conservative tax-exempt groups. The unit that was supposed to make such determinations (located in Cincinnati in part to keep it away from political pressure) made an intolerable mistake in searching for right-wing groups using political terms.

But the dragnet was hardly a secret: News reports appeared in 2012 about tea party complaints of harassment, at a time when some congressional Democrats were demanding that the IRS crack down harder. A grand jury can help unravel whether the IRS’s outrageous decisions amounted to criminal behavior.

● The Justice Department launched two special investigations of leaks in June after intense Republican criticism of intelligence disclosures. The probes focused on the sources for stories discussing the Stuxnet cyberattacks on Iran and a spy inside al-Qaeda’s Yemen affiliate.

Ann Telnaes animation: Eric Holder gets stuck. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

Even a journalist can understand why officials get upset when such secrets are blown. But the GOP’s larger motivation was its suspicion (apparently wrong) that senior Obama administration officials had organized the leaks. The administration’s own leak obsession (fueled by fears of congressional criticism) led Justice Department officials to subpoena two months of records for more than 20 phones at the AP.

Why did Justice approve such a broad seizure when its own guidelines urge narrow use of reporters’ records? Perhaps it was an especially egregious leak, jeopardizing a British agent in place and infuriating the United States’ closest ally. We don’t know, because the administration has never properly explained its campaign against leaks — fearing political backlash.

● Finally, Benghazi, the scandal that keeps on giving: This one began in the fog of war, so it’s best to be cautious about assigning responsibility. But the administration did try from the beginning to spin the story to preserve its campaign theme that Obama had won the war on terror, and the GOP has been spinning it ever since, to the point that the blame game is beginning to chill operations in North Africa.

Another generation would have said: Let’s get on with it. We say, let’s have another investigation.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/17/outgoing-irs-chief-faces-hearing-after-stunning-revelation-on-another-scandal/,2013-05-17 00:00:00,[],"Tables turn on IRS, lawmakers grill outgoing agency chief at heated hearing","For the first time in years, the IRS was knocked down a peg or two.

In a hearing that escalated into a boisterous public shaming of one of the country's most-feared government agencies, lawmakers took turns Friday calling outgoing IRS Commissioner Steven Miller on the carpet for his department's scandalous practice of targeting conservative groups.

Miller rebuffed attempts to extract the names of those responsible, saying he did not know. But lawmakers vowed that the tense hearing would mark only the start of a series of investigations, in which criminal activity could be probed.

Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., seemed to capture the angst against the agency toward the end of the hours-long hearing, as he described the ways its agents are capable of ruining lives.

""You can put anybody out of business that you want. ... When the IRS comes in there, you're not allowed to be shoddy,"" he said, suggesting the agency's leadership was being held to a different standard now that it is coming under scrutiny.

""This is absolutely an overreach, and this is an outrage for all Americans,"" he said.

When he finished, the committee room erupted in cheers and applause that lasted several seconds.

The hearing, though, was more than just venting.

While Democrats voiced concern that the latest scandal would be used to score ""political points,"" lawmakers on both sides of the aisle scolded the agency. And they made clear they'd be pressuring the IRS in the weeks to come on several points -- namely, who was responsible and whether lawmakers were overtly lied to last year.

On the first question, they got few answers from Miller during Friday's testimony.

But they repeatedly confronted the acting commissioner -- who was ousted from him job earlier this week -- about his and other officials' failure to disclose the program last year despite being aware of it.

""In fact, we were repeatedly told no such targeting was happening. That isn't being misled, that's lying,"" said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.

Miller seemed to frustrate lawmakers' attempts to dig deeper. He claimed, a week after the scandal broke and a year after he first learned of the practice, that he still did not know who was responsible.

""I don't have that name,"" he testified, after Rep. Dave Reichert, R-Wash., asked who was behind the program.

Miller also claimed -- over and over -- he was being honest with Congress during a hearing last year.

""You did not share the information you knew,"" Reichert charged.

""I answered all questions truthfully,"" Miller replied.

This claim was met with deep skepticism Friday. Miller acknowledged he learned of the practice during a May 3, 2012, briefing. Yet when he was asked about it at a July 25 hearing that year, he said only that some applications fell into a particular category -- and that those organizations were grouped for ""consistency"" and ""quality.""

A letter he wrote to a Republican lawmaker the month before also gave a general description of the process without acknowledging that some groups were being singled out based on words like ""Tea Party"" and ""Patriot.""

""How can we not conclude that you misled this committee?"" Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., former GOP vice presidential nominee, asked Miller.

Miller said he ""did not mislead the committee"" and stands by his answer.

Asked whether his answer was ""incomplete,"" he said again he answered ""truthfully.""

Miller objected to the term ""targeting,"" and claimed political motivations were not at play in the program, which began in 2010. But he apologized for the program and said ""foolish mistakes were made by people trying to be more efficient.""

""As acting commissioner, I want to apologize on the behalf of the Internal Revenue Service for the mistakes that we made and the poor service provided,"" Miller said. ""The affected organizations and the American public deserve better.""

The hearing is the first to examine the scandal, and will likely kick off a string of subsequent hearings and investigations. Republicans made clear that the two retirements or resignations to date would not satisfy their concerns.

Camp ripped the tax-collecting agency over the practice at the start of the hearing. ""Now we know the truth -- or at least some of it,"" he said. ""We also know that these revelations are just the tip of the iceberg. It would be a mistake to treat this as just one scandal.""

He questioned how high the scandal went, and also suggested there was other targeting of conservatives that has not yet been acknowledged by the agency. He called it part of a ""culture of cover-ups.""

""This systemic abuse cannot be fixed with just one resignation, or two,"" he said. He said the problem is not just personnel, but the size and scope of the IRS.

The inspector general who released a scathing report on the agency also testified Friday. J. Russell George -- the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration -- said his findings raised ""troubling questions"" about the agency, while claiming some of the wrongdoing was apparently done with no-to-little supervision.

But he said all three allegations against the agency turned out to be true -- that it was using ""inappropriate criteria"" to screen conservative groups, it was delaying applications and it was asking unnecessary questions.

Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., the top Democrat on the committee, said the agency's management ""completely failed the American people."" At the same time, he urged Republicans not to use the hearing to ""score political points.""

Republicans, though, expressed more concern after they learned Thursday that the IRS official who led the tax-exempt organizations unit when the targeting took place -- Sarah Hall Ingram -- has since moved over to the IRS office responsible for ObamaCare.

Miller said Friday he was the one who promoted her and called her a ""superb civil servant.""

The acknowledgement comes after the administration announced that Ingram's successor Joseph Grant -- who had only been on the job a few days -- would be retiring.

President Obama, meanwhile, maintained Thursday that he didn't know about the investigation into the IRS program until it was made public. Obama also appointed a new acting commissioner -- White House budget officer Daniel Werfel -- after the prior IRS chief announced his resignation."

The rivalry between Texas and California is no secret, and it goes far beyond the fact that they are the two most populous states in the nation. While neither state is monolithic in terms of its political ideology—Texas has deep-blue Austin while some inland parts of California are a startling shade of crimson—the politics of each state has been marked by radically different ideologies. California's main power bases of economic and political power include two of the places conservatives most love to hate: San Francisco and Hollywood. Meanwhile, every single statewide elected official is a Democrat, and Democrats have dominated the state legislature, despite the roadblocks along the way. In recent years, the state government has sought to invest in projects like high-speed rail and solar energy, often taxing itself for the privilege Texas, of course, is just the opposite: a conservative ideological paradise funded substantially by the oil industry, with low taxes and a belief that government is the problem, not the solution.

Because of its ideological ramifications, the rivalry between Texas and California is more than just competition for bragging rights between the nations two heaviest hitters; rather, it is ground zero in an ideological proxy war between the progressive and conservative factions of larger-scale national politics. And in recent years, as the Lone Star State was experiencing its so-called ""Texas Miracle"" while California was limping along from budget crisis to budget crisis, it was far from uncommon for conservative ideologues to point to the contrast between the two as evidence of the success of conservative economic policy.

Unfortunately for them, the tide has turned on this view. First, the so-called Texas Miracle turned out to be a sham masked by a combination of rapid population growth, high oil prices and low wages. Ironically enough, it was billions of dollars in stimulus funds that was propping up Texas' budget solvency. When that ran out and the economic crisis finally showed its full effects, the state faced a crippling budget deficit of $27 billion, and was forced to make massive cuts to Medicaid and education to stay afloat.

California, meanwhile, has been on exactly the opposite trajectory. The voters, sick of the tax revolt that had been artificially maintained by the Republican minority, voted in a series of structural reforms that loosened the minority's stranglehold in Sacramento and followed that up by passing two tax measures to promote green energy and protect our schools from further cuts. Combined with the economic recovery that has been taking place nationwide, these changes were enough to put California's budget back in the black for the first time in many years, even as Texas suffers from high poverty, low wages and a drastically failing education system.

Join me below the fold to learn more about why the economic miracle in Texas was really a mirage."

(CNN) —

On “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart captured the frustration that many of President Obama’s supporters have felt over the past week as one scandal after another cascaded into the White House.

After starting with a predictable riff accusing Bill O’Reilly of ignoring facts when attacking the Obama administration, Stewart turned to the IRS story, banged on his desk, and yelled out curses.

Stewart then blasted the administration for the revelation that the IRS had given extra scrutiny to right-wing organizations. “Explanation please,” Stewart said, before playing some comedic clips of Lois Lerner, the official in charge of handling tax-exempt organizations at the IRS, who admits she is not good at math.

“Well, congratulations, President Barack Obama,” Stewart went on to say. “Conspiracy theorists, who generally can survive in anaerobic environments, have just had an algae bloom dropped on their f*****g heads. Thus removing the last arrow in your pro-governance quiver. … This has, in one seismic moment, shifted the burden of proof from the tinfoil-behatted to the government.”

Opinion: Will scandals stall Obama agenda?

Larry Levanti Julian Zelizer

This was just one of the scandals to rock the administration within the week. The media also reported that the Justice Department had conducted a surveillance operation focusing on journalists for The Associated Press, in an effort to find the source behind a leaked story about a foiled terrorist attack.

Many liberal Democrats were frustrated and shocked that the administration had permitted the seizure of the phone records, the kind of activities they would certainly have railed against had they happened under President George W. Bush.

Although there is no evidence that Obama was involved in either of these incidents – and many Republicans are clearly trying to use them to drum up a narrative about a scandal-ridden presidency – the combination left many Democrats, like Stewart, scratching their heads, wondering what happened to the president who promised when he ran in 2008 to transform the way politics worked.

Despite controversies, Obama approval rating holds steady

It is still too early to know all the facts and what the president’s role has been. Nonetheless, some of the frustration that Obama’s supporters feel comes from ways in which this White House has too often accepted politics as usual rather than embarking on the transformative changes that he once promised. While many of the president’s supporters insist that he has delivered on his promise to push forward a bold policy agenda, few would say that he has fulfilled his goal of changing the way that politics works.

What happened?

Since the resignation of President Richard Nixon over Watergate, most presidential candidates have run on the promise to fix a broken Washington. Jimmy Carter, whose 1976 campaign revolved around the basic promise that you could trust him, perfected this message and style of campaigning.

In one way or another, every candidate – including Obama’s predecessor, Bush – has assured voters he would reform government and transform politics. But the change doesn’t happen. Within four years, as Carter discovered, the new boss looks like the old boss and “the system” seems the same.

Most presidents realize once they are in office that reforming Washington will consume too much of their political capital, generating more enemies among their opponents as well as within their own party, and the results of any such initiative will probably be negligible.

Instead, once in office, presidents tend to embrace the role of politician and turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues that will matter much more to voters on Election Day. The easiest way to achieve policy goals is by working through the existing system rather than trying to remake things.

Transformation is also difficult simply because the size and scale of the executive branch have grown so much over the past century, vastly increasing the odds that things can go wrong.

Within each agency, there are multiple opportunities for unethical bureaucrats, sometimes without presidential knowledge, to do bad things. This is part of the reason there have been such strong advocates, on the right and the left, calling for greater – though less politicized – congressional oversight and tighter rules to constrain wrongdoing.

Opinion: For Obama, it’s no more Mr. Nice Media

In certain respects, the burden, as Stewart points out, is greater for liberals, given the centrality of government to their agenda. Over the past decades the vast expansion of executive power through the homeland security program has also increased the possibilities for wrongdoing.

People should not be surprised that the Justice Department was so aggressive with the AP phone records. After all, Obama has kept most of Bush’s homeland security program in place and has conducted an extraordinarily aggressive program to contain any leaks that threaten the system. In defense of the government’s actions, Attorney General Eric Holder said the leak that it was investigating “put the American people at risk.”

Reforming government has also fallen victim to the hyperpartisan polarization that defines Washington. From day one in the White House, Obama has faced an incredibly hostile Republican Party, unwilling to support almost anything he does. This vastly diminished the incentives for him to try to find bipartisan support for reform initiatives, which usually generate a lot of opposition from interests who thrive in the status quo and are rarely priorities for voters on Election Day.

With campaign finance, another area where Obama has greatly disappointed his supporters, Obama decided that the only way to beat the Republicans would be to raise and spend as much money as they did. That prompted his decision to turn down federal financing for his campaigns, bringing an end to the post-Watergate reforms, and leading to reliance on the Super PACs he once criticized.

None of this is meant to excuse the kinds of activities that have recently been revealed. But Americans should not be surprised that the promise of reform vanished under Obama and that the problems of government he inherited have not gone away.

Obama to new grads: ‘No time for excuses’

Ultimately, we will need politicians who are willing to take huge risks in tackling some of the underlying problems with government – or a scandal so severe that it creates real political pressure for incumbents to do something – if we are to strengthen our processes and reduce the risks of the kinds of stories we saw this past week.

Scandals can prod elected officials to take reform seriously. Following Watergate, a scandal far worse than what we have seen thus far, Congress and the president adopted a number of major government reforms that included a new campaign finance system, ethics rules, the Office of the Independent Counsel, and much more. While Carter has been criticized for many of his failings on domestic and foreign policy, his decision to move forward with reforms in the wake of Watergate stands as one of his biggest achievements.

Perhaps Obama should use this moment as an opportunity to be bold and to return to some of the fundamental ideas for reform that he raised in embarking on his journey to the White House.

Our democracy is endangered. Not by the Russians, North Korea, the Iran regime, or even terrorists. To quote Pogo: “We have met the enemy and he is us.”

Inside the beltway, the fingers point and the media tuts and struts in glee, and we, the American public, respond by becoming more rigid and divided ourselves. No more “truth springing from argument amongst friends,” as David Hume said. A recent nonpartisan Pew Research Poll finds our knee-jerk partisanship has increased dramatically.

This road we’re on will lead us step-by-step to an extreme: either an autocratic government that functions, or a dysfunctional anarchy. The petty squabbles, bilge in the name of party or principle, will dissolve our self-government.

Abraham Lincoln felt no foreign power could ever defeat the United States. He said, “From whence shall we expect the approach of danger? Shall some trans-Atlantic military giant step the earth and crush us at a blow? Never…No, if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men we will live forever or die by suicide.”

We’re pointing a pistol at our heads. A government of, by, and for the people requires that people talk to people, that we can agree to disagree but do so in civility. If we let the politicians and those who report dictate our discourse, then our course will be dictated.

Why am I alarmed? Because two “scandals” – the IRS tax-exempt inquiries and the Department of Justice’s tapping of reporters’ phones – have become lynch parties. And the congressional investigation of Benghazi may become a scandal in itself.

The IRS scandal has sparked bipartisan outrage that should require a bipartisan solution. The director who oversaw this was a Bush appointee who was confirmed by a Democratic Congress. Even Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein says he doubts very much that Obama was involved

We, the people, need to stay focused on facts, causes and solutions. Let’s begin with the findings of the Treasury’s inspector general who uncovered it: That it was bureaucratic mismanagement, but that there was no evidence of any political motivation or influence from outside the IRS.

And that, according to acting Commissioner Steven Miller, who just resigned, the problem started because the Supreme Court’s Citizens’ United decision created a surge of requests by political groups for tax-exempt status.

Democrats and Republicans agree there’s a problem. Maybe they should focus on solutions.

Let’s demand an end to partisan sideshows or media witch hunts: It turns out that the leaked White House Benghazi e-mails which allegedly show a coverup of a terrorist attack were themselves altered. Those e-mails are, in a word, bogus

Next up on the playbill: The Department of Justice secretly obtained dozens of reporters’ phone records because of a serious security leak. The double contradictory shell game we’re supposed to believe: Obama is not in charge and he has his finger in every pot.

This bamboozling of the American people obscures the main point: How do we safeguard American lives and respect our freedoms at the same time? Maybe working together – Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals – the Media Shield Law, a solution to the problem, can be passed.

Both the Democrats and Republicans have run roughshod over our separation of powers. Both parties have misused and abused their constitutional powers. Democrats blocked, again and again, President Bush’s nominees for federal judges. Today, Republicans aren’t just blocking Obama’s judicial nominees, they’re blocking the Senate from considering laws and blocking Cabinet appointees necessary for the federal government to run.

Why should we allow any political party or personality to render our government unable to govern?

On 9/11 terrorists attacked the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and tried to attack the U.S. Capitol building in order to destroy our institutions, our economic strength, our military and our democratic Congress where “the people rule.”

But in our partisan self-righteousness, we’re destroying our foundations of government more effectively than al Qaeda ever could. Whether it’s the media or the politicians, the churning of partisan passion into anger, indeed hate, has an ulterior purpose: If Obama’s administration is constantly engaged in fighting for its existence, the governing comes to a halt, and his agenda will go nowhere.

Aiming for that and little if nothing else weakens and harms our democratic institutions, both Congress and the presidency. Remember, Obama was elected by a bigger margin than George W. Bush. He deserves to have his appointees, and he deserves to have votes on the issues, to have the government function, and to fight for the policies on which he was elected. By allowing problems to become scandals and scandals to become demagoguery, we’re shooting ourselves in the foot.

If it keeps up, we will all be complicit in weakening our democracy.

Nearly all of them declined to speak for attribution, citing their unwillingness to alienate the Clinton family.

Last Thursday, Mr. Clinton arrived two hours late to an exuberant welcome at a health clinic about 60 miles north of Johannesburg. Children in zebra-striped loincloths sang as Mr. Clinton and Ms. Clinton made their entrance, and the former president enthusiastically explained how his foundation had helped the South African government negotiate large reductions in the price of drugs that halt the progress of HIV. Aaron Motsoaledi, South Africa’s minister of health, heaped praise on the effort. “Because of your help we are able to treat three and a half times more people than we used to,” he told the crowd.

The project is typical of the model pioneered by the Clinton Foundation, built around dozens of partnerships with private companies, governments, or other nonprofit groups. Instead of handing out grants, the foundation recruits donors and advises them on how best to deploy their money or resources, from helping Procter & Gamble donate advanced water-purification packets to developing countries to working with credit card companies to expand the volume of low-cost loans offered to poor inner city residents.

The foundation, which has 350 employees in 180 countries, remains largely powered by Mr. Clinton’s global celebrity and his ability to connect corporate executives, A-listers and government officials. On this month’s Africa trip, Mr. Clinton was accompanied by the actors Dakota Fanning and Jesse Eisenberg and the son of the New York City mayoral candidate John A. Catsimatidis, a longtime donor.

For most of the foundation’s existence, its leadership has been dominated by loyal veterans of the Clintons’ political lives. Ira C. Magaziner, who was a Rhodes scholar with Mr. Clinton and ran Mrs. Clinton’s failed attempt at a health care overhaul in the 1990s, is widely credited as the driving force behind the foundation’s largest project, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which, among other efforts, negotiates bulk purchasing agreements and price discounts on lifesaving medicines.

Mr. Band, who arrived at the White House in 1995 and worked his way up to become Mr. Clinton’s closest personal aide, standing behind the president on golf courses and the global stage, helped build the foundation’s fund-raising structure. He conceived of and for many years helped run the Clinton Global Initiative, the annual conference that draws hundreds of business leaders and heads of state to New York City where attendees are pushed to make specific philanthropic commitments.

Today, big-name companies vie to buy sponsorships at prices of $250,000 and up, money that has helped subsidize the foundation’s annual operating costs. Last year, the foundation and two subsidiaries had revenues of more than $214 million."

Bush’s second term, the Washington Post wrote that Bush’s frequent trips to his Texas ranch symbolized “a lackadaisical approach to the world’s most important day job” and gleefully noted that Bush was intent on setting the record for being on “vacation”–or away from Washington, D.C.–for the most number of days of any president.

But when President Barack Obama vacations in Hawaii, sets up a fantasy golf vacation for himself with Butch Harmon and Tiger Woods, averages more than a vacation a month in 2013 while purporting to be a man of the people and demanding the rich pay their fair share, and playing sequester politics by shutting down White House tours, the mainstream media is silent.

And while Bush spent more time outside of Washington than Obama, it is also worth nothing that nearly all of Bush’s vacations were trips back to his Texas ranch or family vacation homes in Maine.

The Post, in 2005, conceded that Bush’s vacations–unlike Obama’s–were not lavish and he did not “make time for fun.”

“Bush rarely takes the type of vacation one would consider exotic — or, to some, even appealing,” the Post wrote. “His notion of relaxation is chopping cedar on his ranch or mountain biking through rough terrain, all in 100-degree-plus temperatures in dusty Texas where crickets are known to roast on the summer pavement. He seems to relish the idea of exposing aides and reporters to the hothouse environment.”

Obama, on the other hand, has traveled to Hawaii every winter. The Obama daughters are vacationing at the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas this week with a full Secret Service detail, as Breitbart News reported, even as the White House claimed they could not afford to pay Secret Service agents to continue the popular White House tours for other students who are on their spring vacations in Washington, D.C.

The Obamas have gone to Martha’s Vineyard multiple times while the country was in recession and Americans were struggling to find jobs. Michelle Obama has taken a whirlwind trip to Spain and a ski trip to Aspen.

Obama took 13 vacations in his first term, which spanned all or part of 83 days. But they have been much more lavish than Bush’s. His annual vacations to Hawaii alone have cost taxpayers at least $20 million during his first term. In 2011 alone, Michelle Obama may have cost taxpayers $10 million on vacations herself. Obama’s fantasy golf outing this year cost local law enforcement in Florida a reported $78, 205.

Bush was content to work from home during his vacations. And for doing so, the mainstream media tagged him as lazy and disinterested. The Obamas gallivant around, making plenty of “time for fun,” and the mainstream media does not call them out for wasting taxpayer dollars or even for the terrible “optics.”"

(CNN) —

One of the most perverse results of the IRS’s lame, overzealous – and possibly criminal – behavior in looking into the tax-exempt applications of assorted advocacy groups is this: They’re a lot safer from scrutiny today than they were yesterday.

After this IRS mess, who in government is going to be in a rush to take on – or try to regulate – the groups they should actually be looking at as political operations, overt or covert? Um, not many.

Here’s the real deal: It’s an open secret in Washington that some of these groups, which spent huge amounts of money during presidential campaigns, are politically aligned. Whatever their “labels,” as the IRS might call them, they have been tax-exempt because they claim to be dealing with issues rather than elections. That is, policy, not political candidates. But in the heat of a general election, when policy is politics, how can anyone tell the difference?

CNN Gloria Borger

Priorities USA is a Democratic brand; Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS isn’t likely to do anything other than help the GOP. To gain their tax-exempt status, they’re supposed to promote the “social welfare.” What, exactly, does that mean?

It’s a complicated question that has become infinitely more complex in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, which allowed corporations to start donating directly to activist groups. Suddenly, the potential of getting some dibs on their considerable money grew larger. The groups designated as 501(c)(4) became the perfect pots to hold the dough, and they swelled, literally and figuratively. And the IRS didn’t do much about it.

It might have been a better idea, rather than embarking on what seems like a potentially criminal political fishing expedition, to actually take a look at the huge amounts of money being spent out in the open during the last campaign.

Why wasn’t the IRS “scrutinizing the big fish,” asks Paul Ryan, the chief lawyer for the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group that has pushed (unsuccessfully) for the IRS to investigate these groups. “The IRS needs to be focused on the big fish and not on the little Mom and Pop tea party groups, and certainly not based on their political ideology.”

Ah, but that’s exactly what happened – and, as a result, these groups that, according to some estimates, collectively spent over $250 million on candidates during the last election are still tax-exempt. Can it be that the IRS investigators were so silly, clueless and unaware of their appropriate role? Alas, yes.

But the legal eagles reading and interpreting the IRS laws are obviously a lot smarter. In its description of the 501(c)(4) category, the IRS lays it out pretty plainly. “Examples” of organizations under this statute that would be considered tax-exempt, it says, are “civic associations and volunteer fire companies.” Hmmm. Not exactly political in any way, shape or form. What’s more, the IRS also makes it clear that, in order to qualify, the burden is to prove that “your organization is organized exclusively (italics mine) to promote social welfare.”

But according to Ryan, the gremlins (i.e. the lawyers) have managed to figure out a way to get around this. The new “perceived line,” he explains, is that all these groups need to do is spend less than half of their money on politics. He calls it the “tax lawyer community interpretation.” Huh? Is that how we’re running the government?

So if these groups spend less than half of their money on politically related activism, the dough they collect from big corporations and donors can be used for campaign activities, all without disclosure of where the money came from.

This has not escaped the notice of Congress, especially Democrats who have been outgunned by Republican-leaning groups.

“We urge you to protect legitimate section 501(c)(4) entities by preventing non-conforming organizations that are focused on federal election activities from abusing the tax code,” seven Democratic U.S. senators wrote then-IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman last year.

What makes sense is for the IRS to make sure that its laws are followed. Citizens can at least expect that their government might know the difference between quashing political dissent and legitimate inquiry. Fishing expeditions on political-sounding names is just stupid, if not venal.

And now, the obvious – and perverse – consequence of the IRS bungling: It has just made the world safer for tax lawyers. Your taxpayer dollars at work.

When asked whether the nonpartisan GAI report shows a deficiency in Obama’s “leadership skills” during his White House press briefing, Carney alleged that “cabinet secretaries don’t regularly get entered into the visitor’s logs” and alleged that Obama meets “frequently” and “regularly” with Sebelius.

As Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer noted on Fox News’s Hannity on Wednesday, though, GAI examined the White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House, it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” He noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meetings off the books, Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.

The Government Accountability Institute report found that since Obamacare was signed on March 23, 2010, Obama met with “various Cabinet secretaries a total of 277 times,” but his presidential schedule did not “document a single one-on-one meeting” with Sebelius. There was, though, “one instance of Secretary Sebelius meeting jointly with the President and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner.”

According to the White House schedule, Obama “met with secretaries from the Departments of Defense, State, and Treasury for 263 (95%) out of his 277 face-to-face meetings.” Obama also had meetings with “secretaries from the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security, Interior, Labor, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs… [including] two meetings with the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus (not an official Cabinet level post).”

As Breitbart News has reported, GAI “recorded listings as they were contained on the White House and Politico presidential calendars; other forms of communications, such as private emails or phone calls, are not able to be quantified.” They also examined public records on Politico’s White House schedule

Schweizer had previously said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare

“In the case of President Obama, if you look at his calendar, there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all,” Schweizer said on Hannity on Wednesday.

In a piece he wrote for Politico on Thursday, Schweizer mentioned that “perhaps the insular White House team wanted to distance the president from the bureaucratic process in the hopes of granting him a halo of deniability if the launch failed.” He also noted “the lack of meetings reinforces the severity of what the New York Times describes as the ‘deeply dysfunctional relationship between the Department of Health and Human Services and its technology contractors, and tensions between the White House chief of staff and senior health department officials.'”

On Fox & Friends on Friday, Schweizer emphasized that ignorance should never be an excuse for a leader.

“If you’re an executive you need to know for sure–for darn sure–that the rollout is going to work and it’s going to go well,” Schweizer said. “And it’s really incumbent upon a president to contact the people that are involved in this initiative.”

That is not the case with Obama, Schweizer noted, particularly because Obama’s top advisers like Valerie Jarrett “don’t challenge” Obama’s weaknesses and “reinforce this notion that he is so brilliant.”

Schweizer said presidents consult their top advisers in times of war and peace and that “there’s just simply no excuse for him to be this detached on this important piece of legislation which is reorienting one-sixth of the national economy.”"

""Apparently the president thinks he can furlough reality when talking about the debt limit,"" Palin wrote.

Palin said Obama, who has repeatedly warned about the dangers of default if Congress does not raise the debt ceiling ahead of the October 17 deadline, is using the debt limit to scare the public.

""It’s also shameful to see him scaremongering the markets with his talk of default,"" she wrote. ""There is no way we can default if we follow the Constitution.""

Palin went on to cite the Constitution's 14th Amendment.

""The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 4, requires that we service our debt first,"" she wrote. ""We currently collect more than enough tax revenue to service our debt if we do that first.""

However, Palin suggested that Obama could face impeachment if he used the 14th Amendment to raise the debt ceiling without congressional approval — an option endorsed in a Courier-Journal op-ed by constitutional lawyer Brianne Gorod. Former President Bill Clinton and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have also urged Obama to invoke the 14th Amendment if necessary.

Palin, on the other hand, said any such action would be a ""betrayal"" of future generations.

""It’s time for the president to be honest with the American people for a change. Defaulting on our national debt is an impeachable offense, and any attempt by President Obama to unilaterally raise the debt limit without Congress is also an impeachable offense,"" Palin wrote. ""A default would also be a shameful lack of leadership, just as mindlessly increasing our debt without trying to rein in spending is a betrayal of our children and grandchildren who will be stuck with the bill."""
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-to-urge-greater-private-capital-role-in-mortgage-markets-185037682.html,,[],"Obama rejects 'socialist' label, urges bigger private role in housing market","President Barack Obama, dismissing “folks who call me a socialist,” laid out a sweeping plan Tuesday for overhauling the nation’s housing policy by giving private capital a bigger role.



Obama, whose proposals face an uphill fight to passage in the divided Congress, said it was time to wind down the role Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play in the mortgage market to limit the danger of another devastating bubble — and the risk that it could lead to massive government bailouts.



“Private capital should take a bigger role in the mortgage market. I know that sounds confusing to folks who call me a socialist,” the president said. “But I actually believe in the free market.” (His prepared remarks had invoked “folks who call me a raging socialist every day.”)



And “our housing system should operate where there’s a limited government role, and private lending should be the backbone of the housing market. And that includes, by the way, community-based lenders who view their borrowers not just as a number, but as a neighbor,” Obama said.

The president railed against massive government bailouts like those of Fannie and Freddie, which reaped vast profits in the housing boom — then got taxpayer rescue packages when the bubble burst in 2008.

“We can’t leave taxpayers on the hook for irresponsibility or bad decisions by some of these lenders or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac,” he said. “We’ve got to encourage the pursuit of profit — but the era of expecting a bailout after you pursue your profit and you don’t manage your risk well, well that puts the whole country at risk. And we’re ending those days. We’re not going to do that anymore.”

As he started his remarks, someone in the crowd at Desert Vista High School shouted out “happy birthday, Mr. President!” and the audience sang “Happy Birthday” to him. Obama, whose birthday was Aug. 4, noted that he was now 52, but “Michelle says I don’t look a day over 51.”

The school is in Phoenix, Ariz., which was particularly hard hit when the housing bubble burst. Obama noted that ""the storm hit harder here"" as the crisis ripped through the nation's economy. In recent weeks, the White House has cautiously welcomed news that the housing sector is on the mend. There have been hopeful signs in Arizona, though there's a long road ahead.

On Wednesday, Obama is to take part in a roundtable with Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff, with questions coming from across social media. To ask questions for the roundtable, which will stream live on Yahoo, visit our Homes section here."

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)

Mayor Vincent C. Gray stepped away from his role as scandal-scarred leader and into the spotlight as agitator in chief against the federal shutdown during a dramatic confrontation on the Capitol steps Wednesday with Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid.

It was a new public posture for an embattled mayor whose 2010 campaign remains under federal investigation — but who is now fighting to keep the District government in business by exempting it from the ongoing shutdown.

“Sir, we are not a department of the government,” the mayor told Reid after concluding his news event and then crashing another about 50 yards away, where Reid and other Senate Democrats were talking to reporters. “We’re simply trying to be able to spend our own money.”

Reid (Nev.) responded defensively in front of a bank of cameras and reporters: “I’m on your side. Don’t screw it up, okay? Don’t screw it up.”

The tension came after the Republican-controlled House voted last week to pass a bill allowing the District to use its locally raised tax funds to maintain operations until Dec. 15. Democrats, including Reid and President Obama, have held fast in opposition to piecemeal funding bills, saying Republicans must come to a deal to fund the entire government, not just favored segments.

Caption Nearly half of the lawmakers have refused or donated their shutdown salaries, with many regarding it unseemly to collect a paycheck while their actions deprived more than 800,000 Americans of theirs. But some lawmakers have been vocal about their plans to keep their pay. Here are a few. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) Murray spokesman Matt McAlvanah said the senator previously supported a measure that would have suspended all lawmakers’ pay during any such shutdown. That measure passed the Senate but was never taken up by the House. “She continues to support that approach,” McAlvanah told the Associated Press. Melina Mara/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

But the national Democrats’ posture against a stand-alone District funding bill has stoked the flames of the city’s long-standing gripes about its treatment at the hands of Congress, which controls all District appropriations, even those related to locally generated tax receipts. It has placed leaders of the overwhelmingly Democratic city at odds with national politicians from their party, who have generally supported local priorities in the past but have on occasion sacrificed the city’s interests in national political fights.

The moment also raised new questions about Gray’s political future. He must decide in coming weeks whether he will seek a second term in 2014; his impassioned defense of the District on Wednesday offered new evidence that he continues to consider an electoral bid despite the ongoing federal corruption investigation into his 2010 campaign. Gray has not been charged and has denied any wrongdoing in the investigation, which centers on a D.C. businessman who allegedly funded a half-million-dollar shadow campaign on the mayor’s behalf.

The shutdown, meanwhile, gives the media — and the mayor — something else to talk about.

To manage the crisis — during which the District is unable to spend its roughly $6 billion in yearly local revenue — Gray and the D.C. government have tapped a $144 million contingency cash reserve fund to keep its 32,000 employees on the job since the federal shutdown took effect Oct. 1. But the city has frozen many of its outgoing payments to conserve the contingency account, which is expected to be exhausted sometime next week.

At their own news conference on the Capitol grounds Wednesday, Gray and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) highlighted the partisan contradictions while detailing the drastic effect of the cash crunch on the D.C. government — including schools, health care, services for the disabled and programs for senior citizens.

“Democrats, at this critical moment, have abandoned their long-held principles,” Norton said, calling it “shameful . . . to hold the city’s local funds hostage to make a federal point.”

In a particular jab at Democrats, the event featured remarks from Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who called on Reid and his allies to pass a D.C. funding bill — and at one point alluded to a favored bit of tea party rhetoric.

Why are some Republicans backing a clean continuing resolution to fund the government? In Play takes a closer look at the districts they represent for clues. (The Washington Post)

Issa commented that he couldn’t help but notice that the city’s license plates say “Taxation Without Representation,” then added, “Perhaps they should say, ‘Federal government, don’t tread on me’ instead.”

Gray thanked Issa for his support and told a supportive crowd of hundreds to push Democrats to “act now” on a D.C. funding bill. As soon as the event wrapped up, Gray walked over to the separate event being held by Senate Democrats on the east steps of the Capitol.

Gray cut his way through a bank of TV cameras and walked up to Reid and began speaking with him as senators from Maryland and Virginia explained to reporters the economic hardship facing the two states bordering the nation’s capital.

Democratic Sens. Benjamin L. Cardin (Md.) and Timothy M. Kaine (Va.), in particular, had to raise their voices to be heard over ralliers who had attended Gray’s event and then turned their attention toward the senators, yelling chants of “Free D.C.!”

Reid took questions from reporters, including one about whether the Senate would vote on a D.C. funding measure. “Talk to the Republicans. They’re the ones objecting,” Reid said.

With cameras rolling, Gray, standing a few paces to Reid’s right, stared at the Senate leader. As the news conference concluded and Reid began to walk back into the Capitol, Gray approached the Senate leader again and offered his remarks, prompting the “Don’t screw it up” comment.

Local television reporters began shouting at Reid: “What does ‘Don’t screw it up’ mean?”

Reid ignored them and, surrounded by aides and security guards, walked away, at one point telling reporters that “of course” he supports giving the District the budgetary flexibility needed to continue operating during the partial shutdown.

Gray said afterward that the encounter had been entirely unplanned and that he did not know that Senate Democrats would be having a media event.

Norton left a few minutes later after being approached by Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.), who was heard saying, “We’ve got your back.”

After Reid left the steps, Gray got into a heated exchange with Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who attempted to explain the Hill Democrats’ position to him.

http://news.yahoo.com/ap-photos-prospectors-seek-fortune-legal-pot-054947248.html,,[],AP Photos: Prospectors seek fortune in legal pot,"SEATTLE (AP) — Dot-bong, Marijuana Inc., the Green Rush: Call it what you will, the burgeoning legal marijuana industry in Washington state is drawing pot prospectors of all stripes.

Microsoft veterans and farmers, real estate agents and pastry chefs, former journalists and longtime pot growers alike are seeking new challenges — and fortunes — in the production, processing and sale of a drug that's been illegal for generations.

In Colorado, the only other state to legalize marijuana, existing medical marijuana dispensaries can begin selling for recreational use in January. But in Washington, where sales are expected to begin in late spring, the industry is open to nearly anyone — provided they've lived in the state for three months, pass a background check and raise any money from within the state. Washington on Monday began accepting license applications from those eager to jump in. By midafternoon, hundreds had applied.

Click through the portraits, or read through the profiles, of those hoping to make their mark in the new world of legal weed.

THE PIG FARMER

Bruce King says he was a 22-year-old high-school dropout when Microsoft hired him as its 80th employee in 1986. A software engineer, he eventually left and started or acquired two other companies — telephone adult chat and psychic hotlines — but he really wanted to farm.

He found a management team to handle his business and started breeding pigs north of Seattle. After Washington legalized marijuana last fall, he looked at pot as any other crop. The potential margins were ""fabulously attractive,"" he says. He found a farm with a 25,000-square-foot barn for a marijuana operation.

King, 50, doesn't like pot himself, but says, ""If people are going to eat a stupid drug, they should eat my stupid drug."" He likens it to running a psychic hotline when he's never had a reading. ""You don't have to like Brussels sprouts to grow them.""

POT & PATISSERIES

Marla Molly Poiset had swapped her three-decade-old home-furnishing store and interior design business in Colorado for a life of world travel when she learned some devastating news: Her eldest daughter had leukemia.

Story continues

She suspended her travels to help her daughter and her family through the ordeal. She then continued her tour, attending cooking school in Paris. Poiset, 59, graduated last spring, and had an idea: ""Blending my newfound patisserie skills with medical cannabis,"" she says.

So she abandoned Paris for Seattle, where she's been developing recipes for marijuana-infused chocolate truffles for recreational and medical use. Her aim is to create ""a beautiful package"" like French chocolate or pastries for people like her daughter.

They could ""ingest discreetly and enjoy life, rather than everything being in a pill,"" she says.

420-NINER

If legal pot is the Green Rush, Daniel Curylo has some unique credentials: He's been an actual prospector.

He helped put himself through college working for a company that flew him into northern British Columbia and the Yukon with a map, a compass and a heavy backpack. He'd pan for gold and take soil samples. Another source of income in those days? Growing and selling marijuana with a few other political science majors.

A former techie and ex-house flipper, Curylo, 41, says his background in ""business development and taking risks"" is perfect for the legal pot world.

He has invested $400,000 so far. His goal? A cannabis business park northwest of Olympia that would feature his growing operation, Cascade Crops, as well as retail stores run by his mother, father and aunt.

'THE POSTER CHILD FOR ANTI-CANNABIS'

Angel Swanson was raised on the South Side of Chicago by a mother who warned: ""If you see drugs, run.""

Decades later, the businesswoman and real estate agent found herself in Washington state with a husband, seven children and a strong bias against illegal drugs — ""the poster child for anti-cannabis,"" she says.

That is, until one of her daughters, who had serious digestive issues and had never weighed more than 100 pounds, came home from college one day and ate a full plate of food. The girl had tried pot-laced cookies, which stimulated her appetite. Swanson lost it.

""Do you have any idea the sacrifices that have been made for you to go to college?"" she remembers saying.

Swanson, 52, did some research and couldn't find a reason for her daughter not to use weed. She and her husband opened a medical marijuana dispensary, The Cannabis Emporium, near Tacoma. They now want to sell recreational pot, but hope to continue to serve patients — a challenge, since stores will be barred from trumpeting pot's therapeutic benefits.

FROM MBA TO THC

Todd Spaits and Bilye (sounds like ""Billy"") Miller are more gym-and-yoga than smoke-and-cough. The couple doesn't use pot — ""I much prefer a glass of scotch,"" Spaits says — but they say they know a good business opportunity when they see one.

The pair previously worked in online marketing in San Diego, and Spaits has a master's in business administration. Their most recent startup is skyfu.com, which helps restaurants monitor what people are saying about them on social media.

Spaits, 39, also helps judge business plan competitions and believes his skills are perfectly honed to run a successful pot store.

He and Miller, 38, who has also worked as a bartender, are excited about Washington's grand experiment. They sought advice from friends who operate medical dispensaries in California to help draw up a revenue model. They're seeking a retail license in Kirkland, east of Seattle.

THE PATH FROM ADDICTION

It started with small doses that eased the aches of restaurant work. But over time, Yevgeniy ""Eugene"" Frid found himself addicted to prescription painkillers. ""It completely envelops your whole life.""

He tried to quit many times, and when he finally did, he says, cannabis played a huge role — displacing the opiates with a substance much gentler on the body.

Frid, 28, quit his job doing business management and marketing for a video game company when a friend asked him to help start a medical marijuana dispensary. A Greener Today opened in Seattle in 2012 and now serves about 4,000 people.

Frid says his most gratifying work is helping patients get off opiates the way he did, so he has mixed feelings about applying for a recreational retail license. The future of unregulated medical marijuana in Washington is dim — many state officials see it as a threat to the heavily taxed recreational system. Some medical dispensary operators believe they have little choice but to convert to the recreational market.

""We don't know what's happening,"" Frid says.

THE SECURITY GUARD

For a guy with a uniform and a gun, Steve Smith was unusually welcome at medical marijuana dispensaries. Of course, he was a security guard, not a federal drug agent.

Smith, 29, had a background in food marketing. His father worked for a large grocery cooperative in California. He earned a degree in agriculture business management and started marketing organic and natural products for a food broker. He liked thinking he was helping people eat better.

A friend who was working in security suggested Smith do the same. Looking to keep busy and make some extra money, he took his training and became a certified security guard. The company that hired him happened to assign him to a couple of medical marijuana dispensaries.

""You can only work as a guard for so long before you want to open your own shop,"" he says. He wants to apply to open two retail marijuana shops near Tacoma.

THE SECRET SODA

Cecilia Sivertson worked for eight years as a paralegal in the prosecutor's office for Washington's most populous county. She helped make sure people paid child support and tracked down deadbeat dads. It was a rewarding, stressful and sometimes depressing job.

After her husband died in a car accident in 2001, she decided she needed a more upbeat line of work and joined a labeling business.

Sivertson, 55, has epilepsy and arthritis in her hands. About two years ago, she says, she noticed improvement in both when she started using marijuana. Last spring, she began making products infused with cannabis oil under her ""Nana's Secret"" line. Her specialty is pot-infused soda — with the soda concentrate produced by a client of the labeling business.

The Alabama native says she's applying to become a licensed marijuana processor so her sodas and other items can be sold in retail pot stores.

CANNABIS: A FORCE FOR GOOD

Paul Schrag has a simple philosophy: He hopes to use his skills to do the most good in the world.

For a while, that meant working in journalism, enticed by its power to shape public discourse. Before being laid off in 2009, he worked as a reporter for the Business Examiner, a biweekly publication in Tacoma.

Nowadays, it means working in the pot industry.

The 40-year-old says he's been growing marijuana since 1999 and uses it to treat lifelong neck pain. He began working at a medical marijuana collective, where part of his job entails coming up with a marketing and public education plan to help erase any stigma associated with cannabis use.

He believes the medical and social benefits of the plant are only just starting to be understood. He plans to work as a grower's vice president of marketing, research and development, and believes his knowledge of pot and business will help.

""I'm one of those rare cats that get both,"" he says.

Authorities said the website had been used by “several thousand drug dealers” since January 2011 to distribute hundreds of kilograms of narcotics with sales exceeding $1 billion.

Federal authorities said they had seized Bitcoin worth about $3.6 million, which they said is the largest seizure ever of the virtual currency.

QUIZ: How much do you know about the Bitcoin?

The FBI also seized the Silk Road website, which customers could access only after running the anonymity software Tor, which encrypts Web traffic and makes it difficult to determine who’s running the site, or visiting it.

Federal prosecutors said the website was operated by a man who called himself “Dread Pirate Roberts,” who was actually 29-year-old Ross William Ulbricht. FBI agents arrested Ulbricht on Tuesday in San Francisco, said Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, which is handling the case.

In an affidavit filed in court, an FBI agent said Ulbricht had operated the Silk Road website since January 2011, using it to sell cocaine, heroin, LSD and other controlled substances to customers in the United States.

FBI special agent Christopher Tarbell also said Ulbricht had attempted to orchestrate the murder of an unidentified Silk Road user who had threatened to expose the identities of thousands of the website’s customers. The affidavit did not say whether the murder-for-hire plot was carried out.

Matt wanted to have internal controls in place. And we thought: This was a legitimate business. If the State of California deems it legitimate, we want to be the best at it.”

Mr. Davies’s accountant, David M. Silva, said he set up spreadsheets to keep track of inventories, revenues and expenses. “I’ve been a C.P.A. for 30 years,” Mr. Silva said. “What I saw was a guy who was trying to run an operation in an up-and-up way.”

The federal authorities said they stumbled across the operation after two men were spotted apparently breaking into Mr. Davies’s 30,000-square-foot Stockton warehouse. The police said they smelled marijuana plants. Federal agents conducted a raid and confiscated 1,962 plants and 200 pounds of marijuana.

Mr. Davies, who is free on $100,000 bail, greeted visitors to his gated home by asking them to speak softly while walking through the entryway so as not to awaken his sleeping infant. He called out to his wife when asked when he was indicted: “Hey, Molly — we were indicted on your birthday, right? July 18.”

Mr. Davies referred to marijuana as “medicine,” and himself as a turnaround expert.

“We were basically pharmacists for medical marijuana — everything was in full compliance with state law,” he said. “We paid our employees. We paid overtime. We had people going for unemployment if we fired them.”

“Why are they coming after me?” he asked. “If they have such a problem with California, why can’t they sue California?”

Stephanie Horton, 25, who went to work for Mr. Davies after going to one of his dispensaries to obtain medical marijuana to help her deal with ovarian and cervical cancer, said she was devastated by the arrest of employers she described as among the best she had ever had — not to mention the loss of her job."

Bill faces stiff opposition in the Kentucky House

Governor also is worried about police ability to differentiate between it%2C marijuana

Hemp has less than 0.3%25 THC vs. marijuana%27s 3%25 to 15%25

FRANKFORT, Ky. — An effort to allow Kentucky farmers to grow hemp for a variety of products passed the state Senate on Thursday — and took a small step toward federal acceptance as well.

But it still faces steep odds, including skepticism from the governor and Kentucky State Police and the distinct possibility of being gutted in the state House.

Backers of Kentucky Senate Bill 50 say Thursday's 31-6 vote could make Kentucky among the first in the nation to legalize the crop, potentially creating thousands of hemp-related jobs growing and processing the plant's fiber and seeds.

But Gov. Steve Beshear said he has doubts about legalizing the far weaker relative of marijuana as an industrial crop, citing state police concerns about complicating marijuana enforcement efforts. Even if the state legalizes hemp, the federal government would have to distinguish it from marijuana before cultivation could be allowed.

The federal government took a step in that direction Thursday when Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, both Kentucky Republicans, joined Oregon's Democratic senators in sponsoring a bill that would remove hemp from the federal controlled substance list and define it as a nondrug — as long as it contains less than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol, better known as THC and the active ingredient in marijuana.

Marijuana has 3% to 15% THC.

""I am extremely proud of the Kentucky state Senate for its commitment to job creation in Kentucky,"" said Agriculture Commissioner James Comer, who has led the campaign to pass the bill along with Paul.

Kentucky would become the ninth state to remove barriers to the production of industrial hemp, according to Vote Hemp, a national group seeking to legalize the crop. Seven states — Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Vermont and Washington — have introduced bills have introduced bills so far this year.

""Today's bipartisan vote is the first step toward more opportunities for our farmers and jobs for Kentuckians,"" Comer said.

The bill now goes to the state House, where Speaker Greg Stumbo said it will have a ""tougher time.""

House may rewrite

Stumbo has suggested the bill may be overhauled to remove the rules for growing hemp and replace them with an economic impact study. Stumbo, a Democrat from Prestonsburg, Ky., and former state attorney general, has said he doesn't believe hemp has a market.

""It's not that we are saying, 'No,' "" he said. ""We are saying that the evidence doesn't show enough of a market to override the concerns that the law enforcement community has.""

Beshear voiced similar concerns before the Senate vote.

""We really don't know anything about whether there's going to be a market for it yet,"" Beshear said. ""The other concern is law enforcement. ... We've got a big drug problem in Kentucky, and I just want to make sure we don't do anything that will make that problem any worse.""

The Kentucky State Police, the most vocal critic of the bill, didn't comment on the vote. The state police argues that allowing hemp production would hamper efforts to eradicate marijuana because the plants look very similar.

""Our position's very well known,"" Sgt. Rick Saint Blancard said, adding that the agency will enforce whatever laws are passed.

McConnell and Paul's U.S. Senate legislation is similar to a bill filed in the U.S. House last week by Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who represents much of northern Kentucky.

The House bill has 28 Democratic and Republican co-sponsors.

The debate Thursday on the Kentucky Senate floor mirrored previous arguments, both in Kentucky and across the nation.

""This issue in the big scheme of things is a nonissue,"" said state Sen. Chris Girdler, a Republican from Somerset, Ky., who questioned its economic benefit in voting against the bill.

Hemp used to be used for making ropes and sailcloth until the federal government began restricting production after the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act. After World War II, its cultivation was phased out across the country. From the end of the Civil War until 1912, almost all hemp in the U.S. was grown in Kentucky, according to Oregon State University research.

State Sen. David Givens, a Republican from Greensburg, Ky., said he would prefer to approve a small, controlled growing study while the economics of hemp could be analyzed.

Seeking a chance

""Give us the opportunity to see how this works,"" said bill sponsor Republican Paul Hornback of Shelbyville, Ky., who also is a farmer. He said any study would be limited because growing the product isn't allowed in the United States.

But he said he's already heard from two companies interested in Kentucky taking action, including a Canadian hemp processor that would relocate to Kentucky and another that interested in using hemp fiber for concrete.

""If you're not first, you're probably last,"" Hornback said. China is the world's largest producer of hemp.

SB 50 would require growers to be licensed annually and undergo an Agriculture Department background check.

Each licensee would be required to plant a minimum of 10 acres, a provision meant to keep licenses from people who are not serious about the effort.

Growers would have to keep sales contracts for three years and provide names of hemp buyers to the department."

The Associated Press

Members of the Ogala Sioux Tribe are voting Tues. to decide whether to permit alcohol on their reservation

Critics of the legalization say it would only exacerbate the reservation%27s problems

Proponents argue that profits would be used for education and treatment centers

PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) — Jobs and confidence are in short supply on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, where the rugged beauty of South Dakota's Badlands contrasts sharply with dilapidated houses, rusted-out vehicles and trash in the streets — symbols of troubles blamed largely on bootlegged alcohol from a tiny Nebraska town.

Members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe are voting all day Tuesday on whether to give up the fight against bootlegging by allowing alcohol to be sold on the reservation — the last place in the state's American Indian territory where it's not allowed. Profits would be used for education, detoxification and treatment centers, for which there is currently little to no funding.

""Alcohol is here. They're kidding themselves if they think we're a dry reservation,"" said Larry Eagle Bull, a recovering alcoholic and one of nine council members who supported the vote. ""Prohibition is not working. Alcohol is going to stay. We need to get our people educated about it.""

Critics say legalization would only exacerbate the reservation's troubles. Alcohol is blamed for some of the highest rates of domestic abuse, suicide, infant mortality, unemployment and violent crime in Indian Country.

Both sides in the debate agree something must be done to limit the scourge of alcohol on the Lakota people. They also share a goal of putting out of business the current main suppliers of booze for tribal members — four stores in Whiteclay, Neb., two miles south of Pine Ridge, that sell millions of cans of beer a year.

There are 43,000 tribal members, and 26,000 — including a large number of children — live on the reservation. The tribe has distributed 4,000 ballots, and that would represent a good turnout compared to past elections.

Many tribal members live on Whiteclay's barren streets to avoid arrest on the reservation for being drunk. Some people try to barter vegetables, electronics and other things for alcohol. One man recently had a store clerk repeatedly try to run through a sale for a couple of bottles on his debit card, but the transaction was rejected due to insufficient funds.

The stores have posted fliers urging customers to contact their tribal council representative if they don't want the businesses to close.

Owners didn't want to comment on Tuesday's vote, though Stuart Kozal, co-owner of the Jumping Eagle, said tribal members seem to be evenly divided.

""I think the vote, one way or the other, is going to be close,"" he said.

Aloysius White Dress, one of Whiteclay's homeless, said even though he drinks alcohol, he opposes legalization because of the damage it has done.

""There's too much drunks on the reservation,"" he said. ""People are miserable on the reservation.""

Federal law bans the sale of alcohol on Native American reservations unless the tribal council allows it. Pine Ridge, the only dry reservation in South Dakota, legalized alcohol for two months in 1970s, but the ban was quickly restored. An attempt to lift prohibition in 2004 also failed.

Opponents of the latest effort, including tribal president Bryan Brewer, believe a vote in favor of legal sales is a vote for alcoholism and the problem only will get worse.

""It's destroying our families and children,"" he said. ""It's affected every family on the reservation. If it's legal, I anticipate the use will go up. Abuse of women and children will go up. A lot of people are saying we'll have all this money for treatment, and that's not true.""

Most profits from alcohol sales would go to the distributors, Brewer said. The tribe, ultimately, would have very little left to fund meaningful treatment and education, he said.

A 14-page tribal council draft of the law offers no specifics about funding or required qualifications for the people who would run the operation. The proposed law calls for a new department and a full-time director to administer and enforce the law. A new commission comprised of nine members, one from each reservation district, also would be created to guide the director, buy the alcohol, open and operate the liquor stores, hire employees and investigate violations.

Brewer said there are problems with the document that need to be resolved if Tuesday's vote succeeds. Eagle Bull acknowledged it would be amended and a hearty debate would follow legalization before any law takes effect.

The council's plan calls for two detoxification facilities, one in the eastern part of the reservation and one in the west, and treatment and counseling programs for adults, youth and families.

Tribal members would lead the effort, Eagle Bull said.

""They'd rather hear it from one of their own who has dealt with the effects of alcohol,"" he said."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-carlsen/how-legalizing-marijuana_b_777837.html,2010-11-02 15:55:31-04:00,[],How Legalizing Marijuana Would Weaken Mexican Drug Cartels,"In the months leading up to today's vote on California's Proposition 19 to legalize recreational use of marijuana, opponents of legalization have issued a barrage of confused and contradictory arguments. Their aim is to somehow debunk the common-sense fact that legal sourcing erodes the black-market profits of organized crime.

The most recent argument thrown out in the anti-Prop. 19 campaign, claims that the California marijuana market is insignificant to Mexican drug traffickers.

That argument was blown out of the water on October 18 when the Mexican Army and police seized 134 tons of marijuana, wrapped and ready to be smuggled from Tijuana across the border. The huge cache was estimated to be worth at least $338 million dollars on the street. Mexican authorities guessed that it was owned by the nation's most powerful drug-trafficking organization, the Sinaloa Cartel.

Even if much of that is distributed to other states, the sheer size of the potential shipment shows that the U.S. marijuana market for Mexican traffickers, calculated at $20 billion a year, is well worth fighting for. Since before Prop. 19 came along, reports showed that Mexico's drug cartels were concerned about how U.S. production and legalization of medical marijuana cut into their profits.

Prohibition creates the underground market that generates their economic, political and military strength. With the drop in income from marijuana sales, cartels have less money for buying arms and politicians, or recruiting young people into the trade.

The drug cartels also consider the marijuana black market worth killing for. Just days after the historic bust, thirteen young men were massacred at a drug rehabilitation center. An anonymous voice came over police radio saying the act was ""a taste of Juarez"" and that up to 135 people could be murdered in retaliation for the bust--one per ton.

Although calculating Mexican cartel earnings from marijuana sales will always be a guessing game, it's indisputable that as long as it's illegal every penny of those earnings goes into the pockets of organized crime. From the peasant who converts his land from corn to pot to feed his family, to the truckdriver who takes on a bonus cargo, to the Mexican and U.S. border officials who open ""windows"" in international customs controls, to the youth gangs who sell in U.S. cities--all are sucked into a highly organized and brutal system of contraband.

Legalization in part of the world's leading market would take a huge chunk out of this transnational business.

The government of Mexican president Felipe Calderon, along with Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos, has redoubled efforts in U.S. media and international forums to oppose the California legalization measure. This is not surprising. These two nations are deeply entrenched in a military-model drug war that has channeled a combined total of nearly $9 billion dollars in U.S. government funds to their governments. As in any war, powerful political and economic interests are at stake in perpetuating the drug war.

It's interesting to see what they say though. Neither President Santos nor Calderon argue that legalization will strengthen drug cartels. Instead, both complain that legalization will erode their drug war by heightening the contradiction between violent crackdowns on growers and traffickers in their countries and the lax attitude toward consumption of marijuana in the United States.

At a recent meeting of the Tuxtla Dialogue in Cartagena, Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos said, ""It's confusing for our people to see that, while we lose lives and invest resources in the fight against drug trafficking, in consuming countries initiatives like California's referendum are being promoted.""

It's about time that contradiction was exposed. But the way to resolve it is not to increase fumigation operations that destroy peasant livelihoods and the environment and seizures of marijuana shipments that lead to the deaths of innocent civilians, while further criminalizing consumption in the U.S. The way to resolve it is to halt ineffective measures to stop marijuana use, and focus scarce resources on attacking the financial and violent aspects of transnational organized crime, and providing employment and services for vulnerable sectors. Legalization of marijuana, in addition to reducing the economic base of the cartels, frees up resources to do just that.

In a report from the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy former presidents of Mexico, Colombia, Brazil called for discussion on legalizing marijuana, noting, ""Prohibitionist policies based on the eradication of production and on the disruption of drug flows as well as on the criminalization of consumption have not yielded the expected results. We are farther than ever from the announced goal of eradicating drugs."" They add that corruption and violence have increased throughout the region as result of the strategy.

The war on drugs launched by President Felipe Calderon has led to more than 30,000 drug-related deaths since late 2006 and the skyrocketing of human rights violations committed by security forces. Last week an international Forum against militarization and violence in Ciudad Juarez, the epicenter of the drug war, was disrupted when police shot a peace protester.

As Calderon insists that there is ""no alternative"" to the militarized drug war, a recent survey shows that three-fourths of Mexicans polled believe the drug war is failing. Particularly in border towns, grassroots organizations have formed to protest the violence and high social costs. Meanwhile, the government has largely bypassed non-violent ways to reduce the power of cartels, such as legalization, anti-money laundering efforts and social programs to strengthen affected communities in favor of the military/police model supported by the U.S. government.

Organized crime is a business. Reducing demand through providing legal sources hurts that business. Hardline rhetoric and wars of statistics cannot change that fundamental equation.

A California initiative that would legalize, regulate and tax recreational marijuana may be coming soon to the state ballot after a positive review by the state attorney general. But the real news is how much money legalization could bring to the cash-strapped state government.

California Attorney General Kamala Harris last week released a summary of the Marijuana Control, Legalization and Revenue Act, which backers are pushing for a spot in November's election.

Though not an endorsement, Harris' generally positive title and summary of the initiative explained that it would legalize under state law marijuana use, growth, cultivation, possession, transportation, storage and sale. It also would create a regulatory commission, apply sales taxes, allocate revenue and prohibit discrimination against marijuana users and businesses.

The summary says a legislative analyst estimated the initiative would save the state ""hundreds of millions of dollars.""

Merry Christmas, indeed!

Here's what the fiscal analysis had to say:

Reduced costs in the low hundreds of millions of dollars annually to state and local governments related to enforcing certain marijuana-related offenses, handling the related criminal cases in the court system, and incarcerating and supervising certain marijuana offenders. Potential net additional tax revenues in the low hundreds of millions of dollars annually related to the production and sale of marijuana, a portion of which is required to be spent on education, health care, public safety, drug abuse education and treatment, and the regulation of commercial marijuana activities.

As LA Weekly noted, there was a slight speed bump in the language of the initiative. It originally read that the law ""could"" protect people under age 21 from using marijuana, instead of ""shall"" protect them. An amended version is awaiting a title and summary from the attorney general, expected to be released on Jan. 31.

""We're expecting a title and summary nearly identical to the one that was just released, if not even more supportive,"" Dave Hodges, one of initiative's primary backers, told The Huffington Post. ""There isn't any change that would affect the title and summary that was released.""

If Hodges is correct, the new title and summary would pave the way for advocates to gather signatures supporting adding the initiative to the November ballot.

The move could come at a good time for California, which has struggled with crippling budget deficits over the past decade. Though the state has seen notable financial success under Gov. Jerry Brown's Proposition 30, which temporarily raises taxes, the pot initiative could add much-needed cushioning when the proposition expires in 2018."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/31/marijuana-chain-brand-jamen-shively_n_3366704.html,2013-05-31 00:00:00,['Ap Huffpost'],Marijuana Chain Planned By Jamen Shively; Investment Will Total $100 Million Over 3 Years,"SEATTLE -- Washington state businessmen who say they're trying to create the first national brand of marijuana received some heartfelt support Thursday from the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox.

Fox appeared at a news conference in Seattle, where he recounted how the war on drugs has ravaged his country and praised the states of Washington and Colorado for voting to legalize the recreational use of marijuana last fall.

At the news conference, former Microsoft manager Jamen Shively discussed his plans to launch a new marijuana brand named for his great-great grandfather, Diego Pellicer. He says his company is joining forces with a Washington state chain of medical marijuana dispensaries run by John Davis, the Northwest Patient Resource Center, as well as dispensaries in Colorado and California.

Shively's planned investment will total $100 million over three years, according to the Stranger.

""This historic step today is to be observed and evaluated closely by all of us, because it is a game changer,"" Fox said. ""I applaud this group that has the courage to move ahead. They have the vision, they are clear where they're going, and I'm sure they're going to get there.""

Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who was Mexico's president from 2000-06, specified that he's not involved in the venture. He appeared at Shively's invitation. The two first met 13 years ago, when a company Shively used to run was opening a computer center in Sinaloa and Fox appeared at the inauguration, Shively said.

Shively described grand visions for his pot brand – hundreds of millions of dollars in investments, tens of millions of customers, more than 1,000 jobs just at Diego Pellicer's Seattle headquarters.

""Yes, we are Big Marijuana,"" he announced.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last March, the company wrote that it had raised $125,000 of an anticipated $625,000. Shively suggested those numbers were outdated, but did not provide different figures.

Washington and Colorado expect to begin allowing marijuana sales to adults over 21 at state-licensed stores beginning next year, but marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and the Justice Department has repeatedly said it can continue to prosecute large-scale, privately owned marijuana operations even when they comply with state law.

It isn't clear how Shively's plans for a national marijuana brand might be accomplished without running afoul of federal laws regarding the distribution of an illegal substance or conspiracy to distribute an illegal substance. He and Davis said no money from their business will travel interstate, nor will the marijuana itself, but neither of those factors would necessarily shield them from arrest.

Shively insisted that his deals with the dispensaries are structured in such a way as to minimize any risk of federal prosecution, but neither he nor Davis would explain how. Shively said he had acquired certain ""rights"" related to the dispensaries, and made the plan sound like a marketing agreement by which the stores, beginning next month, would be re-branded as Diego Pellicer.

""Neither Diego Pellicer nor our investors are exposed to any significant risk, in terms of criminal risk,"" Shively said. ""In terms of criminal risk, that is vastly mitigated. ... We're making strategic investments, but we're making them in such a way that they are not in violation of either federal or state law.""

Asked how his plan didn't constitute a federal conspiracy to distribute marijuana, Shively described his operation as ""a conspiracy to obey the law.""

His securities lawyer, Mike Moyer of the prominent Seattle firm of Dorsey and Whitney LLC, declined to elaborate.

Fox urged the reporters present to maintain a focus on the important issues at hand: the failure of the drug war, the thousands of lives lost, and the better alternative offered by legalization. He noted he'd rather be sitting at a table next to Shively than the notorious cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.

""This is a much better option, no doubt,"" he said.

Based in Florida, GEO is a nationwide political player. It makes the majority of its contributions in its home state, but it's been known to contribute to federal and state elections in places like California, New Mexico, Virginia, and, believe it or not, Indiana.

Over the last decade, GEO Group has spent more than $3 million in direct campaign contributions, the majority of that money going to Republican candidates and causes. This is most likely on the low end of estimates, too, since many state contribution records are either incomplete or missing altogether.

Indiana is eighth on the list of states where GEO does its spending, as it's sunk more than $60,000 into state elections there. It specifically contributed $12,500 to the 2012 Pence campaign, which doesn't seem like much without context. That contribution made GEO one of Pence's top 30 corporate contributors, ranking in front of US Steel Corp, Caterpillar, and Koch Industries.

The group has also thrown its financial weight behind Brian Bosma, the Indiana State House Speaker, who has been quoted as saying:



“As an entry drug, I think marijuana is more powerful than it’s given credit for,” he said. “I know some states have taken that step (to legalize it), but I don’t find it advisable at this point.”

During the first year of operation, the 2,416-bed prison is expected to house approximately 1,068 security level 1-4 adult male inmates for the Indiana Department of Correction and generate approximately $12.8 million. Under the terms of the contract, GEO will be paid for a guaranteed average daily population of 961 inmates, or 90 per cent of the initial contract capacity, following a ramp-up period of approximately four weeks.

State Police responded to the prison around 2 p.m., where inmates set fires outside the cell blocks. Mayor Tom Nipp described the situation as, ""A full-scale riot."" Nipp says police have set up a perimeter around the prison, assuring residents that no one has escaped. Video taken by Chopper 13 shows inmates standing near small flames that appear to be mattresses set on fire. The Indiana Department of Corrections confirms the disturbance involved prisoners from Indiana and prisoners from Arizona. Tear gas was used by correctional officers and State Police to gain control. Police moved hundreds of prisoners outside to an area along the outer fence line while cell blocks were searched for others involved in the riots.

Business has been quite good for GEO in Indiana. In 2005, they signed a contract to operate a prison in New Castle. That first contract reads like many that GEO signs with its depraved partners. Indiana guaranteed a prison population roughly 90% of capacity. Or, as the state's excited press release put it:Some might argue that private prison companies are worth it. After all, the private market is better equipped to handle things effectively and efficiently, right? Wrong The Indiana governor wants to make possession of small amounts of marijuana a felony because, apparently, we aren't nearly hard enough on those non-violent pot smokers. Or something. Lurking beneath the surface is an insidious actor. The unmentioned hand of political influence guides his actions, as prison corporations like GEO own their candidates and wreck state criminal codes."

In recent years, several states have passed laws that decriminalized marijuana, and a majority of Americans now support legalizing the drug. Yet between 2001 and 2010, there were over 8 million pot arrests in the U.S. What's worse, the authorities making the arrests were targeting black Americans far more than whites.

According to a new study from the American Civil Liberties Union, which tracked marijuana arrests by race and county in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, black and white Americans use marijuana at about the same rate. However, blacks were nearly four times as likely than whites to be arrested on charges of marijuana possession in 2010.

In Washington D.C., Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois, blacks were 7.5 to 8.5 times more likely than whites to be arrested for possessing pot.

Most of the people being arrested weren't drug kingpins. Fifty-two percent of all drug arrests in 2010 were for marijuana, and according to the ACLU's analysis, most of the arrestees were in possession of small amounts of the drug.

Having a black president hasn't eased this racial disparity, either. During President Barack Obama’s first three years in office, the arrest rate for marijuana possession was about 5 percent higher than the average rate under President George W. Bush, The New York Times reported.

Obama's first term in office was also marked by an economic recession, a soaring deficit (due to the cost of the Bush tax cuts and two wars) and numerous budget battles that threatened to cause state and federal government shutdowns. In the midst of this, the costs of the War on Marijuana continued to rise.

In 2010, states spent an estimated $3.6 billion enforcing marijuana possession laws, which was a 30 percent increase from a decade earlier. Such a large amount of funding provides a strong financial incentive for police to make arrests and boost their crime-fighting statistics, the ACLU reported. In fact, that same year, more people were arrested for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined.

""In the past 75 years we have seen mounting evidence of the benign nature of the marijuana plant, and its tremendous potential for medical development,"" Amanda Reiman, policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance said in 2012. ""But the rampant misinformation about the effects of marijuana USE is dwarfed by the lifetime of suffering that a marijuana CONVICTION can bring.""

The animal, a Pacific fisher, had been poisoned by an anticoagulant in rat poisons like d-Con. Since then, six other poisoned fishers have been found. Two endangered spotted owls tested positive. Mourad W. Gabriel, a scientist at the University of California, Davis, concluded that the contamination began when marijuana growers in deep forests spread d-Con to protect their plants from wood rats.

That news has helped growers acknowledge, reluctantly, what their antagonists in law enforcement have long maintained: like industrial logging before it, the booming business of marijuana is a threat to forests whose looming dark redwoods preside over vibrant ecosystems.

Hilltops have been leveled to make room for the crop. Bulldozers start landslides on erosion-prone mountainsides. Road and dam construction clogs some streams with dislodged soil. Others are bled dry by diversions. Little water is left for salmon whose populations have been decimated by logging."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

For supporters of the state laws, the policy marked a milestone that they believe will boost their efforts to legalize marijuana in other states, including Oregon, Nevada, Massachusetts and Alaska. But for those who have been fighting the legalization of marijuana, the announcement increased their concern.

“The green rush is upon us. The federal government is saying, ‘We’re just going to back off,’” said a disappointed Derek Franklin, president of the Washington Assn. of Substance Abuse and Violence Prevention, which had campaigned against the state law.

On the other side Alex Cooley, co-founder of Solstice, said to be the first legal cannabis-growing facility in Washington state, called the action a “very large step forward,” but that he expected the controversy to continue. “It is not the end of the war on the prohibition of cannabis.”

But conflict between the Colorado and Washington state laws and federal law — which still considers marijuana a Schedule I drug, along with cocaine and heroin — had been a source of tension and confusion.

Many marijuana advocates said the discord prompted some municipalities to take a wait-and-see approach to enacting zoning and other regulations to permit pot sales, not knowing what the federal ramifications would be.

“I do think it will bring some level of relief or comfort,” said Rachel Gillette, the Colorado executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. “You can operate without fear the [Drug Enforcement Administration] is going to come seize your property and send you to prison.”

But the policy also represents something larger. “It’s a loud statement from the Obama administration that their intent is to let the experiment happen,” said John Davis, executive director of the Washington state-based Coalition for Cannabis Standards and Ethics.

“It’s huge,” he said. “The fact it mentions adult recreational use is historic.”

Franklin, whose organization opposes the Washington state law, said Thursday’s announcement “really opens the door for other states even wider.” He said not enough has been done to regulate the risk of marijuana abuse. He cautioned against empowering the marijuana industry, which he compared to the tobacco and alcohol industries.

But Gillette said this could represent a shift from handling marijuana in punitive ways toward education and rehabilitation.

“We’re finally reaching a point where we can look at alternatives to prohibition,” she said. “It’s become very, very clear that the war on drugs has failed and we need to look at alternative ways to deal with illicit drugs. I’m hoping this will inspire the federal government to treat drug abuse as a health issue, rather than throw [abusers] in jail and leave them there.”

USA TODAY

The partial U.S. government shutdown is now a nervous watch on how close the world's largest economy comes to its first-ever debt default. What you need to know as the shutdown begins Day 8:

Some GOP lawmakers not worried about debt limit breach

Some Republicans are skeptical about warnings that failing to raise the debt ceiling by Oct. 17 would result in a financial catastrophe. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and other GOP lawmakers contend the United States could prioritize its debt payments and not default. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, wants to couple a bill to end the government shutdown with one to increase the nation's borrowing authority, plus other concessions. President Obama is refusing to negotiate until the government reopens and the debt limit is increased to remove the possibility of default.

How furloughed workers are filling their days

Thousands of civilian employees were back on the job at the Pentagon on Monday, but about 500,000 federal workers are still idle in the government shutdown. Many of these idled workers are keeping themselves busy with home projects, looking for part-time work or just enjoying their free time until official Washington returns them to their jobs. A bill to ensure furloughed government workers receive back pay, passed by the House this weekend, has not yet been scheduled for a Senate vote.

Wall Street feeling anxious as stocks fall

Stocks fell Monday amid hardening political stances. The Dow Jones industrial average, Standard & Poor's 500 index and the Nasdaq composite index all dropped as the government shutdown began its second week. Markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Europe also saw losses. ""Expect more market volatility and downside pressure if a deal is not reached this week,"" said Joseph Quinlan, an investment strategist at U.S. Trust.

Polls: GOP takes more blame for shutdown impasse

Seven in 10 adults disapprove of the way Republicans are handling the wrangling over funding the government, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll. That's a 7-point jump since last week. More than half say they don't approve of the way President Obama is handling the budget standoff, and 61% say the same about congressional Democrats. The blame is more closely divided in a Pew Research Center poll. Nearly 4 in 10 Americans point fingers at the GOP, compared with 30% who blame Obama and 19% who say both the White House and Republicans share responsibility.

Skateboarders flip for shutdown's silver lining

There is an upside to the nearly empty plazas in front of the District of Columbia's partially shuttered government buildings. Skateboarders have taken to gliding on some of the marbled plazas and steps on federal property that aren't being policed amid the government shutdown, reports The Wall Street Journal . One favorite spot: Freedom Plaza on 13th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, not far from the White House.

""I believe we can build on the progress we've made and continue to fight for new jobs and new opportunity and new security for the middle class,"" Obama said. ""I believe we can keep the promise of our founders, the idea that if you're willing to work hard ... you can make it here in America.""

The central challenge of Obama's second term is whether he can keep that founder’s ""promise"" to working Americans. It won't be easy, and in an era of divided government and amid cries for austerity and budget cuts, it does not seem likely that the president will offer sweeping new proposals to do so. The administration has said that its top two priorities at the outset of its second term are immigration reform and gun control. Despite an ongoing jobs crisis, creating quality jobs seems to have fallen a few slots on the president's to-do list.

As Obama implicitly acknowledged, the American middle class has fallen on hard times, saddled with historic levels of debt, skyrocketing health care costs and flat wages. By most accounts, middle-class Americans are no better off than they were when the president took office in 2009, in the wake of an unprecedented financial crisis and in the midst of the Great Recession.

The arithmetic is stark. Median household income is lower than when Obama took office, according to Census Bureau data -- lower even than when President Bill Clinton left office in 2001. The middle 60 percent of households -- those earning between $20,262 and $101,582 -- captured a smaller share of aggregate income in 2011 than they did in 2009, while the top fifth, which already made more than the other groups combined, captured more. Surveys of public opinion reveal a middle class that is smaller, poorer and less optimistic than ever. And although the unemployment rate fitfully has fallen below 8 percent for the first time since Obama's 2009 inauguration, most new jobs are too low-paying to sustain middle-class families.

There is more to the plight of the American middle class than numbers can express -- and a greater threat to the country than economists can quantify.

Democracy, after all, can't thrive without a broad, strong, educated core of citizens. But today they find themselves buffeted by the remorseless dictates of global capital, the need for evermore education and training and the burdens of higher taxes to pay for social programs they need, such as health care.

Battling these global and cultural trends is difficult. In fact, it is unfair to ask any one person -- even a president, even Barack Obama -- to overcome them all. The president’s first responsibility in 2009 literally was to do his part to save the world’s frozen capital, banking and trade systems -- without which the American middle class would have had no prospects at all.

Most fair-minded observers would say that Obama did his part, and acquitted himself well under crushing circumstances. A workable and affordable health care system, the central legislative success of his first term, can (if he sets it up properly) be of great benefit to middle-class workers.

But now he must make good on his own promise -- not always central to his discourse or decision making -- to find more good-paying middle class jobs.

How?

On the stump this year, the president made manufacturing a centerpiece of his vision, arguing that a combination of tax reform, investment and education could help repatriate quality jobs to U.S. soil and stabilize the middle class. Perhaps sensing the political popularity of such an idea in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Michigan, the Obama campaign set the lofty but achievable goal of creating a million new manufacturing jobs during the president's second term.

In a recent interview on ""Meet the Press,"" the president renewed his commitment to investing in infrastructure, which he called ""broken,"" as another way to create good-paying jobs.



With the conversation in Washington focused not just on austerity but how much austerity to apply to a sputtering economy, it's hard to imagine what kind of rebooted jobs plan the president could propose for his next term while staying within the bounds of political reality.

""In the short term, we are in a pretty difficult spot,"" said John Schmitt, an economist with the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research who studies economic inequality and unemployment. ""Even if there was a serious commitment on the part of the administration towards a jobs program of some sort, it would run into a lot of trouble in the Congress.""

Without a clear and politically viable policy objective for jobs -- unlike, say, banning high-capacity magazines to address mass shootings -- the administration is likely to continue the piecemeal approach to economic recovery that it took for most of the president's first term, observers say.

Obama's landmark 2009 stimulus bill pumped billions of dollars into the ailing economy, stemming the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs each month. The bill addressed the short-term fallout in the private sector by cutting taxes and pouring money into infrastructure projects and expanded unemployment insurance benefits.

But since then, additional spending has been all but off the table. Obama has repeatedly proposed more infrastructure spending, but the White House has routinely given up such demands in negotiations with congressional Republicans.

The lack of stimulus since the initial package -- aside from the repeated extensions of long-term unemployment insurance -- has exasperated left-leaning and centrist economists.

""The answer is very clear: We need substantial additional stimulus to support the economy,"" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), a left-of-center think tank. ""We are choosing, as a country and as a town [Washington], not to do it, with millions of jobless workers.""

To address the decline in manufacturing jobs, the Obama administration has undertaken a number of modest initiatives, such as launching a manufacturing institute in Youngstown, Ohio, with $30 million in federal funding, a joint effort between industry and schools to train workers for tomorrow's manufacturing jobs. The Youngstown facility focuses on training workers for 3-D printing technology, the kind of modern manufacturing industry where observers see a lot of potential.

The facility is an acknowledgment that tomorrow's manufacturing jobs will be different from the ones of the past. Gone are the days when a new high school graduate could show up at the factory door, get trained on the shop floor and earn a good wage and a pension. Jobs like those in 3-D printing require more advanced training and a certain degree of computer literacy. The same goes for other areas where experts, as well as the White House, see promise, like industrial robotics or nanomanufacturing. Obama's own tech advisers have warned that the country's ""historic leadership"" in manufacturing technology is ""at risk"" if it can't cultivate the right talent for these fields.

In his 2013 budget proposal, Obama called for devoting $1 billion to create a national network of institutes like the one in Youngstown -- a recommendation that hasn't exactly become a priority for Congress. Neither have the loftier goals of his earlier manufacturing package, such as extending tax breaks to companies that return jobs to U.S. shores. They appear unlikely to move forward in a second term, even if the president chooses to champion them.

""The administration has done some things but could do a lot more to help manufacturing,"" said Scott Paul, director of the non-profit Alliance for American Manufacturing. What the White House has done so far is ""not well-publicized or well-known. They will ultimately be helpful, but so much of the debate has become politicized, it's hard to make progress on some of the meaningful issues.""

And in the end, the manufacturing plan still faces some cold mathematics. The U.S. lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs in the first decade of this century, falling from 17 million to 12 million. Fewer than 9 percent of American workers have manufacturing jobs, compared with more than 20 percent in 1979. Creating a million new such jobs puts only a dent in that sector's -- and the middle class's -- long-term woes.

""It doesn't come close to restoring manufacturing employment to what it had been,"" Paul noted, adding that he still found the goal admirable.

Even setting aside the immediate joblessness crisis, Obama still faces the long-term problems of deteriorating wages and growing income inequality for the poor and middle class. Since 1979, the top 1 percent of American households captured more than 38 percent of income growth, while the bottom 90 percent received just shy of 37 percent, according to EPI.

The Great Recession technically ended halfway through 2009, but the economic recovery of the past few years is replacing office workers, real estate brokers and insurance claims adjusters with retail salespeople, restaurant workers and warehouse hands.

Mid-wage jobs -- ones with median hourly wages ranging from $13.84 to $21.13 -- accounted for 60 percent of the jobs lost during the recession, according to an analysis by the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. During the recovery since then, mid-wage jobs have represented just 22 percent of growth. Jobs earning less than $13.84 per hour made up 58 percent of recovery growth, according to the NELP.

The president pledged during his 2008 campaign that by 2011 he would have the minimum wage raised to $9.50 and pegged to inflation, a move that worker advocates have clamored for for years, claiming it would help raise the wage floor for the working poor and the middle class. But the federal minimum wage remains $7.25 per hour, well below a living wage in most areas.

Many of those same worker advocates tie the stagnation of real wages to the decline of collective bargaining in the workplace. The rate of unionization in the U.S. has fallen to a historic low, with just 7 percent of private-sector workers now belonging to a union. Labor leaders believe that labor law needs to be amended to make it easier for workers to join unions. Their best shot came and went under the president's watch, when Democrats failed to pass the Employee Free Choice Act when they controlled both chambers of Congress.

""I do feel disappointment,"" said Schmitt, the Center for Economic and Policy Research economist. ""That said, we're also in a [political] context where it's extremely difficult to make any progress on the concerns of low- and middle-wage workers.""

Despite those shortcomings, and despite the acrimony on Capitol Hill, liberals like Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO federation of unions, are bullish on Obama's second term, given the focus on the middle class and jobs during the election.

""It all starts with the political will, or the national appetite, to again create jobs that are going to be family-supportive and middle-class producing, and I think that's underway right now,"" Trumka said. ""People are talking about it. That's the difference between this election and the ones in the past. We actually had a debate about what's hollowing out the country and what isn't. And our side won, big time.""

Now the president’s challenge is to turn that political victory into an economic one for the people who supported him.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/18/Bankrupt-USPS-Looking-To-Direct-Deliver-To-Cuba,2013-06-18 00:00:00,['Meredith Dake'],Bankrupt USPS Looking at Direct Cuba Delivery,"The Associated Press reported Monday morning that a “U.S. Official” confirmed the United States is looking to resume the mail service which has been out of commission since 1963:

The resumption in talks does not signify any change in the Obama administration’s Cuba policy, the official said, stressing that the discussions are taking place in the context of the Cuba Democracy Act of 1992 and are consistent with the U.S. interest “in promoting the free flow of information to, from and within Cuba.”

U.S. and Cuban diplomats and postal representatives will meet in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday for technical talks aimed at ending a 50-year suspension in direct mail between the United States and the communist island. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the matter publicly before Congress is notified. Lawmakers were to be notified of the meetings starting Monday morning, the official said.

The State Department confirmed the talks will take place this week. “This is something we feel is good for us,” Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, “But it’s not meant to be a signal of anything or indicate a change in policy.”

When asked if the bankrupt Postal Service is in any position to provide these kind of services, Psaki said she “assumed” that “more revenue” would be generated because more stamps would be used.

USPS lost $16 Billion in 2012 and announced at the beginning of this year a change of services that are set to begin this summer.

Read the transcript from the State Department below:

QUESTION: All right. And then if there’s nothing else on North Korea, I just want to nail down the postal talks with Cuba.

MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.

QUESTION: Do you expect anything out of this round or is this really not – is this just – in other words, if these two days of talks are a success, there won’t be direct mail service immediately, I presume, but maybe I’m wrong, so could you —

MS. PSAKI: That’s a good question on the timeline. Just to give you a little bit of history here, the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 states that, quote, “The United States Postal Service shall take such actions as are necessary to provide direct mail service to and from Cuba.” So this is – as you mentioned, on June 18th and 19th – well, you didn’t mention the dates, but so everybody knows, representatives from the Department of State and the United States Postal Service will meet with representatives from the Government of Cuba for a technical discussion on reestablishing direct transportation of mail. The reason we’re doing this is because it’s, of course, good for the Cuban people. This is something we feel is good for us. But it’s not meant to be a signal of anything or indicate a change in policy.

QUESTION: Syria?

QUESTION: Are those talks here or in —

MS. PSAKI: In terms of the exact location, I’m not sure if they’re at the Department of State or if they’re just somewhere else in the —

QUESTION: Could we go to Syria?

QUESTION: Well, can we —

MS. PSAKI: Well, let’s finish Cuba.

QUESTION: Are those talks exclusively on the mail service?

MS. PSAKI: That is with the United States Postal Service. That’s their purview.

QUESTION: But I’m saying is it mainly about the – is there anything going to come up about Mr. Gross?

MS. PSAKI: I don’t want to predict. There are issues that are, of course, raised on both sides. As you know, this is an issue that has been raised at the highest levels from the United States, but given these are talks with the Postal Service, I would expect that will be the focus.

QUESTION: You don’t consider that the highest level?

MS. PSAKI: Well – Brad, having fun on your last day? (Laughter.)

QUESTION: Just one more. I mean, is the U.S. Postal Service in any kind of position to make any kind of deals or agreements with Cuba? I mean, this is an organization that is essentially going broke, and I’m just curious. Is —

MS. PSAKI: Well, I think that’s combining two different things, in my opinion. This has been – we have had – I read off the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992.

QUESTION: Right.

MS. PSAKI: So they’re simply allowing mail to travel, which is – I would assume provides them with more revenue, with more stamps used.

QUESTION: Considering that – well, all right, exactly. So in other words, this could actually help the Postal Union’s budget if they are able to —

MS. PSAKI: I don’t want to go too far on it, but – I don’t want to go too far, Matt, but it’s more people using their services.

Jill.

QUESTION: Jen, a clarification on that too. What is the genesis of this? I mean, how did these talks actually come about? Who asked for them?

MS. PSAKI: Well, this is something that the U.S. has felt would be a positive step for the Cuban people. We felt it was in our interests. In terms of who specifically asked for it, I don’t have that level of detail, but it’s just something that we felt it was – it would be positive moving forward.

QUESTION: But basically, the U.S. asked for it?

MS. PSAKI: I would have to check on that for you, but it’s something, again, that we are very supportive of and we are, of course, helping direct here.

QUESTION: Isn’t it a continuation of the talks from 2009 that were on the same subject?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I don’t know if I’d call it a continuation because it’s been a number of years, but yes, it’s on the same subject, and we’re hopeful that we’ll be able to move things forward."

This year the former secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union is feasting on nothing but water as he marks the 17th day of his hunger strike to protest Washington’s inaction over immigration reform.

While the rest of the nation is gorging on Thanksgiving meals, the immigration activist and two other fasters will be in a heated tent on the National Mall at the foot of the Capitol.

“We are a little thinner,” said Medina, who has lost 19 pounds. “It’s a good diet.” He said the goal of the fast was to bring attention to the plight of immigrants. “We are trying to connect with people on a human level, not on a policy or political level.”

Gaunt, with a patchy beard and a wooden cross hanging from his neck, Medina says he hopes that his fast will pressure House Republicans, who have held up action on an immigration overhaul.

“We want to see it sooner rather than later because of all the deaths and the deportations,” he said, referring to the roughly 200 people a year who die trying to cross the Sonora Desert along the southwest border with Mexico.

Some high-profile Democrats have dropped by his tent to lend support, including Vice President Joe Biden, Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, as well as two Republican members of Congress, Jeff Denham and David Valadao, Californians who support an immigration measure.

“It is a tremendous commitment, what they have been through,” Denham said in a telephone interview. “I think it’s going to have an impact with more and more members.... It helps us bring great recognition to the overall issue.”

Denham says he pressed House Republican leaders last week to act more quickly. But prospects for legislative action before the end of the year appear dim.

Medina, 67, says his family is worried about his health.

“It’s normal that people that love you are really worried,” he said.

At night, Medina sleeps in a room of bunk beds with the other fasters at the Washington Seminar Center, a religious retreat on Capitol Hill.

A full-time nurse checks vital signs twice a day for Medina and two other fasters — Dae Joong Yoon, 43, and Christian Avila, 23 — who also stopped eating Nov. 12. The three risk damaging their livers and other organs as the nutrients in their bodies become more depleted.

During his fast, Medina has found that he needs less sleep. “I wake up and start thinking about what more I should be doing. Then I drive my staff crazy,” Medina said. “At 1 o’clock in the morning, every idea I have is brilliant.”

Medina isn’t surprised that some Republicans have dismissed the fast as a publicity stunt. ""[They see us as] these ragtag people sitting at the foot of the Capitol reminding them of what they have to do,” he said. “It’s a hard thing for them.”

Others say Medina’s fast is raising public awareness in the tradition of labor leader Cesar Chavez.

“It moves people who have been getting complacent and saying, ‘It is not going to happen and we should move on and focus on some other issues,’” said Miriam Pawel, a former Los Angeles Times editor and the author of a forthcoming biography, “The Crusades of Cesar Chavez.” “It reminds people of the injustices.”

When Biden sat with the fasters Friday, he told them to call him “Joe,” not “Mr. Vice President,” Medina said.

Medina would like to see the White House do more. Congressional action is needed to address the problems of the immigration system, but the Obama administration, he said, could use executive orders to slow the rate of deportations and keep more families together. (Pressed by a protester in San Francisco on Monday, President Obama said that he was doing all he could legally.)

Medina recalls being stunned in 1968 when he heard that Chavez was fasting to draw attention to labor conditions on farms. Medina was 22 and had been helping Chavez by organizing a boycott of table grapes in New York City. He remembers thinking to himself, “Is he going to die? What will happen to us?”

Chavez abstained from food for 25 days until New York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who was about to launch his campaign for president, traveled to Delano, Calif., and gave Chavez a piece of bread to break the fast. “It was a big validation of what we were trying to do,” Medina said.

He says that 1968 fast drove him to get more involved in union activity. He devoted his career to encouraging immigrants to join unions, eventually rising to the No. 2 position at SEIU, which represents janitors, security guards and other service workers. He quit that post earlier this year to lead an advocacy program in Washington for immigration reform.

He expresses hope that his fast will spur the same kind of change that Chavez’s inspired in him.

“It’s been 45 years since that fast, and I’ve never been let down by the American people,” Medina said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc suffered a defeat on Monday as the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a decision forcing it to defend against claims it misled investors about mortgage securities that lost value during the 2008 financial crisis.

Without comment, the court refused to consider Goldman's appeal of a September 2012 decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. Goldman shares sank more than 2 percent.

That court let the NECA-IBEW Health & Welfare Fund, which owned some mortgage-backed certificates underwritten by Goldman, sue on behalf of investors in certificates it did not own, but which were backed by mortgages from the same lenders.

Goldman and other banks have faced thousands of lawsuits by investors seeking to recoup losses on mortgage securities.

The bank has said that letting the 2nd Circuit decision stand could cost Wall Street tens of billions of dollars.

Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally had no immediate comment, saying the bank's lawyers had yet to review the order.

Lawyers for the NECA-IBEW fund were not immediately available for comment.

Fred Isquith, a lawyer specializing in class action and securities litigation who is not involved in the case, said Monday's order is important because of the amount of mortgage litigation in the 2nd Circuit, home to Wall Street, but said the fallout might be less than Goldman fears.

""If you expand the number of securities, you expand the amount of potential damages,"" said Isquith, a partner at Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz and former president of the National Association of Securities and Commercial Law Attorneys. ""How much more? I'm willing to bet dollars to donuts that when it comes down to dealing with actual damages, it will be less than they argued.""

Goldman shares were down $3.43, or 2.2 percent, at $151.41 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

""VEXATIOUS"" LITIGATION FEARED

At issue was whether the NECA-IBEW fund, a Decatur, Illinois, electrical workers' union pension fund that bought certificates from two of 17 trusts under a 2007 registration statement, could sue on behalf of investors in all 17 offerings.

The 2nd Circuit let the fund sue over seven of the offerings: the two it invested in, plus five others that also contained loans from GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, later part of Capital One Financial Corp, and Wells Fargo & Co. It said the other 10 offerings were too different.

Theodore Olson, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher representing Goldman, warned in court papers that letting the 2nd Circuit decision stand ""will effectively increase by tens of billions of dollars the potential liability that financial institutions face in this and similar class actions.""

Goldman said the case also merited review because it conflicted with a decision by the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals involving Japan's Nomura Holdings Inc.

But Darren Robbins, a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd representing the NECA-IBEW fund, said both decisions ensure that class representatives have ""a genuine stake in establishing liability on all of the claims asserted.""

The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supported Goldman, saying the 2nd Circuit decision encouraged ""vexatious, abusive litigation and coercive multi-million or billion dollar settlements to the detriment of the nation's economy.""

The case is Goldman Sachs & Co et al v. NECA-IBEW Health & Welfare Fund, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 12-528.

As politicians in Washington slam one another over competing budget priorities, most avoid facing up to the disturbing question behind all the numbers: Is the American Dream temporarily stalled or permanently kaput?

Last Sunday, Parade magazine presented its annual survey, “What People Earn,” an exercise guaranteed to appall and infuriate readers as they compare their own salaries with the likes of Brad Pitt and LeBron James. The story is pretty much the same every year: Entertainers and athletes rake in tens of millions while secretaries and forest rangers scrape by on $35,000 to $40,000.

Sure, it seems a little insane that 19-year-old Justin Bieber makes $55 million – $6,261 an hour – while his high school music teacher probably struggles to pay the mortgage on his house, but the difference between what superstar entertainers earn and what undervalued educators are paid has always been ridiculous. The economics of Hollywood are abnormal. They may say something about our warped values, but they have never been representative of the entire economy – at least not until now.

It is more telling that Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz made close to $30 million last year while a typical twenty-something barrista at one of his coffee shops cannot find a better job, even with a college degree at the top of her resume, and so lives at home with Mom and Dad. CEOs and bankers and hedge fund managers are the new superstars of the economy. In many industries, the few men at the top make a hundred times the income of the guys and gals on the factory floor or in the office cubicles. And this is not because the men and women with the lower salaries fail to work hard enough.

Economics columnist Jon Talton recently did a rundown of the facts about today’s American economy. Among his findings:

• Worker productivity has increased nearly 23% since 2000, but hourly wages rose a pitiful 0.5% in that period.

• Taking a longer view back to 1973, productivity is up 80% between now and then, but pay is up only 11%.

• People at the bottom of the wage scale are earning less now than similar workers in 1979.

• Employees in the middle of the wage scale are getting 6% more than in 1979, but all that increase happened in the 1990s.

• High earners, meanwhile, are making 37% more than back in the 1970s, and the much-talked-about folks in the top 1% have enjoyed a 131% increase in earnings.

It is bad enough that we are going back to the income disparities of the 19thcentury’s Gilded Age, but Talton, like many other observers of the U.S. economy, notes that modern America is also becoming more stratified. We are moving toward the “Downton Abbey” society of the waning British Empire and away from the anyone-can-make-it-big America of the 1950s and ‘60s. Britain of 2013 has greater social mobility than the USA. In fact, it is now easier for the average German, Japanese or Dane to rise through the income ranks than it is for the average American. And if you are undereducated or mired in poverty, you are almost certainly stuck where you are – and the same goes for your children.

This is not the country we like to think we are and it is not the country our political leaders are willing to admit they have helped create. Thirty years of catering to Wall Street, big business and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has not boosted the American economy the way it was meant to do. Yes, the financial industry and giant corporations are awash in wealth, but they are not hiring more workers, they are not paying better pay, they are not enhancing benefits, they are not sharing the wealth. On the contrary, the typical American is working much harder for worse compensation. He or she is paying a bigger share of the healthcare bill and has no pension plan waiting at the end of the line.

The effort by Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe to end Saturday mail delivery is a non-starter on many levels.

First, he lacks the legal authority to do this. Decisions on delivery schedule are the purview of Congress, and every year for the past 30 years, America's elected representatives have mandated six-day delivery — a requirement remaining in force today.

Mr. Donahoe isn't above the law. Further, his attempted power grab flouts the political will of Congress; as recently as the last session, which ended in January, a bipartisan majority of representatives co-sponsored measures backing continuation of Saturday delivery.

It's not surprising that many lawmakers have questioned Mr. Donahoe's legal overreach, or that his explanations are so evasive.

On the merits, it's a disastrous idea. The postmaster general proposes trading 17% of service for 2% in savings — an irrational business plan. Indeed, when the USPS asked the agency's overseer, the Postal Regulatory Commission, in 2011 to support ending six-day delivery, this illogic was one of the factors cited by the commission in declining to endorse the plan.

So, too, was the finding that the savings were wildly inflated. The commission also noted that ending Saturday delivery would disproportionately affect the elderly, rural communities and small businesses. Those small businesses create more than two-thirds of all jobs in this country, and forcing them to hire expensive private contractors on weekends would impose new costs.

So ending Saturday delivery would jeopardize the USPS' future by sacrificing its competitive advantage, hurt tens of millions of Americans — and it wouldn't even solve the agency's financial woes.

That's because most of the red ink has nothing to do with postal operations. Rather, 80% of the red ink stems directly from the 2006 congressional mandate that the Postal Service do something no other agency or company is required to do: pre-fund future retiree health benefits. That mandate accounted for $11.1 billion in red ink in fiscal 2012 alone.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-deal-budget-not-debt-limit-abc-interview-131139955--sector.html,,[],"Obama will deal on budget, not on debt limit: ABC interview","By Mark Felsenthal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, in an interview broadcast on Sunday, blamed conservative Republicans for a stalemate on the budget and insisted that while he is willing to haggle over taxes and government spending, he will not make a deal would that would impose conditions on increasing the nation's debt limit. With a possible government shutdown looming in two weeks, and the threat of a U.S. debt default as early as mid-October, Obama said on ABC's ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"" that it is up to lawmakers to work out a budget. He insisted the budget should contain enough spending to help support economic growth and said he will not allow Republicans to attach conditions to raising the $16.7 trillion U.S. borrowing cap. ""We've presented our budget,"" Obama said. ""Now it's the job of Congress to come up with a budget that keeps our long-term trends of ... reducing the deficit moving forward, but also allows us to invest in the things we need to grow."" Obama said trading cuts to his signature healthcare program in exchange for an increase in the nation's borrowing limit is not an option. ""What I haven't been willing to negotiate, and will not negotiate, is on the debt ceiling,"" he said. With the crisis over Syria off the boil, Washington faces yet another fiscal showdown. Most government operations will cease on October 1 unless Congress passes a budget the president will accept and the United States risks a debt default as early as mid-October if lawmakers delay raising the borrowing cap. Obama and the Republican-led House of Representatives remain at loggerheads over both the budget and the debt limit. Republican lawmakers have sought to make defunding the president's signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, a condition for raising the cap. Obama's administration has delayed implementing such steps as signing final agreements with insurance plans to be sold on federal health insurance exchanges as it struggled to get the law's provisions in place before enrollment opens on October 1. ""This administration has already delayed or waived fully a third of this legislation and we believe it is only fair for the American people now to have that same delay and that's the proposal I believe will be coming forward this week,"" Republican Representative Tom Price of Georgia said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Democratic Representative Chris Van Hollen said on the same program that legislation mandating delays in putting the law in place would stand in the way of making health insurance affordable to many Americans and is ""not acceptable."" ""WAYS OF DOING THIS"" Lawmakers last week considered extending government funding at current $988 billion levels until mid-December, but Tea Party Republicans insisted that cuts to Obamacare remain part of the package. Obama will mark the five-year anniversary of the U.S. financial crisis on Monday in an effort to move back to his domestic agenda after weeks of dealing with Syria and how to respond to its use of chemical weapons. The financial crisis was accelerated on September 15, 2008, when the Lehman Brothers firm filed for bankruptcy protection. Obama is expected to focus on the positive, discussing progress made and highlighting his prescriptions for boosting job creation amid budget battles with Republicans. He said he would be willing to talk to House Speaker John Boehner about reversing deep across-the-board spending cuts that went into effect this year through the process known as sequestration, but said Boehner has been an unwilling partner. ""There are ways of doing this. It's just that they haven't been willing to negotiate in a serious way on that,"" Obama said. Obama and Boehner have clashed on repeated occasions over the budget. A standoff over raising the debt limit in 2011 resulted in the first-ever U.S. credit rating downgrade and dealt a setback to the nascent economic recovery. Obama also said he is willing to talk to Republicans about how to accelerate further reductions in the budget deficit. But he pointed out that the deficit has shrunk more quickly than expected, and said that efforts by ""a portion of Congress"" to push for sharper budget reductions would only worsen the wide gap between rich and poor in the United States. ""There's no serious economist out there that would suggest that if you took the Republican agenda of slashing education further, slashing Medicare further, slashing research and development further, slashing investments in infrastructure further, that would reverse some of these trends of inequality,"" he said. The Congressional Budget Office has said it expects the government's annual deficit to shrink to $642 billion in the fiscal year that ends this month, the first annual deficit below $1 trillion in five years.

http://news.yahoo.com/gop-shutdown-debt-plan-no-agreement-yet-165932830--politics.html,,[],"New GOP shutdown/debt plan, but no agreement yet","WASHINGTON (AP) — Efforts accelerated in Congress on Friday to keep the U.S. Treasury from defaulting as early as next week and to end the partial government shutdown that stretched through an 11th day. At the White House and Capitol, President Barack Obama and top aides consulted repeatedly with both House and Senate Republicans.

""Let's put this hysterical talk of default behind us and instead start talking about finding solutions,"" said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

There was no shortage of suggestions. Yet there also was no evidence of agreement to end crises that have caused financial markets to shudder and interest rates to rise, while closing some federal offices and sending 350,000 workers home on furlough, without pay.

Senate and House Republicans each offered to reopen the government and raise the $16.7 trillion debt limit — but only as part of broader approaches that envision deficit savings, changes to the health care law known as Obamacare and an easing of across-the-board spending cuts that the White House and Congress both dislike. The details and timing differed.

""We're waiting to hear"" from administration officials, said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.

While the impact of the shutdown varies widely, lawmakers seemed to be taking care of their own needs.

The members-only House gym remained in operation, and enough Senate staff was at work to operate the aging underground tram that ferries senators and others from the Russell Office Building to the Capitol a short distance away.

Obama met at the White House for more than an hour with Senate Republicans, the last in a series of four presidential sit-downs with the rank and file of each house and each party.

He has said repeatedly in recent weeks that he is willing to negotiate with Republicans on budget, health care or other issues, but only after the government is reopened and the threat of default eliminated.

The White House seemed to wobble on that point on Thursday, until Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., emphatically reinforced that it was his view, too.

Story continues

Republicans have just as insistently demanded that Obama negotiate with them in exchange for passage of legislation that both sides agree is essential.

That left the White House and congressional leaders looking for a way to negotiate their way out of an impasse without appearing to negotiate — with the health of the nation's economy dependent on their political dexterity. The administration says the government will bump up against its borrowing limit next Thursday, raising the specter of an unprecedented default.

At Obama's meeting with Senate Republicans, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine laid out a proposal to raise the debt limit until the end of January, reopen the government and take a slice out of the health care law.

Under a proposal she and other GOP senators have been developing, a medical device tax that helps finance the health care law would be repealed, and millions of individuals eligible for subsidies to purchase health insurance under the program would be subject to stronger income verification.

At the same time, federal agencies that have been affected by across-the-board cuts would gain greater flexibility in the use of their remaining funds.

Any other items could be negotiated later.

Back at the Capitol, Collins said Obama said the proposal ""was constructive, but I don't want to give the impression that he endorsed it.""

For their part, House Republicans previewed a different approach in a late-night meeting Thursday with White House officials.

It, too, would raise the debt limit and avoid a default, as part of a framework that could include easing the across-the-board cuts in exchange for reductions that Obama has supported in the past in benefit programs. That plan, too, seeks changes in Obamacare.

White House officials declined to comment on that proposal, although administration aides were checking with key Democrats in Congress to gauge their reaction.

The White House and Republicans have negotiated almost $4 trillion in deficit savings in the past three years. But little of that has come out of benefit programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the Republican proposals seemed an attempt to open up that part of the budget to scrutiny.

Obama has proposed raising the cost of Medicare for better-off seniors, a $50 billion item over a decade. He has also backed higher fees under TRICARE, which provides health care for nearly 10 million active-duty and retired military personnel, retirees, reservists and their families, as well as increases in the cost of retirement benefits for federal workers.

After four years of trillion-dollar deficits, the 2013 federal budget shortfall is expected to register below $700 billion, but Republicans say more cuts are essential. At the same time, the nation's debt is rising inexorably — the reason for the effort to raise borrowing limit to cover it. The debt was $10.6 trillion when Obama took office during the worst recession in decades, and has grown by $6.1 trillion in the years since.

The House Republicans' plan was outlined in the Thursday night White House meeting that included senior aides to Obama as well as to House Speaker John Boehner and Cantor, several hours after Obama met with top Republicans.

The discussions unfolded as the House voted 248-176 to resume funding for nuclear arms research and security despite the broader shutdown. It was the latest GOP bill aimed at reviving popular programs — and the latest to face swift demise in the Senate, where Reid has rejected nearly all bills that fall short of fully reopening the government.

Schoen'],Businesses slash jobs as sequester impact hits,"Even before the federal spending crunch began to pinch March 1, Chi-Yeh Han Boone was already feeling the pain of the budget squeeze known as the sequester.

The co-owner and CEO of Fort Worth Gasket & Supply – which sells parts to the military – said the loss of supply contracts forced her to lay off contract workers filling orders in the company warehouse.

“If you don’t have the cash flow, with a reduction of 25 percent of revenues you have to cut staff,” Boone said.

More job cuts are on the way as the river of government spending flowing through the U.S. economy continues to slow. The $85 billion federal spending squeeze – part of a doomsday budget package originally approved last summer to force a more rational spending plan – has now lopped more than a full percentage point from gross domestic product over the past six months and eliminated tens of thousands of federal jobs.

The hit to federal payrolls is expected to show up Friday in the latest monthly job numbers for April. Most economists are expecting the report to show a net gain of 145,000 jobs, according to the economists polled by Reuters.



The pace of layoffs is expected to pick up speed this summer. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that for the full year, federal spending cuts will reduce overall employment by about 750,000 jobs. Most agencies have just gotten started.



Private economists say that budget office estimate is probably on the high side because government managers will be looking to generate whatever savings they can by temporarily furloughing workers and cutting back hours – before resorting to outright layoffs – in order to hit their 5.1 percent sequester savings mandates.

“The extent to which it’s done through hiring or through furloughs is pretty hard to get handle on,” said Chad Stone, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “Either way, there certainly will be less hiring than would otherwise take place.”

That means Uncle Sam’s belt-tightening will weigh on the job market through the rest of the government fiscal year, which ends Oct. 1.

Though the cuts officially took effect March 1, the impact is expected to build through the summer as federal agencies work to meet the Oct. 1 deadline.



“The way the sequester is designed, it’s gradual in its nature,"" said Gregory Daco, an economist at IHS Global Insight. “You cut budget authority, but that doesn’t mean you immediately cut spending. So the actual cuts to outlays take time to materialize.”

Those cuts will also hit other spending programs that will bring indirect pressure on non-government hiring, economists say. Cuts to federally funded, state-managed unemployment insurance programs will be concentrated in the summer months. Those cuts will hit hardest in later in the summer in states that delay implementing them.

The hit to consumer spending is expected to ripple through payrolls of industries from leisure and hospitality to retailers.

“They’re going to take a secondary hit from lower disposable income from people that are receiving benefits like unemployment compensation and other federal payments,” said Brian Kessler, an economist at Moody's Analytics.

The biggest wild card in the forecast remains the ongoing political standoff over the budget. Many agencies that have yet to announce furlough plans are still scrambling to avoid service cuts.

Some may be hoping to win a “carve out” from the sequester. The Federal Aviation Administration, for example, was recently granted a budget reprieve after air traffic control tower furloughs began snarling the nation’s airports with delays. The IRS recently announced furloughs that could delay tax refunds.

While that piecemeal process may help the agencies winning a reprieve, it could slow progress on a wider solution, Stone said.

“Carving out the squeaky wheels probably reduces in the impetus to get a deal,” he said. “And it doesn’t change the cuts that have to be made. It just focuses them on a narrower set of programs with less visibility or political interests.”

If no deal is reached, the budget cuts will continue into next winter – and beyond. The current cuts are part of a 10-year “budget control” law that caps federal spending through 2022.

But those future cuts won’t be as painful. Though they slow the growth of federal spending, they don’t reduce outlays like the current round of cuts. That means they’ll have less impact on future economic growth and hiring.

“This year, the change in (federal) spending is going to tap the breaks on job creation and the recovery,” said Kessler. “Next year is sort of a lighter tap on the gas. So adjusting to that move down is what slows growth and kills jobs.”

The hope, of course, is that the private sector economy can fill in the spending gap by creating jobs faster than the government is shedding them.

But the political gridlock over the sequester may be holding back hiring there as well. Many small business owners complain that it’s just too risky to take on new workers until they get more certainty over issues like tax reform and health care spending.

Not all business owners agree.

Boone said that as her competitors pull back, she’s developing plans to draw on savings to invest in new manufacturing equipment and hire skilled staff to expand her product line.

“It is risky. It’s a long learning curve and it’s a lot of investment in hiring and equipment,” she said. “But if I don’t take the risk to invest, the result is zero. If I take the risk to invest – and work hard and learn – we might open up a new market to make up for the business that we lost.”"

Under the Constitution%2C members of Congress can%27t have their own pay cut as part of the %27sequester%27

Congressional offices could see an across-the-board budget cut of about 9%25

Budget cuts could hit some congressional offices harder than others

WASHINGTON — As the rest of the federal government prepares for furloughs, layoffs and sweeping budget cuts caused by the ""sequester,"" the people who could prevent the cuts are the ones whose paychecks are protected: members of Congress.

The 27th Amendment to the constitution — intended to prevent members of Congress from voting themselves a pay raise — also prohibits them from taking a pay cut until after the next election.

Congress will feel the pain in other ways. Members' office budgets, committee staff and leadership offices will all see the same across-the-board cuts as any other discretionary , non-defense spending.

Other legislative branch functions — the Capitol Visitor Center, the Library of Congress's Books for the Blind program, even the Capitol Police — would take cuts of about 9%, according to a report from the Office of Management and Budget.

In the House, each representative gets an annual office budget of about $1.5 million — more for members from expensive and faraway districts.

Some congressional offices may feel the cuts more deeply than others. A USA TODAY analysis of 2011 congressional spending showed that 40% of House members had spent more than 90% of their office budgets — and Congress has cut its own budgets by about 8% since then. Additional cuts imposed by the sequester could force these offices to lay off staff or implement other cost-cutting strategies.

In 2011, Congress passed — and President Obama signed into law — the Budget Control Act, which required the across-the-board cuts of $1.2 trillion as a way to motivate lawmakers to find some other way of reducing the nation's budget deficit. They didn't.

Much of the $85 billion cost savings this year will come through furloughs, the administration has said. As many as 800,000 civilian employees in the Defense Department will have to take 22 days of unpaid leave before Oct. 1. Active-duty military and civilian defense employees in combat zones are exempt, as are senior political appointees in the Obama administration who don't fall under federal civil service rules.

The Executive Office of the President is subject to the sequester, but White House spokesman Jay Carney — while warning of the dire effects of agency cuts — declined to elaborate on how the presidency would be impacted. Again, the president's salary wouldn't be cut.

When Congress passed the sequester, Washington Rep. Norman Dicks, then the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, warned colleagues that the sequester would mean the elimination of about two legislative aides in a typical congressional office.

Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., runs two offices — his member office and the House Judiciary Committee, where he's chairman. He said the sequester hasn't come as a surprise — so he doesn't expect that draconian measures will be necessary to come within budget.

""We have been taking this into account with our hiring, both on the committee and in my congressional office. So I hope to be able to avoid that,"" he said. ""Any federal agency that has been listening to what's been going on for the last year and a half since this issue came up, I would hope has also taken that into account in their hiring practices so that they can mitigate the effect. I don't have the faith that all of them have done that.""

The cuts, known as a sequester, will kick in March 1 unless Republicans agree to President Obama’s demand to a legislative package that combines spending reductions and tax increases. As of Thursday, with the deadline a week off, Republicans seemed determined to say no to any new tax increases.

“Spending is the problem,” declared the House speaker, John Boehner. “Spending must be the focus.” Reflecting the views of many of her Republican colleagues, Representative Martha Roby said Wednesday that Mr. Obama “already got his tax increase” as part of the January agreement over the “fiscal cliff” and that no further increases were necessary.

Both are wrong. To reduce the deficit in a weak economy, new taxes on high-income Americans are a matter of necessity and fairness; they are also a necessary precondition to what in time will have to be tax increases on the middle class. Contrary to Mr. Boehner’s “spending problem” claim, much of the deficit in the next 10 years can be chalked up to chronic revenue shortfalls from the Bush-era tax cuts, which were only partly undone in the fiscal-cliff deal earlier this year. (Wars and a recession also contributed.) It stands to reason that a deficit caused partly by inadequate revenue must be corrected in part by new taxes. And the only way to raise taxes now without harming the recovery is to impose them on high-income filers, for whom a tax increase is unlikely to cut into spending.

As it happens, those taxpayers are the same ones who benefited most from Bush-era tax breaks and who continue to pay low taxes. Even with recent increases, the new top rate of 39.6 percent is historically low; investment income is still taxed at special low rates; and the heirs of multimillion-dollar estates face lower taxes than at almost any time in modern memory."

The proposal has little chance of Republican support, even though neither party wants the automatic cuts. But Republicans are increasingly willing to stomach the reductions in defense and domestic spending rather than accept President Obama’s call for a “balanced” approach that matches cuts with new revenue.

The Democratic alternative would replace half of the scheduled cuts with the so-called Buffett Rule, a requirement that those who have adjusted gross incomes above $1 million pay a minimum 30% tax rate.

The rule, a favorite of the president, is named for billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has complained that tax loopholes and deductions allow him to pay a lower effective tax rate than his secretary.

“Now, Republicans in Congress face a simple choice,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. “Do they protect investments in education, healthcare and national defense, or do they continue to prioritize and protect tax loopholes that benefit the very few at the expense of middle- and working-class Americans?”

The White House and its Democratic allies in the Senate are returning to a strategy that has shown some success — portraying Republicans as protecting tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of deep reductions in popular domestic programs.

Polls show that, although Americans agree with Republicans that deficits are worrisome and that spending should be reduced, enthusiasm wanes when the cuts slice into mainstay programs in transportation, education or other government services.

At the same time, majorities of Americans have shown a willingness to ask the wealthiest to pay more, as happened when Obama secured a tax increase on households earning more than $450,000 in the New Year’s deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff.

Republicans are gambling that by resisting the president’s call for new taxes they will win the budget reductions that they were unable to achieve in the deal.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) asserted that the cuts, called sequestration, will begin March 1 unless serious changes are made in federal spending to achieve the Republican goal of bringing the budget into balance within 10 years. Nonpartisan analysts, noting that would extract federal money from the still-struggling economy, say that could damage the recovery.

“The sequester will be in effect until there are cuts and reforms that put us on the path to balance the budget over the next 10 years,” Boehner said Thursday.

The $120-billion proposal from Democrats would postpone the across-the-board cuts for 10 months to make time to craft a broader solution. The Democratic package includes $55 billion in new revenue, primarily from the tax on the wealthy, along with cuts to farm subsidies and a smaller hit to defense than the automatic cuts coming next month.

Democrats dropped a proposal to close tax breaks on oil companies after protests from four oil-state Democratic senators.

The across-the-board cuts would eliminate as many as 750,000 jobs and reduce the growth of the nation’s gross domestic product, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

Boehner met privately Thursday with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), but the speaker has resisted the closed-door negotiations that characterized past fiscal battles because they drew protests from lawmakers in his Republican majority.

Instead, Boehner has shifted the burden of devising legislation to replace sequestration onto the Senate, as he has struggled to rally support for proposals from his divided GOP majority in the House.

Senate Republicans plan to present their own alternative. Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) would replace the across-the-board cuts with a plan to reduce the federal workforce by hiring only one new employee for every three vacancies.

The Democratic and Republican alternatives probably will come to a vote when Congress returns from its weeklong Presidents Day recess.

Both parties’ proposals are likely to fail, leaving Congress without a clear alternative days before the cuts begin.

North Dakota retains claim to lowest jobless rate%3B Nevada still has the highest

17 states had unemployment rates significantly below the national average in October

Texas leads U.S. in job gains year over year

Unemployment rates fell in 28 states in October while non-farm payroll employment increased in 34 states, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.

Illustrating the generally better trend compared with September, the states that have long held the highest and lowest jobless rates in the country each saw improvement last month.

Nevada, which has led the nation in unemployment nearly every month since early 2010, had a rate of 9.3%. That's a tenth of a percentage point below September's and a full percentage point lower than October 2012.

The Silver State is recovering slowly from the housing bust and recession. Construction jobs are still more than 60% off their pre-recession highs and even the much stronger leisure and hospitality sector remains 5.5% below its 2007 jobs peak.

North Dakota, its fortunes lifted by an energy boom, has enjoyed the nation's lowest unemployment rate since late 2008 and kept that distinction in October. At 2.7%, its jobless rate was a tenth of a point lower than September's and half a point lower than a year earlier.

The national jobless rate last month was 7.3%, up from 7.2% in September.

Friday's report showed 17 states had rates significantly below the U.S. average in October while nine states plus the District of Columbia had measurably higher rates. The district's unemployment rate jumped 0.3 percentage points to 8.9% in October, a month that included the federal government's partial shutdown for 16 days.

Florida led the U.S. with the largest monthly increase in employment, gaining 44,600 jobs. California followed with a gain of 39,800 jobs and North Carolina was third with 22,200.

The states with the most significant decreases in employment over the month were Kentucky, down 12,600; Washington, 8,100; and South Dakota, 2,600.

Over the year, Texas has led the nation in job gains with 267,400. California ranks second with 207,300 and Florida is third with 182,200."

Economists aren't very optimistic that trend will continue in the months ahead.

Gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of economic output -- rose at a 2.5% annual pace in the first three months of the year, driven largely by a pick-up in consumer spending, the Commerce Department said.

Consumer spending, which alone accounts for roughly two-thirds of GDP, rose at a 3.2% annual pace, the fastest pace since the end of 2010.

At first glance, that's pretty remarkable, since most workers saw their take-home pay drop in January, following the end of the payroll tax cut.

But the data also shows that consumers funded that spending in part by saving less. Americans saved an average of 2.6% of their disposable income in the first quarter, down from 4.7% at the end of 2012.

""Households are drawing down savings, and they are borrowing to continue spending,"" said Steve Cunningham, director of research and education for the American Institute for Economic Research. ""That won't last forever.""

What were people buying? Primarily, more services. That too could be partly temporary in nature.

Americans spent more on housing and utilities, which rebounded after slumping following Hurricane Sandy in the prior quarter. This March was also the coldest since 2002, a weather patten that boosted the demand for heating.

Consumer spending on durable goods like autos also contributed to stronger economic growth, but to a lesser extent.

On the business side, investment in equipment and software added slightly to growth. An even bigger boost, however, came as businesses restocked their shelves and warehouses after drawing down their inventories in the fourth quarter. That effect is also likely to be temporary, Cunningham said.

Related: The global economy is losing steam

Meanwhile, cuts in government spending, mainly related to defense, dragged on the economy in the first quarter.

The last two quarters marked the biggest six-month contraction in the federal government's economic activity since the months following the Korean War, which ended in 1953, noted Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist of Capital Economics.

Spending by federal, state and local governments is now lower than it was in mid-2007, before the recession began.

Given the fiscal squeeze, Ashworth said it's rather impressive that the economy still grew 2.5% in the first quarter. Since the recovery began in mid-2009, the economy has grown an average of 2.1% a year. Once you strip out the government's spending, though, that growth looks more like 3.1%.

""It's becoming more and more clear that the public sector is the real thing holding the economy back now,"" he said.

Public-sector cutbacks are likely to continue dragging on the economy through the rest of the year as the federal government alone cuts $85 billion over a seven-month period.

Economic growth isn't likely to be as strong in the second quarter. Other economic data already shows the economy may have lost some steam starting in March.

Job growth slowed, retail sales slumped and the manufacturing sector showed signs of weakness.

Overall, the first quarter GDP report was a bit of a letdown. Economists had been expecting the economy to grow at an even stronger rate of 2.8%.

""Even this weaker-than-hoped-for growth rate exaggerates the true underlying momentum in the economy,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.

U.S. stocks were mixed Friday morning, following the report."

"" data-share-img="""" data-share=""twitter,facebook,linkedin,reddit,google,mail"" data-share-count=""false"">

The Post Office’s problems are the same today as they were back in September: the long-term secular decline of postal mail, on the one hand, combined with all manner of Congressionally-mandated restrictions which make a bad situation much, much worse. And now the inevitable has happened: we’re going to have a $5.5 billion default.

A default of that magnitude sounds scarier than it actually is. Congress requires the Post Office to make inordinately huge pension-plan payments, for reasons which nobody can really understand. But in the final analysis, USPS pensions are a government obligation, and it doesn’t make a huge amount of difference whether they come out of a well-funded pension plan, a badly-funded pension plan, or just out of US government revenues.

What does make a lot of difference is the degree to which the Post Office is hamstrung by Congress. There’s still room for the Postal Service to reorient itself and become a successful 21st-century utility — but there’s no way that’s going to happen if it’s constantly on the back foot and if Congress prevents it from entering new businesses, possibly including banking.

To put it another way: the Post Office is broken, in large part thanks to unhelpful meddling by Congress. And it won’t get fixed unless and until Congress gets out of the way and stops forcing it into the corporate equivalent of ketosis, essentially consuming its own flesh in order to survive.

The talking point from the mailing industry here is that multi-billion-dollar defaults “could make consumers lose confidence in the Postal Service”, and thereby make matters even worse. It’s a bit like the argument we saw in Detroit in 2009, when lots of people said that if the big auto makers went bankrupt, no one would buy their cars any more. That argument wasn’t convincing at the time, and it turned out not to be true. Similarly, I’m not worried about that bickering in Washington will directly affect the confidence that Americans have in their postal service.

On the other hand, it’s pretty much certain that bickering in Washington will unnecessarily make the situation at the Post Office much worse than it needs to be. And as such, it’s a prime example of US political dysfunction. As Zero Hedge says, if the muppets in Washington can’t get this right, what are the chances that they’re going to be able to do the right thing when the fiscal cliff arrives at year-end?

The best hope for America is that politicians are more likely to create fights and dysfunction for things which don’t rise to the level of outright crisis, but that they somehow manage to come together to find solutions when the alternative is catastrophic. That’s often a good bet — but not always. And so while I’m reasonably confident that we’ll get through the fiscal cliff somehow, I’m not at all certain of it. Meanwhile, I am reasonably certain that Congress will starve the USPS of the funding and freedom it needs to succeed over the long term. Which of course will cost taxpayers enormously for as long as postal workers are collecting pension checks."

The only fili that has winner written all over her face.

I'm going to be brief and direct.

You want to know why Hillary Clinton is leading among all Democrats by huge margins? It is simple: She is the only Democrat big enough to separate from President Obama in 2016 and still win a general election. You can't name anybody else who can do that.

Why would any Democrat want to do that? It is simple: Because even 3 years from now, we are still going to have a shitty economy. President Obama's legacy on the economy is pretty much set: slow, middling growth coupled with vast inequality and poverty. Eight more years of treading water is hard sell. You'd have to be an idiot to run on the Obama economic record. For any other Democrat, there will be no avoiding it.

The cyclic nature of politics should mean the tide is against us. Add to that a Democratic Party that is still afraid of its own shadow, and we shouldn't expect any bold policy initiatives that will fix our crap economy. The only thing saving us in a national election is three things:

1. Demographics.

2. The Republican Party is fucking crazy.

3. Hillary.

The sequester is expected to take a $85 billion bite out of the fiscal 2013 budget, though only half of that impact is expected to be felt this year.

But lawmakers say the government already has $45 billion in unspent money which could be used to offset the shortfall

""There are pots of money sitting in different departments across the federal government, that have been authorized over either ... a number of months or a number of years,"" Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., said.

Fresh legislation would authorize that money, which hasn't yet been spent, to be used elsewhere.

Price introduced that legislation Tuesday along with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. It would require the director of the White House budget office to rescind funds that haven't yet been obligated.

More On This...

""Washington's reckless spending culture has produced this situation where hundreds of billions of dollars are borrowed and then left unspent because Congress routinely bites off more than it can chew,"" Rubio said in a statement.

Republican Sen. Tom Coburn has also identified several programs at the Pentagon he'd set aside, including a video called ""grill sergeants"" in which the instructors show their favorite recipes; money for a plan to send a space ship to another solar system; funds to find advancements in beef jerky from France; and $6 billion on questionable research, including what lessons about democracy and decision-making could be learned -- from fish.

Coburn and others also refer to what they call ""duplication nation"" -- dozens of programs intended for the same purpose.

""There are 50 different literacy agencies, 100 different programs focused on science, tech and engineering,"" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said.

Nevertheless, one Democrat mocked those who argue Washington should cut back the way families do.

""Can't we just cut 2 percent just like American families?"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., echoing the question posed repeatedly by GOP lawmakers. ""American families don't run prisons. They don't build their own roads. They don't have to put out their own local police department.""

Though Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano argues the sequester threatens border security, Citizens Against Government Waste President Tom Schatz says the department has $9 billion dollars in unspent preparedness funds.

He also cited one government study that found 47 job training programs across the federal government.

Further, critics point to $90,000 spent to upgrade security at a spring training site in Arizona for professional baseball teams.

Then there's allegations of waste at the General Services Administration. The agency, which runs federal properties, won notoriety when a regional director famously memorialized a lavish government-paid trip to Vegas with a photo of himself in a hot tub.

But aside from the money spent on conferences, lawmakers note that many buildings in the GSA inventory go unused.

In 2010, President Obama said GSA had roughly $15 billion in property that should be sold by 2014. Only a portion has been so far. As of January 2012, the administration claimed they had reduced real property spending by $2.4 billion from the sale of underutilized federal properties and better management.

Some lawmakers hope that the panic over the sequester, which will hit Friday absent any congressional intervention, will force a closer look at wasteful spending.

Jerry Brown will push this year to upend the way schools are funded in California, hoping to shift more money to poorer districts and end requirements that billions of dollars be spent on particular programs.

Brown said he wants more of the state’s dollars to benefit low-income and non-English-speaking students, who typically are more expensive to educate.

“The reality is, in some places students don’t enjoy the same opportunities that people have in other places,” the governor said in an interview. “This is a way to balance some of life’s chances.”

He would also scale back — and possibly eliminate — dozens of rules that districts must abide by to receive billions in state dollars. Some of those requirements, such as a mandate to limit class size, have been suspended amid Sacramento’s recurrent budget problems but are set to resume by 2015.

Brown and his aides are keeping most details under wraps. But advisers say his proposals, part of the budget blueprint to be unveiled early this month, will amount to the most extensive changes in decades in the relationship between school districts and state government.

His intentions are already raising concerns among school administrators, district officials and labor unions. The governor postponed earlier plans to push for the changes when the discord threatened to distract from his campaign for higher taxes. Voters approved the tax hikes in November, averting billions of dollars in education cuts.

Advertisement

Now, the transformation of school funding is at the top of his agenda. He says his goal is more local control.

“What the state has done for 40 years is develop one new program after another to compensate for underperforming” schools, he said. “What we have now is command and control issuing from headquarters in Sacramento.”

Advertisement

Scores of programs set up by state mandate — for smaller classes, bilingual education and summer school, for example — have their own pots of money sent from Sacramento to pay for them. ¿The Public Policy Institute of California found that nearly 40% of every dollar sent to schools from both the state and federal governments is earmarked for such a purpose.

The programs vary in size and scope: $4.5 million to meet the needs of Native American students, $10 million to improve school Internet access, more than $618 million set aside for school buses, etc.

Advertisement

According to Brown’s Department of Finance, 56 such programs received a total of $11.8 billion in state funds last year. ¿The result, the governor says, is a bloated school bureaucracy that takes money away from core instruction.

“You have to have administrators at the state level, district level and at the school level who are engaged in making sure this money is used for what it’s supposed to be used for,” Brown said. “This constant articulation of rules is a world unto itself that is not directly supporting the teacher in the classroom.”

Advertisement

But many of the programs are popular with parents and various interest groups and have staunch defenders in the Capitol. They say lifting restrictions on how schools spend their money could hurt struggling students.

In recent years, state lawmakers have offered districts some flexibility to cope with rounds of budget cuts. The results, some say, have not always been good, leading to larger classes and sharp reductions in programs for adults trying to earn a high school degree.

Advertisement

Since 2008, the average class size in kindergarten through third grade has grown from 20 to 23, among the largest in the nation, according to a study from the Public Policy Institute of California. During the same period, the average class size elsewhere in the country remained at around 15 students.

In addition, “since schools have been given greater flexibility, adult education ... has been decimated throughout the state,” said Jeff Freitas, secretary-treasurer of the California Federation of Teachers. “You can’t just give the locals carte blanche with the money.”

Advertisement

Shifting money to poorer schools at the expense of wealthier ones is also certain to stir protest.

Under a similar proposal the governor floated last year, the Department of Finance estimated that Compton Unified schools would see an uptick of more than $4,700 per pupil by the 2017-18 school year. Manhattan Beach Unified would get a per-student increase of just $681.

Advertisement

Those who have met with Brown’s top education aides expect the governor to propose a similar formula in January, asking districts to account for the expenditures to make sure the funds serve higher-needs students.

Adonai Smith, a lobbyist for the Assn. of California School Administrators, said his members would not support a plan that amounts to a “redistribution of resources.”

The governor says that even if funding is tweaked to favor more poor students and English learners, all schools will receive more money now that state revenue is on the uptick.

“I want to align more closely the money schools receive with the problems that teachers encounter,” Brown said. “When somebody’s teaching in Compton, it’s a much bigger challenge than teaching in Beverly Hills.”

A New Jersey Native', 'He Graduated Loyola University In Maryland.']",Competing plans on student loan rates fail in Senate,"WASHINGTON — With student loan rates set to double in about four weeks, competing proposals to prevent the increase were defeated in back-to-back Senate votes Thursday, leaving the issue unresolved.

The failed measures leave lawmakers snarled in a familiar debate that has divided the parties but has not attracted the attention it did a year ago when it became part of the presidential campaign.

The House voted last month on a proposal that would tie interest rates for Stafford loans to the Treasury’s 10-year borrowing rates, which Republican sponsors said was in line with principles outlined by the Obama administration. Based on current forecasts, the interest rate for subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans would be 5% next year. The proposal would cap such loans at 8.5%.

The White House, however, offered a plan that differs slightly by locking in that variable rate for the duration of the loan rather than allowing it to reset each year. The plan would not place a ceiling on rates but would continue to allow college graduates to repay loans as a percentage of their overall incomes. For a subsidized Stafford loan, the rate in 2014 would be 3.4%.

President Obama, in a Rose Garden event last week, said the plan passed by House Republicans would also eliminate safeguards for low-income families.

The two Senate proposals took different approaches. The Democratic version would have extended the current rates for two years.

Advertisement

The Republican one would have tied the interest rates of all newly issued federal student loans, not simply Stafford loans, to Treasury rates. It would also, like the president’s plan, lock in that interest rate for the life of the loan. Under that plan, interest rates for all loans would be 5.5% next year.

The Democratic plan received 51 votes, nine short of the threshold needed; the Republican plan received 40 votes.

In 2012, as student borrowers faced the same increase in rates, Obama campaigned on the issue, urging Congress to extend lower rates as he appeared in college towns in key states. Congress ultimately voted to pass the one-year extension. Now, without new action by July 1, interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans will double from 3.4% to 6.8%.

Thursday’s votes were seen as political moves, with neither expected to pass.

“This is like the opening act at the circus,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), a co-sponsor of the GOP bill. “Hopefully, the main event will attract some senators who are willing to conduct this in a grown-up way.”

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) called the result “another example of how out of step Republicans in Congress are with the struggles of all of our American families today.”

The House and Senate have three weeks to agree on a compromise before they adjourn for recess.

The White House, which supported the Senate Democratic plan, said in a statement that it was willing to work with lawmakers on a long-term solution.

USA TODAY Collegiate Correspondent

Donya Nasser thought she had maxed out on federal student loans going into her freshman year of college. Unaware that her mother was eligible for a federal Parent PLUS loan, Nasser took out a private loan for $14,000.

""We ended up getting a private loan because we just didn't understand the process, because my mom hadn't gone to college before,"" says Nasser, a junior at St. John's University.

Nasser learned a year later that her mother could have taken out a federal Parent PLUS loan at a much lower interest rate, a miscommunication that will likely cost her thousands of dollars.

The Department of Education is launching a new initiative this fall to help students like Nasser avoid those types of missteps. In this case, the Obama administration will be focusing on the other end of the process: repayment.

The department will soon begin proactively reaching out to struggling student borrowers to make them aware of the various federal repayment and forgiveness programs available to them.

""Even as we work to bring down costs for current and future students, we have got to offer students who already have debt the chance to actually repay it,"" President Obama said during a speech at the University of Buffalo in August, when he announced an array of policy initiatives to lower the cost of college.

There are currently about 1.6 million students enrolled in income-based repayment programs, which allow borrowers to pay back their loans as a percentage of their disposable income. At the same time, 2.1 million borrowers are in default, many of which might have been eligible for a federal program.

""I think a big majority of students don't know about paying back their loans or programs that are out there because we never see the information on campus,"" says Joshua Carter, a junior at the University of Texas at El Paso who will graduate with $30,000 in loans.

Greg Young, a 28-year-old doctoral student at the University of Buffalo, was thinking about applying to a federal repayment program after he graduated from the College of Saint Rose in 2007.

""Frankly, I was really confused in trying to figure out which one was the best, and I wasn't sure where I could get some advice on it,"" he says.

Young was able to defer his loans because he went back to school, but will probably need a federal repayment program to help pay off his $40,000 of debt.

""I think this education campaign is really great because I don't think the information is out there,"" Young says about the Obama administration's new outreach.

Betsy Mayotte, director of regulatory compliance at the non-profit American Student Assistance, says that informing borrowers about repayment options is only half the battle.

The process of applying to a repayment program can be cumbersome, she says, and the Department of Education simply doesn't have the resources to guide everyone through it.

Nasser says she might want to apply for a repayment or forgiveness program but doesn't have the ""slightest clue"" where to start.

""Especially if you are a first-generation student, you don't ever go through a workshop that explains to you, this is how you are going to pay for college,"" she says.

By being proactive instead of reactive, the Department of Education hopes to help struggling students avoid defaulting or paying more than is necessary.

Mayotte just hopes the e-mails and phone calls don't get lost in transmission.

""Borrowers that are past due get a ton of phone calls and they get a ton of mail, and a lot of the time they don't answer the phone and they don't open the mail,"" Mayotte says.

School officials on reservations across Minnesota have begun making painful cuts to the current budget in anticipation of sequester cuts, adding students to classrooms, slashing course offerings and leaving vacant jobs unfilled, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. At least one reservation is considering shortening the school year to save money.

“There’s a real sense of frustration for everybody,” Red Lake Superintendent Steve Wymore told the newspaper.

[pullquote]

State education advocates say the cuts could threaten hard-won progress made by Native Americans. Last year saw graduation rates at 22 Native American school districts rise 3 percentage points, up to about 45 percent.

“It is indefensible that the first wave of reckless sequestration cuts to education will hit our most vulnerable students,” U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., who co-chairs the Congressional Native American Caucus, told the newspaper.

But in Washington, education funding cuts did not stop the appointment this month of a former elementary school teacher and aide to Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. to the job of executive director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African-Americans. David Johns was given the newly created job, where he will be “asked to identify evidence-based best practices to improve African-American student achievement from cradle to career,” according to the Department of Education.

The goal of the initiative is to work with federal, state and local agencies, as well as community groups, to ""produce a more effective continuum of education programs for African-American students.""

Previously, the White House has created similar initiatives to serve Hispanics, Asian-American and Pacific Islanders and American Indian and Native Americans and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. While all of these may be well-intended, the latest job was announced on March 7, barely a week after the sequester cuts were locked into place.

Johns had been serving as a senior education policy adviser to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Before that, he was a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Fellow in Rangel’s office. Johns’ salary in the new job is $123,758, according to a department official.

Outside the beltway, budget cuts are taking a visible toll. The department must cut 5 percent from all education programs to comply with the Budget Control Act, commonly known as sequestration. While most school districts are funded with local taxes, those on tax-exempt Native American lands depend on federal funding.

The selective austerity shown by the Department of Education and other federal agencies shows the Obama administration is trying to emphasize the budget cuts' effect on the public, said Kyle Olson, founder of the Michigan-based education watchdog Education Action Group.

""It seems like there's no rhyme or reason for the cuts that they're making,"" Olson said. ""They are trying to maximize the public effect -- the pain -- in order to make their point. But the fact of the matter is, the sequester is not a cut, it is a reduction in the rate of growth. The choices they're making are absurd."""

As a historian of American education, I do not agree.

Forty-five states have adopted the Common Core national standards, and they are being implemented this year.

Why did 45 states agree to do this? Because the Obama administration had $4.35 billion of Race to the Top federal funds, and states had to adopt ""college-and-career ready standards"" if they wanted to be eligible to compete for those funds. Some states, like Massachusetts, dropped their own well-tested and successful standards and replaced them with the Common Core, in order to win millions in new federal funds.

Is this a good development or not?

If you listen to the promoters of the Common Core standards, you will hear them say that the Common Core is absolutely necessary to prepare students for careers and college.

They say, if we don't have the Common Core, students won't be college-ready or career-ready.

Major corporations have published full-page advertisements in the New York Times and paid for television commercials, warning that our economy will be in serious trouble unless every school and every district and every state adopts the Common Core standards.

A report from the Council on Foreign Relations last year (chaired by Joel Klein and Condoleeza Rice) warned that our national security was at risk unless we adopt the Common Core standards.

The Common Core standards, its boosters insist, are all that stand between us and economic and military catastrophe.

All of this is simply nonsense.

How does anyone know that the Common Core standards will prepare everyone for college and careers since they are now being adopted for the very first time?

How can anyone predict that they will do what their boosters claim?

There is no evidence for any of these claims.

There is no evidence that the Common Core standards will enhance equity. Indeed, the Common Core tests in New York caused a collapse in test scores, causing test scores across the state to plummet. Only 31 percent ""passed"" the Common Core tests. The failure rates were dramatic among the neediest students. Only 3.2 percent of English language learners were able to pass the new tests, along with only 5 percent of students with disabilities, and 17 percent of black students. Faced with tests that are so far beyond their reach, many of these students may give up instead of trying harder.

There is no evidence that those who study these standards will be prepared for careers, because there is nothing in them that bears any relationship to careers.

There is no evidence that the Common Core standards will enhance our national security.

How do we know that it will cause many more students to study math and science? With the collapse in test scores that Common Core brings, maybe students will doubt their ability and opt for less demanding courses.

Why so many promises and ungrounded predictions? It is a mystery.

Even more mysterious is why the nation's major corporations and chambers of commerce now swear by standards that they have very likely never read.

Don't get me wrong. I am all for high standards. I am opposed to standards that are beyond reach. They discourage, they do not encourage.

But the odd thing about these standards is that they seem to be written in stone. Who is in charge of revising them? No one knows.

When I testified by Skype to the Michigan legislative committee debating the Common Core a couple of weeks ago, I told them to listen to their teachers and be prepared to revise the standards to make them better. Someone asked if states were ""allowed"" to change the standards. I asked, why not? Michigan is a sovereign state. If they rewrite the standards to fit the needs of their students, who can stop them? The federal government says it doesn't ""own"" the standards. And that is true. The federal government is forbidden by law from interfering with curriculum and instruction.

States should do what works best for them. I also urged Michigan legislators to delay any Common Core testing until they were confident that teachers had the professional development and resources to teach them and students had had adequate time to learn what would be tested.

Do we need national standards to compare the performance of children in Mississippi to children in New York and Iowa? We already have the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which has been making these comparisons for 20 years.

Maybe I am missing something. Can anyone explain how the nation can adopt national standards without any evidence whatever that they will improve achievement, enrich education, and actually help to prepare young people -- not for the jobs of the future, which are unknown and unknowable -- but for the challenges of citizenship and life? Thebiggest fallacy of the Common Core standards is that they have been sold to the nation without any evidence that they will accomplish what their boosters claim.

Across the nation, our schools are suffering from budget cuts.

Because of budget cuts, there are larger class sizes and fewer guidance counselors, social workers, teachers' assistants, and librarians.

Because of budget cuts, many schools have less time and resources for the arts, physical education, foreign languages, and other subjects crucial for a real education.

As more money is allocated to testing and accountability, less money is available for the essential programs and services that all schools should provide.

Our priorities are confused."

As a historian of American education, I do not agree.

Forty-five states have adopted the Common Core national standards, and they are being implemented this year.

Why did 45 states agree to do this? Because the Obama administration had $4.35 billion of Race to the Top federal funds, and states had to adopt ""college-and-career ready standards"" if they wanted to be eligible to compete for those funds. Some states, like Massachusetts, dropped their own well-tested and successful standards and replaced them with the Common Core, in order to win millions in new federal funds.

Is this a good development or not?

If you listen to the promoters of the Common Core standards, you will hear them say that the Common Core is absolutely necessary to prepare students for careers and college.

They say, if we don't have the Common Core, students won't be college-ready or career-ready.

Major corporations have published full-page advertisements in the New York Times and paid for television commercials, warning that our economy will be in serious trouble unless every school and every district and every state adopts the Common Core standards.

A report from the Council on Foreign Relations last year (chaired by Joel Klein and Condoleeza Rice) warned that our national security was at risk unless we adopt the Common Core standards.

The Common Core standards, its boosters insist, are all that stand between us and economic and military catastrophe.

All of this is simply nonsense.

How does anyone know that the Common Core standards will prepare everyone for college and careers since they are now being adopted for the very first time?

How can anyone predict that they will do what their boosters claim?

There is no evidence for any of these claims.

There is no evidence that the Common Core standards will enhance equity. Indeed, the Common Core tests in New York caused a collapse in test scores, causing test scores across the state to plummet. Only 31 percent ""passed"" the Common Core tests. The failure rates were dramatic among the neediest students. Only 3.2 percent of English language learners were able to pass the new tests, along with only 5 percent of students with disabilities, and 17 percent of black students. Faced with tests that are so far beyond their reach, many of these students may give up instead of trying harder.

There is no evidence that those who study these standards will be prepared for careers, because there is nothing in them that bears any relationship to careers.

There is no evidence that the Common Core standards will enhance our national security.

How do we know that it will cause many more students to study math and science? With the collapse in test scores that Common Core brings, maybe students will doubt their ability and opt for less demanding courses.

Why so many promises and ungrounded predictions? It is a mystery.

Even more mysterious is why the nation's major corporations and chambers of commerce now swear by standards that they have very likely never read.

Don't get me wrong. I am all for high standards. I am opposed to standards that are beyond reach. They discourage, they do not encourage.

But the odd thing about these standards is that they seem to be written in stone. Who is in charge of revising them? No one knows.

When I testified by Skype to the Michigan legislative committee debating the Common Core a couple of weeks ago, I told them to listen to their teachers and be prepared to revise the standards to make them better. Someone asked if states were ""allowed"" to change the standards. I asked, why not? Michigan is a sovereign state. If they rewrite the standards to fit the needs of their students, who can stop them? The federal government says it doesn't ""own"" the standards. And that is true. The federal government is forbidden by law from interfering with curriculum and instruction.

States should do what works best for them. I also urged Michigan legislators to delay any Common Core testing until they were confident that teachers had the professional development and resources to teach them and students had had adequate time to learn what would be tested.

Do we need national standards to compare the performance of children in Mississippi to children in New York and Iowa? We already have the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which has been making these comparisons for 20 years.

Maybe I am missing something. Can anyone explain how the nation can adopt national standards without any evidence whatever that they will improve achievement, enrich education, and actually help to prepare young people -- not for the jobs of the future, which are unknown and unknowable -- but for the challenges of citizenship and life? Thebiggest fallacy of the Common Core standards is that they have been sold to the nation without any evidence that they will accomplish what their boosters claim.

Across the nation, our schools are suffering from budget cuts.

Because of budget cuts, there are larger class sizes and fewer guidance counselors, social workers, teachers' assistants, and librarians.

Because of budget cuts, many schools have less time and resources for the arts, physical education, foreign languages, and other subjects crucial for a real education.

As more money is allocated to testing and accountability, less money is available for the essential programs and services that all schools should provide.

Our priorities are confused."

This is the time for bold change.”

Hers is one state that is not waiting. It has established a board to create a program for limited-license legal technicians, the first in the country. Within a year, the board is expected to lay out the educational and professional framework for the technicians. They will have more training and responsibility than paralegals but will not appear in court or negotiate on their clients’ behalf.

“The consuming public cannot afford lawyers, and the profession needs to figure that out and own it,” Ms. Littlewood said. “Our hope is to provide more access. The second point is that you have these folks out there doing unauthorized practice, which is harming the public. The hope is to bring them under the tent.”

Elsewhere in the country, law schools are trying to deal with declining popularity in a range of ways. The University of Akron Law School in Ohio has frozen its tuition and virtually ended its out-of-state surcharge. At the University of Oregon, Michael Moffitt, the law school’s dean, has started clinics on nonprofit groups, environmental policy and probate mediation. He has also set up law courses for students in other parts of the university, which brings revenue to the law school.

“The problem is that we have been selling only one product,” Mr. Moffitt said. “But if you are getting a business degree, you need to know about contract law. City planners need to know about land-use law. So we at Oregon are educating not just J.D. students."

Perhaps we underestimate ourselves. Five years after the Lehman collapse triggered the deepest recession in eight decades, the middle class may be solving the vexing problems of income inequality and stalled wages on its own.

Faced with unemployment and dim job prospects, Americans made one significant change that should alter their fortunes and those of the middle class for decades: they went back to school. During the recession, there has been a sharp surge in the number of Americans who are getting a college degree.

Photo

For much of the last several decades young Americans, particularly young men, had shied away from college. As a share of the population, there were actually more male college degree holders among those ages 25 to 29 in 1976 than there were in 2006. Between 2000 and 2006, the share of all Americans ages 25 to 29 with a four-year college degree dipped by 0.7 percentage points, with men leading the decline, falling from 27.9 percent to 25.3 percent.

Americans have now reversed that decline by going to school in unprecedented numbers. In 2011, there were 3.2 million more people enrolled in higher education than there were in 2006. This 18 percent increase in enrollment was the largest such jump since the end of the Vietnam War.

In the last six years, American higher education institutions conferred nearly 3.5 million more degrees (from associates to Ph.D.’s) than they did over the six years before that. By last year, 29.8 percent of men and 37.2 percent of women ages 25 to 29 possessed four-year college degrees. This blows past previous highs.

Educational gains during the recession were not reserved for the young. By 2010, there were nearly 8 million students over the age of 25 enrolled in higher education institutions, 1.2 million more than in 2007. Degrees conferred at all levels of education for all races, ages and genders are up from six years ago.

The knock on the American work force is that when it comes to brainpower, it has fallen behind our international competitors. In a recent survey of 23 countries by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, American adults were mediocre in both math and reading. In “The Undereducated American,” Anthony P. Carnevale and Stephen J. Rose assert that the United States has been underproducing college graduates since the 1980s, creating a labor force unable to match the needs of employers.

But is college still worth it today? It’s not just that college graduates are riding out the meager recovery living in their parents’ basements; the fear is that they will permanently underperform in the labor market. This seems unlikely. The recession has followed familiar labor patterns, with unemployment rates among college graduates roughly half those of high school graduates, just as in every recession since the mid-1970s.

In time, these young college graduates will find work and they will earn pay that is significantly higher than what they would have earned had they not gone to college.

How can we be so certain? Because the more education you have, the more you earn. In 2012, two-year-degree holders earned close to $7,000 more per year than their high-school-diploma-only counterparts. Someone with a four-year degree earned roughly $15,000 more than that same someone with an associate degree. A professional degree reaped nearly $35,000 more than a four-year college degree, according to the Department of Labor.

What this means is that the income mobility problem that drives policy makers nuts disappears for those who get a degree. Over the past few decades, those born into the middle three income quintiles were more than twice as likely to reach the top income quintile if they possessed a college degree compared with those who did not. The steepest mobility gains came from those in the second poorest quintile. Nearly two-thirds of these working-class Americans jumped to the richest quintile (37 percent) or the next richest quintile (27 percent) on the basis of earning a college degree.

But we still face serious obstacles if we want to turn this recession-led college resurgence into one of the dominant economic trends of the 21st century. First, almost 60 percent of adults over the age of 25 still do not have any degree beyond a high school diploma. For men in particular, this is a problem. When inflation is accounted for, the peak earnings year for men with a high school diploma was 1973. We’re living in a fantasy if we think that 40-year trend is about to change.

Likewise, college graduation rates are still far too low. Even now, 46 percent of students enrolled in a four-year college will not have a degree after six years.

And then there are the record levels of student debt. For people under 35, student loans are the second largest source of debt behind mortgages. College tuition has increased faster than inflation every single year since 1981.

So what can we do? Anya Kamenetz, the author of “Generation Debt,” has put together some excellent ideas for Third Way, the centrist policy organization where we both work. Let’s start by reducing the number of college administrators per 100 students, which jumped by 40 percent between 1993 and 2007. We should demand a cease-fire to the perk wars in which colleges build ever-more-luxurious living, dining and recreational facilities. Blended learning, which uses online teaching tools together with professors and teaching assistants, could also help students master coursework at less cost.

There are 37 million Americans with some college experience, but no degree. So pegging government tuition aid to college graduation rates would entice schools to find ways of keeping students in class. And eliminating some of the offerings of rarely chosen majors could bring some market efficiencies now lacking in education.

The most commonly discussed solutions to the problem of income inequality seem unlikely to get to the heart of the problem. Yes, we could raise additional taxes on the wealthy, but we just did that. Bumping up the minimum wage would help, but how high would lawmakers allow it to go? We should look instead at what Americans are already doing to solve this problem and help them do it far more successfully and at less cost.

Warren introducing her student loan bill.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduced her first bill, a simple proposal to give students the same loan rates as the nation's biggest banks. Her proposal would allow the cut-rate loans for students for one year, to give Congress the time to come to agreement on a long-term solution to interest rates. Federal Stafford subsidized loan rates for new students are set to double on July 1 to 6.8 percent.

Here's a snippet from her floor speech introducing the bill.



“Some people say that we can’t afford to help our kids through school by keeping student loan interest rates low,” said Senator Warren. “But right now, as I speak, the federal government offers far lower interest rates on loans, every single day–they just don’t do it for everyone. Right now, a big bank can get a loan through the Federal Reserve discount window at a rate of about 0.75%. But this summer a student who is trying to get a loan to go to college will pay almost 7%. In other words, the federal government is going to charge students interest rates that are nine times higher than the rates for the biggest banks–the same banks that destroyed millions of jobs and nearly broke this economy. That isn’t right. And that is why I’m introducing legislation today to give students the same deal that we give to the big banks.” “Big banks get a great deal when they borrow money from the Fed,” Senator Warren continued. “In effect, the American taxpayer is investing in those banks. We should make the same kind of investment in our young people who are trying to get an education. Lend them the money and make them to pay it back, but give our kids a break on the interest they pay. Let’s Bank on Students… Unlike the big banks, students don’t have armies of lobbyists and lawyers. They have only their voices. And they call on us to do what is right.”

Sen. Warren is selling herself a little short, there. Students don't just have their voices. They have Elizabeth Warren's voice, too. That's a damned good thing.

Schoen'],College students face another round of sticker shock,"As college acceptance letters go out in the next few weeks, prospective students and their parents are in for another round of sticker shock.

And while tuition costs keep rising, the roughly three out of every four students headed to state colleges and universities in the fall may not find all of the courses and services they sampled on their college tour.

Faced with continued budget cuts at the state and federal level, state universities continue to raise tuition and cut offerings, according to a recent analysis by the Center of Budget Policy and Priorities.

On average, states are now spending more than $2,500 less per student than they did five years ago, when the Great Recession blew a large hole in most state budgets.

That 28 percent spending cut has forced an average tuition increase of $1,850 per student over the same period. It’s also forced schools to continue to look for ways to cut back, according to Phil Oliff, a CBPP policy analyst who prepared the report.

“They’ve eliminated faculty positions and increased class sizes, frozen staff salaries and instituted furloughs, cut course offerings and even entire departments, closed down computer labs and cut library services, among other cost-saving actions,” Oliff said.

In the last year alone, the total “sticker price” of a four-year public degree has risen a little over 4 percent to $17,860 for in-state students and $30,911 for those from out-of-state, according to the College Board. A private four-year degree, on average, costs nearly $40,000.

Public and private universities have also been hit by cutbacks in state and federal research funding, according to the National Science Board. Research grants now make up about a quarter the average budget among the top 101 public research universities – down from 38 percent two decades ago.

CBPP

The recent round of federal budget cuts known as the “sequester” have only made matters worse. Those cuts – which took effect March 1 – sliced some 5 percent from federal research and development spending, taking a $6 billion bite out of federal research spending, according to the American Council on Education.

The sequester is also cutting federal spending on various programs to help students pay the higher costs of a degree.

Because Congress and the White House continue to haggle over the budget cuts, students getting financial aid letters will need to take those numbers with a grain of salt. But unless Congress makes changes, college-bound students can expect to pay higher origination fees on loans and see smaller grants from various programs.

For those most reliant on aid, the sequester could cost as much as $876 a year, according to the Student Aid Alliance. Those cuts include military tuition assistance, federally supported work-study programs and so-called Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants for low-income students. (Pell grants – which helped roughly a third of all college students in 2011-2012 - were spared this year, but could be cut in the future.)

With costs rising and financial aid drying up, college students and their families are leaning ever more heavily on debt, which now stands at roughly $1 trillion outstanding. Last year, total student borrowing amounted to $113 billion – up 24 percent from five years ago, according to the College Board.

As the national housing and markets show convincing signs of recovery, higher income and property tax revenues are helping to stabilize state budgets. But Oliff says there is little sign states are reversing cuts to higher education.

“Funding has continued to go down,” he said. “The rate of decline of has moderated somewhat, but we don’t see any sign that states are re-investing in their higher education systems. And they’re coming out of an enormously deep hole.”

Only a few days before the big gala concert, the Obama Administration claimed sequestration caused January’s anemic jobs numbers by cutting vital government services. However, the purportedly severe cutbacks of government spending didn’t stop the President from enjoying a night of stirring soul music during Tuesday’s program, titled In Performance at the White House: Memphis Soul.

First Lady Michelle Obama kicked off the April 9 tribute to Soul with an hour-long, morning program held in the White House State Dining Room billed as a “guidance” on the night’s Memphis Soul performance. The event was held for students and music lovers and featured soul greats Sam Moore, Mavis Staples, Charlie Musselwhite, Ben Harper, and pop star Justin Timberlake as panel members taking questions from the audience.

Mrs. Obama opened the morning’s introductory program by discussing the importance of music in America today and urged the children in the audience to faithfully practice playing music.

“The only way for you to become the best musician you can be is to keep pushing through those moments when something doesn’t seem fun by spending hours in the practice room repeating those scales and drilling into that theory,” she said. “And if you do all that… you might become a better performer than you ever imagined.”

The First Lady went on to note that even if one doesn’t become a musician for a career choice, all that effort is still a worthy exercise.

“When I was young I played the piano, now as I try to remind my kids I regret the fact that I didn’t keep it up. I try to tell them that every single day,” she claimed.

The full concert was recorded later that evening and included performances by Alabama Shakes, William Bell, Steve Cropper, Al Green, Ben Harper, Queen Latifah, Cyndi Lauper, Joshua Ledet, Sam Moore, Charlie Musselwhite, Mavis Staples, and Justin Timberlake, with Booker T. Jones as music director and band leader.

During the night’s finale, the artists tried to get President Obama to join in the singing on stage, but the President rebuffed the offer.

Despite declining to sing, Barack and Michelle stayed on the stage during the finale, shaking hands, dancing, and clapping.

The concert was recorded for television, and In Performance at the White House: Memphis Soul was broadcast Tuesday on PBS stations nationwide."

As governor decades ago, he shook up the UC Regents with such unconventional board appointments as music mogul David Geffen, a local YMCA director and a Zen Buddhist porpoise expert. He said faculty pay should be reduced because professors derive “psychic income” from their job.

Now he is challenging the UC and Cal State systems again -- minus the eccentricity. Brown hopes to use state purse strings to force down their expenses, hold the line on tuition and fees, and graduate more students more quickly.

He wants more teaching, less research and more online courses to save money and increase offerings. He says more students should be accepted from California’s community colleges.

The universities must “reconfigure themselves so that they are more effective and they’re able to do excellent work, but do it in a way that will not keep the costs escalating,” said the governor, who attended UC Berkeley.

It is unclear whether the schools will go along. The public universities are among the few areas to which Sacramento devotes a great deal of money without much say in how it is spent -- particularly in the UC system, whose independence is enshrined in California’s Constitution. Relationships between governors and the two systems can be rocky.

In the state budget he proposed last week, Brown increased money for the two systems by more than $250 million each -- less than they requested, but enough to avert tuition hikes in the fall, leaders of both systems have indicated. If they want more in the future, the governor said, they’ll need to do as he asks.

Brown, who sits on the boards of both systems, will make his pitch to UC Regents in San Francisco on Wednesday and to the Cal State University Board of Trustees in Long Beach next week.

Some university leaders said they welcome his input.

“I personally am overjoyed,” said Sherry Lansing, the former head of Paramount Studios who is now the president of the UC Regents. “For me, there’s nothing better than to have the governor come so he can understand the problems that we’re facing, and work with us to find some solutions.”

In addition to a 12% to 18% funding hike in the coming fiscal year, Brown is proposing 4% to 5% increases for both systems over the four subsequent years if they will keep student costs steady during that time.

He wants limits on the number of units that students can take, charging more for those who accumulate more credits without graduating. That, he said, would free up space for others to get courses they need to finish their degrees in a timely manner.

The governor has said both systems should trim their administrative expenses. A 2010 study by a faculty group showed the number of senior administrators had increased by 125% since 1997, while the number of students increased 33%.

“I’ve got a whole book showing how the university is spending money it doesn’t have to,” Brown has said, referring to “certain kinds of research, sports, gardeners, a lot of things.”

Former Regent Ward Connerly said the universities frown upon meddling by governors and other politicians.

“There’s a feeling that this is our domain and the governor shouldn’t be too engaged, shouldn’t be playing in our backyard,” he said in an interview.

“That creates a tendency to resist.”

Former Gov. Gray Davis, who served on both boards from 1995 to 2003 as lieutenant governor and governor, said academics “have a much longer time horizon and move much more slowly.”

“If they don’t want to do something you propose,” Davis said, “they will just slow-walk you and wait for you to be out of office.”

But Brown has been working for months to cultivate university leaders, even taking the unusual step of participating in regents meetings. He needed the schools’ support for his tax hikes, passed by voters in November, and the universities were happy to help: The new revenue spared them $500 million in combined budget cuts.

Robert Powell, chairman of the UC Academic Senate, said he and other faculty leaders met for three hours with the governor in Oakland last fall.

“He was really drilling down,” asking detailed questions about increasing summer courses, the obstacles students face to graduating in four years and the possibility of three-year degrees, Powell said.

But he was skeptical of Brown’s hope that online courses would save significant money.

“You’re not going to teach students more cheaply,” he said. “No one has demonstrated an ability to do that.”

Bob Samuels, president of the UC union for more than 4,000 lecturers and librarians, said his members have mixed feelings about the new attention from Brown. They appreciate being spared the budget ax, but they’re wary too.

History has shown, Samuels said, that Brown “is a very unpredictable person.”

William Tierney, director of USC’s Pelias Center for Higher Education, welcomed Brown’s overtures.

“Significant reform of higher education almost always happens when the governor is centrally involved,” Tierney said, adding that Brown should use the political capital from his tax victory to also tackle such challenging issues as duplicative courses and administrative functions.

Brown says he’ll be “listening a lot” as he pursues change, and his approach will be less sensational than in the past.

“Before when I used to go to the regents, I’d go armed and I was attacking,” Brown said. ""... You’ve got to be more subtle; you need more allies.”
