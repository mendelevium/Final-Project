While short of the 3.3 million enrollees that the Obama administration was hoping for by now, the number signing up for insurance is a dramatic improvement from the early weeks of the program, when barely 150,000 got coverage because of a series of technical problems with the federal website HealthCare.gov. Sign-ups for what has become known as Obamacare gained pace during December as the website's performance improved, and as more Americans focused on getting coverage by the new year. Many of the newly insured under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enrolled just ahead of a December 24 deadline to receive benefits on January 1, giving health insurers a tight framework to create accounts that can be accessed by doctors. About half the 2.1 million signed up for private health insurance on the federal website, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters in a conference call. HealthCare.gov covers 36 states; another 14 states and the District of Columbia have their own healthcare websites. Sebelius said that in October and November, another 3.9 million Americans were determined eligible for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program, although this included some renewals. Both are government-run programs serving low-income people. HealthCare.gov crashed soon after its launch on October 1, as millions of visitors accessed the site, and remained balky for much of the ensuing weeks. The disastrous rollout disappointed those who were trying to enroll in subsidized health insurance, and damaged the credibility of President Obama and his signature domestic policy achievement. Two officials have left the U.S. agency that was in charge of launching the website. Administration officials hope they have turned a corner toward a better-working program that makes it possible for millions of Americans to get health insurance who did not have it before. People can still sign up until March 31 for coverage in 2014. But the new year is expected to bring new challenges as many Americans begin to use their medical coverage for the first time. U.S. officials have said that some errors occurred with the transmission of enrollment data to insurers, especially early in the enrollment period. ""January 1st marks not only the beginning of a New Year, but an exciting new day in health care as millions of Americans will now be able to access care, thanks to the coverage they found at the Health Insurance Marketplace,"" Sebelius said in a blog posting on Tuesday. ""For many of the newly insured ... it will be the first time that they can enjoy the security that comes with health coverage,"" Sebelius said. She said the administration was doing everything possible to help with the transition period. (Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Bill Trott)"

The deal is meant to mollify millions of people enraged after their insurers canceled policies that do not meet Obamacare requirements. But how many it will ultimately help remains to be seen.

The uproar over the cancellations has ensnared the White House for weeks, shining a spotlight on Obama's previous promise that people who liked their insurance plans can keep them.

""This fix won't solve every problem for every person. But it's going to help a lot of people,"" the president said at the White House.

But the fix, as reported earlier by CNN's Dana Bash, puts the onus of the renewals outside the president's control: The administration is not requiring insurers or state insurance commissioners to extend the existing plans, but instead is letting them offer an additional year of coverage.

Also, insurers must notify policyholders of the difference in benefits between their policies and the Obamacare plans available on the insurance exchanges. And the companies must inform people that additional policies are available on the exchanges and that subsidies may be available to those who qualify.

Share your story: Are you signing up for Obamacare?

Not everyone who has received a cancellation notice, however, may be able to extend.

Since insurance is regulated at the state level, it remains up to the commissioners to permit the extensions and the companies to do so. The president noted that not all commissioners may agree to extensions. At least four states -- California, Idaho, Virginia and Kentucky -- are requiring all individual plans adhere to Obamacare rules.

The insurance industry said the reversal could cause major problems, including a hike in premiums if fewer younger and healthier people opt to buy in the exchanges.

""Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,"" said Karen Ignagni, chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group. "" Additional steps must be taken to stabilize the marketplace and mitigate the adverse impact on consumers.""

In his remarks, Obama said he didn't want his signature policy to be the reason people are losing their insurance.

""The key point is that it allows us to be able to say to the folks who receive these notices, look, you know, I, the president of the United States, and the insurance -- the insurance model of the Affordable Care Act -- is not going to be getting in the way of you shopping in the individual market that you used to have,"" he said.

But he also stressed that the reason for health reform is that the current system did not work well, and that Americans will be able to find better quality insurance on the exchanges.

""It's important that we don't pretend that somehow that's a place worth going back to,"" he said, of the existing individual market. ""Too often, it works fine, as long as you stay healthy. It doesn't work well when you're sick.""

See how many people signed up in your state

Also, in announcing the changes Thursday, Obama apologized for the rough start to enrollment in the federal and state exchanges. The websites have been marred by major technological problems that have stymied many visitors from registering accounts, determining whether they are eligible for subsidies and picking insurance plans. Only 106,185 people signed up for insurance in the first month, with fewer than 27,000 of them going through the federal healthcare.gov site, which is handling enrollment for 36 states.

""We fumbled the roll out on this health care law,"" he said.

Only 106,185 people signed up for insurance in the first month, with fewer than 27,000 of them going through the federal healthcare.gov site, which is handling enrollment for 36 states. And the site is still far from fully operational, leaving tech experts racing to get it working by month's end, as the administration promised.

Obama said the website healthcare.gov will see ""marked and noticeable"" improvement.

Americans have until March 31 for sign up for a plan, but people must select and pay for a plan by Dec. 15 for coverage to start Jan. 1.

McWain lives alone and is semi-paralyzed from the waist down. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)

After a spinal condition paralyzed her legs six years ago, Joyce McWain-Gray crawled to her second-floor bedroom in a LeDroit Park rowhouse and holed up for nearly a year.

For her weekly medical appointments, the 56-year-old relied on District firefighters to carry her down the 12 steps from her room.

McWain-Gray grew hopeless, she said, until a social worker told her about the District’s Elderly and Persons with Physical Disabilities Waiver Program.

The Medicaid program sent an aide to her house for 16 hours a day to help her bathe, dress, cook and clean. She got a motorized wheelchair and learned to ride the bus.

Then one day her freedom ended.

The District would no longer pay for her care during evening hours, she learned in a letter from her home health agency. Then, three days later, the aide left a stack of adult diapers and a cooler of food next to McWain-Gray’s bed and left.

“They helped me with everything, and then all of a sudden it was gone,” said McWain-Gray, who lives on $710 a month in Social Security benefits. “I can’t even go to the bathroom by myself.”

McWain-Gray was illegally dropped from the program, her attorneys say, along with hundreds of other elderly or disabled people in the District — a move that attorneys who work for the city concede might have been improper.

The Washington Post found that the District cut 366 people from all or some of the services they may have been eligible to receive in the nine months ended March 2012, according to records on file at the D.C. Attorney General’s Office. About a third of those people died, the office said. The District doesn’t know how they died because the program doesn’t get copies of death certificates, officials said.

“These are absolutely critical services. The safety net falls and we look at dire consequences,” said Rebekah Mason, a staff attorney for the AARP’s Legal Counsel for the Elderly, which has represented about a dozen people facing termination from the District’s Medicaid waiver program.

Reinstatement possible

Officials with the District’s Department of Health Care Finance, which runs the waiver program, deny wrongfully cutting anyone from home health services. They said many participants lose their spots when contract case managers submit incomplete or late annual paperwork required by federal law. They said people can request an administrative hearing to fight the terminations and get back into the program if they are eligible. In the past two years, the District reinstated about 600 people, said Yvonne Iscandari, program director for the department’s Division of Long Term Care.

“You are not going to have a perfect system,” said Iscandari, who oversees the waiver program. “You are going to have instances where somewhere in the process somebody’s eligibility was not updated.”

But even home health agencies that contract with the District — and take some of the blame — worry that the District’s bureaucracy puts vulnerable people in peril.

“We’re not totally innocent in this, but some of the processes they’ve implemented have put some of the patients at risk and the agencies at risk,” said Linda Davis, owner of Premium Select Home Care, which serves about 100 Medicaid recipients in the District.

About two dozen licensed home health-care agencies contract with the District to serve about 3,000 people in the program. The District created the program in 1999, six years after Congress allowed Medicaid money to cover basic home help that doesn’t require a nurse. People must make less than $2,130 a month to qualify. The District funds 30 percent of the program and the federal government covers the rest.

The popular program reached its cap in 2011, creating a waiting list of more than 1,000 people. That triggered a paperwork backlog for contract case managers, who must get doctors to approve the level of care for each client every year. If they file it late or at the last minute, the District might not have time to authorize the continued care before the federal deadline, District officials said. That’s when the system ends the aid.

Legal guidance

Many of those people cut from the program got help from a handful of organizations that provide free legal services to seniors and people with disabilities. Attorneys for University Legal Services said they have taken up 30 to 40 termination cases in the past year and half. In some of those cases, people returned home from a brief hospital stay to discover that their aide and spot in the program were gone.

McWain-Gray is one of the people that University Legal Services helped.

She was still wearing a neck brace from a recent spinal surgery when she called for help in January 2012.

McWain-Gray said she remembers trying to change her diaper in bed in the evenings. She could not sit up. Widowed with no children, she says she had no one to turn to.

McWain-Gray’s attorney requested a hearing in front of an administrative judge, arguing that the District broke the law by not giving the woman enough notice of the pending termination.

Ending the Medicaid benefits of people who are eligible for them is illegal, said her attorney, Marjorie Rifkin. Within a few days of ending services, the District placed McWain-Gray back in the program and restored the 16 hours of daily home care.

Some clients receive vague notices that they will soon lose their home care. Others never get a notice. The practice is forcing people into nursing homes or leaving them to fend for themselves, Rifkin said. That led her and four other attorneys to write a complaint to D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) in February 2012, threatening to sue the city if it didn’t make changes.

“We urge you to intervene to stop this practice and remediate the harm to those who need EPD Waiver services and supports to remain in their homes and the community,” read the complaint from the National Senior Citizens Law Center and University Legal Services.

Various outcomes

Attorneys who work for the city responded a few months later, saying that more than 300 people might have been improperly terminated from the program. Staff from Health Care Finance tracked down those people and found that 133 had died and 37 had entered nursing homes or other long-term care facilities, according to the letter. An additional 95 placed on the basic state Medicaid plan said they were satisfied with it. The District also took 69 people back into the waiver program at their request, the letter said.

The bureaucratic mess almost left one Northeast Washington man without anyone to care for his 89-year-old mother, who has dementia. Dwayne Hughes, 52, said he reached out for legal help after the woman’s home health-care agency kept calling to say that the District wasn’t paying. In November, Legal Counsel for the Elderly got Hughes’s mother back into the program.

“I made a commitment that I would take care of my mom. I’m going to keep her in the home as long as possible,” said Hughes, who arranged for 12 hours of daily care for his mother while he works evenings at a telecommunications company in McLean. “This is a good program, but there needs to be more oversight.”

Health Care Finance officials point to steps the District has taken to prevent people from losing the waiver benefits. District staff held mandatory training sessions for all case managers last year, focusing on the need to complete annual recertification on time, Iscandari said. Health Care Finance also began mailing notices to participants 90 days and 30 days ahead of their yearly recertification deadline. And all 1,397 people on the waiting list have received notice of available slots, she said.

The 30-day termination notices, which tell participants that they can request a hearing, help ensure that everyone who is eligible for home aid will continue to get it, Iscandari said. The program does not track how many people are terminated, when or why.

More to be done

Attorneys and advocates for Medicaid recipients say the District hasn’t done enough. People who don’t request a hearing can still lose their services because of the District’s administrative errors, Rifkin said.

“We don’t think the problem has been solved,” she said. “They’ve failed to manage the process.”"

She Also Writes A Weekly Column.']",Ruth Marcus: The real hurdles in Obamacare,"Maybe it was the too-cute-by-half way the administration let slip the news about delaying the requirement that employers provide health care — policymaking by early evening blog post. Any announcement so deliberately low-key had to signal bad news.

Maybe it was wishful thinking on the part of the health-care law’s legions of enemies. “This announcement means even the Obama administration knows the ‘train wreck’ will only get worse,” chirped House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), declaring “a clear acknowledgment that the law is unworkable.”

Whatever the reason, reports of the impending death of Obamacare have been greatly exaggerated. Indeed, reports that postponing the mandate demonstrate that the law is too unwieldy to work have been greatly exaggerated.

Put another way, if you are a fan of the Affordable Care Act and worry about its implementation, or an enemy salivating at the prospect of its implosion, you should focus on other potential problem areas. Among them:

●Whether the insurance exchanges will be up and running by Oct. 1 in a way that’s accessible and comprehensible to consumers.

●Whether there will be enough sign-ups by the “young invincibles” who may believe they are impervious to the need for health insurance but whose premium dollars are essential to keeping overall costs low.

●Whether — and this is perhaps most fundamental — it is possible to implement a change this sweeping and complex in the face of massive political resistance by states whose Republican governors decline to participate and by Republicans in Congress unwilling to consider legislative tweaks or to provide adequate funding for implementation.

In other words, of all the headaches facing Obamacare, the employer mandate isn’t close to the most throbbing.

The essential mandate is the requirement that individuals obtain insurance. The parallel mandate that employers with more than 50 workers offer insurance was something of an add-on, a belt on top of suspenders. Without it, the law still works.

The reason is that most employers covered by the requirement — more than 94 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation — already offer insurance. Their incentives to do so — to attract and retain workers, to take advantage of the tax-free nature of compensation in the form of health-care benefits rather than salary — will remain, regardless of the mandate. Most employers will continue to play, whether or not they have to pay.

Some critics have argued that the employer penalties, $2,000 to $3,000 per worker, perversely incentivize employers to drop coverage because paying the fine would be less costly than providing insurance and because their employees would be able to purchase coverage on exchanges. Yet in Massachusetts, where the employer penalties were far lower than those in federal law, the share of employers offering insurance rose after the mandate took effect.

At the same time, the precise structure of the federal employer mandate is ungainly — or, less charitably, dumb. It kicks in for employees working more than 30 hours a week. Employers may be tempted to game the system — and hurt workers — simply by reducing hours, converting full-time employees to part-timers.

The better approach, as my colleague Ezra Klein has argued, was in the House version of health-care reform, which calculated employer compliance based on the percentage of payroll spent on health care.

So what will be the impact of the delay? There is, granted, a certain irony in the administration freeing employers from the responsibility to provide coverage while individuals continue to face a penalty if they do not obtain it.

Still, as noted earlier, employers that offer coverage now aren’t about to drop it because of this change. As for the relatively small number of employers that would have added coverage in response to the mandate, their workers aren’t out in the cold. They will be able to buy insurance on the exchanges and, because most are low- to moderate-income, will be eligible for federal subsidies to pay the cost.

Similarly, workers whose employer-sponsored coverage is unaffordable (because it exceeds 9.5 percent of incomes) or fails to meet minimum standards are also eligible for subsidized insurance on the exchanges.

In short, the federal government loses income from the expected penalty payments — $10 billion, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. The complications that induced the administration to postpone the employer mandate (how to count workers’ hours or implement reporting requirements) are just that — complications, not insurmountable obstacles.

Expanded access to insurance — the fundamental goal of health-care reform — remains intact.

Congress is treated differently under Obamacare%2C but is not exempt

Taxpayers would continue to pay for congressional health benefits after exchanges start

Author of the congressional provision claims %22drafting error%22 in forcing Congress into exchanges

WASHINGTON — Of all the arguments against the Affordable Care Act that congressional Republicans are mustering in the debate over the spending bill, one hits closest to home. Congress, they say, is exempt from the very law that applies to everyone else.

The truth: Members of Congress are treated differently under Obamacare, but they're not exempt. In fact, by forcing them to purchase health insurance through publicly run exchanges, they're impacted more by that key provision than similar employees in private sector — or even in government.

But members of Congress will also be able to purchase their insurance under terms that are more favorable than other employees — in government or in business — who have access to employer-provided health care.

Here's the history: During the 2010 debate over the Affordable Care Act, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, proposed an amendment requiring members of Congress and their staffs to purchase health insurance though state exchanges. Democrats, viewing the amendment as a political stunt, co-opted the idea as their own and inserted it into the bill.

But the provision was silent about who would pay for that insurance, or how those payments would be treated. The exchanges were intended for uninsured people who couldn't get health insurance through their employer or qualify for Medicaid. Those who had access to health benefits meeting minimum coverage levels could still purchase insurance on the exchanges — but without a subsidy and using after-tax income.

Holding members of Congress and their staffs to that standard would have the effect of stripping them of the employer-paid health coverage they currently get, which is the same as any other federal employee. So the Office of Personnel Management issued a proposed rule in August making clear that the government would continue to pay the employer contribution for congressional health benefits at the same rate as if members were still on the federal plan.

Grassley now says that was his intent all along. ""My goal, regardless of how the amendment was worded … was that we need to go into the exchange so that we would have to go through the same red tape as every other citizen,"" he told Roll Call Thursday. But because of what Grassley called a ""drafting error,"" the amendment left out language that would have explicitly given lawmakers the same before-tax employer contribution as any other federal employee gets.

Some of Grassley's Republican colleagues have a different interpretation. Sen. David Vitter, R-La., introduced an unsuccessful amendment to the spending bill that would have required members of Congress to pay the full cost of their health care.

""We're on a timetable, a collision course, where unless we act a horrible policy and illegal Obama administration rule will go into effect,"" Vitter said on the Senate floor Thursday. ""And the rule says for members and any staff who do go to the exchange, they do get to take a big fat taxpayer-funded subsidy with them — a subsidy that's completely unavailable to any other American at that income level going into the exchange.""

To complicate matters, some congressional staffers would not be subject to the special treatment of Congress under Obamacare. The Grassley amendment applies to ""all full-time and part-time employees employed by the official office of a member of Congress, whether in Washington, D.C., or outside Washington, DC.""

The Office of Personnel Management said ""official office"" might not include staffers who work for a committee or leadership office — and left it up to each member of Congress to decide which staffers would be forced out of the federal health plan and into the exchanges.

Don%27t try to do platinum plan shopping in Indiana

Florida and Arizona have many plans to choose from

Insurers treading carefully during health exchanges%27 first year

Some counties in the U.S. have almost 30 times more choices of health insurance plans than others do, a stark example of the lack of competition in many parts of the country as consumers try to shop for affordable coverage on the new federally run exchanges.

USA TODAY analyzed data from HealthCare.gov, the federal health insurance exchange selling plans for 34 of the states that didn't set up their own exchanges. The analysis clearly shows the impact of insurers' hesitancy to move into states where they aren't already doing business.

Insurance companies are being especially cautious during the first year rollout of the Affordable Care Act and are sticking to states and counties where they already have established networks of doctors and hospitals. That leaves consumers with few choices in many areas and may contribute to the slow sales on the glitch-ridden exchange.

""This is brand new and insurers are really risk averse,"" says Wendell Potter, a former spokesman for Cigna insurance, who is now an author and industry watchdog. ""They don't know how the market will behave, so the for-profit companies in particular are going to be sitting this out. Shareholders have no patience for this kind of uncertainty.""

Competition among health insurers varied widely county by county before the ACA, Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters says. ""That's not something the law is going to change overnight,"" she says.

About 95% of consumers will have a choice of two or more health insurance issuers, ""and often many more,"" says Peters. Last year, just one or two different insurance companies dominated the individual insurance market in most states, the White House said in May. One insurer covered more than 50% of all enrollees in the individual insurance market in 29 states.

State and county competition and coverage:

• Florida and Arizona stand out as hotbeds of competition, falling into a small category of states with several counties boasting 80 to 170 plans. Several insurers have already been selling Medicare Advantage plans in Arizona and Florida, making the states logical places for them to sell aggressively on the exchanges.

• Alabama, Mississippi and Maine have just two to 21 plan choices except for a small area of central Alabama where there are up to 30 available. Doctors tend to avoid smaller markets, which makes it harder for insurers to attract enough physicians to their networks to make plans competitive, Potter says. He worries that the high rate of uninsured residents in rural areas may not ""change a whole lot in the new market.""

But Kevin Lucia, a senior research fellow at Georgetown University's Center for Health Insurance Reforms, says even though Blue Cross Blue Shield has well over 90% of the market in Alabama, its rates are fairly competitive.

• Wisconsin residents have numerous options in eastern counties and fewer in the more rural western half of the state.

• Some states have no top-level platinum plans except in certain areas, such as Cincinnati, Northern Virginia, Salt Lake City, Chicago and the Peoria-Galesburg region. Alabama — a poor state with poor health rankings — has universal access to a platinum plan, but states such as Indiana and Maine don't have any. Platinum plans, which cover 90% of eligible medical expenses, also have the highest premiums, ranging from $196 to $497 a month for a 27-year-old individual's plan.

• Residents of Northern states tend to have more choices than those in Southern states, with the exception of Maine and New Hampshire. Indiana is evenly divided along those lines, with fewer choices in the southern, more rural region and more in the industrial, northern part of the state.

• Some unusual differences appear. Everyone in North Carolina, for example, has access to at least one platinum plan, but no one does in relatively affluent areas around Dallas-Fort Worth and St. Louis.

While some say too many plan choices could overwhelm consumers, others say having more choice is always better. Even if consumers need help navigating multiple choices, options provide ""more pricing variability and more benefits variability,"" says Bryce Williams, managing director for consulting firm Towers Watson Exchange Solutions, which operates private health insurance exchanges for businesses.

Along with platinum, exchanges also typically offer options in three different metal categories. All prices could be significantly reduced by subsidies and other financial assistance available to people earning up to four times the federal poverty limit, or about $44,000 a year. Before subsidies, a 27-year-old would pay $135 to $335 a month for the least expensive bronze plan, a silver plan would cost that person $185 to $400 and a gold plan would range from $222 to $504, according to USA TODAY's review of HealthCare.gov's pricing.

Prices can vary widely depending on competition, however, which is why states running their own exchanges are trying to find ways to get more insurers to participate. Maryland requires insurers above a certain size to participate in their exchange if they already do business in the state. Colorado, New York and Oregon are trying waiting periods that would keep insurers out for a certain period of time after 2014 if they don't sell plans next year.

Expanding into states where they don't have contracts with doctors and hospitals is costly for insurers, Williams says. When insurance companies don't have established networks of health care providers, they often rent the networks used by other insurers. That means they have to charge prices others negotiated, plus an additional fee that makes the process inefficient and costly, Williams says.

Optima Health, a Virginia Beach-based insurer, is just selling HMO plans on the exchange and only in Virginia. It only has an established network of doctors in the state and wants to see what consumers are buying on the exchange before it expands, spokesman Bobby Pearson says.

""This is going to be a trial year to see what happens,"" Pearson says. ""You may see a broader range of options going forward.""

Optima is participating in all parts of the state except for part of the more urban Northern Virginia. John Holahan, a fellow at the Urban Institute who has been studying health care reform, says Optima — which had been a Medicaid provider — is helping drive down insurance costs in rural areas of the state by competing aggressively with insurer Anthem.

The paltry selection of plans in some states and counties covered by the federal exchange could lead to sticker shock for many of the working poor who aren't eligible for much or any financial help, but do need insurance. experts say. And it could undermine the idea that the Affordable Care Act will make insurance — affordable.

""We all wanted there to be a competitive dynamic,"" Williams says. ""Whether or not it gets more affordable remains to be seen.""

Depending on the state, ""reform is likely to look quite different,"" Holahan says. ""In some states, it's going to be working and in some states it could be a mess.""

DelBene is the former head of Microsoft%27s Office division

Kurt DelBene announced his retirement from Microsoft in July

WASHINGTON — Kurt DelBene, former president of the Microsoft Office Division, will replace Jeff Zients as the administration's point person on HealthCare.gov, the Department of Health and Human Services announced Tuesday.

""Jeff did an outstanding job working with our team to provide management advice and counsel on the HealthCare.gov project,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote in a blog post. ""Today, the site is night and day from what it was when it launched on October 1.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Obama discussed the new appointment during his meeting today with a group of high-tech executives. DelBene will work with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

""He starts tomorrow,"" Carney said. He cited the appointee's background and experience: ""He is uniquely suited to this task.""

Zients came in after HealthCare.gov's dismal rollout Oct. 1 to fix the site. He quickly brought in outside technology experts to determine the problems, initiated software and hardware upgrades, and began daily briefings with the press so the public would understand what the government was doing to fix the problem. He promised the site would be operational by Nov. 30, and the government was able to reach that goal.

""Kurt will work closely with me, the White House, and the teams and senior leadership in place at HHS and CMS to see this project through its next important phase as the CMS team continues to build on their initial progress,"" Sebelius wrote. ""He has agreed to serve in this role for at least the first half of next year.""

Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., praised the White House for appointing a long-term director of the project.

""Although Colorado's health exchange has not experienced the difficulties of HealthCare.gov, Mr. DelBene's appointment is a good step toward achieving the goal of giving all consumers — regardless of where they live — a functioning marketplace to find and compare health plans,"" Udall said.

Sebelius said several lawmakers, including Udall, had provided advice in the new appointment.

Sebelius said DelBene would provide oversight and advice on everything from technology to marketing, as well as execute the existing plan.

""The President and I believe strongly in having one person, with strong experience and expertise in management and execution, who is thinking 24/7 about HealthCare.gov,"" she wrote. He will continue to work with QSSI, the general contractor for HealthCare.gov.

The government also released statements from technology executives who have worked with DelBene in the past.

""Kurt is a talented and capable executive, with a track record of successfully managing complex large-scale technology projects,"" said Bill Gates, Microsoft's founder. ""Working with Kurt over many years, I know him to be a passionate advocate for using technology to solve difficult problems at scale. I'm certain he'll make an important positive contribution in his new role with HHS.""

DelBene stepped down from Microsoft in July as part of a reorganization announced by CEO Steve Ballmer, who then announced his own retirement in August.

DelBene's wife, Suzan, a Democratic U.S. House member from Washington state, is also a former Microsoft executive."

The Board', 'Which Operates Separately The Newsroom', 'Proceeds On The Presumption That Serious']","Finally, the Obamacare rollout","State insurance-buying exchanges — one of the centerpieces of President Obama’s controversial 2010 healthcare law — begin their first open enrollment period Tuesday, an event that both supporters and opponents have been eagerly anticipating practically since the legislation was signed 3 1/2 years ago. For the first time, low- and moderate-income Americans who don’t have health benefits at work will be able to sign up for comprehensive coverage at a discount, thanks to taxpayer subsidies that offset much of the costs.

The exchanges are opening their doors as federal and state governments are still struggling to implement some important elements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Some requirements, such as the mandate on larger employers to provide affordable health benefits, have been postponed. Outside California, some exchanges aren’t yet ready to offer certain features, such as online sign-ups. And in several red states, elected officials are actively undermining the exchanges and their uninsured constituents’ ability to obtain coverage.

Add to that the misguided effort by congressional Republicans last week to “defund Obamacare,” and you have a lot of drama surrounding the exchanges’ debut. Still, the test of the exchanges’ viability — and the sustainability of the Affordable Care Act — isn’t what happens on Day One. It’s whether they attract a broad and deep pool of the previously uninsured by the time the enrollment period ends March 31.

The idea of an insurance exchange has broad bipartisan support because the concept is elegantly simple: Give people an easy way to compare and sign up for insurers’ offerings and that will increase competition, hold down premiums and expand coverage. The technical challenges are significant, however, because the exchanges’ computer systems have to inter-operate with those of federal, state and county governments and the health plans that are offering coverage.

State officials and health plan executives say they’re confident that Covered California, the state’s exchange, is ready to handle the calls and Web traffic it is expected to receive on opening day. But that’s partly because most buyers are likely to enroll closer to Jan. 1, when the coverage becomes effective. Some applicants will run into problems regardless — that’s inevitable on a venture of this scale. It’s impossible to know how manageable those problems will be until people start applying.

Although some troubling glitches have surfaced, the delays and shortcomings experienced so far have been overblown. The exchanges will not invite insurance fraud on a grand scale, as some have suggested, nor will they will lead employers to stop offering health benefits en masse.

The real challenge for Covered California and its counterparts will be getting their message out to the uninsured, then persuading younger, healthier individuals to pay for coverage that they have been content to live without until now. Although insurers aren’t charging as much as federal budget analysts predicted, the price of coverage will go up for many of the healthy people insurers have been eager to have as customers, while dropping for many of the ailing and higher-risk people insurers have been reluctant to cover. That’s because the law requires insurers to cover all applicants, ignore preexisting conditions and charge older customers no more than three times as much as they do younger ones. It also requires adult Americans to carry coverage, although the penalty for going uninsured will likely be smaller than the premiums.

The subsidies will make a huge difference in the cost of coverage for many low- and moderate-income Americans. Yet a new survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that almost three-fourths of eligible Californians were unaware of the aid or assumed (wrongly) that they were ineligible.

That lack of awareness is one hurdle. Another is the relentless invective about Obamacare that’s reducing support for the law among the people who have the most to gain from it. But the exchanges have started telling the other side of the story, and their outreach begins in earnest Tuesday. Rather than getting caught up in the overheated rhetoric, consumers should explore Covered California’s offerings and measure the costs and benefits of the law for themselves."

Good luck. Not only will you have to navigate the technical problems that have plagued the site -- but in most states, those running the exchanges are not posting ratings that could give shoppers a clear sense of how good the plans are.

The consumer ratings are called for in the Affordable Care Act. They would be provided by a respected independent company, allowing consumers to judge health plans by treatment outcome, service and consumer satisfaction.

Federal and state officials, though, largely decided it would reflect poorly on the insurance exchanges if some companies were rated and others were not -- and have not yet published them.

""We think that is ludicrous,"" said Garry Maisel, CEO of Western Health Advantage, an ObamaCare-approved provider. ""Consumers deserve to know what is unrated versus what has been around a long time and has a good quality rating.""

The controversy arose last week in California, when Western Advantage and two other highly rated providers -- Kaiser Permanente and Sharp Health Care -- complained the state failed to post their ratings because of opposition from lower-rated plans.

""When a quality rating is available, consumers should have access to it,"" said Maisel. ""If I was a consumer, I would want to know [if] the plan I pick, the network of providers I access care through, was just put together or has been around a long time.""

Kaiser Permanente in California is ranked #7 nationally. Blue Shield in California is ranked #414. But on the Covered California website, consumers have no way of knowing that, because the state refused to post the ratings.

Last week, officials reversed that decision and said the state will begin adding quality scores in 2015.

""To make a smart choice, we need more information, that is why this rating system is so important,"" said health care analyst Betsy McCaughey. ""Otherwise choosing a plan on these exchanges is just a shot in the dark.""

The National Council on Quality Assurance rates almost every health plan available nationwide on treatment, prevention and customer service. Each category is scored on a scale of 1 to 5, and then plans are ranked from best to worst.

Eighty percent of insurers nationwide are rated by the NCQA. But only eight states are posting those ratings. The rest, including the 34 state health care exchanges managed by the federal government, do not.

""It is extremely important consumers have this rating information, otherwise people are just going to pick the lowest price plan when in fact a more expensive one may serve them better,"" said McCaughey.

Some states -- like Colorado, Minnesota and Oregon -- do post ratings. The Oregon website lists the quality score right next to price, allowing for an apples-to-apples comparison. Maisel said it is a model other states should strive for.

""Value is a combination of price versus quality,"" he said. ""It's like an equation, like a teeter totter. So put it out there! Price is out, so put the quality rating out there and let the consumer decide who they want to buy based on value.""

Under the law, the health care exchanges have until 2016 to display quality-of-care data."

Administration officials approached the contractors last week to see if they could perform the necessary repairs and reboot the system by Nov. 1. However, that goal struck many contractors as unrealistic, at least for major components of the system. Some specialists working on the project said the online system required such extensive repairs that it might not operate smoothly until after the Dec. 15 deadline for people to sign up for coverage starting in January, although that view is not universally shared.

In interviews, experts said the technological problems of the site went far beyond the roadblocks to creating accounts that continue to prevent legions of users from even registering. Indeed, several said, the login problems, though vexing to consumers, may be the easiest to solve. One specialist said that as many as five million lines of software code may need to be rewritten before the Web site runs properly.

“The account creation and registration problems are masking the problems that will happen later,” said one person involved in the repair effort."

Although the president insists that everything is “working the way it’s supposed to,” a former HHS official has already warned that we will see a “redefinition of what ‘start’ means.”

That’s not the only thing being redefined.

The health care law was sold on three core promises: costs would go down, Americans could keep coverage they had and liked, and jobs would be created.

Instead, premiums are skyrocketing by as much as 400 percent, individuals are losing the health care coverage they currently have, and full-time jobs are being lost.

More On This...

[pullquote]

Employers across the country have been forced to refrain from hiring and are revisiting their coverage options in order to comply with the law’s costs – household names like the University of Virginia, Wegmans, Trader Joe’s, SeaWorld, UPS, Delta, Walgreens, and the Cleveland Clinic, to name a few.

Warnings about how this law will cause a ‘part-timing of America’ are coming from some of the president’s staunchest allies, such as labor unions and his hometown newspaper.

After falling behind schedule while spending over budget, the administration embarked on a frantic race to October 1.

It’s not surprising, then, that the security and functionality of the law’s many programs and data hub are in question.

It does not instill confidence that the administration was scheduled to certify the security of the health IT systems just hours before millions of Americans are expected to upload their personal information.

The administration was also months behind in doling out grants to Navigator groups for outreach and enrollment assistance, resulting in a reduction in training time by more than half and creating additional privacy concerns.

It was months behind in testing the calculator used to determine pricing online, raising questions about its accuracy. The administration even delayed the verification process entirely, choosing instead to rely on an ‘honor system’ in order to distribute taxpayer subsidies to applicants.

The vulnerabilities are startling, and one estimate says the potential for fraud could cost taxpayers $250 billion.

At the time of the final debate, then-Speaker Pelosi famously warned that we would “have to pass the law to find out what is in it.” The law was constructed behind closed doors, based on special interest deals, out of sight from the American people.

Implementation has been no different. The administration has used every opportunity to bury the law’s failures and act unilaterally to amend it along the way.

It has given waivers and delays to politically favored friends but left the rest of America to bear the full weight of the law. To quell the public’s growing discontent, the president is now mocking efforts to protect families from this looming train wreck as “crazy.”

Whether it’s ready or not, the president’s health care law will enter a new phase of implementation this week.

The American people face costly and onerous mandates, small businesses struggle to keep up with rising costs, doctors frustrated with the challenges of a government-run health care system, and the security of Americans’ health and financial information is unknown.

Add October 1 to the list of dates on which the Obama administration pretends a unworkable health care scheme is precisely what the American people were promised; an admission not yet made, but inevitable nonetheless."

Will the November surge will be able to make up for the October purge, i.e. the millions who were dropped from existing plans because of Obamacare’s new minimum standards for coverage? In California, there is reason to think it may not.

In a piece posted at Wonkblog Friday, author Sarah Kliff introduced the term “November surge” into the discussion of enrollment figures. According to Kliff, the uptick in enrollment, especially in California, is reason for optimism:

Some state-based marketplaces had a pretty smooth launch, and are seeing the pace of enrollment speed up daily. California has lead [led] the bunch; the state’s enrollments have grownsteadily in November and now account for nearly a full third of allhealth law sign-ups. The state has had its strongest two weeks ofenrollment this month.

The enrollment surge in California, and the idea that it was part of a broader pattern, was first reported by LA Times health writer Noam Levey a week ago. Levey’s piece was widely quoted, including by Sarah Kliff, but his claims did not stand up to much scrutiny. For instance, Levey claimed that Kentucky was “outpacing” its enrollment estimates. A spokesperson for the state says no such estimates exist.

Both Levey and Kliff fail to ask the most important question. How soon will current enrollment trends balance out the number of people who have been dropped from their insurance as a result of Obamacare grandfathering regulations? In other words, can a November surge make up for the October purge?

Health insurance expert Bob Laszewski suggests California has a long way to go before the net enrollment shows a gain. He lays out the figures in a post published Monday:

California has 5.3 million uninsured eligible to buy in the exchange with half estimated to be subsidy eligible.

California is cancelling another 1.1 million people of which Covered California has estimated 510,000 qualify for a subsidy they can only get if they go to Covered California. At least 80% need to act by December 23 to avoid losing their coverage.

The state is spending $250 million in federal money to get people signed up–dramatically more than any other state.

The Covered California goal is to sign-up 500,000 to 700,000 subsidy eligible people by March 31.

Laszewski concludes “Looking at these numbers, if they don’t have well more than 500,000people signed up by December 31, I would have to think the number ofuninsured in California would have grown.”

Any fair accounting of the enrollment figures needs to keep in mind the number of people who–contrary to the President’s oft-repeated promise–have been kicked off plans they had. In California the enrollment figures for November have improved but they are still a long way from bringing the state back to where it was before the cancellation notices went out."

(CNN) —

The Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Thursday that human genes cannot be patented.

But in something of a compromise, all nine justices said while the naturally occurring isolated biological material itself is not patentable, a synthetic version of the gene material may be patented.

Legal and medical experts believe the decision will have a lasting impact on genetic testing, likely making varieties more widely available and more affordable.

The overriding legal question addressed was whether “products of nature” can be treated the same as “human-made” inventions, allowing them to be held as the exclusive intellectual property of individuals and companies.

The broader issue involved 21st century conflicts over cutting-edge medical science, the power of business and individual legal rights, and how their convergence might influcence decisionmaking over how people and medicine manage the prospect and reality of certain diseases, like cancer.

The issue has deeply divided the scientific and business communities. But it was a blockbuster celebrity, actress Angelina Jolie who brought it to the public in announcing last month that she underwent a double mastectomy following a genetic test.

The Supreme Court case involves Myriad Genetics, a Utah-based company that was sued over its claim of patents relating to two types of biological material that it identified – BRCA1 and BRCA2, whose mutations are linked to increased hereditary risk for breast and ovarian cancer.

Since Myriad owns the patent on breast cancer genes, it was the only company that could perform tests for potential abnormalities.

It says 1 million patients have benefited from its “BRAC Analysis” technology, and that about 250,000 such tests are performed yearly.

An initial test catches most problems, but the company also offers a second called BART to detect the rest, a diagnostic that can cost several thousand dollars.

Jolie had Myriad’s breast cancer test.

Plaintiffs and testing

Among those challenging the Myriad patents were sisters Eileen Kelly and Kathleen Maxian. Kelly was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40.

The initial BRCA test proved negative, meaning her family members were not likely at risk. But Maxian later developed ovarian cancer. The second BART testing proved positive, meaning the siblings carried the cancer-causing mutation all along.

Money was not an issue for them, but Kelly and Maxian, along with a coalition of physician groups and genetic counselors say Myriad has not made the BART tests widely available for patients without a strong family history of these kinds of cancers.

Breast cancer survivor Lisbeth Ceriani was another plaintiff. She faced having to pay thousands for Myriad’s test to see if she had a mutation for ovarian cancer. Because of cost, she waited 18 months before she could afford it, learning she carried a mutation, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented plaintiffs.

All sides agree the science of isolating the building blocks of life is no easy task. Myriad has said it has spent several years and hundreds of millions of dollars in its research. But the issue of patenting has divided the scientific and business communities.

A history of patent protection

In the past 31 years, 20 percent of the human genome has been protected under U.S. patents.

On one side of the Myriad case, scientists and companies argued patents encourage medical innovation and investment that saves lives.

On the other, patient rights groups and civil libertarians countered the patent holders were “holding hostage” the diagnostic care and access of information available to high-risk patients.

Outside the court during oral arguments in April, several protesters held signs, such as “Your corporate greed is killing my friends” and “My genes are not property.”

The patent system was created more than two centuries ago with a dual purpose. One is to offer temporary financial incentives for those at the ground floor of innovative products like the combustible engine and the X-ray machine.

The second is to ensure one company does not hold a lifetime monopoly that might discourage competition and consumer affordability.

All patent submissions rely on a complex reading of applicable laws, distinguishing between abstract ideas and principles, and more tangible scientific discoveries and principles.

The Supreme Court ruling

The Supreme Court has long allowed patent protection for the creation of a new process or use for natural products. Whether “isolating” or “extracting” genes themselves qualifies for such protection became the central argument.

The justices took the position offered by the Obama administration – DNA itself is not patentable but so-called “cDNA” can be.

Complementary DNA is artificially synthesized from the genetic template, and engineered to produce gene clones.

Use of this protein-isolating procedure, known as “tagging,” is especially important in mapping and cataloguing the vast human genome.

“Genes and the information they encode are not patent-eligible under [federal law] simply because they have been isolated from the surrounding genetic material,” said Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the 9-0 court opinion.

“Myriad did not create anything,” said Thomas. “To be sure, it found an important and useful gene, but separating that gene from its surrounding genetic material is not an act of invention.”

But Thomas said, “cDNA does not present the same obstacles to patentability as naturally occurring, isolated DNA segments.”

Reaction to the decision

The American Civil Liberties Union said the decision represents a major shift in patent law and overturns established policy.

“Today, the court struck down a major barrier to patient care and medical innovation,” said Sandra Park, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Women’s Rights Project. “Myriad did not invent the BRCA genes and should not control them. Because of this ruling, patients will have greater access to genetic testing and scientists can engage in research on these genes without fear of being sued.”

Dr. Harry Ostrer, a professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and director of genetic and genomic testing at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, said the decision will not undermine the genetically engineered drug industry and expects the costs of tests to fall.

“I’m thrilled. We can offer BRCA 1 and 2 testing to low-income women without concerns about how it will be paid for,” he said.

Jolie also hoped for a meaningful impact.

“I hope that this ruling will lead to more women at risk of breast cancer being able to get access to gene testing and to take control of their lives, not just in the U.S. but around the world – whatever their means and whatever their background,” she said.

Peter D. Meldrum, president and chief executive officer of Myriad, said in a statement the company believed the court “appropriately upheld our claims on cDNA”

The ruling, he added “underscored the patent eligibility of our method claims, ensuring strong intellectual property protection for our BRACAnalysis test moving forward.”

Investors in Myriad were pleased with the ruling with the stock soaring as much as 9% before settling back but still higher.

The case is Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (12-398).

But when Kaiser Permanente — which insures 45,000 public workers here — proposed another hike for 2014, San Francisco’s Health Service System teamed up with labor unions to say “no more.”

In a rare show of unity, they are demanding that Kaiser craft an alternative proposal, one that caps profits, links rates to the use of services and provides for more transparency. That means explaining whether rising costs are a result of potentially avoidable complications, such as hospital infections, and breaking down just what the city is paying for in a ballooning category known as “other medical services/integrated care management.”

The showdown introduces local political muscle into the national push, under the Affordable Care Act, to make the industry more responsive to consumers.

“It’s a huge … opportunity,” said Sally Covington of the Oakland-based Community Campaigns for Quality Care, a nonprofit that has guided unions nationwide to press health plans for accountability and is working with the San Francisco labor coalition.

“What we’re seeing unfold here … is very unusual,” she said. “We do not know of any other instance where these kinds of forces have been realigned in this manner.”

Final contracts must be approved by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, which is watching the negotiations closely. So is Mayor Ed Lee, who a spokeswoman said was confident that the parties would “work toward a proposal that will serve our employees and protect the fiscal health of the city.”

In a statement, a Kaiser Permanente spokeswoman said the 2014 proposal was “fair and competitive,” adding that the organization would continue to meet with city representatives “to explain our renewal pricing and cost structure.”

For years, city administrators and labor leaders bristled at the rate hikes. Then they joined forces.

“If you are going to get people healthier, it has to translate into a reduction in cost for employers, employees and taxpayers,” said Rebecca Rhine, executive director of the Municipal Executives Assn. and part of a coalition of labor groups pushing for change. “We began talking about how they all fit together.”

When health service system Deputy Director Lisa Ghotbi analyzed the data, she found that overall, Kaiser’s San Francisco members have been using fewer services because of the enrollment of families with young children, who tend to have fewer health problems.

Yet while their use of hospital, doctor and prescription services has trended down by as much as 16% since 2011, plan costs had risen by 11%. (Kaiser proposed a 5.5% rate hike for next year.)

Advertisement

And although hospitalizations had dropped by more than a third over the last seven years, Ghotbi said, charges in that category had risen by nearly 90%.

City workers’ families have been cared for by Kaiser for 64 years, “and we certainly value the quality of care,” she said. “This has nothing to do with that. It really has to do with pricing practices.... We have concern that there is a lot of profit being made off the public employers.”

Ghotbi’s department previously structured its contract with Blue Shield, which covers 40,000 city workers, to include “accountable care organizations” of partnered medical groups and hospitals. She said the result has been improved quality of care — and no rate increases for the last two years. The company also pledged to cap its profits at 2%.

At a health system board meeting earlier this month, Ghotbi asked Kaiser for a 4% cap. Between 2010 and 2012, she said, Kaiser took in $87 million more from members here than it cost to serve them, a 15% profit that outpaces its overall margin of 5%.

Wendy Sack, vice president of underwriting for Kaiser, responded that its pricing structure was “put together to compete in the marketplace” and was not directly tied to utilization of services. Hospital patients are sicker overall, she said, and more surgeries are performed on an outpatient basis.

Commissioners called her answers “confusing” and directed Kaiser officials to return for further discussion at a board meeting Thursday.

“You have to come forward with much better explanations for those fees,” health service Commissioner Jean Fraser told Sack. “You’re losing a PR battle.”

In response to an inquiry from The Times, a Kaiser spokeswoman later said that the organization stands apart from competitors because it is fully integrated — with its own hospitals, medical groups and so on. That means “other medical services” and “integrated care management” — which account for 29% of the company’s proposed 2014 premium proposal — include services that other healthcare plans either don’t provide or bill for separately. Examples include injections given during medical visits, secure email communication with doctors, health education classes and disease management.

“It is absolutely untrue to suggest that these categories are used for any purpose other than to classify and account for tangible services delivered to members,” Gerri Ginsburg, director of communications, said in a statement

Ginsburg also noted that as a not-for-profit organization, Kaiser’s “margin” is needed for “investments in new hospitals, medical offices, equipment and technology.”

Brent Fulton, a healthcare market expert at UC Berkeley, said the public pressure on Kaiser was an interesting development, but that the company — which long has underpriced competitors — probably had the negotiating advantage.

“It’s like going to Wal-Mart and saying, ‘You’re making too much profit,’ ” he said. “Wal-Mart will say, ‘OK, so go shop someplace else.’ ”

Still, as a “large employer, with so many customers,” San Francisco is well-positioned to press for change, said Supervisor Mark Farrell, who also is a health system commissioner.

“You’re starting to see it at the federal level, you’re starting to see it at the state level, and I’m certainly going to push for it at the Board of Supervisors here at the city,” he said.

The deal is meant to mollify millions of people enraged after their insurers canceled policies that do not meet Obamacare requirements. But how many it will ultimately help remains to be seen.

The uproar over the cancellations has ensnared the White House for weeks, shining a spotlight on Obama's previous promise that people who liked their insurance plans can keep them.

""This fix won't solve every problem for every person. But it's going to help a lot of people,"" the president said at the White House.

But the fix, as reported earlier by CNN's Dana Bash, puts the onus of the renewals outside the president's control: The administration is not requiring insurers or state insurance commissioners to extend the existing plans, but instead is letting them offer an additional year of coverage.

Also, insurers must notify policyholders of the difference in benefits between their policies and the Obamacare plans available on the insurance exchanges. And the companies must inform people that additional policies are available on the exchanges and that subsidies may be available to those who qualify.

Share your story: Are you signing up for Obamacare?

Not everyone who has received a cancellation notice, however, may be able to extend.

Since insurance is regulated at the state level, it remains up to the commissioners to permit the extensions and the companies to do so. The president noted that not all commissioners may agree to extensions. At least four states -- California, Idaho, Virginia and Kentucky -- are requiring all individual plans adhere to Obamacare rules.

The insurance industry said the reversal could cause major problems, including a hike in premiums if fewer younger and healthier people opt to buy in the exchanges.

""Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,"" said Karen Ignagni, chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group. "" Additional steps must be taken to stabilize the marketplace and mitigate the adverse impact on consumers.""

In his remarks, Obama said he didn't want his signature policy to be the reason people are losing their insurance.

""The key point is that it allows us to be able to say to the folks who receive these notices, look, you know, I, the president of the United States, and the insurance -- the insurance model of the Affordable Care Act -- is not going to be getting in the way of you shopping in the individual market that you used to have,"" he said.

But he also stressed that the reason for health reform is that the current system did not work well, and that Americans will be able to find better quality insurance on the exchanges.

""It's important that we don't pretend that somehow that's a place worth going back to,"" he said, of the existing individual market. ""Too often, it works fine, as long as you stay healthy. It doesn't work well when you're sick.""

Also, in announcing the changes Thursday, Obama apologized for the rough start to enrollment in the federal and state exchanges. The websites have been marred by major technological problems that have stymied many visitors from registering accounts, determining whether they are eligible for subsidies and picking insurance plans. Only 106,185 people signed up for insurance in the first month, with fewer than 27,000 of them going through the federal healthcare.gov site, which is handling enrollment for 36 states.

""We fumbled the roll out on this health care law,"" he said.

Only 106,185 people signed up for insurance in the first month, with fewer than 27,000 of them going through the federal healthcare.gov site, which is handling enrollment for 36 states. And the site is still far from fully operational, leaving tech experts racing to get it working by month's end, as the administration promised.

Obama said the website healthcare.gov will see ""marked and noticeable"" improvement.

Americans have until March 31 for sign up for a plan, but people must select and pay for a plan by Dec. 15 for coverage to start Jan. 1.

USA TODAY

New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner says he coined the term ""Obamacare.""

When he was in Congress, the Democrat was a frequent guest on cable-TV shows during the height of the 2009 debate over health care. Near the bottom of a New York Timesarticle about Weiner's legislative record, the story of how he went from being a supporter of a single-payer system to a backer of the law advocated by President Obama is told.

Obamacare is ""a term, by the way, that I coined,"" Weiner told The New York Times.

Here's what we know:

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is the law's formal name, and Obama signed it into law in 2010. It is now widely known as Obamacare, a word that has been used pejoratively by Republicans — but one that Obama himself started embracing during last year's presidential campaign.

Stories by The Washington Post and other media outlets often note Republicans began wide usage of Obamacare during the 2009-10 debate in Congress over the national health care law. The term would often be used in the same breath as ""Hillarycare,"" a reference to the proposals advanced in the 1990s by then-first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.

GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney used the same juxtaposition as early as May 2007 during a campaign speech in Iowa. ""Socialized medicine, Hillary-care, Obama-care, they don't get it,"" Romney said at the time, according to NBC News.

The first known use of Obamacare in print came three years before the legislation passed Congress. A 2011 story in The Atlantic says Jeanne Schulte Scott used the term in March 2007 in an article for the trade journal, Healthcare Financial Management, noting how health care was becoming a key issue in the 2008 presidential campaign.

""We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' to go along with 'McCain-care,' 'Edwards-care' and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s,"" Scott wrote."

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Speaker John Boehner

According to the CBO, 1.7 million people would be forced off the rolls in the coming year if the state waivers are repealed as proposed by Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). Another 2.1 million would be dropped in 2014 as a result of the tighter eligibility rules backed by the GOP. In both cases, the impact would decline as the economy improves and more jobs become available. But on average, CBO estimates that a total of 2.8 million people would lose their benefits over the next decade, and another 850,000 households will see an average reduction of about $90 a month in benefits.

Yes, the Republican proposal for $40 billion in food stamp cuts over the next 10 years would have horrific effects on millions of people , the dirty hippies over at the Congressional Budget Office confirm:That's 1.7 million people going hungry or being forced onto severely restricted diets, with millions more to come. A $90 cut in the groceries a family can buy in a month is also a Big F'ing Deal, especially for a family that's already pinching every penny to get enough to eat. Taking $90 out of a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program allotment that already only lasts most families two and a half weeks is in itself cruel—and, from the most coldly financial perspective, shortsighted, since forcing people to eat more cheaply means increased risk of diabetes and other chronic conditions that will raise health care costs for the nation.

But this is what Eric Cantor and the starvation caucus of his party want. And even if they can't actually get $40 billion in cuts through the Senate or signed by the president, the farm bill—which nutrition assistance is usually part of and which House Speaker John Boehner isn't sending to conference with the Senate until these cuts get a vote—sure makes a nice hostage to take in the effort to force deeper cuts than either the Senate or the president would want to make.

Please send an email to your member of the House of Representatives, telling him or her to oppose all cuts to food stamps."

Bilmes', 'William M. Daley', 'November']","With HealthCare.gov, the government’s bad management skills are showing again","Linda J. Bilmes, a professor of public policy at Harvard University, was chief financial officer at the Commerce Department from from 1999 to 2001. William M. Daley served as commerce secretary for President Bill Clinton from 1997 to 2000 and White House chief of staff to President Obama from 2011 to 2012.

The plight of the Affordable Care Act Web site has focused attention on a problem that seldom receives it — the absence of good management in the U.S. government. Despite more than three years of lead time and $400 million to $600 million in taxpayer money, the government can’t seem to deliver something that is bread and butter to the average online retailer.

Of course, the task is much more complex with health care, and there are plenty of excuses: poor coordination among technology contractors, shifting goals for the design of HealthCare.gov, the need to coordinate between federal and state governments. But these challenges are hardly unprecedented. Based on our experience in the public and private sectors, we’ve concluded that the core problem is that the federal government lacks many of the basic skills private firms rely on.

Over the past three decades, fierce global competition has forced corporate America to modernize how it manages projects so that they can be delivered as efficiently as possible. The federal government, insulated from market pressures, has fallen badly behind. In government, managerial jobs — such as chief financial officers, technology officers and procurement executives — are considered the least glamorous, a poor second to policymaking and politics.

Civil servants who manage government programs are judged by their ability to expand their departments, in terms of the number of employees and the size of their budgets. Most people who work in government are committed to their mission, so they naturally want their programs to grow bigger and do more. There is seldom much personal benefit, in pay or promotion, for a manager who delivers services at the same quality for lower cost. There are few thank-yous for simplifying Web sites or delivering faster, better service. Managers are actually penalized for being more efficient: If an agency saves money, its budget will most likely be reduced the following year.

And the media pounces on mistakes, but when the government accomplishes something skillfully — such as the smooth launch of the new GI Bill Web site, which provides education benefits to nearly 1 million veterans — few reporters take notice.

The malfunctioning HealthCare.gov is simply the latest in a long series of problems for large, complex government technology projects. The price tag of the Coast Guard’s project to modernize its fleet ballooned from $17 billion to $29 billion because of cost overruns, oversight failures and massive contracting flaws. The Homeland Security Department’s multibillion-dollar initiative to develop an electronic “virtual” fence along the border with Mexico has been halted after software and contractor problems. A four-year effort to integrate service-member files between the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Defense Department has been plagued by delays and dysfunction. And the IRS’s decades-long effort to improve electronic filing of tax returns and issue refunds faster is several years behind schedule and vastly over budget.

Altogether, these failures cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. In the end, the problems usually turn out to be not technical but related to procurement, incentive structures, the way objectives are defined, and the management of schedules and costs. Most congressional “oversight” focuses on pinning political blame rather than improving how programs are executed.

More perniciously, repeated failure reinforces a belief — widely promoted by the right wing of the Republican Party — that government cannot do anything right. If we lose faith in the idea that our nation can collectively accomplish great things, talented young people who could be interested in government will take their technical or administrative skills to the private sector, where they will be better appreciated and better paid.

There are three steps the government should take to restore Americans’ confidence in its ability to get things done. First, we need more and better incentives for workers. President Obama has said he wants to make working in government “cool again.” For that to happen, the hot opportunities must be in the managerial ranks, not just in policy positions. We need to train our civil servants how to be managers. And managers and their programs should benefit directly from improvements in efficiency. “Gainsharing,” or letting a department keep a portion of any savings to spend the next fiscal year, is one technique; another is to mimic some U.S. cities that have introduced individual and team bonuses for successful reforms. Managers also need greater flexibility to reallocate resources.

Second, the federal bureaucracy should consolidate programs with similar missions. The Government Accountability Office has provided a blueprint of hundreds of programs that should be considered. For example, there are dozens of programs serving veterans that, in many cases, duplicate efforts and make it harder for states to help men and women who have served.

In a related step, government programs should make performance targets more meaningful. We should understand which of the programs that we fund year in and year out actually work, prune the poor performers and be willing to experiment with new approaches. Right now, objective evaluation succumbs to finger-pointing among different agencies.

Third, the federal government needs to align its systems and processes to work better with state and local governments, which disperse more than a quarter of all federal money. The lack of coordination with state governments has been a particular problem in the launch of the federal health insurance exchange. The success of the ACA will vary considerably from state to state, and states with the fewest insured residents — Texas, for example — are likely to lag behind in providing care for their populations.

More broadly, state governments, most of which must by law balance their budgets every year by July 1, are at the constant mercy of federal budgeting — which, inexplicably, is supposed to be set by Oct. 1. In recent years, budgeting has been especially uncertain as Congress lurched from crisis to crisis, passing only temporary funding measures.

Poor management is undermining public trust in our government. It makes it hard for departments to run programs effectively and for citizens to have faith in our leaders. Starting with Congress, our elected officials need to change the attitude in Washington to one that values and rewards efficient government.

In effect, the administration gave itself a passing grade. Because of hundreds of software fixes and hardware upgrades in the past month, it said, the website — the main channel for people seeking to buy insurance under President Obama’s health care law — is now working more than 90 percent of the time, up from 40 percent during some weeks in October.

Jeffrey D. Zients, the Obama adviser leading the website repair effort, said consumers were having a much better experience now than in early October. Pages on the website load faster — in less than a second — compared with an average of eight seconds in late October, Mr. Zients said. “The site is now stable and operating at its intended capacity, with greatly improved performance,” he said.

In a “progress and performance report,” the administration summarized five weeks of frantic activity to repair the website and undo damage to Mr. Obama’s political standing."

Follow Her On Twitter']",Team Obama's scary message for ObamaCare's critics,"Are you afraid of the Obama White House? If you challenge the president’s beloved health care plan, maybe you should be. Consider the fate of William White, the Washington, D.C. Insurance Commissioner, who voiced skepticism about President Obama’s hastily assembled “fix” for the millions losing their insurance policies.

A day after suggesting that the new demands on insurers could destabilize the marketplace and lead to even higher premiums, White was canned.

Telling the truth about ObamaCare is risky.

Remember the manhandling of Congressional Budget Office head Douglas Elmendorf? When the supposedly neutral bean counters undertook the first analysis of ObamaCare ’s fiscal impact, their preliminary findings threatened to undermine the happy talk flowing from the White House. Elmendorf was summoned to a parlay with the president, who doubtless explained how the budget gurus might amend their analysis, as a patriotic duty.

[pullquote]

Not long after, budget chief Peter Orszag issued a further warning to the CBO, saying it should guard against “exaggerating costs and underestimating savings.”

Any surprise that the cost estimates from the CBO have made generous assumption -- underestimating the number of Americans to receive subsidies and who will be added to Medicaid roles? I will guarantee that as this bill takes hold, costs will exceed those projected by the CBO.

Pity the poor insurance companies (if you can.) Hauled into the White House only after the president decided to live up to his promise that Americans could keep their existing insurance, they were effectively thrown under the ObamaCare bus.

Now it’s their problem that millions have lost policies that did not comply with ACA mandates; they will either figure out a way to undo the work of the past three years in just a few weeks or will be battered – ”bad apples indeed!” -- by a defensive White House. Photos of that gathering reveal the president lecturing on the benefits of the temporary do-over, while industry executives glumly take their medicine.

They have seen how this White House functions. Early in ObamaCare ’s sorrowful struggle, insurers like Anthem Blue Cross in California dared whisper the truth – that they were forced to raise rates because of the ACA mandates. The company found itself targeted by the president on a “60 Minutes” segment, and then required to justify its rate-setting by HHS head Kathleen Sibelius, who also demanded the firm explain where the increased revenues would be spent – an unheard-of intrusion.

Sibelius also went after America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), a national trade association, demanding that they stop “using scare tactics and misinformation to falsely blame premium increases for 2011” on the ACA. She also threatened “there will be zero tolerance for this type of misinformation…”

Insurers must be scared to death. They’ve seen what can happen when a collaborator – like one-time golden boy Jamie Dimon – turns foe. The president once called JP Morgan CEO Dimon “one of the country’s smartest bankers” – but that was before the former Obama supporter went public in his disdain for what he called the White House’s “constant attack on business.”

Hitting back at Obama’s “fat cat” anti-bank rhetoric, Dimon dismissed as “ridiculous” the government’s investigation into oil price speculators, and charged that the inquiries into the bank’s “London Whale” trade were a “tempest in a teapot.” He should have known better.

Now the bank – one of the few that didn’t need TARP but was required to take it -- is the subject of numerous wide-ranging investigations and has been hit with unprecedented fines and demands for admission of wrong-doing. Lost in the witch-hunt has been the reality that the government’s charges of mortgage misbehavior mainly stem from the activities of Washington Mutual, the largest bank ever to fail in the U.S.

In 2008 Morgan was pressed by regulators to buy the failed thrift, which otherwise could have brought down the country’s bank insurance program at an especially fragile moment. Dimon’s willingness to act earned unusual praise at the time from FDIC head Sheila Bair, who said “Some are coming to Washington for help, others are coming to help.” That was then – before he started sounding off about President Obama’s policies. Bank analyst Dick Bove may have been right when he wrote, “the United States government has made it a priority to break this company.”

You don’t have to be a large corporation – or be located in Washington – to be scared of the Obama administration. The tone set by the White House has percolated down, spreading fear throughout the country. The IRS targeting of conservatives came out of Cincinnati, though it appears to have received the blessing of the White House. Any place where the Obama liberal pro-union agenda meets opposition – such as in Wisconsin – is fair game.

The Wall Street Journal reported recently on a special prosecutor’s assault – including subpoenas and dawn home raids -- on conservative organizations that opposed the recall campaign against labor nemesis Governor Scott Walker in Wisconsin. This frightening account – sounding more like what takes place in Beijing than in Madison - should send a chill through every American.

But - the White House is especially quick to chase down those critical of the president’s signature healthcare bill. Even Edie Sundby, the stage-four cancer patient who dared to recount in an op-ed how she lost her insurance, courtesy of the ACA, came under attack. Instead of the stage props usually positioned behind the president as he invokes the wonders of ObamaCare , here was a real person with a real ailment whose prospects were seriously threatened by the new insurance mandates.

No less a personage than White House advisor Dan Pfeiffer tweeted out a rebuttal to Ms. Sundby’s narrative, referencing a piece that blamed United Healthcare instead of the ACA. As it happens, Ms. Sundby’s take is the correct one; but for ObamaCare , her insurance would be intact.

Pretty small beans to attract the attention of the White House. But, when your signature law is a colossal failure, doesn’t make economic sense and threatens your much ballyhooed “legacy,” silencing the critics becomes a full-time job."

One expects to pay more. One expects to pay less. And one is just trying to figure it all out.

Each, in a different way, represents the relatively small part of America that the Obama administration did not talk about while campaigning for the Affordable Care Act: people who have health insurance that they like, but who will be unable to keep it under the law.

Now that new insurance marketplaces are opening, insurance companies are canceling millions of individual plans that fail to meet minimum standards. The dropped plans have become the political talking point of the moment — and, according to many Republicans, a symbol of the president’s flawed ambitions.

Mr. Obama says that people will be better off in the long run with more robust coverage.

Yet the individual stories add up to a more complicated tale."

The contractors faced tough questioning from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, who voiced frustration with the weeks-long problems surrounding the federal hub. Lawmakers cast doubt on attempts by contractors, who were paid millions, to claim they were not responsible for many of the site's problems. Top contractor CGI Federal revealed it was paid $290 million in taxpayer funds.

But CGI Federal and other contractors repeatedly claimed that overall ""end-to-end"" testing was the responsibility of an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, as was the decision to go live on Oct. 1.

They suggested more time was needed to work out the -- major -- kinks.

Representing contractor QSSI, Andrew Slavitt told the committee that ideally, end-to-end testing should have occurred well before the launch, with enough time to correct flaws.

More On This...

""Months would be nice,"" said Slavitt.

""We would have loved to have months,"" concurred CGI vice president Cheryl Campbell, though she earlier claimed no amount of testing could have flagged all the problems.

Questioned whether there were concerns the site was not ready to go live, she also said: ""It was not our position to tell our client whether they should go live or not go live.""

Slavitt said his firm did share concerns with the agency, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, adding they were responsible for addressing them.

""We identified errors in code that was provided to us by others,"" he said. ""In this function we reported back the results to CMS and the relevant contractor, who in turn was responsible for fixing coding errors or making any necessary changes.""

He also blamed in part a ""late decision"" to require customers to register before browsing for insurance, which could have helped overwhelm the registration system.

""This may have driven higher simultaneous usage of the registration system that wouldn't have otherwise occurred if consumers could window-shop anonymously,"" he said.

CMS officials, in a conference call later in the day, acknowledged that there should have been more testing, but said there wasn't due to the ""compressed"" timeframe. They also claimed responsibility for the decision to make people fully log on before browsing for insurance.

The hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee was the first of what is likely to be many on the failures of the main ObamaCare website. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who skipped Thursday's hearing for an event in Phoenix, is expected to testify next Wednesday.

While Sebelius will face tough questioning, lawmakers on Thursday also took issue with much of the contractors' testimony, as they assigned blame to CMS and each other.

Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., questioned their claims that ""unexpected volumes"" of traffic caused much of the trouble.

""I think it's really kind of a lame excuse,"" she said. ""Amazon and eBay don't crash the week before Christmas and ProFlowers doesn't crash on Valentine's Day.""

The witnesses at times downplayed the problems with the site itself, prompting jeers from lawmakers.

""The system is working. People are enrolling,"" Campbell testified, acknowledging the system is still too slow.

Noting that the administration is urging people to use paper applications, Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said: ""That is a system that has failed.""

Campbell -- who said she still thinks everything will be fixed in time for the Jan. 1 hard launch -- and others acknowledged the system needs to be improved. But all four contractor representatives tried to spread the blame around for the problems to date. Representatives from Equifax Workforce Solutions and Serco also spoke.

Campbell said QSSI's tool that allowed consumers to create secure accounts created a ""bottleneck"" in the system.

Slavitt later said QSSI takes ""accountability"" for the problems with that function.

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle took aim Thursday at the contractors, even as they implicated administration officials. Lawmakers were indignant as they complained that officials looked them in the eye before Oct. 1 and told them the launch of HealthCare.gov was on track.

""Either these officials were shockingly unaware of what was happening ... or deliberately misleading our committee and the public,"" Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., said.

""They said there was nothing wrong, and they expressed nothing but optimism,"" Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., said.

Republicans, still committed to repealing Obama's health care law, approached the questioning with a prosecutorial tone, leading New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone to call the whole exercise a ""monkey court.""

An official with the Department of Health and Human Services plans to brief House Republicans on the site on Oct. 30.

Under a wrinkle that dates back to enactment of the law, members of Congress and thousands of their aides are required to get their coverage through new state-based markets known as insurance exchanges.

But the law does not provide any obvious way for the federal government to continue paying its share of the premiums for the comprehensive coverage.

If the government cannot do so, it could mean an additional expense of $5,000 a year for individuals and $11,000 for families under some of the most popular plans."

But this logic simply pushes beyond credibility. As the president said Monday: “Let me remind everybody that the Affordable Care Act is not just a Web site.” The Web site is only a part of the whole.

But to many Republicans who are stuck fighting a battle that’s already been lost rather than moving on to the next challenge, this Web site problem offers a sliver of hope that they can turn people off from the law. So far, it isn’t working. According to a Gallup poll released Wednesday, there has been an uptick in support for the law since the Web site opened.

Sometimes you simply have to accept reality, and sometimes that reality is accepting defeat. Learn from it. Grow from it. But first you must admit it. That’s the modern Republican Party’s problem — blindness to the obvious.

The Republican Party’s conduct during this period in the country’s history will get the same sober, thorough judgment from history as the health care law, and that judgment is not likely to be kind.

History will record that this is the moment that the party camped out in its own graveyard, hastening the demise of its national viability; that it gave up on America, while constantly reminiscing about America as it once was; that its thought leaders were replaced by crusade leaders and the Grand Old Party saw its grandeur subside; that it came to realize that it couldn’t forever be the party of intransigence in a nation of progress, without being burned by the friction inherent in those two warring concepts.

This is the moment when the rest of America realized that opposition isn’t an idea, and preventing things from getting done is not the same as getting things done."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-mocks-gop-crazy-obamacare-predictions-164348603--finance.html,,[],Obama mocks GOP for 'crazy' Obamacare predictions,"LARGO, Maryland (AP) — With just five days to go before Americans can begin signing up for health care under his signature law, President Barack Obama on Thursday ridiculed Republican opponents for ""crazy"" doomsday predictions of the impact and forecast that even those who didn't vote for him are going to enroll.

With polls showing many Americans still skeptical of the law known as ""Obamacare,"" the president went back to the basics of explaining how nearly 50 million uninsured Americans will be able to buy coverage in new government-run exchanges while mocking Republicans for trying to block its implementation. ""The closer we get, the more desperate they get,"" Obama argued.

""The Republican party has just spun itself up around this issue,"" Obama said. ""And the fact is the Republicans' biggest fear at this point is not that Affordable Care Act will fail. What they're worried about is it's going to succeed.""

House Republicans are inserting provisions that undermine the health care law into a short-term spending measure needed to avoid a government shutdown on Oct. 1 and into legislation that would increase the government's borrowing ability, which the Treasury says will hit its limit in mid-October.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor Thursday that Obama is trying to sell the law to a skeptical public.

""It must be frustrating for the president that folks seem to keep tuning out all the happy talk anyway,"" McConnell said. ""This law is a mess. It needs to go. It's way past time to start over.""

Obama won loud applause from a friendly audience at Prince George's Community College in the Washington suburbs when he vowed that he wouldn't let Republicans block the law. ""We are going to see it through. The Affordable Care Act is here,"" Obama said.

The six-month enrollment period for the exchanges starts Tuesday, with consumers in most of the country able to comparison shop between plans online. The Obama administration needs millions of Americans — especially young, healthy people — to sign up in order to keep costs low for everyone.

Story continues

The White House said Prince George's County, Md., has a high rate of uninsured, with about 16 percent of residents under 65 without insurance. Obama's audience was full of the young people he is targeting for enrollment.

Obama acknowledged there would be glitches in getting the exchanges up and running, and even as he was speaking administration officials were quietly telling key interest groups to expect initial problems signing up online for coverage. Small businesses will not be able to enroll online starting Oct. 1 when new health insurance markets go live and will have to enroll by paper, and the Spanish-language version of its healthcare.gov website will be not be ready to handle enrollments for a few weeks. An estimated 10 million Latinos are eligible for coverage.

Three-and-a-half years after Obama signed the bill into law, his nearly hourlong speech showed he's still having to educate consumers about what will be available to them and convince them to sign up. He predicted success once people learn they can save money or get insurance for the first time.

""Even if you didn't vote for me, I'll bet you'll sign up for that health care plan,"" Obama said.

Obama said Republicans want ""to shut this thing down before people find out that they like it.""

Obama didn't call out any of his Republican opponents by name, but he laughingly taunted some of their arguments. He mentioned House Speaker John Boehner's prediction right before the bill was signed into law in March 2010 that ""Armageddon"" was impending. He quoted Louisiana Rep. John Fleming, who said earlier this month that ""Obamacare is the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed in Congress."" He cited Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann's appeal to colleagues on the House floor six months ago to ""repeal this failure before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens.""

And he quoted New Hampshire state Rep. Bill O'Brien's declaration in August that Obamacare is ""a law as destructive to personal and individual liberty as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850."" That was met by a chorus of gasps and boos from the largely black audience.

""Think about that. Affordable health care is worse than a law that lets slave owners get their runaway slaves back,"" Obama said. ""I mean, these are quotes. I'm not making this stuff up.

""All this would be funny if it wasn't so crazy,"" Obama said."

If you or a family member has been notified that your individual policy is being canceled at year’s end, you may be stunned and upset.

House Republicans sparred with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius Wednesday over the cancellations, with Sebelius saying the law generally didn’t require insurers to discontinue plans if they were in effect at the time of the law’s enactment in March 2010.

No one knows how many of the estimated 14 million people who buy their own insurance are getting such notices, but the numbers are substantial. Some insurers report discontinuing 20 percent of their individual business, while other insurers have notified up to 80 percent of policyholders that they will have to change plans.

Here is a guide to help you understand the bigger picture, including why your premiums and benefits are likely to change next year and what you should consider as you shop for a new policy.

Q. Why is this happening?

A. The so-called individual market was targeted by the health care law because it didn’t work well for many people who do not get coverage through an employer, particularly those who were older or had health problems. The latter were often rejected for coverage, charged more or had their conditions excluded from coverage. Some policies were so skimpy they provided only the barest of coverage when someone did fall ill.

Starting Jan. 1, insurers can no longer reject people who are sick or charge them more than the healthy under the Affordable Care Act. They must also beef up policies to meet minimum standards and add benefits, such as prescription drug coverage, maternity care and mental health services.

Q. Why am I getting this notice?

A. Most likely your plan didn’t meet all the standards of the federal health law. One type of policy being discontinued by Florida Blue, for example, did not cover hospitalizations or emergency room visits and paid a maximum of $50 toward doctor visits. It’s possible your plan also had deductibles and other potential expenses – such as copayments for doctors and hospital care -- that exceeded the law’s annual out-of-pocket maximum of $6,350 for individuals or $12,700 for families. Insurers may have just decided to end certain types of policies, something they have always had the ability to do. Some policies that fail to meet the law’s standards can still be sold, but only if the insurer decides to continue them and they are “grandfathered,” meaning you purchased one before March 2010 and neither you nor the insurer has made any substantial change since then. Adjusting an annual deductible, which many people do each year to keep down their premiums, is a change that could end grandfathered status.

Q. How are insurers picking policies to discontinue?

A. Some consumers fear they are being targeted because they are unhealthy or otherwise unprofitable for an insurance company. Kansas Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger said insurers can only discontinue entire blocks of business and cannot simply pick and choose certain customers to cancel. Those whose policies are canceled can sign up instead for a new plan and can’t be rejected because of their health. Insurers say they are ending policies that don’t meet the law’s standards or were not grandfathered.

Q. My insurer says if I renew before the end of the year, I can keep my current plan. What does this mean?

A. In some states, insurers are offering selected policyholders a chance to “early renew,” meaning they can continue their existing plan through next year, even if it doesn’t meet all the law’s standards. If you choose this option, your premium may still go up, but the cause would be medical inflation, rather than the need to add benefits because of the health law. Not all states allow early renewals. Fearing insurers would offer such renewals only to their most profitable plans, a handful of states, including Illinois, Missouri and Rhode Island, barred insurers from doing it.

Q. Why are premiums changing?

A. Under the old rules, insurers could decide whether to accept you – and how much to charge -- based on answers to dozens of medical questions. You no longer have to fill out those forms. Starting Jan. 1, insurers can no longer charge women more than men, reject people who are sick or charge them more and can charge older people only three times more than younger ones. They’re also adding new benefits.

As they drew up the rates for 2014, insurance firms had to make educated guesses about how many customers would stay, how many new ones they would attract – and what the health conditions of those new members might be. Actuaries say the new rules on how much insurers may vary rates level the playing field, making premiums more of an average. Older buyers or those who had above-average health problems – and whose former rates reflected those problems – may find their premiums going down. Younger or healthier people, on the other hand, may find premiums going up, sometimes sharply. Under the new rules, consumers “are not paying based on their own health status, but an average health status,” said Robert Cosway, an actuary with consulting firm Milliman. “The positive side is that people in poor health won’t have to pay as much, but the way you get there is that people in better health have to pay more.”

Q. I don’t qualify for a subsidy, and my premium is going way up for what the insurer tells me is a comparable policy. Why is that?

A. Insurers base premiums on a number of factors, including medical inflation and the cost of implementing insurance rules. A report on the California market done by Cosway at Milliman estimated that medical inflation and changes from the health law could add about 30 percent to the average premium in California. The biggest chunk of the increase was attributed to insurers being required to accept everyone, even those who are ill.That requirement polls well with the public. But it makes insurers nervous because they can no longer reject the costliest patients.

Q. I’m healthy. Why do I have to pay for people who are sick?

A. Except for a fortunate few, everyone is likely to develop some kind of health problem or face an accident sometime in their lives. Policy experts and regulators say insurance works best when it spreads risk across a large group of people. Your house may not burn down this year, but you pay for insurance coverage just in case.

Q. I’m a single man, why do I have a plan with maternity coverage?

A. Again, it’s about spreading the risk. Men may not need maternity care, but women don’t need treatment for prostate cancer and those costs are baked into the rates, too. Older men, and women past child-bearing age, are more likely to need treatment for heart disease, artificial hips or other illnesses that younger men and women are less likely to need. “The whole concept of insurance is you can’t just pick and choose the benefits you want,” said Praeger. If people – especially older ones – get premiums based solely on what they might need, she said, “it could cost a whole lot more.”

Q. What if it turns out they’ve charged too much for the new coverage?

A.Under the health law, insurers who fail to spend at least 80 percent of their premium revenue on medical care have to issue rebates to consumers. Those rebates for 2014 policies won’t be seen until 2015, however.

Q. I’ve gotten this notice, what should I do now?

A. Experts say people should scrutinize the terms of their soon-to-be-discontinued policy and compare them with what new policies offer. The monthly premium is just one factor in cost. Also note the deductible. Is it per person? What is the maximum deductible if two or more family members fall ill in the same year? Finally, note the annual out-of-pocket cap, which is the maximum you pay in deductibles and co-payments for medical care during the year.

An independent broker can show you plans from various carriers. You can also check your state’s online marketplace or log onto or call healthcare.gov, the website serving 36 states that opted not to create their own marketplaces. While consumers are having trouble creating accounts through healthcare.gov, the website now allows shoppers to browse health plans without creating an account. When browsing, however, be aware that the premiums are not actual quotes because they do not reflect your exact age. Nor do they show subsidies, although several online calculators—including some on state marketplace websites and another by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation can give you a good idea of how much you might receive toward coverage, based on your income.

The Obama administration may be in hot water over its jammed-up health insurance websites, but the federal government did plan for some trouble, paying for thousands of specially trained guides called navigators to help people negotiate the treacherous waters of health insurance.

But, three weeks into the most important phase of health reform, these experts aren't faring much better than average civilians in getting the sites to work. And it's not just the federal website -- some state-run sites are struggling just as badly.

""Can we just see if it works?"" Amine Ashkar pleads as he tries to sign up for health insurance at the Community Clinic, Inc. in Wheaton Md. on Wednesday afternoon. ""We can try,"" answers Martha Lopez, a former insurance agent who's helping people enroll.

The screen gets stuck as she tries to set up an account for Ashkar, a 32-year-old bus driver who's looking for a better deal on his insurance.

Lopez and her team of fellow navigators employed through the nonprofit clinic have been unable to complete a single enrollment online.

""Why don't we try next week?"" Lopez asks Ashkar. It's not the first time Lopez has sent a client away. The day before she thought she got one couple signed up before the website fizzled. “I told them to call back in 10 to 12 days.""

The main goal of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was to help get health insurance to the estimated 47 million Americans who don’t have it, either by extending Medicaid or by giving them access to commercial, private insurance sold through health insurance marketplaces called exchanges.



Customers must sign up by Dec. 15 in order to get care that begins Jan. 1. But people have until March 31 to enroll for insurance that starts in 2014.

Still, consumers trying to enroll on their own online have been complaining loudly about how difficult it is. But even the pros are having trouble.

""The IT system is so messed up at the moment,"" says Wendy Korrick, who leads the team of in-person navigators working through the clinic's network.

The federal government promised easy, Expedia-style websites where people were supposed to be able to sign up in a single online session, pick a plan, find a premium, figure out if they could get a subsidy. That's what Ashkar is hoping for. He has health insurance through the state, but he estimates he pays $250 a month for a plan that covers himself, his wife and his two children, and he has heard he might do better with a federally subsidized plan.

But the federally run sites in 34 states have been balky at best. Website signups have been almost as bad in some of the states running their own exchanges, too.



On Monday, President Barack Obama admitted the sites weren’t working as planned and promised to fix them. In the meantime, Obama advised people to use call centers and get in-person help from navigators and non-certified workers called helpers at community clinics nationwide. But for some, that's a dead end for now.



The navigators and helpers go through 30 hours of training and take a federally administered test. They receive instruction on privacy, and must promise to stay free of conflicts of interest.



The administration awarded $67 million last August to train and pay navigators around the country. Maryland gave $24 million in grant funds to six organizations like Community Clinic, Inc., to get the word out about the exchanges, encourage and help people enroll. The state has trained about 5,000 people total, including navigators, insurance brokers and social workers, to help people sign up.

Across the Potomac River in Virginia, there are far fewer navigators. Virginia opted to let the federal government run its exchange, and much of the work has fallen to non-profit groups.

After complaints by Republicans that navigators might not have enough training, or might have access to personal information, states including Utah, Nevada and Georgia passed law calling for stricter certification and licensing.



At Healthworks, a system of community health centers in Virginia, trained navigators have been able to get a few people signed up on the federal website. But navigators there have also turned to paper, says Carol Jameson, associate CEO for the clinics.

""We were going to wait until the website was up,"" Jameson says. ""Then, when that wasn't happening, we decided to mail the applications in.""



The team at Community Clinic, Inc., a network of low-cost medical clinics, has talked with 1,300 people so far, Korrick estimated.



But not a single one has made it through the entire enrollment process online. Maryland’s website, modeled on the federal website, keeps breaking down.

One woman got angry at the delays, says Apoorva Srivastata, who’s assigned to a clinic in nearby Takoma Park, Md. “She was, like, ‘I have given up hope,’” Srivastata says. “She had taken public transport to get there, and she had her kids with her. I told her not to give up and that she has time.”

Srivastata will call the woman when she is sure the website will work.

Alexandra Dixon, who spends her days at a folding table with a laptop computer inside one downtown Silver Spring clinic, has calmed some impatient customers, too. “I had one gentleman who got pretty upset,” she says.

Maryland’s case hasn’t been a total failure. The Maryland Health Benefit Exchange says that as of last week, 2,300 households used the website to sign up for health insurance. About 260,000 have visited the website; Maryland has 800,000 residents without health insurance.



But it compares poorly to, for instance, the state of Washington, which says more than 35,000 people have successfully signed up on its online exchange.

For the time being, the navigators are telling people about the health care law and their options. Srivastata says she makes her “elevator pitches” whenever the clinic’s waiting room fills up with patients, most of them recent immigrants from Latin America or Ethiopia.

“I say, ‘Do you know about the new health care law?’ and they are all blank,” she says. “I’d say 90 percent of people are at point zero.”

Asking people about the Affordable Care Act usually get a shrug, says Dixon. “But if you say Obamacare, they say “yeah, oh, yeah, Obamacare,” she says.

She remains hopeful. “It’s better than it was last week and I fully expect for it to get better next week,” Dixon says, nodding. In the meantime, she’s telling people to make appointments for two weeks from now.

Critics in Congress say they believe the Obama administration knew about the problems and didn’t tell anyone. On Thursday, the Republican-controlled House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on the technical problems and has summoned executives from several of the software contractors who helped build the federal exchange.

Inasmuch as Texas is the state with the highest rate of uninsured citizens he refused Obamacare’s expansion of Medicaid. For those with pre-existing condition in Texas who were either in the high priced high risk Texas insurance pool or were uninsured because of the cost of these high risk pools, Obamacare comes to the rescue even here in Texas.

My wife has Lupus, a pre-existing condition. As a small business owner I had a group plan with a professional engineering organization. After being extorted with rates that effectively cost us north of $20 thousand a year over a decade ago I migrated to a high deductible catastrophic policy for my daughter and myself, an inexpensive student policy for my daughter while in college, and the Texas High Risk pool for my wife. It was expensive but less than the previous policy. Over the long run it is evident that this would become unsustainable as all these policies increased in value at a much faster rate than inflation.

Then came Obamacare. Obamacare means that effective October 1st, once again my wife, my daughter (while still in college and less than 26 years old), and me will be once again on the same policy at an affordable price. I already checked pricing and they are less expensive, reasonable, and provide much better coverage.

The real reason for this post however is the hypocrisy of the Republican Party in Texas. Republicans run Texas, not because it is a Red State but because it is the state with the worst voter participation. They run all departments. They run all agencies including the high risk pool. Today my wife received the following letter.

Important to note is that the letter correctly echoes the benefits of Obamacare for the millions in Texas and the United States with preexisting conditions. It correctly states that someone with a preexisting condition can no longer be denied coverage. It states forcefully (with an underline) that everyone is guaranteed the same rate given one’s age. It also correctly states that many will qualify for subsidies.

The letter even goes further in promoting Obamacare. It correctly states that there are no more lifetime maximums (in other words insurance companies cannot stop paying up to some maximum; bankruptcies be gone). It correctly states that 100% coverage for preventative care is provided, and all policies now cover doctor visits hospitalization, and prescriptions. In other words charlatans can no longer sell worthless policies. Most importantly, the letter sends Texans to the correct website that will provide them accurate information instead of all the lies and misinformation provided in an orchestrated manner by the Republican Party. The misinformation and lies will directly cause the unnecessary deaths of many, mostly their own constituents and base.

This letter from a Texas agency is the best justification for Obamacare. This Texas government agency placed the wellbeing of Texans over politics.

ObamaCare architect claims 'big PR campaign' needed,"The federal health care overhaul was central to President Obama's two campaigns for the White House, and has been the defining achievement -- for better or worse -- of his presidency.

But one of the architects of ObamaCare, in a heated interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" argued that the reason young people are not signing up in droves for coverage under the law is the administration hasn't promoted it.

Ezekiel Emanuel, a former health adviser to the president (and the brother of former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel), argued the administration has been too caught up with fixing HealthCare.gov to give the law the proper promotional push.

""No one has launched a big PR campaign to get these people signed up because of the problems with the federal website,"" he told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""We are about to launch a big PR campaign, and that, I think, is going to persuade a lot of people to sign up.""

He noted the administration still has ""four more months to go until the end of March,"" when penalties kick in for those who haven't gotten coverage.

More On This...

Obama, though, recently kicked off his latest effort to promote the benefits of the law in response to mounting criticism about its rollout. States have been promoting their health care exchanges for months, in advance of the Oct. 1 launch. And Obama spent much of the 2012 campaign touting the upsides of the law.

Whether a new promotional effort will convince young people to come onboard is unclear. Speaking earlier on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said: ""I don't see any way ObamaCare can work.""

Emanuel was responding to a recent poll that showed that vital age group was shying away from coverage.

The Harvard ""Millennials"" poll, released last week, found only 22 percent of young Americans -- defined in the survey as between 18 and 29 years old -- plan to sign up for ObamaCare. ""Actuarially, the [Affordable Care Act] depends upon these young Americans signing up,"" Trey Greyson, director of Harvard's Institute of Politics, said last week. ""Our survey shows that the administration has a lot of work to do to get them onboard.""

The Affordable Care Act relies on young, healthy people to sign up. If this doesn't happen, it could create what some have referred to as a ""death spiral,"" where insurance companies are taking on older and sicker Americans, causing premiums to skyrocket and risking the health of the whole system.

Emanuel, though, disputed the Harvard poll as ""not a very useful piece of information,"" and claimed that in states like California, the percentage of young Americans signing up is consistent with the population itself. He said he doesn't think the ""death spiral"" is a ""real possibility.""

He said he thinks young people will be incentivized to sign up, and noted that the looming penalty will convince more to sign up by March 31.

Emanuel also tried to rebut complaints that despite the president's promises, people are losing their current doctors. ""If you want to pay more for an insurance company that covers your doctor, you can do that,"" he said.

As for the problems with the website, Emanuel said the administration is ""working diligently"" to fix them.

He continued to compare the rollout to that of major tech products like the iPhone.

""I know that when I got my iPhone, there were lots of glitches. They send updates for that,"" he said. ""This happens with large-scale enrollment of millions of people.""

Asked whether someone like Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius should be fired over the botched launch, he would not say. ""He'll make a decision,"" Emanuel said of the president, adding that the decision not to appoint a ""CEO"" to oversee the launch was clearly a ""mistake."""
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/19/florida-abortion-bill_n_3118365.html,2013-04-19 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Reporter'],Florida Abortion Bill Debate Causes Black Women Lawmakers To Walk Out,"A debate in Florida's House of Representatives over a Republican-sponsored ban on race- and sex-selective abortions became extremely heated Thursday, causing several black women lawmakers to walk out in protest.

House Bill 845, sponsored by Rep. Charles Van Zant (R-Keystone Heights), would make it a third-degree felony in Florida to perform an abortion based on the race or gender of the fetus. In his closing statements on Thursday, Van Zant accused Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers of intentionally targeting black people. ""The fact is, 80 percent of abortion clinics nationwide are located in minority neighborhoods where 43 percent of all black babies are aborted,"" Van Zant said, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

""In America alone, without the Nazi Holocaust, without the Ku Klux Klan, Planned Parenthood and other abortionists have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973,"" he said. ""This is called discriminatory targeting.""

Several black lawmakers became insulted during the debate, and at least five women walked out. Rep. Barbara Watson (D-Miami), one of the members who left, told HuffPost in a phone interview that she felt as if Van Zant was manipulating information to reflect his personal beliefs about abortion.

""I don't appreciate anyone trying to explain what any other ethnic group's lifestyle is and what they do, when you really don't have any authority to interpret it,"" she said. ""I think the women and people of color in that chamber deserve an apology from him, but I don't know that it would actually change his point of view.""

Rep. Darryl Rouson (D-St. Petersburg) said he felt the bills' sponsors were disingenuous in their mission to save the black population from abortion. ""If these representatives truly care about even the subject matter of black genocide, I've got a few bills they could file,"" he said. ""That's what got me upset. They could have talked about the bill and its intent without trying to use black genocide and black babies to sway a vote.""

Van Zant was not immediately available for comment.

Anti-abortion activists have long accused Planned Parenthood of targeting African Americans, but a 2011 fact-check by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research organization, showed that only 9 percent of abortion clinics are located in predominantly black neighborhoods, while 63 percent of clinics are in non-Hispanic white neighborhoods. While black women have a disproportionately high abortion rate compared to other ethnic groups, Guttmacher research shows that could be attributed to higher rates of poverty among black women and the fact that 69 percent of pregnancies among black women are unintended, compared with 40 percent of pregnancies among whites.

Florida representatives passed the anti-abortion bill after a long, fiery debate on Thursday by a vote 71-44, sending it to the state Senate. Rouson said that bill cosponsor Rep. Keith Perry (R-Gainesville) wrote him a personal letter after the vote to apologize for offending him.

Rouson said he hopes the legislature can focus on something else now. ""I've been up here five sessions now, and every last one we're dealing with abortion bills,"" he said. ""You would think we could deal with some women's rights issues or things of great governmental concern, other than every year coming back and trying to do something with abortion.""

UPDATE: 6:10 p.m. -- Rep. Keith Perry acknowledged in a phone interview with HuffPost on Friday that he did send an apology letter to Rouson out of a concern that he had offended him. But Perry said he stands by the comments he made on the House floor.

""What I did was speak some facts about percentages of abortion that are performed, and the ratios [for black women] far exceed the norm of the population,"" he said. ""And I'm not saying the facts are wrong, because they weren't, but the way it was presented, it certainly offended [members of the black caucus].""

Perry added, ""The concern is whether or not there's a strategic marketing approach by people who provide abortions to target certain groups. I don't know if they do or not, but there's a concern that some people may share."""

Republican fissures over the expansion of Medicaid, a critical piece of the 2010 health-care law designed to provide coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, continue to deepen, with battles in Arizona and elsewhere showing just how bitter the divisions have become.

Despite expressing distaste for the new law, some GOP governors have endorsed an expansion of Medicaid, and three — Jan Brewer of Arizona, John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Snyder of Michigan — are trying to persuade their Republican-controlled legislatures to go along. The governors are unwilling to turn down Washington’s offer to spend millions, if not billions, in their states to add people to the state-federal program for the poor. But they face staunch opposition from many GOP legislators who oppose the health-care law and worry that their states will be stuck with the cost of adding Medicaid recipients.

In one of the most explosive of the internal Republican battles, Brewer, a firebrand tea party favorite who once wagged her finger at President Obama, has declared a “moratorium” on all other legislation until her Medicaid plan, which would add 300,000 Arizonans to the program, is approved. She has backed up her threat by vetoing five unrelated bills.

In Ohio and Michigan, the governors are pressing for last-minute compromises before their legislatures adjourn this summer. The Florida legislature, which has adjourned, rejected Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s plan to expand Medicaid.

These conflicts over the health-care law illustrate a larger divide within the Republican Party over an array of issues, including immigration and automatic budget cuts.

The Medicaid expansion is one of the two main ways the health-care law would provide coverage to the uninsured. The other is through health insurance exchanges, which will sell policies to individuals whose incomes are too high for Medicaid; many of those people will receive subsidies to buy the health plans.

Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state and depends on income and other factors. The health-care law, in an effort to make eligibility uniform, mandated that anyone earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level, or $15,856 in 2013 dollars, be eligible for the program. But last June, the Supreme Court, while upholding most of the health-care law, ruled that states could refuse to expand their Medicaid programs. That set the stage for bitter debates — ones ruled as much by ideology and politics as by financial realities — that have been occurring in state capitals nationwide.

Under the law, the federal government will pay 100 percent of the cost of newly eligible Medicaid recipients for the first three years, beginning in January. After that, the federal contribution will taper, leveling off at 90 percent for 2020 and beyond.

Twenty-three states and the District have agreed to the Medicaid expansion. Nineteen states have decided against the expansion and eight are debating it, according to Avalere Health, a consulting firm. States that decline to expand Medicaid now can still sign up in later years.

The debate over Medicaid has been emotional and vitriolic in many states. In Texas, Gov. Rick Perry (R) was heckled during a recent speech for opposing an expansion. In Montana, chaos erupted after a lawmaker accidentally voted against expanding the program, causing the measure to fail. Medicaid advocates in some states, frustrated by inaction from their elected leaders, are working to put the matter to voters in the form of ballot initiatives.

The hostility is evident in Arizona, where authorities are investigating a threatening phone call and e-mails directed at lawmakers who support expanding the program. Opponents of the expansion have condemned the alleged threats.

Brewer’s support for the expansion has stunned longtime backers, who have come to relish her gritty, confrontational persona. These supporters were gleeful last year when photos showed her defiantly pointing a finger at the president on a tarmac in Phoenix during what she later described as a tense conversation about her characterization of Obama in her memoir, “Scorpions for Breakfast.”

Now, her former fans label her a traitor and deride her Medicaid proposal as “Obrewercare.”

“It’s typical of these politicians,” said Dara Vanesian, chairman for the Navajo County Republican Committee. “This is not truly about the individual or rights or what’s best for Arizona. This is Brewer looking at dollars that are supposedly going to come from the federal government.”

Brewer may win, despite the opposition. Her measure has passed the Republican-controlled state Senate. There is stronger opposition in the House, which has a larger and more conservative Republican majority. State Rep. John Kavanagh (R), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the committee plans to strip the Medicaid expansion from the budget.

He acknowledged that his members are feeling the heat after Brewer’s vetoes. Still, he added, conservative lawmakers would be hard-pressed to vote yes on the Medicaid expansion after years of railing against the health-care law and federal spending.

“For the last five years, almost every one of us Republicans have been bashing Obamacare and vilifying the federal government for irresponsible government spending,” Kavanagh said. “I have never seen a more toxic vote for Republicans than to vote yes on this expansion.”

Matthew Benson, a spokesman for Brewer, said the governor is confident that the Medicaid proposal will ultimately pass the House. Despite the vocal opposition from within her party, he said she has the support of many traditionally conservative groups, including 14 of the state’s 15 sheriffs and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce.



“We recognize that the ‘Obamacare’ title is what makes this controversial,” Benson said. “If it weren’t for that aspect of it, this plan would have gotten done months ago.”

Brewer, who joined the unsuccessful lawsuit last year to strike down the health-care law, has tried to walk a blurry line on the issue. She has maintained her opposition to the legislation and insisted that her Medicaid proposal is not the same as Obama’s.

Her office has argued that the Medicaid plan will spur growth by providing money to hospitals and pumping $2 billion into the Arizona economy. And she has said she will pull the plug if it appears that the federal government will not come through on its promise to fully or mostly fund the expansion.

“When I introduced my Medicaid restoration plan in January, I knew it wasn’t going to be easy,” Brewer said at a rally in Tucson. “I knew the road was going to be tough. And I knew there were going to be opponents. But let me tell you something else. I don’t think the opponents realize how hard we are going to fight.”

Arizona was the last state to join Medicaid, signing on in 1982, 17 years after the program was created. Today, it covers many childless adults who earn up to $11,490, the federal poverty level for that demographic and a more generous amount than most states."

Pugach doesn't see herself as upper-income by any stretch, but President Barack Obama's budget would raise her Medicare premiums and those of other comfortably retired seniors, adding to a surcharge that already costs some 2 million beneficiaries hundreds of dollars a year each.

More importantly, due to the creeping effects of inflation, 20 million Medicare beneficiaries would end up paying higher ""income related"" premiums for their outpatient and prescription coverage over time.

Administration officials say Obama's proposal will help improve the financial stability of Medicare by reducing taxpayer subsidies for retirees who can afford to pay a bigger share of costs. Congressional Republicans agree with the president on this one, making it highly likely the idea will become law if there's a budget deal this year.

But the way Pugach sees it, she's being penalized for prudence, dinged for saving diligently.

It was the government, she says, that pushed her into a higher income bracket where she'd have to pay additional Medicare premiums.

IRS rules require people age 70-and-a-half and older to make regular minimum withdrawals from tax-deferred retirement nest eggs like 401(k)s. That was enough to nudge her over Medicare's line.

""We were good soldiers when we were young,"" said Pugach, who worked as a computer systems analyst. ""I was afraid of not having money for retirement and I put in as much as I could. The consequence is now I have to pay about $500 a year more in Medicare premiums.""

Currently only about 1 in 20 Medicare beneficiaries pays the higher income-based premiums, which start at incomes over $85,000 for individuals and $170,000 for couples. As a reference point, the median or midpoint U.S. household income is about $53,000.

Obama's budget would change Medicare's upper-income premiums in several ways. First, it would raise the monthly amounts for those currently paying.

If the proposal were already law, Pugach would be paying about $168 a month for outpatient coverage under Medicare's Part B, instead of $146.90.

Then, the plan would create five new income brackets to squeeze more revenue from the top tiers of retirees.

But its biggest impact would come through inflation.

The administration is proposing to extend a freeze on the income brackets at which seniors are liable for the higher premiums until 1 in 4 retirees has to pay. It wouldn't be the top 5 percent anymore, but the top 25 percent.

""Over time, the higher premiums will affect people who by today's standards are considered middle-income,"" explained Tricia Neuman, vice president for Medicare policy at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. ""At some point, it raises questions about whether (Medicare) premiums will continue to be affordable.""

Required withdrawals from retirement accounts would be the trigger for some of these retirees. For others it could be taking a part-time job.

One consequence could be political problems for Medicare. A growing group of beneficiaries might come together around a shared a sense of grievance.

""That's part of the problem with the premiums -- they simply act like a higher tax based on income,"" said David Certner, federal policy director for AARP, the seniors lobby.

""Means testing"" of Medicare benefits was introduced in 2007 under President George W. Bush in the form of higher outpatient premiums for the top-earning retirees. Obama's health care law expanded the policy and also added a surcharge for prescription coverage.

The latest proposal ramps up the reach of means testing and sets up a political confrontation between AARP and liberal groups on one side and fiscal conservatives on the other. The liberals have long argued that support for Medicare will be undermined if the program starts charging more for the well-to-do. Not only are higher-income people more likely to be politically active, they also tend to be in better health.

Fiscal conservatives say it makes no sense for government to provide the same generous subsidies to people who can afford to pay at least some of the cost themselves. As a rule, taxpayers pay for 75 percent of Medicare's outpatient and prescription benefits. Even millionaires would still get a 10 percent subsidy on their premiums under Obama's plan. Technically, both programs are voluntary.

""The government has to understand the difference between universal opportunity and universal subsidy,"" said David Walker, the former head of the congressional Government Accountability Office. ""This is a very modest step towards changing the government subsidy associated with Medicare's two voluntary programs.""

It still doesn't sit well with Sheila Pugach. She says she's been postponing remodeling work on her 58-year-old house because she's concerned about the cost. Having a convenient utility room so she doesn't have to go out to the garage to do laundry would help with her back problems.

""They think all old people are living the life of Riley,"" she said."

USA TODAY

Up to 75%25 of those with individual insurance could have policies canceled%2C experts say

Administration has said a certain percentage of individuals will lose existing policies

Law sets minimum standards for policies

Millions of Americans are getting their health insurance canceled under the Affordable Care Act and the Obama administration has known for about three years that this would happen, NBC News is reporting.

About 50% to 75% of 14 million consumers who buy health insurance individually will receive a ""cancellation"" letter or its equivalent in the next year because their current policies don't meet the standards laid out by the new law, the news organization reports, citing four sources deeply involved in ACA.

Of those who will be forced to buy new insurance, many will face huge price increases, NBC reports.

Initially, the administration stipulated that policies in effect as of March 23, 2010, could be ""grandfathered"" or kept even if they don't meet the requirements of the new law. Later, the Department of Health and Human Services wrote regulations that narrowed that provision to dictate that if any part of those policies, such as co-pay or benefits, had substantially changed since then, they would not longer be grandfathered in.

NBC alleges the administration knew that up to 67% of customers on the individual market could have their policies canceled, but instead, President Obama said as recently as in 2012, ""If (you) already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance.""

The White House told NBC that people whose policies will be canceled will, in most cases, be automatically shifted to plans with better protections.

""Nothing in the Affordable Care Act forces people out of their health plans,"" White House spokeswoman Jessica Santillo told the news organization.

White House spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged that some plans would not meet the new minimum standards and would ""not qualify for the Affordable Care Act."""

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-briefed-spring-widespread-website-problems-214659604--sector.html,,[],Obama was briefed in spring on widespread website problems,"By Roberta Rampton and David Morgan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, who has portrayed himself as surprised by technical problems with the government's new health care website, was briefed last spring on a detailed consultant's report that warned of system failure, White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Tuesday. Carney said the president's familiarity with the report and recommendations by McKinsey & Co did not contradict previous statements from the White House that described Obama as surprised by the scope of flaws in HealthCare.gov since it opened for people to enroll for insurance coverage on October 1. Obama was told the problems identified by McKinsey were being addressed, Carney said. After reeling from technical problems at its website for more than six weeks, the Obama administration on Tuesday also said that it is still months away from completing the back end of the system, including functions needed to finalize federal subsidies for consumers who buy health plans. Administration officials said the complicated information technology system's financial management function would not be completed until mid-January, weeks after the first enrollees are scheduled to begin receiving benefits under the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 as Obama's signature domestic policy. Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), played down the January timeframe, saying the financial management functions are not among the high priority fixes aimed at ensuring a smooth operation for consumers to shop, enroll in coverage and make their first month's premium payment. But the ability of the administration to deliver federal premium tax credits as partial premium payments for qualifying consumers is a vital segment of the function of the new online marketplace. Also not due until January are functions involving risk adjustments for insurers and the monthly reconciliation of enrollment data. The McKinsey report, released Monday night by a Republican-controlled House of Representatives committee, is the most detailed analysis made public to date of the difficulties the site was facing late in its development. It warned the government of the potential for system failure that could make the health care exchanges inaccessible to consumers trying to buy insurance through them, suggesting that there was not enough time before October to make all the repairs. Release of the report by the Republican chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee was part of a broad effort by Republicans to discredit the health care program and to portray the Obama administration as incompetent in implementing the health care law. DEMOCRATS JOINING CRITICISM Democrats are increasingly joining the chorus of criticism. Representative Elijah Cummings, a senior Democrat and ally of Obama, called on Tuesday for a White House shakeup over the handling of the rollout of the healthcare law, commonly called Obamacare. The website is an online exchange that allows consumers to shop for coverage under the law, which mandated that Americans have health insurance and created new marketplaces to buy and sell policies. In a separate House hearing, Republicans portrayed the website as not only broken but not secure for personal information of consumers. Three security experts testified that HealthCare.gov was so insecure for consumers that they believed it should be shut down until fixed. Obama administration officials responded that the site was safe. The rollout of Obama's signature domestic policy has hurt the popularity of the initiative, but the decline has been fairly modest, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Monday. Forty-one percent of Americans expressed support for Obamacare in a survey conducted from Thursday to Monday. That was down 3 percentage points from a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken from September 27 to October 1. Opposition to the healthcare law stood at 59 percent in the latest poll, versus 56 percent in the earlier survey. (Additional reporting by Caren Bohan; Editing by Fred Barbash and Grant McCool)"

For starters, the effort has elicited something long missing on the part of this president -- some spine.

Ever since he stepped into the Rose Garden on October 1 to warn the Republicans that he simply wasn't prepared to negotiate while the government was shut down and default on the debt was threatened, we've seen a much tougher Obama. The split in the Republicans, meanwhile, continues to widen, with an ever-increasing backlash among party professionals against the nihilism of Ted Cruz and company. Poor John Boehner tacks back and forth between frantically trying to hold his coalition together and signaling that he'd be willing to suspend the Hastert Rule and allow pragmatic Republicans vote with Democrats to keep the government open.

Public opinion seems to be moving against the Republicans. The question is no longer whether they will continue their suicidal gambit but when they will cave and on what terms.

Weirdly, by threatening to shut the government unless Obama killed the Affordable Care act, they got the opposite of what they sought. The rest of the government is closed, and Obamacare is open for business.

And, while Republicans and movement conservatives have spent the better part of a year demonizing Obama's health reform, the more people become familiar with it, the more people will appreciate it -- leaving the Republican alarmism with no clothes. In that regard, the president and his strategists would do well to change one core piece of their rhetoric. In his Rose Garden remarks, the president said this:

Now, of course, if you're one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, you don't need to do a thing. You're already benefiting from new benefits and protections that have been in place for some time under this law. But for the 15 percent of Americans who don't have health insurance, this opportunity is life-changing.

In fact, that's profoundly wrong, and weakens the president's case. The statistically accurate contention that 85 percent of people will have no change in their insurance is a throwback to the early days of the health reform debate, when focus groups suggested that people who had employer-provided insurance and liked it needed to be reassured.

But a lot has changed since then. Employer coverage is eroding. People who lose jobs or change jobs typically lose their insurance. COBRA protection paid entirely by the former worker is only a temporary and largely unaffordable stopgap.

The fact is that the Affordable Care Act helps a lot more the 15 percent of the population. Young adults with no employer-provided insurance (and their parents) already know how valuable Obamacare is, for allowing people under age 26 to stay on their parents' insurance. People without jobs and at risk of losing jobs are also coming to value the Affordable Care Act.

There is an analogy here with the revolution in broad acceptance of sexual diversity. As more and more gays and lesbians came out, straight people were initially shocked, then surprisingly accepting, as they realized that they had a friend, co-worker, neighbor, or family member who turned out to be gay.

As more and more people sign up for affordable insurance thanks to Obama Care, many Americans who have insurance (and many who are worried about losing it) will hear heart-rending firsthand stories about friends, colleagues and relatives with medical worries, who finally get insurance. That coalition is a lot more than 15 percent.

Many of these people, incidentally, are in red states, where the percentage of the uninsured tends to be far higher than the national average. In several such states, Republican governors have broken ranks and signed their states up for the provision of the Affordable Care Act that has the Federal government finance nearly all the costs of expanded Medicaid.

No wonder the Republicans are so desperate to kill Obamacare in utero. The more it takes effect, the more their hysteria will be proven to be a phony. By 2014, when the Republican House majority will present itself for re-election, the Affordable Care Act could be quite popular. What then?

President Obama, increasingly, finds himself in the chips. Let's see if this time he can resist the impulse to fold a winning hand.

Seventeen million people will qualify for tax credits to reduce the cost of health insurance under Obamacare, according to a report released Tuesday.

That amounts to about 60 percent of the 29 million people who could make up the market for the health insurance exchanges created by President Barack Obama's health care reform law, the Henry J. Kaiser Family foundation estimates. Enrollment via the insurance exchanges began Oct. 1, but has been hampered by the failed launch of HealthCare.gov, the federal portal to the marketplaces in more than 30 states, and technical problems affecting several of the state-run exchanges.

Residents of five states -- Texas, California, Florida, New York and Pennsylvania -- represent more than 40 percent of the people who would qualify for tax credits across the country, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. California and New York are operating their own insurance exchanges, while the other states are part of the federal system. The report includes breakdowns of how many people are eligible for tax credits in every state.

The insurance exchanges are intended for people who are uninsured or who buy insurance on their own because they don't get health benefits from their employers. Those already covered by job-based health coverage or government programs like Medicare and Medicaid don't need to use the exchanges.

The Affordable Care Act provides two kinds of financial assistance based on income. People who earn up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $46,000 for a single person, are eligible for tax credits to reduce the cost of their monthly insurance premiums. In addition, people who earn up to 250 percent of the poverty level, or about $29,000, can get additional subsidies to cut out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and copayments.

Subsidies mainly will go to younger, working people, according to an analysis published by Families USA in April.

The value of these subsidies will differ based on the price of health insurance, which varies greatly by state and by factors such as age. Although millions of people will get tax credits large enough to cover the full cost of their insurance, others will get smaller subsidies, and people earning above 400 percent of the poverty level will have to pay full price. In some cases, those premiums will be higher than prices available on the current health insurance market.

Although the Kaiser Family Foundation projects close to 30 million people could be using the exchanges, actual enrollment during the first year is expected to be much lower. The Congressional Budget Office projects that 7 million people will use the exchanges to obtain private health insurance for 2014, and that 6 million of them will qualify for tax credits.

The poor performance of HealthCare.gov and ongoing issues in a few states could suppress enrollment, although the Obama administration maintains it will have the federal web portal functional by the end of the month, enabling people to sign up. Consumers have until Dec. 15 to choose a health plan that will be in place on Jan. 1, and the enrollment period ends March 31.

If you or a family member has been notified that your individual policy is being canceled at year’s end, you may be stunned and upset.

House Republicans sparred with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius Wednesday over the cancellations, with Sebelius saying the law generally didn’t require insurers to discontinue plans if they were in effect at the time of the law’s enactment in March 2010.

No one knows how many of the estimated 14 million people who buy their own insurance are getting such notices, but the numbers are substantial. Some insurers report discontinuing 20 percent of their individual business, while other insurers have notified up to 80 percent of policyholders that they will have to change plans.

Here is a guide to help you understand the bigger picture, including why your premiums and benefits are likely to change next year and what you should consider as you shop for a new policy.

Q. Why is this happening?

A. The so-called individual market was targeted by the health care law because it didn’t work well for many people who do not get coverage through an employer, particularly those who were older or had health problems. The latter were often rejected for coverage, charged more or had their conditions excluded from coverage. Some policies were so skimpy they provided only the barest of coverage when someone did fall ill.

Starting Jan. 1, insurers can no longer reject people who are sick or charge them more than the healthy under the Affordable Care Act. They must also beef up policies to meet minimum standards and add benefits, such as prescription drug coverage, maternity care and mental health services.

Q. Why am I getting this notice?

A. Most likely your plan didn’t meet all the standards of the federal health law. One type of policy being discontinued by Florida Blue, for example, did not cover hospitalizations or emergency room visits and paid a maximum of $50 toward doctor visits. It’s possible your plan also had deductibles and other potential expenses – such as copayments for doctors and hospital care -- that exceeded the law’s annual out-of-pocket maximum of $6,350 for individuals or $12,700 for families. Insurers may have just decided to end certain types of policies, something they have always had the ability to do. Some policies that fail to meet the law’s standards can still be sold, but only if the insurer decides to continue them and they are “grandfathered,” meaning you purchased one before March 2010 and neither you nor the insurer has made any substantial change since then. Adjusting an annual deductible, which many people do each year to keep down their premiums, is a change that could end grandfathered status.

Q. How are insurers picking policies to discontinue?

A. Some consumers fear they are being targeted because they are unhealthy or otherwise unprofitable for an insurance company. Kansas Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger said insurers can only discontinue entire blocks of business and cannot simply pick and choose certain customers to cancel. Those whose policies are canceled can sign up instead for a new plan and can’t be rejected because of their health. Insurers say they are ending policies that don’t meet the law’s standards or were not grandfathered.

Q. My insurer says if I renew before the end of the year, I can keep my current plan. What does this mean?

A. In some states, insurers are offering selected policyholders a chance to “early renew,” meaning they can continue their existing plan through next year, even if it doesn’t meet all the law’s standards. If you choose this option, your premium may still go up, but the cause would be medical inflation, rather than the need to add benefits because of the health law. Not all states allow early renewals. Fearing insurers would offer such renewals only to their most profitable plans, a handful of states, including Illinois, Missouri and Rhode Island, barred insurers from doing it.

Q. Why are premiums changing?

A. Under the old rules, insurers could decide whether to accept you – and how much to charge -- based on answers to dozens of medical questions. You no longer have to fill out those forms. Starting Jan. 1, insurers can no longer charge women more than men, reject people who are sick or charge them more and can charge older people only three times more than younger ones. They’re also adding new benefits.

As they drew up the rates for 2014, insurance firms had to make educated guesses about how many customers would stay, how many new ones they would attract – and what the health conditions of those new members might be. Actuaries say the new rules on how much insurers may vary rates level the playing field, making premiums more of an average. Older buyers or those who had above-average health problems – and whose former rates reflected those problems – may find their premiums going down. Younger or healthier people, on the other hand, may find premiums going up, sometimes sharply. Under the new rules, consumers “are not paying based on their own health status, but an average health status,” said Robert Cosway, an actuary with consulting firm Milliman. “The positive side is that people in poor health won’t have to pay as much, but the way you get there is that people in better health have to pay more.”

Q. I don’t qualify for a subsidy, and my premium is going way up for what the insurer tells me is a comparable policy. Why is that?

A. Insurers base premiums on a number of factors, including medical inflation and the cost of implementing insurance rules. A report on the California market done by Cosway at Milliman estimated that medical inflation and changes from the health law could add about 30 percent to the average premium in California. The biggest chunk of the increase was attributed to insurers being required to accept everyone, even those who are ill.That requirement polls well with the public. But it makes insurers nervous because they can no longer reject the costliest patients.

Q. I’m healthy. Why do I have to pay for people who are sick?

A. Except for a fortunate few, everyone is likely to develop some kind of health problem or face an accident sometime in their lives. Policy experts and regulators say insurance works best when it spreads risk across a large group of people. Your house may not burn down this year, but you pay for insurance coverage just in case.

Q. I’m a single man, why do I have a plan with maternity coverage?

A. Again, it’s about spreading the risk. Men may not need maternity care, but women don’t need treatment for prostate cancer and those costs are baked into the rates, too. Older men, and women past child-bearing age, are more likely to need treatment for heart disease, artificial hips or other illnesses that younger men and women are less likely to need. “The whole concept of insurance is you can’t just pick and choose the benefits you want,” said Praeger. If people – especially older ones – get premiums based solely on what they might need, she said, “it could cost a whole lot more.”

Q. What if it turns out they’ve charged too much for the new coverage?

A.Under the health law, insurers who fail to spend at least 80 percent of their premium revenue on medical care have to issue rebates to consumers. Those rebates for 2014 policies won’t be seen until 2015, however.

Q. I’ve gotten this notice, what should I do now?

A. Experts say people should scrutinize the terms of their soon-to-be-discontinued policy and compare them with what new policies offer. The monthly premium is just one factor in cost. Also note the deductible. Is it per person? What is the maximum deductible if two or more family members fall ill in the same year? Finally, note the annual out-of-pocket cap, which is the maximum you pay in deductibles and co-payments for medical care during the year.

An independent broker can show you plans from various carriers. You can also check your state’s online marketplace or log onto or call healthcare.gov, the website serving 36 states that opted not to create their own marketplaces. While consumers are having trouble creating accounts through healthcare.gov, the website now allows shoppers to browse health plans without creating an account. When browsing, however, be aware that the premiums are not actual quotes because they do not reflect your exact age. Nor do they show subsidies, although several online calculators—including some on state marketplace websites and another by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation can give you a good idea of how much you might receive toward coverage, based on your income.

Des Moines Register

Last month%2C Cruz kicked off a controversial campaign to stymie Obamacare

Cruz spoke Friday at the Republican Party of Iowa%27s annual Ronald Reagan fundraising dinner

The audience greeted him with a 36-second standing ovation

Conservative purist Ted Cruz addressed the concerns of any Iowa Republicans who reject him as too rigid, arguing he knows exactly how to unify the GOP and how to turn the country around.

The answer: ""Restore historic economic growth,"" he said.

Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, who has been drawn to the presidential testing grounds of Iowa three times now in less than three months, told an audience of about 600 at the Republican Party of Iowa's annual Ronald Reagan fundraising dinner: ""We need to come together.""

""And let me tell you, growth and principles are ideas that unify Republicans,"" he said. ""They are principles and ideals that unify the evangelical community, the liberty movement and the business community. Growth and freedom are principles that bring together Main Street and the tea party.""

Last month, Cruz kicked off a controversial campaign to stymie Obamacare, the federal law requiring almost all Americans to carry health insurance, with a 21-hour pseudo-filibuster. The battle between conservative and Democratic members of Congress led to a 16-day federal government shutdown and took the country to what some Americans considered an alarming near-default on its debts.

The Des Moines Register reported Friday morning that some Iowa Republicans believe Cruz is the embodiment of the war inside the GOP. They see him as the tip of the spear of anti-establishment rage that is tearing apart the coalition of Republicans that has existed since the Reagan era: fiscal conservatives, social conservatives and national security conservatives.

If Cruz were to run for president, his campaign might leave him with only the fiercest tea party defenders, those center-right voters and political strategists say.

In a 45-minute speech, Cruz said over and over that working ""collectively"" is the only way to protect the nation from those who want to impose health insurance mandates, pile on more national debt, assault gun rights and hurt other constitutional rights.

It was the GOP's failure to stand together, he said, that killed the effort to defund Obamacare.

""We didn't accomplish our ultimate policy goal in this battle, and we didn't because unfortunately a significant number of Senate Republicans chose not to unite and stand side by side with House Republicans,"" he said. ""Had we stood together I'm convinced the outcome of this fight would be very, very different. But listen, none of us ever thought that taking on the Washington establishment was going to be easy.""

He added: ""Right now I'm more encouraged than ever.""

As Cruz took the stage, the audience greeted him with a 36-second standing ovation.

""I promise that I'll do everything humanly possible to try to speak for less than 21 hours,"" Cruz told them. ""You know I'm nearing to end when I bring out and begin to read 'The Cat in the Hat.'''

Twenty-one hours, he said, referring to his Sept. 24 speech on the Senate floor, is a long time.

""That's almost as long as it takes to sign up on the Obamacare website,"" he joked, referring to the troubled rollout of healthcare.gov, a site meant to help millions of uninsured Americans sign up for health insurance.

When Cruz came to Iowa in July, he had his father, a Cuban immigrant, in tow. This time his wife, Heidi, was by his side, and he made repeated references to their two young daughters, Catherine and Caroline.

Some center-right Republicans skipped the traditional fundraising dinner to express distaste for both Cruz and the current liberty movement-oriented leadership at party headquarters.

Republican Party of Iowa Co-Chairman David Fischer referenced that rift in his opening remarks.

""There are some of the old guard in the Grand Old Party that frankly don't approve of the kind of principled leadership being shown by the new conservative leaders like Sens. Cruz, (Rand) Paul and (Mike) Lee,"" he said, referring to the conservative senators from Texas, Kentucky and Utah.

""Some Republicans have even gone so far as to call them names. Well, I have a name for these new leaders, too,"" Fischer said. ""I call them the future.""

Republicans describe the fissure in different ways.

A center-right national strategist, Mike Murphy, has been talking this week about what he sees as two schools of thought in GOP.

The ""mathematicians"" look at the GOP's losing streak and say the party needs to make real changes to attract voters beyond the old Republican base of white guys, Murphy told the Washington Post.

The ""priests"" are focused on sins that the GOP is against, and they argue a lack of ideological purity is what loses elections, Murphy said.

When the Register asked Cruz where he falls, he scoffed.

""I do always finds it amusing that political strategists who manage to lose national elections immediately share their wisdom to others about how to continue losing national elections,"" he said in an interview earlier in the week.

Politicians can be hybrids of the two categories – politics is about the spectrum, not the absolutes, center-right strategists say. But not Cruz, Murphy told the Register in an email Friday night.

He's a purist and a priest, Murphy said.

""It's not a question of purity,"" Cruz told the Register. ""It's a question of standing for common-sense conservative principles that are shared throughout this country that have been part of the American fabric of every small town and every small business and in families all across this country.""

Cruz said every Republican presidential candidate who ran as a strong conservative won — Nixon in 1968 and 1972, Reagan in 1980 and 1984, George H.W. Bush in 1988, George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004. And those that ran as an establishment moderate lost — Ford in 1976, George H.W. Bush in 1992, Dole in 1996, McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012, Cruz said.

""After looking at that 40-year pattern,"" he said, ""the D.C. strategists all say we need more establishment moderates because they haven't won in four decades, but next time, trust us, they're going to win. That's not a pattern to electoral success.""

The Register interviewed 10 Republicans at the dinner, and each firmly agreed that division in the GOP means trouble.

""Political parties are designed to win elections. It's the only reason they exist,"" said Keith Christiansen, 18, a student at Grandview University in Des Moines. ""You cannot control the government if your party is fighting amongst itself. The in-fighting is horrible.""

But the chairman of the Iowa GOP, A.J. Spiker, told the audience that conservatives at the right-most side of the spectrum aren't budging.

""The Republican party is at a crossroads to determine the type of party it wishes to be,"" he said.

Those in ""the permanent political establishment"" who say it's necessary to water down the GOP message to try to win elections, Spiker said, won't succeed."

The delay in the tax, which has long been a goal of Big Labor, is expected to be part of a spending agreement brokered by Sens. Reid and McConnell.

At issue is a “reinsurance” tax levied against all group health plans. The funds raised would be used to compensate insurance companies for providing coverage to extremely sick individuals. Labor unions have made eliminating the tax a top priority, arguing that it would drive up the cost of health insurance for union members. At the recently concluded AFL-CIO annual meeting last month, union members passed a resolution calling for a repeal of the tax. The outlines of the emerging Senate spending deal will delay imposition of the tax for one year.

When House Republicans passed their government spending bill, with a one-year delay in ObamaCare’s individual mandate, President Obama countered that the health care program was the “settled” law of the land. Which, apparently, is true unless one has a PAC that showers millions of dollars in campaign contributions on lawmakers.

Earlier this year, the Obama Administration delayed for one year the mandate that large employers provide health insurance to their employees. This came soon after a similar one-year delay in the set-up of health exchanges for small businesses. Since ObamaCare passed Congress, the Administration has issued hundreds of waivers to special interests, exempting them from the effects of the law.

It seems that only the average American citizen will be made to comply with the ObamaCare program. Democrats, throughout the fiscal stand-off, have argued that ObamaCare should not be altered or reformed. Unless, of course, you are a labor union."

Fareed speaks with Steven Brill, founder of Court TV and The American Lawyer magazine, and David Goldhill, author of ‘Catastrophic Care: How American Health Care Killed My Father – and How We Can Fix It,’ about the problems with America’s health care system.

How would you change it?

Goldhill: Well, what I'm seeking is a balance, right? What we've done is all the way in this direction, in fact, further than almost any country on Earth, believe it or not, in reducing the amount of skin consumers have in the game.

But the problem isn't just money. The problem is the way the health care sectors compete now…we have a non-functioning price system in health care. Prices are not cost. They never have been. Their prices may make no sense by any normal economic means. It is to remove the consumer from the equation.

Consumers don't exercise power through leverage. They don't have leverage in any market. You don't have leverage in the cell phone market. Or the personal computer market or the home building market. We never have leverage. That's things that people say in health care they don't say in anything else. It's the competition for consumers that drives good behavior. And in health care, everything we've done has been to reduce competition.

So how could, I mean this seems like a point of agreement, where you talk...



Brill: Sure.

…so much about local monopolies, about the lack of competition, that the reason you can have this kind of price-gouging which you described is because you have all these local monopolies.

Brill: That's right. And the first part of the solution is complete transparency as to pricing so that…you have an instance where consumers have a choice, they have some kind of an informed choice. But if I'm right, and you need insurance – and they don't need to have 100 percent of the skin in the game – you need to balance the market out so that the insurers or whoever else is buying on behalf of the patient has some degree of leverage.

More from GPS: Why we need to fix health care

And I do think it is leverage. I think if I walk out of this building today and decide I'm going to buy a new cell phone, the leverage I have is at least knowing, a) that if it's way too expensive for all cell phones, I don't have to buy one, I will live another day…And b) there are lots of people who will sell me different kinds of cell phones at a different price.

I think that that is power and that is leverage. And that is completely missing from the health care economy today.

I think the one point of agreement is we, in the United States, have a kind of almost the worst of all worlds.

Brill: We've tried this really ridiculous experiment where we've left it, you know, completely to market forces, except that what's usual in a market is that there are two sides of the equation, the buyer and the seller. Here, the market forces only work for the seller. And the result is, we've lived in sort of an alternate universe over the last 10 years, where, you know, the rest of the country, the economy hasn't been so good, in case you haven't noticed, for the last half decade.

But the health care economy is just a totally different planet. Everybody is making more and more money. You know, the salaries are ridiculously high. The profit margins keep going up. The salaries of the people who run the drug companies and the hospitals keep going up. And it's all at the expense of the rest of us.

A final word…



Goldhill: Our heart may be in the right place, but we're not just hurting ourselves and our pocketbook. We're genuinely hurting our health. We've unleashed a flood of excess care that is dangerous and unsafe. All health care is not alike, but we treat it all like it's alike."

(CNN) —

For all the difficulties of the Affordable Care Act’s rollout, Americans are more patient than you might think: A new poll shows a majority expressing optimism that the problems are going to be ironed out.

Not only that, a majority continues to support the law or think it didn’t go far enough. Nevertheless, the conservatives rooting for its demise have been expressing not just vindication, but triumph. “We could be looking at the collapse of American liberalism,” said columnist Charles Krauthammer. “Liberalism is crumbling in front of our eyes,” echoed Michele Bachmann.

Yes indeed, a glitchy website and people moving from junk insurance to real insurance prove once and for all that government should have as little to do with health care as possible, and the entire liberal project lies in tatters.

That’s a little like proclaiming that your team will inevitably lose the World Series, then go bankrupt and disband because the other team scored a run in the first inning of Game 1. But the momentary political situation aside, conservatives still face a fundamental problem when they confront America’s health care system. Their ideology dictates only one solution to all health care problems, and that solution – less government, more free market – is exactly what gave us our dysfunctional health care system in the first place.

Let’s step back a moment to consider why we needed the Affordable Care Act and what it says about the health care market. The basic conservative position is that the more you let market forces operate, the better the outcome will be. “More markets” is the answer to everything: Let people buy insurance across state lines. Make it virtually impossible to sue for medical malpractice. Create more health savings accounts.

But where do you think the problems of America’s health care system came from? It wasn’t government that gave us nearly 50 million uninsured Americans and denials for pre-existing conditions. It wasn’t government that gave us the yearly and lifetime caps on insurance coverage that have sent so many people into bankruptcy when they’ve faced a serious illness or accident. It wasn’t government that gave us “rescissions,” where your insurance company cancels your policy if you get sick.

It wasn’t government that gave us a system in which the gap between what we spend and what we get is so enormous.

It was the free market.

The conservatives who profess to love markets so dearly seem unable to grasp that the market for health care isn’t like the market for shoes or cars. Other developed countries understand this. Every one of our peer nations has a system with more government control than ours, ranging from almost completely socialized systems like Great Britain’s to ones like those in Switzerland and the Netherlands, which resemble Obamacare but with tighter regulation.

We don’t have to wonder whether a health care system built on capitalist profit-seeking is more efficient and less expensive than those in which the government exercises more control. There has been a test running for decades, with many developed countries doing it one way, and the United States doing it the other. The results couldn’t be clearer.

On almost any criterion you can come up with, the government-controlled systems work better. They cover everyone, while spending far less than we do. Their health outcomes are as good or better than ours. A recent Bloomberg News analysis rated America’s as the world’s 46th most efficient health system, right above Serbia and right below Iran. Among the developed countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the U.S. ranks first (by a mile) in health spending per capita, but 26th in life expectancy.

There are some, however, who love the American health care system. American doctors make far higher salaries than their counterparts in other countries. American insurance companies do very well. As a recent New York Times investigation revealed, makers of devices like artificial hips mark up their prices double, triple, or even more when they sell to American hospitals as they do when they sell the same devices to European hospitals. The same is true of a hundred other devices and procedures. Why? Because in Europe, Japan, and other places with highly regulated health care, government rules keep the costs low.

In the American system, there are multiple points where companies do the rational thing: Extract as much money as possible from the system. That’s why an MRI costs three times as much in the U.S. as it does in France or Holland.

But people living under the oppression of those other governments’ systems must hate them, right? Wrong. The Commonwealth Fund recently released a study of health systems in 10 developed countries around the world which included a survey of satisfaction. America’s health system was the least popular, with only 25% of Americans saying it works well and the other 75% saying it should be fundamentally changed or completely rebuilt.

The most popular was the most socialized, Great Britain’s, with 63% saying it works well. You may remember that the opening ceremonies of the 2012 summer Olympics in London included a tribute to the National Health Service, so proud are Britons of their health system.

Despite all the problems created by America’s private health care market, we do have versions of big-government, socialized insurance. They’re called Medicare and Medicaid. They are far more efficient than private insurance, and Medicare recipients in particular love their coverage. It’s no accident that in every election, Republicans – who fought against the creation of Medicare and would love to privatize it – try to pretend to voters that they’re the program’s greatest defenders. The champions of free-market capitalism decide they can’t get elected without supporting a single-payer insurance program.

In all their glee about the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act, most Republicans are barely bothering to offer an alternative, other than a return to the way things used to be. It isn’t surprising, because to be brutally frank, they never much cared about the spectacular human suffering created by free-market health care.

For decades, liberals have been working to devise policy solutions and create the political conditions for health care reform that would achieve secure, universal coverage. On the other hand, in the face of millions who can’t get insurance because of pre-existing conditions and millions more who just can’t afford it, the conservative response was always, “Whatever.” The market spoke, and you lost. Too bad for you.

The Affordable Care Act can certainly be improved. But in health care – to paraphrase Ronald Reagan – the free market isn’t the answer to our problems. It is the problem.

(CNN) —

A pregnant nurse tells CNN she was fired from her job after she refused to get a flu shot for fear of miscarrying.

“I’m a healthy person. I take care of my body. For me, the potential risk was not worth it,” Dreonna Breton told CNN Sunday. “I’m not gonna be the one percent of people that has a problem.”

Breton, 29, worked as a nurse at Horizons Healthcare Services in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, when she was told that all employees were required to get a flu shot. The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention advises that all health care professionals get vaccinated annually.

She told her employers that she would not get the vaccine after she explained that there were very limited studies of the effects on pregnant women.

Breton came to the decision with her family after three miscarriages.

CDC: More states reporting widespread flu

The mother of one submitted letters from her obstetrician and primary care doctor supporting her decision, but she was told that she would be fired on December 17 if she did not receive the vaccine before then.

Horizons Healthcare Services spokesman Alan Peterson told CNN affiliate WPVI that it’s unconscionable for a health care worker not to be immunized and that pregnant women are more susceptible to the flu.

The CDC website states that getting a flu shot while pregnant is the best protection for pregnant women and their babies.

“I know that the CDC says to get it, and that’s fine, but it was our choice to avoid the flu vaccine and the unknowns that come with that,” Breton said.

Breton offered to wear a face mask at work, a practice that is used if employees are exempted for religious reasons. The hospital did not approve, according to Breton.

Breton has no interest in taking legal action, she said. She stated she only wants the company to reevaluate their policy on vaccines for pregnant employees and to continue working as a nurse.

http://news.yahoo.com/lawmakers-push-keep-obamas-health-care-pledge-220513736.html,,[],Lawmakers push to keep Obama's health care pledge,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Little more than a week after millions of consumers received health care cancellation notices, lawmakers in both parties are pushing legislation to redeem President Barack Obama's long-ago pledge that anyone liking their coverage will be allowed to keep it under the nation's controversial new law.

The result is a stern new challenge for the White House as it struggles to fix website woes for the signup portal for those seeking to enroll under the law, and simultaneously copes with angry consumers who rightly or wrongly blame ""Obamacare"" for cancellation letters mailed by insurers.

Democratic officials said top administration aides got a close-up view of the cancellation controversy last week, when Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., said at a closed-door meeting of the party's rank and file that his son had received notice his coverage was being terminated.

In response, these officials said White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough referred to a speech Obama had made earlier in the week saying some of those losing coverage would qualify under Medicaid, some would receive federal subsidies for individual coverage, and others would have options in the so-called exchanges the law set up to allow individuals to shop for insurance. Donnelly's office declined several requests for comment. The officials who described the incident did so on condition of anonymity, saying they were not authorized to discuss a private meeting.

In the Republican-controlled House, officials say a vote is likely as early as next week on a bill to let insurers continue selling any individual policies that were in effect on Jan. 1, 2013, even if they provide coverage deemed insufficient under Obamacare.

The measure, drafted by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., and backed by roughly 100 fellow Republicans, would remain in effect throughout 2014, after which the issue would presumably be reviewed.

""Despite the president's repeated promise of 'if you like your plan, you can keep it,' many Americans are now learning the sad reality that their current plan will no longer exist beginning on January 1,"" Upton, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement when he announced his legislation last week.

Story continues

""This legislation is about providing folks the peace of mind that they will be allowed to keep their current coverage if they so choose.""

While Upton's legislation permits insurers to sell existing coverage plans that would otherwise be banned, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., introduced legislation during the day to go one step further by requiring it.

Aides said that under her measure, insurance companies would be obliged to continue offering existing paying customers continued coverage under any plans in effect at the end of 2013. No new consumers could enroll.

""A promise was made that if you like your health plan, you can keep it - and I will do everything I can to see that the promise is kept,"" said Landrieu, who is gearing up for what is expected to be a challenging re-election campaign next year.

In a statement, Landrieu added that ""Many people may find better plans in the marketplaces that offer superior coverage for them at a good value and at a potentially lower cost. But if people want to keep their current plans, they should be able to do so.""

Her measure also requires insurers to explain areas in which the coverage falls short of the law's requirements, and notify consumers they may be able to find an alternative plan that meets the requirements.

The White House declined comment on the two bills.

Both measures are designed to cut through a complicated system in which some plans for individuals that fall short of coverage standards are allowed to continue under Obamacare, while others are not.

In general, individual coverage plans in effect on the date the legislation was enacted, March 23, 2010, may continue to be sold, regardless of their coverage levels. There are exceptions, though, including plans that significantly increase costs to consumers through higher deductibles, copayments or other steps.

According to an explanation published by Families USA, an increase in deductibles above medical inflation plus 15 percentage points would disqualify a plan from continued sale, for example.

Under current law, plans that went into effect after March 23, 2010 and fall short of the law's coverage requirements may not be sold beyond the end of the year.

That means that insurance companies that began selling new policies later throughout much of 2010 or in the two following years did so presumably knowing they would have to be canceled.

The impetus to amend the law is particularly strong among Republicans, who have voted dozens of times to repeal, defund or dismantle a program they voted against unanimously.

Unlike other GOP proposals, Upton's bill could conceivably add to the overall number of individuals gaining coverage. In political terms, it allows lawmakers to recite Obama's pledge delivered before the American Medical Association in 2009. ""If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period,"" he said. ""If you like your health-care plan, you'll be able to keep your health-care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what."""

At least, you’ve heard it if you’ve been following right-wing news sources such as Fox News, which is alive to the irony that so many physicians in “deep-blue California are rebelling against the state’s Obamacare health insurance exchange and won’t participate.”

Like every other mention of this statistic, the Fox story hangs it on Dr. Richard Thorp, a rural internist who is president of the California Medical Assn.

In the news business, this yarn would be classified as “interesting, if true.” But there are a few problems with it, starting with: It’s not true.

Advertisement

In fact, according to Covered California, the only source with verifiable numbers, some 58,000 doctors, or more than 80% of the state’s practicing physicians, will be available to enrollees in the exchange’s health plans.

The “boycott” claim originated with Richard Pollock, a reporter at the conservative Washington Examiner, whose piece doesn’t appear to reflect how the California exchange actually works.

“That article was wrong,” says Molly Weedn, spokeswoman for the CMA. “We have no idea how many doctors are participating. We don’t collect that data.”

In fact, Pollock’s sourcing for the data in his original article, which appeared Dec. 6, is highly questionable, if not flat-out worthless. Pollock revised his story on Tuesday after he got called on it by the CMA. He now says there’s no organized boycott. But he’s still seems to have the story wrong.

Covered California says that the doctors participating in its exchange plans include 100% of Kaiser Permanente’s 14,000 California doctors, 43,000 taking HealthNet patients and 35,000 in Blue Shield’s network. (There’s probably some overlap between the latter two networks.)

Although all Kaiser doctors will be available to all Kaiser enrollees, not all the doctors in other insurance networks will be available to all those insurers’ enrollees; there are reports that some may see patients only in non-exchange plans.

The narrowing of physician networks has long been a fact of life in American healthcare and didn’t originate with the Affordable Care Act. It’s a cost-saving trend and in some respects it makes sense: Insurers make reimbursement deals with doctors, and physicians who don’t want to accept the proffered deals won’t see that company’s customers.

Judging from his original article, Pollock seems to think that Covered California somehow imposed a standard reimbursement rate on all the state’s doctors, or perhaps that insurers in the exchange pegged all reimbursements to the state’s low Medicaid reimbursement rate. Neither is true. Insurers made their own deals with doctors, and it’s unlikely that they were pegged to Medicaid (known in California as Medi-Cal). It’s possible that some were pegged to Medicare, which pays more than Medicaid, but plainly there wasn’t a one-size-fits-all reimbursement figure for all insurers and all plans.

As for Pollock’s 70% nonparticipation figure, he says he arrived at it after talking to “a half-dozen” independent insurance brokers and agents across the state. He told me their estimates were consistent.

The problem is that insurance agents have no way of estimating physician participation across the state; they’re typically small businesses that tend to operate locally; they can check for a client to see if a particular doctor or group is participating in a plan, but they don’t have access to a statewide database. They can concoct an estimate from what they see, but they’re dealing with a specialized clientele and their vision is more likely to be myopic than Lasik-clear.

The CMA says Pollock offered his estimate of 70% nonparticipation to Thorp, the CMA president, who responded that it “wouldn’t surprise” him.

That was an error on Thorp’s part; since his own organization doesn’t have its own estimate, he should have kept his mouth shut. But it’s the Washington Examiner that erected its big alarmist story on the basis of this tiny little foundation, and it’s the anti-Obamacare right-wing noise machine that pumped it up to the volume of a shriek.

As for the very idea of an organized “boycott,” Pollock’s latest article states that “California’s budding doctor rebellion against Obamacare appears to be genuinely spontaneous, lacking leadership from a single individual or organization.”

This is known as taking a quarter-step back when a full step is required. What he should say isn’t that “California’s budding doctor rebellion” is “spontaneous,” but that it’s spurious. It exists in the mind of the Washington Examiner and has spread, like an epidemic, to a bunch of other susceptible patients in the news world. It should never have started, and it’s high time it was eradicated."

Bill now awaits House approval

The state has 16 licensed abortion clinics

Texas and other states are trying to implement new abortion limits

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The North Carolina Senate gave its final approval Wednesday to legislation adding new restrictions for abortions in North Carolina, even as hundreds of angry protesters descended on the legislature to express their displeasure.

The Senate voted 29-12 for the measure that would direct state health regulators to change abortion clinic rules so they're similar to those for ambulatory surgery centers.

More than 500 opponents of the legislation — mostly women and many wearing pink — organized quickly to gather at the Legislative Building after Senate GOP leaders late Tuesday added several abortion-related provisions to an unrelated bill and won quick approval in a committee and in an initial Senate vote.

Even Republican Gov. Pat McCrory criticized the rushed legislative process in a statement Wednesday but was silent on the contents of the bill, which would still need House approval again before it goes to his desk. The General Assembly won't take up legislation again until early next week.

""Regardless of what party is in charge or what important issue is being discussed, the process must be appropriate and thorough,"" McCrory, who was elected last year, said. When McCrory was asked last fall during a debate which additional abortion restrictions he would agree to sign into law, he responded, ""None.""

More than 100 protesters in the atrium outside the full gallery above the Senate floor chanted ""Shame!"" after Wednesday's vote. One woman was arrested by General Assembly police after yelling ""Shame on you!"" before the daily session ended. Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, who presided over the nearly two-hour debate, warned the crowd several times about their debate outbursts before clearing the gallery before adjournment.

The bill, which received initial approval Tuesday night, could force abortion clinics to close and would effectively limit the rights of women to obtain an abortion in the state, according to its opponents. There are 16 licensed abortion clinics in the state but only one ambulatory surgical center that performs the procedure, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

""If they can restrict access to abortion, they can officially take away that right and it's really distressing,"" said Maria Lynn of Chapel Hill, a former nurse and one of the protesters.

The updated bill also would prohibit gender-selective abortions, restrict abortion insurance coverage and require a physician to be physically present during an entire surgical abortion and when a woman takes an abortion-inducing drug such as RU-486.

Social conservatives pushed the bill, and backers say it would make abortion procedures safer for women in the light of recent problems with some clinics, bringing them in line with other medical facilities.

Sen. Warren Daniel, R-Burke, who is shepherding the bill through the Senate, referred to the abortion doctor in Philadelphia convicted recently of killing live babies at a clinic that prosecutors labeled ""a house of horrors"" in pushing the bill. Another senator read a newspaper story about a Charlotte clinic that was forced to close briefly this spring after state officials determined staffers were improperly administering a drug to induce abortions.

The legislation comes as Republican-led legislatures in North Carolina and several other states — including Ohio and Texas — work to place new restrictions on abortion, in some cases effectively limiting their availability. The North Carolina General Assembly passed abortion restrictions in 2011, but some were struck down by a federal court.

Sen. Angela Bryant, D-Nash, equated the bill with ""enslavement and domination of me and my body and my uterus ... and my human and constitutional rights to health care."" But Senate leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham, said this bill does not attempt to overturn the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.

""We have an obligation to protect the health of the people — the women — that go to these clinics,"" Berger said. ""Anyone who is interested in having safe abortions in North Carolina has nothing to fear from this bill.""

The swift Senate action on the bill further energized abortions rights groups, many of which already have participated in weekly protests at the Legislative Building against Republican policies on health care, voting rights and other matters. The GOP took control of the legislature after the 2010 elections. Those protests, which have led to nearly 700 arrests, are expected to resume Monday with a focus on the abortion bill.

The Senate leadership knew ""they couldn't pass these sweeping restrictions by playing by the rules. It is shameful that they chose to stoop to these underhanded tactics,"" said Melissa Reed of Planned Parenthood Health Systems, which runs clinics that provide reproductive health care services, including abortions.

Senate Rules Chairman Tom Apodaca, R-Henderson, said Democrats had rammed their own legislation through the chamber for years, and more debate wouldn't have changed the outcome. But McCrory said in his statement the legislative procedure ""was not right then and it is not right now.""

Lalitree Darnielle of Durham, who stood outside the Senate gallery with 22-month-old son Roman in his stroller, came Wednesday because she said the public should have had more advance notice. ""For them to sneak something like this into a vote without public input is disingenuous,"" she said.

Abortion opponents praised the bill. ""We think it's a great victory for the unborn and for women,"" said Tami Fitzgerald with the North Carolina Values Coalition. ""Abortion clinics in North Carolina have problems ... this bill fixes some of those problems.""

As for whether the bill becoming law, Fitzgerald said she and allies ""would expect the governor to sign the bill.""

The bill may be tricky for House Speaker Thom Tillis, R-Mecklenburg, who is running for Democratic U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan's seat in 2014; his spokesman said he had no comment on the legislation Wednesday. The issue could become an issue in any primary race he has.

Hagan criticized the state Senate's move as ""shameful."" If legislative ""leaders think they can pull a fast one on women's health right before a holiday, they are wrong,"" Hagan tweeted. ""Women are watching.""

The bill also contains provisions that already passed the House. Those would outlaw or limit abortion-related services from health insurance plans offered through exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act or by cities and counties. Conscientious refusals to participate in an abortion would be expanded beyond doctors and nurses to any medical professional."

Democratic lawmakers blasted the proposal this week because it would force women to anticipate being raped, ThinkProgress reported.

""Forcing women to decide whether they want to buy 'rape insurance' and even compelling parents to make the unfathomable decision about whether to buy it for their daughters is truly despicable,"" State Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer (D) said Monday. ""Requiring Michigan women to plan ahead for an unplanned pregnancy is not only illogical, it’s one of the most misogynistic proposals I have ever seen in the Michigan Legislature.""

More than 80 percent of private insurance plans currently cover abortions, so the measure would have a broad effect.

Michigan lawmakers passed the same bill last year, but Governor Rick Snyder (R) vetoed it, saying he does not ""believe it is appropriate to tell a woman who becomes pregnant due to a rape that she needed to select elective insurance coverage.""

But anti-abortion activists were able to collect enough signatures on a petition this year to force a vote on the measure again. If the Republican-controlled legislature approves it, it will automatically become law, even if Snyder does not sign it. If lawmakers do not pass it, citizens will consider it as a ballot measure in 2014.

Right to Life Michigan gathered protesters this week who had been born as a result of rape and incest to speak out in support of the measure. ""We are people, we are not exceptions,"" Mary Rathke, a 34-year-old from Essexville whose birth mother was raped, told reporters.

The group's president, Barbara Listing, compared rape and incest to car accidents and floods earlier this year.

""It’s simply, like, nobody plans to have an accident in a car accident, nobody plans to have their homes flooded,"" Listing said. ""You have to buy extra insurance for those."""

The move is aimed at saving the city money and comes as the Emanuel administration has been trying to wrangle significant pension cost concessions from employee unions.

The details are in a letter the city plans to send to retirees this week.

Still getting health insurance: Police officers and firefighters who retired between the ages of 55 and 64 and are not yet eligible for Medicare but whose coverage is guaranteed under union contracts, as well as workers who retired before August 1989 and are protected by a legal settlement.

Cut out as of Jan. 1 will be the rest. That's when the city will begin a three-year phaseout of the coverage, according to the letter signed by Comptroller Amer Ahmad. During that period, premiums, deductibles and benefits could change, the letter states.

Once the phaseout is complete, those retired workers would have to pay for their own health insurance or get subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. The city-subsidized coverage is particularly important to retired workers who aren't yet eligible for Medicare, as opposed to those 65 or older who use the subsidies for Medicare supplemental insurance.

The guaranteed city health coverage was good through June 30, but the administration will continue the full subsidy until Jan. 1 to protect workers who already have budgeted their health care for 2013, Ahmad wrote in the letter.

Last year, the city spent nearly $109 million on health care for nearly 37,000 retired workers and their spouses and children who are part of the legal settlement, according to a report issued earlier this year by an Emanuel-appointed panel. Enrollment was expected to grow to more than 47,000 in the next 10 years, which would balloon costs to $541 million, the report states.

""The retirement healthcare system as it stands today is fiscally unsustainable, and we have a responsibility to ensure a secure financial path for Chicago taxpayers,"" Emanuel spokeswoman Kathleen Strand said in a statement after being asked about Ahmad's letter. ""But the mayor also wants to ensure that our retirees who served this city honorably have access to healthcare and the critical information they need to make informed decisions.""

Emanuel's decision comes as the city continues to wrangle with unions over how best to alter the city's four pension systems to avoid major financial havoc as pension-funding bills come due in the next few years. Taking away health care could give Emanuel leverage in those talks.

The four pension systems have about $20 billion in unfunded liabilities. That tab does not include an $805 million shortage in retiree health care funds, which ends up putting the pension funds that also pay a portion of the insurance costs in an even more precarious financial position.

Chicago Fraternal Order of Police First Vice President Bill Dougherty said the city's projections for future cost of health care are too high.

Dougherty called the mayor's plan ""a poor decision"" and suggested that it should in no way be linked to negotiations over pension changes.

""The mayor has shown that he likes to play games on different levels, and we're not interested in doing that,"" Dougherty said.

It's not clear what the pension funds will do about their obligation for retiree health care, said Clint Krislov, the attorney who filed the lawsuit in 1987.

Krislov said he was pleased that the city will continue to protect those who retired before Aug. 23, 1989, but he continues to study the potential effect of the changes on other workers. ""We needn't jump precipitously,"" he said.

The settlements in that long-ago legal matter, called the Korshak case, never resolved whether the city is required to subsidize retiree health care, and if so, for how long. Retired city workers could return to court to argue that any health care cutback impairs or diminishes their pension benefits in violation of the state constitution.

Henry Bayer, executive director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31, said the uncertainties of the Affordable Care Act and the state insurance exchanges they would create make the city's plan hard to assess.

""This uncertainty will cause anxiety and fear for tens of thousands of seniors who gave their working lives to public service — men and women whose retirement savings are already under attack in the name of 'pension reform.'"" Bayer said. ""Our union will be working to get answers to our many questions, to ensure the City Council closely oversees the administration's proposals, and to protect access to affordable health care for city retirees now and in the future.""

The leader of the conservative Republican opposition to President Obama’s healthcare overhaul, which triggered the government shutdown, freshman Texas Sen. Ted Cruz remained defiant. Cruz said he would keep focusing on Obamacare in the coming months, despite calls from the White House and members of both parties of Congress to take up issues such as immigration reform.

On two talk shows, Cruz did not rule out another push for a shutdown in January, when continued funding for the government would once again require congressional authorization. “I would do anything and I will continue to do anything I can to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare,” Cruz said on ABC’s “This Week.” “What I intend to do is continue standing with the American people to work to stop Obamacare, because it isn’t working, it’s costing people’s jobs, and it’s taking away their healthcare.”

Cruz interpreted the bottom-of-the-barrel poll ratings for Congress that came out last week as a sign that Americans wanted Congress to work harder to dismantle Obamacare, rather than as a repudiation of its priorities. He sharply criticized his fellow Senate Republicans for agreeing to end the shutdown.

“I think the House Republicans marched out on principle to say we’re listening to the people who are hurting because of “Obamacare.” And I wish that Senate Republicans had come in like the cavalry to support them,” Cruz said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Instead … they made a decision not just to not support the House Republicans, but to come in like an air force and dive-bomb them.”

Other, more senior Republican senators agreed with the need to halt healthcare reform. But they took issue with shutting down the government again in 2014 as a negotiating ploy. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the GOP would do “everything possible” to repeal the Affordable Care Act but said “everything” did not include another shutdown.

“A number of us were saying back in July that this strategy could not and would not work, and of course, it didn’t. So there’ll not be another government shutdown, you can count on that,” McConnell said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

McConnell declined to criticize Cruz, whose great popularity with the GOP’s conservative base has amplified his clout, despite his recent arrival on the national stage. But other GOP senators such as Lindsey Graham of South Carolina were more pointed about the impact of Cruz’s approach.

“I think the tactical choice that he embraced hurt our party,” Graham said on “Face the Nation.”

“After this debacle called ‘the shutdown,’ ... our brand name’s at the lowest ever. Obamacare actually got a bump in polling, and we got in the way of a disastrous rollout.”

Graham added: “The shutdown should be in our rearview mirror as Republicans [say], ‘Don’t do this again, Ted.’ ”"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/opinion/krugman-republican-health-care-panic.html,2013-07-26 00:00:00,['Paul Krugman'],Republican Health Care Panic - The New York Times,"Leading Republicans appear to be nerving themselves up for another round of attempted fiscal blackmail. With the end of the fiscal year looming, they aren’t offering the kinds of compromises that might produce a deal and avoid a government shutdown; instead, they’re drafting extremist legislation — bills that would, for example, cut clean-water grants by 83 percent — that has no chance of becoming law. Furthermore, they’re threatening, once again, to block any rise in the debt ceiling, a move that would damage the U.S. economy and possibly provoke a world financial crisis.

Yet even as Republican politicians seem ready to go on the offensive, there’s a palpable sense of anxiety, even despair, among conservative pundits and analysts. Better-informed people on the right seem, finally, to be facing up to a horrible truth: Health care reform, President Obama’s signature policy achievement, is probably going to work.

And the good news about Obamacare is, I’d argue, what’s driving the Republican Party’s intensified extremism. Successful health reform wouldn’t just be a victory for a president conservatives loathe, it would be an object demonstration of the falseness of right-wing ideology. So Republicans are being driven into a last, desperate effort to head this thing off at the pass.

Some background: Although you’d never know it from all the fulminations, with prominent Republicans routinely comparing Obamacare to slavery, the Affordable Care Act is based on three simple ideas. First, all Americans should have access to affordable insurance, even if they have pre-existing medical problems. Second, people should be induced or required to buy insurance even if they’re currently healthy, so that the risk pool remains reasonably favorable. Third, to prevent the insurance “mandate” from being too onerous, there should be subsidies to hold premiums down as a share of income."

Fifty-three percent of the uninsured disapprove of the law, the poll found, compared with 51 percent of those who have health coverage. A third of the uninsured say the law will help them personally, but about the same number think it will hurt them, with cost a leading concern.

The widespread skepticism, even among people who are supposed to benefit from the law, underscores the political challenge facing the Obama administration as it tries to persuade millions of Americans to enroll in coverage through new online marketplaces, a crucial element of making the new law financially viable for insurers.

There are several reasons the uninsured appear to be as wary of the law as the insured, including opposition to the requirement that most people have insurance. Still, nearly six in 10 uninsured said having insurance would make their own health better. And 56 percent said they were more likely than not to get insurance by March 31, the deadline to enroll in coverage or face a tax penalty under the law. Thirty-five percent said they were more likely to pay the penalty."

Smith told NBC News that she ""just instantly burst into tears"" when she was able yesterday to sign up for a $3.19 a month health insurance policy through Obamacare.

Smith described the low-cost of her federally-subsidized plan as ""totally mind-blowing"" and praised the Obamacare call center agent who assisted her sign-up as ""the most loveliest of helpers.""

Previously, the aging Smith had been uninsured. The company for which Smith is a medical transcriptionist does not offer coverage to its employees.

""They took a vote at the company and people wanted more money in their pockets,"" Smith was reported as saying. ""I have had four paycuts in one year.""

Smith's new, highly affordable Obamacare policy will cover her household, including her unemployed husband Eric, age 56.

Republicans who are praying for the failure of Obamacare do not want stories like the one told by JoAnn Smith to get out, but Smith's Obamacare success story bodes well for Democrats running for re-election in 2014.

Smith had been trying to sign up for health insurance for the past two months, but Obamacare's rocky rollout and website glitches had prevented her from doing so successfully.

Smith expressed continued shock that after months of difficulty, Obamacare's sign-up process is now working well enough that her application 'took seconds to complete' according to NBC. Smith now only has to confirm payment with her new insurer:

""I am kind of afraid to call them because I feel like it's a trick. I am afraid I will call and they will say 'JoAnn who?'""

Obamacare backers aim for the law to improve the quality of healthcare for Americans by:

Providing insurance federally through healthcare.gov

Providing insurance through state-based website exchanges

Providing coverage by increasing the availability of Medicaid

Eliminating insurance denials or extra charges based on gender or pre-existing health status

Eliminating junk insurance policies and instead setting national standard for high quality coverage

Those new national standards include requirements that policies always cover prescriptions, hospitalizations, and emergency room care. The standards have led insurers to cancel the junk policies of Americans whose previous insurance did not include these benefits, deemed essential by Obamacare, rather add the benefits to those plans.

Those cancellations combined with rollout glitches led to weeks of bad press for Obamacare. Success stories like that of JoAnn Smith might indicate that many Americans will instead find cheaper coverage through Obamacare, and that the health overhaul's worst days have passed."

Here are some of the key figures involved in the rollout of the federal health insurance exchange's online portal on October 1 and in addressing criticisms since that time. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA Obama has been on the defensive about his healthcare policy since October 1, when HealthCare.gov was switched on and crashed the same night, preventing people from going online to create accounts and enroll in health insurance. He has promised the website is just weeks away from a cure, and struggled to convince Americans he is on top of what has become a self-inflicted wound to the signature achievement of his presidency. While experts have been called in to fix technical glitches, a separate problem has emerged - Obama's pledge that people who are happy with their health plans would not have to change coverage because of the law. Obama said on October 30 that ""bad apple"" insurance companies, not his healthcare law, are to blame for hundreds of thousands of people losing their coverage in the past few weeks. Insurance companies say the law requires coverage beyond what many people choose to purchase. Obama has stood firm against Republican attempts to defund or delay the healthcare law - efforts that led to a 16-day government shutdown in early October. WHITE HOUSE ADVISER JEFFREY ZIENTS The administration announced on October 22 that Zients had been brought in to lead a ""tech surge"" aimed at repairing the website. Three days later, Zients promised that HealthCare.gov would be working smoothly for most users by the end of November, and said a ""general contractor"" would manage repairs - Quality Software Services Inc, a unit of UnitedHealth Group. Zients, a former official of the Office of Management and Budget, will become head of the National Economic Council in January. So his assignment as the website's Mr. Fix-It is intended to be temporary. Zients has 20 years of business experience as a chief executive, management consultant and entrepreneur. He helped the Obama administration figure out a solution for the ""cash for clunkers"" car exchange program's website, which crashed repeatedly when it opened early in Obama's first term. WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF DENIS MCDONOUGH McDonough took on a prominent behind-the-scenes role months ago in explaining how Obamacare would work after Democrat Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sounded the alarm in April about how few details were being shared with Congress. Baucus warned of a coming ""train wreck"" if the administration were to fail to enroll enough people for coverage. McDonough then began briefing Baucus every two weeks on healthcare, and chatting just as often with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY KATHLEEN SEBELIUS As the member of Obama's Cabinet in charge of implementing the Affordable Care Act, Sebelius is facing Republican calls to resign over Obamacare problems. The former Kansas governor has not resigned, but she has taken the blame for HealthCare.gov's troubled launch. She also told a House of Representatives hearing on October 30 that the administration did not have any reliable enrollment figures from the website. But a day later, administration papers released by a congressional committee showed that enrollment was very small in the first two days of the website's operation - with just 248 people signing up. CMS DIRECTOR MARILYN TAVENNER Tavenner, a former nurse, heads the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services and was in charge of setting up the online insurance exchanges. Two months before the administration turned on the website, Tavenner assured Congress that the work was on track. She got to apologize to Congress for HealthCare.gov before Sebelius. Sebelius testified that Tavenner made the decision to ask consumers to register on the website before browsing for price information, a step that has been blamed for bottlenecks on the site when it was first switched on. Tavenner has a lot of fans on Capitol Hill, including her fellow Virginian, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Republican. CMS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER MICHELLE SNYDER Snyder, a veteran CMS official, oversees daily operations at the agency, which has a staff of nearly 5,000. At the October 30 hearing, Sebelius mentioned Snyder when asked to name the person responsible for building the website. But Sebelius added: ""Michelle Snyder is not responsible for the debacle. Hold me accountable for the debacle. I'm responsible."" CHIEF U.S. TECHNOLOGY OFFICER TODD PARK Park, who previously ran multiple healthcare IT companies, was trotted out over the summer to talk up the launch of HealthCare.gov, but his direct role in the rollout is unclear. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa has asked Park and White House Chief Information Officer Steve VanRoekel to supply documents about their involvement in the website. Park is now part of the administration's ""tech surge"" to repair the healthcare website. WHITE HOUSE HEALTH ADVISER JEANNE LAMBREW Lambrew is a long-term confidante of Obama's on healthcare. An academic and health policy expert, she advised Obama during his first presidential campaign in 2008. She headed the Health and Human Services Office of Health Reform when the Obama administration was pushing its healthcare overhaul on Capitol Hill. In March 2011, she moved to the White House as deputy assistant to the president for health policy, a job in which she would oversee White House implementation of Obamacare. CMS DEPUTY CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER HENRY CHAO Chao was part of the CMS team of officials who interacted with contractors building the website. He was one of two officials whose names appeared on a government memo about security concerns dated four days before HealthCare.gov opened. The memo said the website was at ""high risk"" because of lack of testing. Chao said at an insurance industry meeting in March that he was ""pretty nervous"" about the exchanges being ready by October 1, adding, ""let's just make sure it's not a Third World experience."" HHS CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER BRYAN SIVAK Sivak joined the Department of Health and Human Services in July 2012 to help the agency harness the power of technology to improve healthcare. He has appeared numerous times at conferences about bringing the mentality of startup tech companies to the federal government. Sivak's name surfaced in documents released by Issa's committee October 29, showing he and another HHS employee brushed aside offers of help with the stuttering website from Amazon Web Services Inc. The papers showed an employee of Amazon Web Services emailed Sivak and another HHS official on October 7, saying, ""I hear there are some challenges with Healthcare.gov. Is there anything we can do to help?"" Sivak replied in an email the next day: ""I wish there was. I actually wish there was something I could do to help.""

GOP plans to hold Democrats accountable for health care promises

With midterm elections a year away%2C Democrats say GOP message won%27t resonate

Barrage provides Republicans a chance to coalesce after recent govt shutdown

Republicans are launching a new wave of attacks on congressional Democrats after President Obama pointed out that he's not the only one who promised Americans they could keep their insurance under Obamacare.

""And, by the way, I think it's very important for me to note that there are a whole bunch of folks up in Congress and others who made this statement,"" he said Thursday, adding that they shouldn't be blamed. ""It's not on them. It's on us.""

Within 48 hours, Republicans had scoured public releases, news articles and town hall transcripts to unearth pledges made by 60 Democratic House members and 27 Democratic senators, including Majority Leader Harry Reid (""If you like the health care you have, you can keep it"") and Health Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (""If you like a plan, you get to keep it"").

The GOP plans to hold them accountable for those promises, driving the message through November with the hope of gaining an edge in the midterm elections.

""The law is called Obamacare, but every House and Senate Democrat over the last four years has voted over and over again to ensure that the law would operate this way,"" Rory Cooper, communications director for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said Saturday. ""And while the president shoulders a lot of the blame, so do his Democratic counterparts in Congress.""

For their part, Democrats say the elections are still a year away and as long as the website is fixed and people have insurance they like by then, the GOP message just won't resonate.

""There's a great amount of hypocrisy here,"" Democratic National Committee spokesman Michael Czin said Saturday. ""Republicans were for a fix until the president was for a fix and now they're going right back to repeal the law, which poll after poll shows the American people want to work.""

In any case, the barrage provides Republicans with a chance to coalesce around something they all agree on — criticizing Obamacare — after being divided and taking a beating in the polls over the recent government shutdown.

In a blog post titled, ""What I meant to say was …,"" House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy cataloged statements from Democratic House members dating back to April 2009, including from DNC chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schlutz.

""Let me be clear: If you like your current plan, you'll be able to keep it,"" she said in July 2009, when opposition to reform was gathering steam in town halls across the country.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's staff, meanwhile, compiled quotes from Democratic senators.

Over at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Deputy Executive Director Matt Canter brushed aside the attacks, saying that Senate Democrats are working to fix the law while Republicans simply want to go back to the pre-Obamacare system, when insurers were allowed to refuse coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.

""While Democrats are working to make fixes to the law, every single Republican Senate candidate in the country wants to let insurance companies abuse consumers,"" he said. ""We're confident that the Republican proposals to discriminate against patients is going to be more of a political problem for them in an election."""

Like the Scarecrow, whoever came up with House Republicans’ plan to deal with Kathleen Sebelius on Wednesday didn’t have a brain.

It was their big chance to flambé the secretary of health and human services and the person who has overseen the disastrous launch of Obamacare. Instead, they wound up casting her as Judy Garland’s Dorothy.

“In ‘The Wizard of Oz,’ there is a great line,” Barton, one of the first Republican questioners, informed Sebelius, a former two-term governor of Kansas. “Dorothy at some point in the movie turns to her little dog, Toto, and says, ‘Toto, we’re not in Kansas anymore.’ Well, Madam Secretary, while you’re from Kansas, we’re not in Kansas anymore.”

Thus began several references, each more painful than the last, to Oz, Kansas, following the yellow brick road, pulling back the curtain, the wonderful things the Wizard does — and, for good measure, something about Chicken Little, although he did not appear in the 1939 classic.

And, sure enough, the Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee went after Sebelius like so many flying monkeys. But — spoiler alert! — the film doesn’t turn out well for Dorothy’s persecutors, and the hearing, likewise, didn’t turn out to be the humiliation for Sebelius that Republicans had in mind. Dorothy melted the Wicked Witch with a bucket of water; Sebelius doused her questioners with an unexpected and extended confession of responsibility.

“Access to HealthCare.gov has been a miserably frustrating experience for way too many Americans,” she said in her opening statement. “So let me say directly to these Americans: You deserve better. I apologize. I’m accountable to you for fixing these problems. And I’m committed to earning your confidence back by fixing the site.”

This was a sneaky and dastardly thing for her to do: sneaky, because it wasn’t in the advance testimony she gave the committee, and dastardly, because in today’s Washington, any acceptance of responsibility is so rare that the Republicans — who were counting on her evading and deflecting — were bound to be caught off-guard.

Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) seemed not to have heard the secretary’s apology. “You’re now blaming it on the contractors and saying it’s Verizon’s fault,” she said.

“Let me be clear. I’m not pointing fingers at Verizon,” Sebelius said. “We own the site.”

Blackburn pressed Sebelius to tell her who led the team overseeing the project, and when Sebelius provided it, Blackburn pounced. “Michelle Snyder is the one responsible for this debacle?”

“Michelle Snyder is not responsible for the debacle,” Sebelius said. “Hold me accountable for the debacle. I’m responsible.”

Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.) declined this offer. “The president is ultimately responsible for the rollout,” he declared.

“No, sir. We are responsible for the rollout,” Sebelius replied.

After more such back and forth, Harper insisted: “While I think it’s great that you’re a team player and taking responsibility, it is the president’s ultimate responsibility, correct?”

“You clearly — whatever,” Sebelius said, allowing herself a rare moment of exasperation. “Yes, he is the president. He is responsible for government programs.”

Otherwise, Sebelius, in a gray pinstriped jacket, her white hair well-coiffed and her fingernails manicured, was generally poised, keeping her voice measured even though Republican lawmakers took photos of her with their phones, and their staff members, lined up against a wall, laughed and applauded when their bosses scored points.

She bluntly refused their requests to fire one of her deputies (“I will not, sir”), to make enrollment voluntary for the first year (“No, sir”) and to hand over enrollment numbers (“No, sir”). She answered mildly even as a red-faced Rep. Billy Long (Mo.) and a furious Rep. Cory Gardner (Colo.) demanded that she drop her health-care coverage and join an Obamacare exchange (she pointed out that the law wouldn’t allow it). She did not respond to Blackburn’s contention that Obamacare had deprived people of having a health plan that is “a Ford, not a Ferrari” or a “red Solo cup and not a crystal stem.”

But many of her interrogators were unusually mild, probably disarmed by Sebelius’s self-criticism. “I told the president that we were ready to go. Clearly I was wrong,” she admitted. “No one ever imagined the volume of issues and problems that we’ve had.”

After 31 / 2 hours of Fords and Ferraris and “Wizard of Oz” references, Sebelius finally got to go home. But she had the power to do so all along: All she had to do was click her heels together three times and think, “There’s no place like the House.”

Time to go on offense, Mr. President.

The Affordable Care Act was designed to make sure all Americans had a certain level of insurance. But TPM has learned that USHealth Group is actively telling consumers that they don't need that minimum level. In fact, company representatives are telling people they'd be better off without it. And the company may be just one player in a larger industry trend, where companies see non-ACA compliant plans, like the so-called fixed benefit coverage marketed by USHealth Group, as a business opportunity. Health care industry analysts have long derided the kinds of non-insurance health care coverage products the company is selling as ""junk insurance."" ""They were not intended to be health insurance,"" Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Health Policy Institute at Georgetown University, told TPM, speaking about fixed benefit plans. ""They were intended to be what are called income replacement policies. ... But over the years, these things have kind of morphed. And for many people, unfortunately, mainly because they come with a cheaper sticker price, they are marketed as and treated as health insurance. Even though the coverage is really crappy."" USHealth Group's pitch is three-fold, according to accounts provided to TPM by Mortimer and another prospective customer. First, it says, it is a misconception that everyone needs ACA-compliant insurance. Second, USHealth Group plans are cheaper than ACA-compliant policies, even after customers pay the tax penalty for failing to comply with the ACA's individual mandate. Third, Obamacare is scary.

Democrats should not be panicking over the relatively tiny number of people losing their junk health insurance plans. They should be loudly and continuously beating up on the insurance companies using Obamacare to trick people into buying new ones. Case in point: USHealth Group What USHealth Group isn't telling would-be customers, what they are, is that these fixed benefit coverage plans, in which the company reimburses customers a fixed amount of money for medical services, don't comply with the law. These plans aren't outlawed by Obamacare, but they don't meet the requirements for coverage. That means that people buying them are just wasting their money, because they will also have to get real coverage and if they don't, they'll have to pay a penalty. They also won't have any coverage if they get sick. One of these kinds of plans, Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation said, is ""not health insurance, in the sense it's going to protect you in any way from going broke.""

Other, only slightly less dastardly, insurers are misleading their customers, canceling policies that otherwise would have been grandfathered in order to get people into new ones that they can charge more for, and not informing customers about their options on the exchanges. The president's administration fix would at least require insurers who do cancel plans to inform people of their options.

It's not too late for Democrats, including President Obama, to go on offense against the insurance companies that are making the roll-out of Obamacare that much more difficult. Obama has met Republicans partway with his ""fix"" for policy cancellations. Now's the time to say enough, and to start reminding people about what insurance companies do and why they made this law so necessary in the first place."

For openers, the botched roll-out of the ObamaCare state exchange in Hawaii has hurt Democratic Gov. Neil Abercrombie's approval ratings: 51 percent of likely Democratic primary voters say they don't like the way he's doing his job.

Already out of a job is Coral Andrews, the executive director of Hawaii's state-run exchange. She submitted her resignation effective December 6 after only 257 people had signed up for health care a month into the roll out.

Hawaii's website contract was awarded to the same firm, CGI, that blew the national Healthcare.gov roll out. CGI won the Hawaii contract even after the state senate president warned the state exchange director not to hire the firm. CGI apparently also had botched Hawaii's tax website, costing Hawaiians $50 million to fix.

Hawaii is not alone. Oregon's website never has worked, despite that state receiving more exchange grant money than any others, except California and New York.

Oregon applicants are forced to fill out a 19-page paper form but that, too, has been problematic. Despite assurances that coverage would take effect January 1, late this month applicants began receiving robo-calls in which a voice told the applicant, ""If you have not heard from us by December 23rd, it is unlikely your application can be processed for January 1st insurance coverage.""

Oregonian Harold Stanton received one of those calls and is no longer sure whether his health care insurance is effective come January 1.

""The governor should have been apprised of the situation. If he wasn't apprised of the situation, then shame on his aides, and if he was, then shame on him for not listening to his aides,"" he says.

The director of Oregon’s exchange is now on medical leave.

Maryland, home to presumed Democratic presidential contender Gov. Martin O'Malley, also had a bad roll out.

Its exchange director is now gone, but lingering animosities remain. Gubernatorial hopeful Attorney General Doug Gansler fired off an intra-party salvo when he said the roll out was akin to a ""Saturday Night Live skit."" The object of his wrath is lieutenant governor and gubernatorial front-runner Anthony Brown, who is also the chairman of the state panel on the health care roll out.

California has been touted as a state exchange success story. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi recently said of her state’s exchange, ""In Covered California, we're moving along (the) largest state in the union, rolling along in a very positive way on it.""

But what she did not say was that the state’s enrollment among Latinos has been weak.

Only five percent of enrollees are Latino, even though they make up more than half of California's uninsured.

In a conference call with reporters Monday, Pelosi said the ""transformational"" nature of ObamaCare, much like Social Security, means that the law will take time to work out.

She added, ""It's going to be a glorious thing."""

Davis Shared In Winning The Pulitzer Prize For Investigative Reporting In']",D.C. insurance commissioner fired a day after questioning Obamacare fix,"A day after he questioned President Obama’s decision to unwind a major tenet of the health-care law and said the nation’s capital might not go along, D.C. insurance commissioner William P. White was fired.

White was called into a meeting Friday afternoon with one of Mayor Vincent C. Gray’s (D) top deputies and told that the mayor “wants to go in a different direction,” White told The Washington Post on Saturday.

White said the mayoral deputy never said that he was being asked to leave because of his Thursday statement on health care. But he said the timing was hard to ignore. Roughly 24 hours later, White said, he was “basically being told, ‘Thanks, but no thanks.’ ”

White was one of the first insurance commissioners in the nation last week to push back against Obama’s attempt to smooth over part of the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act: millions of unexpected cancellations of insurance plans.

In persuading Congress to vote for the health-care overhaul, Obama had promised that Americans who liked their insurance plans would be able to keep them. When that turned out to not be the case, Obama apologized last week. And to stem growing bipartisan dissent, he announced Thursday that plans slated to be canceled next year to comply with the legislation could be extended for one year.

While the president’s plan sounded like a simple fix, it rattled the insurance industry, which had set prices for next year based on many of its products changing to comply with the health-care law. Allowing some plans to continue beyond Jan. 1 could also run afoul of provisions in laws passed by dozens of states and the District to implement the Affordable Care Act.

In a statement issued Thursday, White hinted strongly that he opposed the idea.

“The action today undercuts the purpose of the exchanges, including the District’s DC Health Link, by creating exceptions that make it more difficult for them to operate,” the statement said.

He also pointed to a statement issued by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that said the Obama order “threatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond.”

“We concur with that assessment,” White said Thursday.

White’s statement was removed from the department’s Web site sometime before Friday morning. Asked about the removal Friday, spokesman Michael Flagg said the department’s statement had changed.

“Our statement now is that we’re taking a close look at the implications of the president’s announcement on the District’s exchange and we will soon recommend a course of action after taking into consideration the positions of all the stakeholders,” Flagg wrote in an e-mail.

On Saturday, Flagg declined to comment on whether White had been fired, saying the department doesn’t comment on personnel issues.

A senior city official said White’s initial statement was sent to the mayoral communications director, Pedro Ribeiro, only minutes before it was issued publicly. It was not sent to Deputy Mayor Victor Hoskins, White’s immediate supervisor, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak about a personnel matter.

A formal statement critical of the president should have been closely vetted and approved by the mayor’s office, and White refused to acknowledge the misstep, the official said. White said Hoskins fired him Friday.

White said he thought he would have been derelict in his duties to not quickly make a statement on the president’s announcement.

“Everyone was looking for responses from the regulators. One of my chief concerns is always consistency and clarity in the marketplace — you can’t have something that big sitting out there without responding to it,” he said.

White had served as Gray’s commissioner for the D.C. Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking since February 2011. Prior to last week, his most high-profile and controversial role had been as chief of the department that took control of Chartered Health Plan, the city’s largest manager of health care for low-income residents, amid questions about “irregularities” in its finances.

Chartered was owned by businessman Jeffrey E. Thompson, who has been implicated in funding a $650,000 “shadow campaign” to elect Gray. White oversaw the successful sale of the insurer’s assets, and his department’s handling of the transition has been generally viewed positively.

White said he had known since he took the job that he served at the pleasure of the mayor. He said he was proud of his record and would have stayed.

On the president’s proposed health-care fix, he said: “I wasn’t saying I was against it, I also was saying I didn’t know enough to fully support it — I want to be clear, and I think it is, I was not speaking for Mayor Gray.”

Washington (CNN) - Only a minority of Americans are giving a thumbs up to the rollout of the Obamacare health care exchanges, according to a trio of new national polls.

Just 12% of people questioned in a CBS News poll released Tuesday say they think the process is going well, with nearly half saying it's not going well and nearly four in 10 saying they can't evaluate the signup process at HealthCare.gov.

The state level online exchanges, which opened for business on October 1, are intended to allow those without insurance to sign up for health care, and are a crucial part of the Affordable Care Act.

Less than three-in-10 surveyed in a Pew Research Center poll released on Monday say the online exchanges are working very well, with 46% saying they are not.

Besides the expected partisan divide, the poll also indicates a racial gap. Just 24% of white respondents, but 51% of black respondents say the exchanges are working well.

And the survey points to generational and income divides.

""Young people and those with annual household incomes of less than $30,000 are divided in their evaluations of the exchanges, while the assessments of older and more affluent Americans are more negative,"" says a release from Pew Research.

An ABC News/Washington Post poll suggests that major problems with the health care law's website may just be an appetizer.

Fifty-six percent of those questioned in the survey, which was released Monday, say the website failures are a sign of broader problems to come, with four in 10 saying they are an isolated incident.

More than eight in 10 Republicans see the website failures as part of a larger problem with the measure, while most Democrats describe it as an isolated incident.

President angry with rollout

The health care law, passed along party lines in 2010 when the Democrats controlled the Senate and the House, is considered President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement.

And the President vented Monday about the website rollout.

""Nobody's madder than me about the website not working as well as it should, which means it's going to get fixed,"" Obama said during an appearance the White House Rose Garden.

But he didn't specify exactly what went wrong or who was to blame for the problems, which include long waits to log onto the federally administered website and maddeningly long wait times once online.

There's ""no excuse for the problems,"" Obama added.

But he said tech industry experts were being brought in to help workers trying to fix the site.

The technical fiasco is fueling the GOP push to dismantle or defund Obamacare, and some Republicans are calling for the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.

In early September, barely half (51%) knew that exchanges were going to be available in their state; that has risen to nearly two-thirds (65%) today.

Website failures not affecting support for Obamacare

According to the ABC News/Washington Post poll, 46% of Americans support the law, edging up four points from last month. Forty-nine percent say they oppose the measure, down three points from September.

Forty-three percent of those questioned in the CBS News survey give Obamacare a thumbs up, a four point increase since September, with 51% saying they oppose the law, unchanged from last month.

The 42%-53% approval/disapproval rating for the measure in the Pew poll is basically unchanged from September.

A CNN/ORC International poll released Monday indicates that 41% say they favor the law, with 56% opposed to it. The 41% approval was up three points from last month, with the disapproval basically unchanged.

The CNN survey also indicates that 38% say they are against the law because they think it's too liberal, while 12% say it's not liberal enough. That means 53% either support Obamacare, or say it's not liberal enough.

The Pew survey suggests more Americans are becoming familiar with the exchanges. The percentage of people who know that the exchanges are available in their state rose from 51% early last month to nearly two thirds now."

Now they're busy flouting it.

The mandate that employers provide insurance next year or pay a penalty, as the law requires? Delayed for at least a year.

The law's dictate that people applying for federal subsidies to buy insurance provide proof that they're eligible for the government aid? Scaled back.

Sharp limits on Americans' out-of-pocket costs for health care? Suspended for a year.

Providing members of Congress and more than 10,000 staff members with federal health care subsidies that the law does not allow? Done, via a deal brokered by President Barack Obama.

And on and on.

The Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, is a hugely complex law that sets up online health insurance marketplaces, requires people to have coverage or pay penalties, and doles out subsidies and incentives to nearly everyone in health care. Doctors, hospitals and insurers have spent large sums to gear up for its requirements. Employers are mulling: Hire? Fire? Cut workers' hours?

Millions of Americans, that is, stand to gain or lose from how this law is enforced — with the Obama administration bending that enforcement in ways that test, and arguably exceed, the boundaries of lawful conduct.

Every time the White House undercuts one provision of Obamacare, there is a massive ripple effect on other provisions. It's generally a zero-sum game: When someone gains, someone else loses. Example: When employers are relieved of their mandate to provide insurance, taxpayers risk having to subsidize more of those companies' employees.

The administration asserts that it can make these changes under the president's broad executive authority. Yet critics make a compelling argument that the president is stretching the limits. Former federal appellate Judge Michael McConnell, director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, writes in The Wall Street Journal about a different sort of mandate: the mandate in Article II of the Constitution that the president ""'shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' This is a duty, not a discretionary power. ... As the Supreme Court wrote long ago (Kendall v. United States, 1838), allowing the president to refuse to enforce statutes 'would be clothing the president with a power to control the legislation of Congress, and paralyze the administration of justice.'""

Like most issues of presidential authority, this isn't cut and dried. Presidents do have broad discretion on how laws are enforced. But they're on shaky ground when they decide whether to enforce a law. It's not hard to understand why: Imagine the outcry if President Mitt Romney refused to enforce, say, Obamacare.

Granted, any president may decline to enforce statutes he believes are unconstitutional. But Obama is making no such claim here. Basically, he is admitting that parts of law are impossible to enforce on the deadlines imposed by Congress — deadlines he signed into law. He's also admitting he doesn't want to have Congress make these changes, for fear that if lawmakers get their mitts on this unpopular program, they would at least debate far more extensive changes than he'd like.

Congressional Democrats, and some Republicans, may agree with the numerous delays, changes and special favors. But the president invites chaos when he picks which parts of Obamacare to enforce, and which, in retrospect, he has decided are unworkable or unwise.

In a recent news conference, Obama acknowledged that congressional modification of the law is preferable to these White House fiats: ""In a normal political environment, it would have been easier for me to simply call up (House Speaker John Boehner) and say, 'You know what? This is a tweak that doesn't go to the essence of the law. ... Let's make a technical change of the law.' That would be the normal thing that I would prefer to do, but we're not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to, quote-unquote, 'Obamacare.'''

Tweaks? Obama isn't making tweaks. He's trying to circumvent major flaws that began flaring when the law was enacted. Hence the many carve-outs, delays and special deals that have been piling up since he added his signature to Obamacare on March 23, 2010.

The president crusaded for this law and has embraced its nickname. But he did not write the law. Congress did. Major changes are necessary — he has stipulated by his actions that this law as constituted cannot work — and Congress should legislate them for his review.

Bottom line: Let's delay and rewrite this ill-conceived law. Congress need not start from scratch. Lawmakers can build on what all of us have learned from three years of painful trial and error. Three years of attempting, but failing, to make this clumsy monstrosity work for the American people."

USA TODAY

Enrollment functions of site will be unavailable during off-peak hours this weekend

The website will remain open for general information

Federal and state health insurance websites experienced problems this week

The government website launched this week to sell health insurance was overwhelmed by up to five times as many users as it was designed to handle, President Obama's top technology adviser said Saturday in an exclusive interview with USA TODAY.

U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park said the government expected HealthCare.gov to draw 50,000 to 60,000 simultaneous users, but instead it has drawn as many as 250,000 at a time since it launched Oct. 1.

Park's comments are the administration's most detailed explanation for the glitches that have frustrated millions of consumers who have tried to enter the site or complete applications for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.

""These bugs were functions of volume,'' Park said. ""Take away the volume and it works.''

The administration built the site's capacity based partly on the all-time high of 30,000 simultaneous users for Medicare.gov, an existing site where senior citizens can buy or renew prescription-drug plans under Medicare Part D, Park said. Its theoretical maximum capacity hasn't been disclosed.

More than 8.1 million consumers visited the site from Tuesday through Friday, according to the White House. The administration hopes that as many as 7 million consumers eventually will sign up for health insurance through the government marketplace.

HealthCare.gov's enrollment functions are shut down at off-peak hours this weekend so technicians can make repairs to the site.

``We're obviously not satisfied with the performance,'' Park said. ``We're working 24-7.''

The site will be running better by early next week, he said, though he declined to make specific guarantees. The administration isn't yet prepared to say how many simultaneous users the upgraded site will be able to handle, he added.

The administration's explanation didn't impress a Bush administration official who helped launch Part D in 2006.

""Whoever thought it would draw 60,000 people wasn't reading the administration's press releases,'' said David Brailer, former national coordinator of health care information technology. ""The Medicare Part D site was supposed to have 20,000 simultaneous users and was (built for) 150,000, and that was back when computing was done on an abacus. It isn't that hard.''

The volume since Tuesday overwhelmed a specific component of software on the HealthCare.gov site that lets people create accounts, enabling them to shop for insurance plans available in their state, Park said.

The part of the site that explains generally how the new law will work, and gives broad information about the kinds of plans available, has worked throughout the troubled launch, he said.

The Affordable Care Act called for the Department of Health and Human Services to build an online exchange, or Internet store, to let uninsured consumers compare and buy plans offered by private insurance companies. The government will subsidize coverage for many working-class and middle-class families, while poorer citizens may be covered by the law's expansion of the existing Medicaid program for low-income families.

The exchange misfired almost immediately upon its launch.

Engineers quickly deployed software that referred visitors to an online waiting room, hoping that controlling the number of people trying to create accounts would ease pressure on the software, Park said. But serious performance issues have plagued the site all week, he said.

Park disputed a Reuters report that quoted non-government technology experts who theorized that the site's architecture inadvertently made it mimic a common method by which hackers attack websites to shut them down, forcing the software to misfire.

""That is not the driver of the bottleneck,'' he said.

The site is managed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Park said. It is hosted at a secure, privately owned cloud computing facility in Virginia. Outside experts this week had questioned whether the site was being run on cloud-based technology, whose flexibility usually lets website owners adjust quickly to spikes in traffic.

But the problem proved to be more complex than just adding more computer servers to manage the extra demand, he said.

A team working on the site is taking two other steps to fix the problem, Park said.

It is upgrading software that lets people create accounts to apply for insurance. One symptom of this has been malfunctioning pull-down menus that have worked only intermittently all week. And HealthCare.gov is moving one part of the site that processes applications from so-called virtual machine technology, which uses software to let a website securely share computer servers with other sites, to using servers dedicated exclusively to that process, he said.

That change will add extra computing power, complementing the software upgrade to make the registration process work more smoothly, he said.

The explanation is ""a little geekalicious,'' he said."

Up to 25%2C000 people can use the federal site at the same time

Only 27%2C000 people picked insurance on the site in its first month of operation

The site will be ready for the vast majority of users by Nov. 30%2C Zients says

WASHINGTON — The HealthCare.gov website, the federal exchange where Americans can shop for health insurance, went through its first week without outages and provided users with faster response times, President Obama's appointee to lead the fixes to the site said Friday.

""We had no problems this week,"" said Jeffrey Zients, whom Obama named to the fix the problems that have plagued the site since it opened Oct. 1. Along with the lack of outages, response time for more users dropped to less than one second, Zients said.

""This week, we've driven the error rate down to 1 percent,"" Zients said.

Volume at the site ""increased significantly,"" Zients said, but the site can only handle 20,000 to 25,000 people ""comfortably"" at the same time.

The website must be able to handle tens of thousands prospective insurance customers at the same time if they are to meet the Dec. 15 deadline to buy health insurance that starts on Jan. 1 or by March 31 to meet the deadline to avoid paying a penalty for not having health insurance.

On Wednesday, the Obama administration reported that slightly less than 27,000 people selected private insurance on the site between Oct. 1 and Nov. 2.

Repair technicians will spend the weekend increasing the site's capacity to enable more people to use it simultaneously, Zients said.

""The site has gotten better each week,"" Zients said. ""A lot of people are on the site and using the site and should continue to do so.""

Problems with the site have slowed the ability of many Americans who received notices that their individual market policies had been canceled to shop for alternatives. On Thursday, Obama said the Health and Human Services Department would allow people to keep those policies for another year if insurance companies and state insurance commissioners approved. The House voted Friday for a bill that would allow people to keep those policies, but Obama has threatened to veto it because it would undermine parts of the Affordable Care Act.

Zients said technicians this week completed 60 fixes on the software ""punch list"" of problems and there are another 50 more on the priority list for the weekend.

""In total, we have now crossed more than 200 bug fixes off our punch list,"" he said. He repeated a promise made by Obama and other White House officials that the site will be ""working smoothly for the vast majority of users"" by Nov. 30.

Julie Bataille, communications director for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said they have also begun contacting states with Medicaid eligibility information for people who have come through the federal site.

Bataille also said people who choose to buy an old insurance plan that does not meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act would qualify for the requirement to buy health insurance and would not have to pay a penalty."

http://news.yahoo.com/fed-judge-texas-abortion-limits-unconstitutional-190525066.html,,[],Fed judge: Texas abortion limits unconstitutional,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A federal judge determined Monday that new Texas abortion restrictions place an unconstitutional burden on women seeking to end a pregnancy, a ruling that keeps open dozens of abortion clinics across the state while officials appeal.

The ruling by District Judge Lee Yeakel came one day before key parts of the law the Legislature approved in July were set to take effect. Lawyers for Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers argued in their lawsuit that a provision requiring abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital less than 30 miles away would have effectively shuttered about a third of the state's 38 clinics that perform abortions.

Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, whose office argued the law protects women and the life of the fetus, immediately filed an appeal with the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.

""I have no doubt that this case is going all the way to the United States Supreme Court,"" Abbott said during stop in Brownsville, Texas, as part of his campaign to replace retiring Gov. Rick Perry.

Although several conservative states in recent months have approved broad abortion limits, the Texas ones were particularly divisive because of the number of clinics affected and the distance some women would have to travel to get an abortion.

Federal judges in Wisconsin, Kansas, Mississippi and Alabama also have found problems with state laws prohibiting doctors from conducting abortions if they don't have hospital admitting privileges.

All the other appeals — including the one from Mississippi, which like Texas is within the 5th Circuit — deal only with whether to lift a temporary injunction preventing the restriction from taking effect. The Texas appeal could be the first that directly addresses the question of whether the provision violates the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.

The admitting privileges provision ""does not bear a rational relationship to the legitimate right of the state in preserving and promoting fetal life or a woman's health and, in any event, places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion,"" Yeakel wrote.

Story continues

In another part of his ruling, Yeakel, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, partially blocked the provision requiring doctors to follow an 18-year-old U.S. Food and Drug Administration protocol. He found that the state could regulate how a doctor prescribes an abortion-inducing pill, but the law failed to allow for a doctor to adjust treatment in order to best protect the health of the woman taking it.

Abortion-rights supporters complained that requiring doctors to follow the FDA's original label for an abortion-inducing drug would deny women the benefit of recent advances in medical science.

Other portions of the law, known as House Bill 2, include a ban on abortions after 20 weeks and a requirement beginning in October 2014 that all abortions take place in a surgical facility. Neither of those sections was part of this lawsuit.

Amy Hagstrom Miller, president of Whole Woman's Health, said the judge did not go far enough.

""Nearly 40 percent of the women we serve at Whole Woman's Health choose medication abortion and now Texas is preventing these women from the advances in medical practice that other women across the United States will be able to access,"" she said.

The law requiring admitting privileges was the biggest obstacle facing abortion clinics in Texas, and the ruling gives them a temporary reprieve until new regulations go into effect next year.

Mississippi passed a similar law last year, which a federal judge also blocked pending a trial scheduled to begin in March. Mississippi's attorney general asked the 5th Circuit to lift the temporary injunction so the law could be enforced, but the judges have left it in place signaling they believe there is a legitimate constitutional question.

Unlike the Mississippi case, Yeakel's order is a final decision, setting the groundwork for the 5th Circuit to review the merits of the law, not just an injunction against it.

The proposed restrictions were among the toughest in the nation and gained notoriety when Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis launched a nearly 13-hour filibuster against them in June. She is now the only Democrat in the race for Texas governor.

Davis said the ruling didn't surprise her.

""As a mother, I would rather see our tax dollars spent on improving our kid's schools than defending this law,"" she said in a statement.

During the trial, officials for one chain of abortion clinics testified that they've tried to obtain admitting privileges for their doctors at 32 hospitals, but so far only 15 accepted applications and none have announced a decision. Many hospitals with religious affiliations will not allow abortion doctors to work there, while others fear protests if they provide privileges. Many have requirements that doctors live within a certain radius of the facility, or perform a minimum number of surgeries a year that must be performed in a hospital.

Beth Shapiro, chairwoman of board of directors of Lubbock's Planned Parenthood Women's Health Center, said no hospital in Lubbock has granted privileges to the lone doctor from East Texas who flies in to do abortions when there are procedures scheduled. There is not incentive for hospitals to do so, she said.

""I don't see why local hospitals would give privileges to someone who's not going to admit patients,"" Shapiro said. ""I don't see what the business and financial incentive would be.""

Whether the law ultimately accomplishes its aim of making the insurance markets nationwide more competitive — and plans more affordable — will only become clear over time. Experts expect some insurers to drop out after a year or so, while some other companies may decide to enter, depending on how the markets evolve. Insurers will have to figure out how to offer plans that most people can afford but still provide coverage to those with expensive medical conditions — and, for investor-owned plans, how to make a profit in the meantime.

“A rush to judgment will be just that,” said Dan Mendelson, the chief executive of Avalere Health, a consulting group. “It’s not going to be possible in 2014 to make a strong valid judgment of whether the exchanges are working or not.”

Insurers already active in the market are the most likely to show up on the exchanges. Blue Cross plans, for example, have already established relationships with local hospitals and physician groups, as well as state regulators. “We don’t have to recreate the wheel because the Blue plans are already there,” said Daniel J. Hilferty, the chief executive of Independence Blue Cross, a nonprofit headquartered in Philadelphia.

In California, Anthem Blue Cross, Health Net, Kaiser Permanente and Blue Shield of California will remain big players. Most likely to be missing from any given exchange are many of the national insurers, whose business is focused mainly on providing coverage to workers through their employers — companies liked UnitedHealth Group, Aetna and Cigna.

WellPoint, which operates Blue Cross plans in 14 states and is the nation’s largest provider of individual and small business policies, has little choice but to compete because many of its customers will be buying insurance on the exchanges.

But the other companies may delay entering any given exchange until they see a real chance to gain customers. Given the uncertainty over how well the exchanges will function, and whether enough healthy people will enroll, insurers are likely to enter only those markets where they already have a sizable number of existing customers."

This rebate came about because of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) that specifically forces health insurance companies to spend no more than 20 percent on expenses not attributable to health care. No longer are they allowed to take your premiums and convert it to profits for shareholders, salaries for executives, and the purchase of politicians.

The Republican Party has been successful in misinforming and lying about Obamacare. This is likely one of the most immoral actions giving that slowing implementation and in the case of many Republican governors not accepting full implementation, is tantamount to the murder of American citizens with the weapon of knowing neglect.

Yesterday morning MSNBC Chuck Todd assessed that the Obama Presidency using the Republican moniker of Obamacare for the Affordable Care Act, while cute, was stupid. Todd vastly underestimates the success of the Republicans in promoting that name so much so that most Americans immediately identify with the Obamacare as opposed to the Affordable Care Act.

Just before the elections in 2012 I interviewed two intelligent upwardly mobile middle-class women in Austin, Texas. When asked about the Affordable Care Act they were completely oblivious to it. When told it was Obamacare they immediately knew what I was talking about and said they did not know it by that name. Check out that video here. It is probative.

The Obama administration has done a poor job of promoting the Affordable Care Act. The media has failed to effectively call out the lies on the Republican side thus given these lies plausibility and mental metastases. There is a lot of good news in states where politicians have made the concerted effort to support its citizens.

As people get rebates from insurance overcharges, as exchanges open that afford individuals affordable rates, and as states that have the best interests of their citizens expand Medicaid, many will see the benefits of having a healthier, humane and moral health care system. It is incumbent upon those on the right side of history to not allow those who would put corporate interest and greed over humanity to go unpunished for the sabotage they have effected on the wellbeing of the poor and the working middle class."

He starts off with a lament that I think we don't express enough: That talking about the life-saving benefits for the uninsured seems to be an insignificant issue for too many Americans.



Normally, I would start this discussion by providing chapter-and-verse details about the 47 million men, women, and children who now have the opportunity to obtain health insurance, to live longer and healthier lives, to avoid needless bankruptcies. But, in what to me is one of the saddest developments in our nation’s history, that reality is irrelevant to ardent Obamacare opponents....These days, I have to start by answering the question “What’s in it for me?”

This is the fundamental issue that too many people do not understand. There seems to be this belief among some that those who are uninsured simply go off and die somewhere, thus having no impact on the medical-care-delivery system in the United States. But the opposite is true—the uninsured have some of the most dramatic effects of any group on our nation’s health-care system...In fact, the uninsured affect the finances, quality of care, and availability of medical assistance to every person in a community, regardless of their insurance status.

And answer he does. He begins with the clearest of points that too often is ignored: the uninsured get health care, whether they have insurance or not.Then, he presents the most amazing numbers I've seen in this debate: The PRECISE amount the uninsured are costing those with insurance. He begins with the national average (he gives for two years, I'll use the 2010 estimates.) That amount: $1,502. That is not the premium - that is the EXTRA premium that the insured are paying to compensate for the bills the uninsured are unable to pay.

Even more fun, the piece then shows that the highest amount in extra premium is being paid by, you guessed it, the states that are the biggest opponents of Obamacare:



It is the citizens of states most opposed to Obamacare and who are refusing expansions of Medicaid who are taking the biggest shellacking: Texas residents are paying $2,786 more in premiums for family policies provided through employers. Montana, $2,190. Alaska, $2,248. Idaho, $2,152. North Carolina, $1,828.

I've already started reciting those numbers to some friends who have bought into the Republican lies. Their only response is ""splutter.""

Then Eichenwald points out something I never knew. Those communities with the highest numbers of uninsured have the lowest quality of care, not just for the uninsured, but for the insured as well.



Follow the logic. Hospitals don’t have poverty wards; if a patient comes in the door in bad shape, they don’t do a wallet biopsy before deciding what care that person should receive—everyone at a hospital receives the same quality. But if a community has a higher number of uninsured, that means the latest and greatest technology and treatments will drive up the amounts of unreimbursed care. In essence, hospitals that provide the best, most modern, and most expensive treatments in an area with lots of uninsured will be forced to pass unsustainable amounts of cost to their prices. Insurance companies won’t pay it, local governments won’t finance it, and the hospitals will go out of business. The only option then? Don’t provide the top-quality care to anyone—insured or not.

Eichenwald then immediately acknowledges that people might not believe the logic, and so cites multiple studies proving he's right.

It is only after this lengthy description of medical economics that Eichenwald returns to the benefits to the uninsured.



With the “what’s in it for me” question regarding the benefits of covering the uninsured, now let’s go to the price they pay for being without health insurance. This one is as simple as screaming “death panels”: the uninsured die. As the Texas health-care task force reports: ""Overall, the uninsured receive less preventive care, are diagnosed at more advanced stages of disease, and once diagnosed, receive less therapeutic care than do the insured. Thus, lack of adequate insurance leads to premature death."" Hopefully, those words are easy enough for everyone to understand. If Republicans truly are dedicated to the sanctity of life, they should be the first ones on the front lines trying to get policies for the uninsured.

This is as much as I can quote and still stay within fair use. But it is a long, long article loaded with powerful facts, figures and arguments. Before you have another arguments with the deluded, just print it out and hand it to them. It was exhilarating to read!"

Republicans are back on offense, and more quickly than many had expected, after seeing their approval ratings plunge during last month's partial shutdown and worrisome talk of a possible U.S. debt default.

They pillory administration officials at Capitol Hill hearings. They cite the millions of people getting dropped by insurers despite President Barack Obama's promise that it wouldn't happen. They harp on the program's flawed enrollment process.

Now they're relishing Obama's apology to those who are losing health insurance plans he had repeatedly said they could keep.

""If the president is truly sorry for breaking his promises to the American people, he'll do more than just issue a halfhearted apology on TV,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement.

Republicans once pinned their health care criticisms largely on computer glitches in the application and enrollment process. Today, they're accusing Obama and congressional Democrats of much worse, including deceit and incompetence.

Conservative groups are pouring money into ad campaigns reminding voters that many Democrats had promised Americans they could keep their current insurance policies if they wanted. In particular, Republicans hope these efforts will help them with women, who tend to vote Democratic and often make health care decisions for their families and in-laws.

In the 2014 elections, ""this is going to be a big issue, and it's not going away,"" said Daniel Scarpinato of the National Republican Congressional Committee. ""Democrats who voted for Obamacare,"" he said, ""are pretty desperately running around with their hair on fire, trying to distance themselves, which they're not going to be able to do.""

The White House says canceled policies can be replaced with better coverage, sometimes at lower prices. What the administration doesn't emphasize is that better coverage often costs more, and those looking for new policies may not qualify for the tax subsidies available under the new law.

Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the GOP's top Senate campaign group, acknowledged that Republicans took a hit last month when an angry public blamed them for the 16-day partial government shutdown.

But now, he said, ""there's a spring in the step"" of party activists.

Potential congressional candidates ""who might have been 50-50 about running for office might be a little more inclined"" to plunge in, he said. Best of all, Dayspring said, the most vulnerable Democratic lawmakers have echoed Obama's now-disproven promises about insurance cancellations and ""most of them are on film doing it.""

The conservative group American Crossroads already is using such film clips against Democratic Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Kay Hagan of North Carolina, who face re-election next year. The group is paying to place the videos on Facebook and other sites.

Another conservative group, Americans for Prosperity, says it will spend $2 million in a new ad campaign tying Obama's health care law to Hagan and Landrieu.

Begich, Landrieu and Hagan were among the 16 Democratic senators who met with Obama on Wednesday, a day after two gubernatorial elections highlighted the party's struggles with the health issue. Half of New Jersey voters and 53 percent of Virginia voters said they oppose the president's health law. The two Democratic gubernatorial nominees won 11 percent and 14 percent of those voters, respectively.

Democrat Terry McAuliffe was elected in Virginia, while Republican Gov. Chris Christie cruised to re-election in New Jersey.

Several of the Democratic senators cited the program's malfunction website when they urged Obama to extend the enrollment deadline for people to sign up for health insurance.

Republicans must pick up six Senate seats next year to gain control for the first time in eight years. If they prevent Democrats from gaining 17 net House seats, they will sustain the GOP House majority they won in 2010.

Dayspring said the law's problems will help his party combat Democrats' claim that Republicans are engaged in a ""war on women"" on matters such as access to contraceptives. His campaign committee is targeting Hagan, Landrieu and other female Democrats with messages saying ""Obamacare could hurt hundreds of thousands of women,"" yet these Democratic lawmakers stand by the law.

Landrieu was among the first Democrats to propose legislation to let people keep their current health insurance policies even if they don't cover newly required areas such as hospitalization, laboratory services and prenatal care.

Landrieu said Louisiana voters won't buy the GOP's new attack lines against her and other Democratic women.

""If the Republican Party does not stop talking about a bill that is already passed, signed into law"" and promising ""that middle-class Americans and small businesses can for the first time get private insurance that they can afford and that they can count on, they will rue the day,"" she said.

Republicans also are making the ""Obamacare""-hurts-women argument in New Hampshire, where Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen faces re-election next year. Shaheen calls the claims absurd.

The Republican Party's basic position on health care, Shaheen said, ""opposes contraceptives for women and is unwilling to provide access to abortion even in cases of rape and incest.""

Now, she said, Republicans want people to believe ""that the great new preventive coverage that women are going to get under the new health care law is somehow not going to be good for women and families.""

""It's like being called ugly by a frog,"" Shaheen said.

Consumers, insurance companies and federal and state authorities are scrambling ahead of Monday, the last day people in nearly all states have to choose a health insurance plan that is guaranteed to be in place on Jan. 1.

Even after revamps of HealthCare.gov, the federal portal to health coverage in 36 states, and improvements to some state-run insurance exchanges, technological problems and a tight time frame pose major challenges to people looking for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Those include uninsured people and insured people whose policies expire Dec. 31, risking potentially costly gaps in their health benefits.

The coming days could strain the insurance exchanges, rendering a stark verdict on whether the Obama administration's weeks-long effort to fix HealthCare.gov was enough to handle an expected surge in people trying to get a health plan, while working through backlogs of pending applications. Failure would mean more than frustration for people trying to get covered, as those who fall through the cracks will be at risk of huge medical expenses if they become ill or injured in 2014.

The risks of failure were clearly evident Friday, when HealthCare.gov was inoperable, the Wall Street Journal reported.

After more than two months of frustrating struggles with HealthCare.gov and the federal exchange's telephone customer service system, Sharon Van Daele, a retiree in Tucson, Ariz., feels tantalizingly close to the finish line and intends to cross it by this weekend.

""I'm trying desperately to get this resolved before the 23rd,"" said Van Daele, 64. ""It's been a long and difficult road. I started this on Oct. 4,"" she said. Van Daele's application was held up by a litany of problems that no one could help with, until she used the option made available this month to delete an application and start over, which she did last week.

""It was smooth -- very smooth. When I started in early October, it was horrible,"" said Van Daele, a cancer survivor. She's currently enrolled in a temporary Obamacare program for people who can't get private coverage, the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, which expires next month. Van Daele thinks she can get a comparable policy for about $250 a month, including the tax credits she will receive. ""Now I'm seeing a light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said.

If she's able to complete the process in time, Van Daele will follow a rapidly growing number of people who've used the insurance exchanges to sign up for coverage in recent weeks.

Although nationwide enrollment in private coverage through the exchanges has a long way to go toward the 7 million people the Congressional Budget Office initially projected would enroll by the end of the sign-up period on March 31, the pace has picked up, and the share of enrollments threatened by faulty data delivered to insurance companies appears to be shrinking.

Through the end of November, nearly 365,000 people enrolled in private insurance via the exchanges, and more than 800,000 were deemed eligible for Medicaid, the Department of Health and Human Services announced last week. And Obama announced on Friday that half a million people have signed up in December alone, suggesting the pace of signups has accelerated.

In some state-run health insurance marketplaces, new figures could portend a big uptick by the end of the year. Enrollments into private insurance via Covered California sped up to more than 17,000 a day this week, and more than 50,000 people signed up from Monday to Wednesday. The jump brings Covered California's total enrollment above 200,000 since October, the exchange announced Thursday. New York, Kentucky, Connecticut and other states reported similar increases.

Ahead of the Dec. 23 deadline, the federal government and several state exchanges have taken steps to ease the messy transition into 2014, as has the insurance industry.

The federal government has increased staffing at its call centers to more than 12,000 people, and is reaching out directly to consumers who haven't completed their applications, senior administration officials told reporters Thursday. The insurance exchanges in California, Connecticut, Kentucky, New York and Washington state have taken similar measures, executives said during a conference call with reporters hosted by the advocacy group Families USA on Wednesday.

On Thursday, the administration revealed that individuals whose policies were canceled because they don't meet the Affordable Care Act's standards won't be subject to the law's individual mandate, and will be allowed to buy bare-bones catastrophic plans originally intended for people younger than 30 or those who demonstrated financial hardship. Senior administration officials estimated this option will apply to fewer than 500,000 people.

""If people are trying to get coverage by Jan. 1, have a policy that's running out and need that coverage, we are committed to getting them through the system,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on HuffPost Live Thursday.

Insurance companies like Health Care Service Corp., a Chicago-based company that operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in five states, and Bloomfield, Conn.-based Cigna also have geared up for the pre-holiday rush by bolstering their customer service and sales teams, according to spokespeople for the companies.

""We've staffed up for it. We know that there's a crunch,"" said Lisa Rubino, the executive at Long Beach, Calif.-based Molina Healthcare who oversees its exchange business in nine states. ""There's a lot of folks looking to enroll,"" she said.

Concerns linger, however, about the federal exchanges' ability to provide insurers with accurate data about their new customers, which would jeopardize people's enrollments. And the situation in several states, such as Oregon, Maryland and Hawaii, is considerably shakier.

""We are aware of the fact that we are going to have to struggle with folks who went through the Cover Oregon process but somehow did not get to us in a timely manner,"" said Dawn Bonder, CEO of Health Republic Insurance of Oregon, based in Lake Oswego. ""What we've been encouraging folks to do is, you can buy our plan directly through our website, and put your application into Cover Oregon immediately,"" she said.

In spite of indications that enrollment is rising, and stories of failures-turned-potential-successes like Sharon Van Daele, other consumers continue to struggle with the balky system.

Alan Wells of Bluff City, Tenn., was eager to get into the exchanges and tried to start the process in October. But the 61-year-old retired information technology professional is still stuck. ""I kind of gave up,"" Wells said.

Wells is looking to replace the COBRA plan he's had since his involuntary retirement, which costs $340 a month. Wells' only income is Social Security, so he expects the law's tax credits would save him money. But he's been stymied at every turn, including his most recent attempt on Thursday. ""I'm going to try it periodically,"" Wells said. ""When it works, it will work.""

She denounced ads that use cartoon characters to push junk food. She bluntly told executives “to step it up” to improve the foods they market to children.

And she promoted a White House “action plan” on obesity that praised a federal effort to come up with voluntary marketing guidelines — the most significant attempt in decades to limit ads targeting children.

But when food and media companies — including many that supported her anti-obesity campaign — mounted a fierce lobbying battle against the guidelines in 2011, the first lady went silent.

It wasn’t until earlier this year, after the guidelines had been blocked, that Obama resumed her call for more responsible food marketing.

Nutrition advocates disagree over how to rein in food and beverage company practices that they believe contribute to obesity, including the roughly $1.8 billion spent each year on marketing to kids: Will companies respond to voluntary efforts or only to government pressure?

Obama has come down on the side of persuasion. She has used her celebrity to reward corporations that join her campaign to encourage children to eat better and exercise more. And she has largely avoided public policy fights that could pit her against the companies, arguing that obesity cannot be eradicated “by passing a bunch of laws in Washington.”

Administration officials say she has notched some notable successes, and they blame Congress for killing the marketing guidelines.

But some who see themselves as Obama’s allies in the fight against obesity believe her desire to create partnerships with industry kept her quiet when her voice would have counted most. Fourteen companies that back Obama’s anti-obesity campaign helped kill the voluntary advertising guidelines, lobbying reports and other records show.

“The White House got cold feet,” said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), who had championed the guidelines. “It sort of undermines everything that the first lady was doing.”

Since Obama launched “Let’s Move!” in February 2010, White House officials have insisted that working with industry is the only way to achieve the first lady’s goal of ending the epidemic of childhood obesity in a generation.

“Business and business leaders are a vital component of the solution,” said Sam Kass, the executive director of Let’s Move! and the first lady’s senior policy advisor on nutrition. Obama declined a request for an interview.

The administration did secure industry backing for a requirement that restaurant menus list calorie information. And the first lady rallied support for a 2010 law that expanded the free school lunch program and set nutritional standards for food sold in schools.

But many public health advocates believe a more forceful approach is needed to limit food marketing.

“The industry has proven itself untrustworthy,” said Kelly D. Brownell of Duke University, a leading expert on obesity who has sometimes advised Obama’s program. “Somebody needs to lean on these companies more strongly.”

Obama has worked through the Partnership for a Healthier America; she is honorary chairwoman of the nonprofit group, which was set up to negotiate pledges from food providers to fight childhood obesity.

Wal-Mart has agreed to promote more healthful foods and build grocery stores in underserved neighborhoods. Darden, owner of the Olive Garden and other restaurants, promised to improve its children’s menus. And 16 food and beverage manufacturers, including Kraft, General Mills and Nestle, pledged to cut calories from their products.

The organization, however, has secured only a few pledges to change the way companies market food.

As she stepped up her campaign, the first lady had forcefully urged companies to limit advertising to kids.

“What does it mean when so many parents are finding that their best efforts are undermined by an avalanche of advertisements aimed at their kids?” she asked in a speech to the Grocery Manufacturers Assn. in March 2010. “And what are these ads teaching kids about food and nutrition ... that it’s OK to eat unhealthy foods because they’re endorsed by the cartoon characters our children love and the celebrities our teenagers look up to?”

Public health advocates thought Obama would lead a change in how products were marketed to children. As far back as 2005, a report by the prestigious Institute of Medicine had found that television advertising influenced children, even toddlers, to seek out foods high in sugar, salt and fat, making the issue a central one for nutrition advocates.

“This is one of the easiest areas where we could take action and have a very powerful effect,” said Dale Kunkel, a University of Arizona communications professor who studies the effect of advertising on children.

In 2009, Congress approved a Harkin-sponsored measure to set up an interagency working group to write voluntary nutrition standards for products advertised to children.

The White House monitored the group’s progress, said Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a brother of then-Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and a physician who helped develop the Let’s Move! campaign. “A number of us at the White House were obviously interested in this,” he said.

So were the food and media industries. General Mills Chief Executive Kendall J. Powell met with White House officials, including senior advisor Valerie Jarrett. In a letter to the White House in September 2010, he argued that no evidence linked obesity to ads.

Powell suggested the working group should “be put on hold” while food companies improved the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative, a self-regulatory effort they set up in 2006.

The working group released draft guidelines in April 2011, acknowledging that its voluntary standards were ambitious: Foods advertised to children should have minimal levels of sugar, salt and fat, and make a “meaningful contribution” to diets by containing nutrients, they said.

The group proposed that its standards apply to all ads aimed at children 17 and younger. “A large percentage” of products advertised to children would not meet the guidelines, the panel noted, suggesting the standards be phased in over at least five years.

Public health groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics embraced the guidelines, but food manufacturers, media companies and trade associations mounted a furious pushback.

“This was just such a dramatic overreach,” said Louis Finkel, the top lobbyist for the Grocery Manufacturers Assn. “There would have been thousands of products swept into this.”

Top food and media corporations hired the firm of former White House communications director Anita Dunn to develop a public relations campaign. Dunn said she did not contact the White House on the issue, noting that federal ethics rules barred her from such communications at the time. About 30 companies flooded Capitol Hill with lobbyists, spending four times as much in 2011 as they had the year before.

“It was probably the most opposition I’ve ever seen mounted against any nutrition policy I’ve worked on in 20 years,” said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group pushing for the guidelines.

::

The lobbying included a July 2011 meeting at the White House, again with Jarrett, which included General Mills’ Powell and top executives from Nestle, Kellogg, Disney, Time Warner and Viacom, the parent company of the Nickelodeon network. The companies all supported the first lady’s anti-obesity initiative.

Jarrett declined to comment. A General Mills spokeswoman said Powell did not discuss the company’s participation in Obama’s effort at the meetings.

Two days later, top food manufacturers rolled out a more rigorous version of their self-regulatory effort. The companies pledged to follow a single nutrition standard that limits the levels of sugar, salt and fat in products targeted at children.

The group, which now comprises 17 companies, gave itself until the end of this year to make the changes.

Elaine Kolish, a former Federal Trade Commission official who directs the effort, said about one-third of the products those companies market to children have to be reformulated. “They’re on track,” she said.

The industry’s actions could significantly improve the nutritional value of food marketed to children, but still allows many products to be fortified with vitamins, rather than use ingredients that naturally provide nutrients, experts said.

It also does not limit appeals in sponsorships of after-school events or on product packages, as the working group guidelines had proposed. And it applies only to foods advertised on programs for which at least 35% of viewers are under 12.

A study by Yale University’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity found that half the food and drink ads seen by children in 2011 were not covered by the pledge because they aired on shows with broader demographics, such as “Family Guy.”

A week after the chief executives’ July 2011 meeting with Jarrett, their chief lobbyists were invited to the White House to attend an event with the first lady, who announced a commitment from Wal-Mart and other companies to open new stores in neighborhoods that lack full-scale grocers, so-called food deserts.

Obama promoted Nickelodeon’s “Worldwide Day of Play” that September at an event hosted by the network. Nickelodeon — which licenses SpongeBob SquarePants to market Popsicles — in 2011 aired a quarter of food ads viewed by children ages 2 to 11, according to the Yale Rudd Center. The network recently rebuffed a request by four Democratic senators to set stricter nutrition standards for the products advertised.

In November 2011, Obama spoke at the inaugural summit of the Partnership for a Healthier America, praising food manufacturers for cutting sugar, salt and fat from their products. She did not mention marketing.

“The first lady was completely disengaged,” said Wootan, who has advised the Partnership. “It was disappointing.”

The working group proposed concessions to industry, but in December the guidelines were effectively killed when Congress required a cost-benefit analysis that officials said was too onerous to perform.

Harkin said he tried to rally administration support. “It was always, ‘We’re looking at it, we’ll see what we can do. The industry, you know, is working with us, and they have their own little deal that they came up with,’” the senator said. “It became clear to me that they just weren’t going to do it.”

::

Dr. William Dietz, a member of the working group who recently retired as head of the nutrition division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said he believed the White House stayed out of the fight for political reasons.

“The whole work of the interagency working group was going on at the same time that the Partnership for a Healthier America was building relationships with industry,” he said. “I suspect those two things were a bit at odds with one another.”

White House officials pointed the finger at lawmakers. “We were very disappointed when Congress granted the food industry’s request and placed new demands on the working group,” Kass said.

Still, the first lady has continued to share the stage with companies that worked to kill the guidelines.

Last year, she appeared with Walt Disney Co.'s CEO and teamed up with Nickelodeon for an event at the Olympics.

This February, she promoted a new effort to increase exercise in schools, an initiative backed in part by $10 million from the General Mills Foundation. The company makes some of the cereals most heavily advertised to children, including Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Lucky Charms, as well as gummy snacks branded with the preschool character Dora the Explorer.

At a summit in March, Obama returned to her tough talk on ads that target children. “Our kids are surrounded by food advertisements on TV and the Internet, on billboards and in stores, and even in their schools,” she said.

With leaders of major food, beverage and media companies in the audience, Obama didn’t single out any for criticism. But she did praise by name those that had “stepped up to set new standards for responsible marketing.”

“While we’re seeing some progress,” the first lady said, “we know that we still have a lot of work to do.”

As expected, the bill to continue existing levels of federal spending through Nov. 15 passed, 54-44, along party lines. Before that, the Senate voted, 54-44, to remove the measure that would have eliminated funding for the Affordable Care Act.

The key vote came more than an hour earlier. Twenty-five Senate Republicans joined with the Democratic majority, voting, 79-19, to end a filibuster on the bill. The motion required 60 votes to pass.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) had argued that a vote against the motion represented a final opportunity kill the healthcare law. Only 18 of the chamber’s 45 other Republicans joined him.

In a final floor speech before that vote, Cruz all but conceded defeat, acknowledging “Republican division on this issue.” But he insisted that the fight against Obamacare, as the legislation is commonly known, wasn’t over.

Noting that the House will send the bill back, he said, “I very much hope the next time this issue’s before this body in a few days, that all 46 Republicans are united against Obamacare and standing with the American people, that we listen to the American people the way Senate Democrats are not.”

Several of the House’s more conservative members joined Cruz on the Senate floor during the vote. Cruz has met this week with House Republicans to plot strategy ahead of House consideration of the Senate’s version of the spending bill.

The House will be in session this weekend for possible votes on the spending bill. If lawmakers there were to vote simply to approve the Senate version, a government shutdown would be averted with days to spare.

But Republican leadership there is under pressure to add new provisions that would undermine the healthcare law -- perhaps to repeal a tax on medical devices or pass a one-year delay of the requirement that individuals have health insurance -- and might have a chance of being passed in the Senate.

House GOP leaders have not yet indicated how they will respond to the Senate action after earlier strategies unraveled, and no immediate action on the spending measure was scheduled for Friday.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) assembled his leadership team Friday morning to consider alternatives that will be presented to lawmakers on Saturday.

“We’re reviewing our options,” Boehner’s spokesman said.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said the House should simply pass the Senate bill.

“They can’t even negotiate with themselves,” she told reporters. “What they say in the morning doesn’t exist in the evening.”

If Congress fails to settle on a plan by midnight Monday, the federal government will see its first shutdown in nearly two decades.

Republicans who lined up against Cruz’s strategy explained that they were simply voting to move forward on a budget measure they supported. “I don’t understand how I can otherwise vote on a matter that I want to see passed,” said Sen. John Cornyn, the chamber’s No. 2 Republican and Cruz’s Texas colleague.

“There are some people across America that are so upset with Obamacare -- and I understand their frustration -- that say we ought to shut down the federal government,” Cornyn said. “It won’t work.”

Furthermore, those Republicans also said acting quickly to return the bill to the House served the cause of undermining the law, because the GOP majority there would have time to attach amendments putting curbs on Obama’s landmark healthcare legislation that might win approval in the Senate.

Cruz, in a more than 21-hour filibuster-like speech, interviews and more floor speeches, had insisted that the vote to move ahead on the bill was tantamount to a vote to sustain the healthcare law. If Republicans were united, he argued, the onus would be on Democrats to choose between the unpopular law and a government shutdown.

In an email sent Friday to supporters, Obama said the economy was being put at risk by “a group of far-right Republicans in Congress.”

“They refuse to pass a budget unless I let them sabotage Obamacare, something they know is not going to happen. Now, we’re left with only four days before a government shutdown,” he wrote. “This is reckless and irresponsible. Republicans are not focused on what’s best for you. They’re playing political games.”

The GOP’s divisions over Cruz’s strategy have largely played out behind closed doors, but they spilled into the open Thursday during a rare intraparty debate on the Senate floor. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said Cruz and his conservative ally, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, were more interested in generating publicity for themselves than supporting an effort to quickly send the bill back to the House.

On Friday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said the battle is “very dysfunctional.”

“We are dividing the Republican Party,” he said in an interview on CBS’ “This Morning.” “Rather than attacking Democrats and maybe trying to persuade those five or six Democrats who are in states that are leaning Republican, we are now launching attacks against Republicans funded by commercials that Senator Lee and Senator Cruz appear in.”

Jan Brewer, Obamacare Foe","FILE - In this Jan. 10, 2013 photo, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, R, speaks from her office at the Capitol in Phoenix. Brewer will give the State of the State address on Monday, Jan. 14, 2013. Democrats will be looking for ways to try to influence spending and can point to a $1 billion surplus in the current budget. Brewer and Republicans who face expiration of a temporary sales tax and lower revenue due to new tax breaks granted to businesses will try to hold spending close to current levels, leaving the fights around the edges as schools and state universities join with advocates for the poor and ill try to squeeze out a few more dollars. (AP Photo/Matt York)

Arizona will participate in the expansion of Medicaid, Gov. Jan Brewer said Monday in her State of the State address, making her the third Republican governor to agree to one of the key components of President Barack Obama's health care reform.

Brewer said that if she did not accept the Medicaid funds for Arizona, other states could claim those federal dollars and create jobs that otherwise would be created in Arizona. Fellow Republican governors Susana Martinez of New Mexico and Brian Sandoval of Nevada also plan to expand Medicaid to anyone who earns up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is currently $14,856 for an individual.

But 10 other Republican governors have already decided not to participate. The Supreme Court's 2012 ruling that affirmed Obama's health care law allows states to refuse to take part in the Medicaid expansion.

Although Brewer has been a consistent opponent of Obamacare, she acknowledged Monday that the law is now an unavoidable reality and that Arizona would be worse off turning down the federal dollars that will come with broadening Medicaid.

""Try as we might, the law was upheld by the United States Supreme Court,"" Brewer said. ""The Affordable Care Act is not going anywhere, at least not for the time being.""

The Arizona governor said the federal funding would help pay for some individuals already covered by the state's Medicaid program and provide some protection for the state's rural hospitals.

While Arizona is moving ahead with the expansion of Medicaid, Brewer declined to take part in another key aspect of Obamacare. In November, she notified the Obama administration that Arizona would not establish a state-run health insurance exchange. These exchanges will be the gateways for individuals and small businesses to comparison shop for health benefits and to learn whether they qualify for financial assistance or Medicaid coverage. Arizona is one of 25 states in which the federal government will have to set up the insurance exchange.

In announcing her decision to lawmakers in Phoenix, Brewer emphasized her continued concern that the federal government may cut back on its share of financing the Medicaid expansion and said she would put plans in place to protect the state's budget. Under Obamacare, the federal government will pay the full cost of covering newly eligible individuals from 2014 to 2016, and then will scale back funding to 90 percent by 2022.

""As I weighed this decision, I was troubled that a future president and Congress would reduce matching rates,"" Brewer said. ""Together with my team, I have crafted a plan that addresses both of those concerns and safeguards Arizona.""

Brewer's plan includes what she described as a ""circuit breaker,"" which would automatically shrink the state's Medicaid program in the event that the federal government were to decrease funding.

""I will not allow Obamacare to become a bait and switch,"" she said.

Brewer placed her decision on Medicaid in the context of the main economic development theme of her speech. She told lawmakers that she did not want to forfeit the federal funds to other states that have agreed to expansion, singling out such neighboring states as California and Colorado. She said that the Medicaid expansion, which she described as ""just slightly beyond"" what voters had previously approved, would insert $2 billion into the Arizona economy.

She also promoted Arizona's Medicaid expansion plan as ""the gold standard"" for the nation.

Brewer continued to emphasize her opposition to the Affordable Care Act but told legislators that the state could not oppose the federal government on all aspects of the health care law.

""We cannot wag our finger at the federal government,"" Brewer said, reminding lawmakers of her famous meeting on an airport tarmac with President Obama last year. ""Trust me, I tried that once.""

Arizona House Minority Leader Chad Campbell (D-Phoenix) told The Huffington Post that Democrats are ""encouraged"" by Brewer's decision. He said that the party still plans to look at the details of her Medicaid plan, but that what the governor outlined in her address was a good step for the state.

Brewer and Campbell, a potential 2014 gubernatorial candidate, have had a frosty relationship over the past two years. Noting that the Medicaid expansion was pushed by the state's business community, along with Democrats and moderate Republicans, Campbell said he hopes that the governor is willing to work with them in a ""constructive fashion"" to pass the plan through the GOP-controlled legislature, which has been led by Tea Party loyalists.

""The only people opposed to this is the ideological far right and the Tea Party,"" Campbell said. ""This is about economic development for the state. Rejecting this will destroy the hospital system."""

Blow'],Web Sites and Grave Sites - The New York Times,"So they have focused their attention on a technical hiccup and tried to spin it as a symptom of systematic incompetency — if the Obama administration can’t run a complicated Web site, it is incapable of managing a complicated policy. But this logic simply pushes beyond credibility. As the president said Monday: “Let me remind everybody that the Affordable Care Act is not just a Web site.” The Web site is only a part of the whole.

But to many Republicans who are stuck fighting a battle that’s already been lost rather than moving on to the next challenge, this Web site problem offers a sliver of hope that they can turn people off from the law. So far, it isn’t working. According to a Gallup poll released Wednesday, there has been an uptick in support for the law since the Web site opened.

Sometimes you simply have to accept reality, and sometimes that reality is accepting defeat. Learn from it. Grow from it. But first you must admit it. That’s the modern Republican Party’s problem — blindness to the obvious.

The Republican Party’s conduct during this period in the country’s history will get the same sober, thorough judgment from history as the health care law, and that judgment is not likely to be kind.

History will record that this is the moment that the party camped out in its own graveyard, hastening the demise of its national viability; that it gave up on America, while constantly reminiscing about America as it once was; that its thought leaders were replaced by crusade leaders and the Grand Old Party saw its grandeur subside; that it came to realize that it couldn’t forever be the party of intransigence in a nation of progress, without being burned by the friction inherent in those two warring concepts.

This is the moment when the rest of America realized that opposition isn’t an idea, and preventing things from getting done is not the same as getting things done."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama--%E2%80%98i-ve-got-one-more-campaign-in-me--for-obamacare-023741313.html,,[],Obama: ‘I’ve got one more campaign in me’ for Obamacare,"President Barack Obama wearily pleaded late Monday with supporters of his Organizing for Action (OFA) group to fight for him through “one more campaign” — his legacy-defining drive to save Obamacare.

“I’ve run my last political campaign, but I’ve got one more campaign in me, and that’s making sure that this law works,” Obama said on a conference call organized by OFA. “And we’re not backing off one bit.”

Obama complained that “a lot of misinformation” about the Affordable Care Act has been “created and fed” by the failure of the federal HealthCare.gov portal for buying health insurance. He did not offer specifics.

The president spoke for about 14 minutes — sounding utterly bone-tired but plainly trying to recapture the magic of his 2008 campaign or at least the competence of his 2012 re-election push.

“I’m going to need your help, your energy, your faith, your ability to reach out to neighbors,” he said. “You’re going to make the difference.”

Obama declared himself “confident” that the website would function for “the vast majority” of would-be purchasers by his self-imposed Dec. 1 deadline. The White House earlier put a number on that phrase: 80 percent of users, with some portion of the other 20 percent able to sign up via other means.

“We’ve always understood that we’re going to have to enroll people by mail, we’ll have to enroll people over the phone, we’re going to have to enroll people in person,” Obama said.

OFA Executive Director Jon Carson, who said some 200,000 were on the call, emphasized that “the biggest push of this campaign is actually going to come in March.” (March 31 is the end of open enrollment).

“It’s a long race and we’re not near the tape yet, so we’ve just got to keep on running” Obama said. “I hope that you have as much fight in you as I do.”"
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/01/sex-education-programs-gop_n_2993788.html,2013-04-01 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Reporter'],Sex Education Programs For Teens Targeted By GOP Lawmakers,"In addition to passing some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation so far this year, Republican lawmakers in North Dakota, Arkansas and Texas are now pushing bills that would defund comprehensive sex education programs for at-risk teenagers.

The North Dakota legislature is currently considering an amendment to an anti-abortion bill that would effectively block a $1.2 million federal grant for a sex education program for teens who are homeless or in foster programs.

Planned Parenthood and North Dakota State University were jointly planning to administer the program, which would have provided counseling and information about abstinence, contraception and sexually transmitted infections. But state Rep. Bette Grande (R-Fargo) proposed to kill the grant to keep Planned Parenthood out of teen sex education in North Dakota, even though the family planning provider does not operate any clinics in the state.

""They're not a part of how we do business in this state,"" Grande said of Planned Parenthood in January after the sex ed program was announced. ""It is an overt abortion industry that we don't want to be a part of.""

Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, told reporters on Monday that North Dakota is the first state ever to go after a sex education program that is fully funded by the federal government.

""This is incredibly unusual,"" she said. ""No state has tried to block a comprehensive sex education program like this, ever.""

Arkansas lawmakers, meanwhile, are considering a bill that would prevent public funds from flowing to any entity that provides or refers for abortions, which would effectively end an HIV and STI prevention program that Planned Parenthood administers through a state grant.

And Texas state Sen. Ken Paxton (R-McKinney) proposed a bill in March that would prevent Planned Parenthood from providing sex education materials to Texas students because the family planning provider has an inherent ""conflict of interest.""

Nash told HuffPost that most states have been moving away from abstinence-only education and toward comprehensive sex education programs over the past decade because the U.S. has the highest teen pregnancy rate in the developed world. Research has shown that such programs delay sexual debut, reduce number of partners and increase contraceptive use among teenagers. But since 2011, several conservative-leaning states have been trending in the opposite direction.

""This could be the start of something,"" Nash said. ""For a couple of years, we've been dealing with attempts to defund Planned Parenthood in the sense of prohibiting state funds to go to Planned Parenthood for the purposes of providing family planning, but now we're seeing that potentially expand to these sex education programs that give teens the information they need to prevent pregnancy.""

Twenty states currently require abstinence-only education in public schools where sex education is taught, including North Dakota and Arkansas. Texas law stresses abstinence education in public schools, but also includes information about condoms.

Dr. John Santelli, a pediatrician and professor at Columbia University's School of Public Health, told reporters in a conference call on Monday that the medical profession and public health communities are united in the belief that comprehensive sex education programs are the best way to combat the country's soaring teen pregnancy rate.

""Unfortunately, this is an area where there's more heat than light sometimes, and political interference is all too common,"" he said. ""We broadly support comprehensive sex education and feel strongly that these programs should be left to health professionals and not politicians."""

All right, I bring this up because, besides the heroic Wendy Davis, there were two stories in the news last week dealing with teenage sex. And just to be safe, the Vatican issued a denial. (audience groans) Yeah, you'll get over it.

One story was about Plan B. That's the morning after pill that the FDA says is safer than Motrin, and which any American can now buy over the counter, just like milk and ammo. And because it's a birth control pill, it will prevent abortions.

Now the other story was about the vaccine for HPV, which is the STD that leads to cervical cancer, and how that vaccine, since its introduction in 2006, has reduced teenage infections by 56%.

All good news, right? Wrong! No, over in Family Values World, things like Plan B and the HPV vaccine are bad, because they remove God's natural intended punishments for sluts who put out. (shocked audience laughter) It's true.

A) being saddled with a baby you don't want, or

B) stricken with a horrible disease.

You don't think that's how these people think? Then tell me why conservatives always couch their objections to the HPV vaccine in ""parental rights"", but never complain about other state-mandated vaccines their kids have to get. Why not throw a shit fit about the measles vaccine? Or mumps, rubella, whooping cough, chicken pox? Because you don't get those diseases from screwing or yodeling in the canyon. (audience laughter turns into cheering)

They do not want a vaccine for HPV, because that's the good kind of cancer, that makes hussies think twice about going all the way. Ron Paul — a fucking doctor! — said this vaccine, which prevents thousands of cases of a fatal disease, was ""not good medicine"". And Michele Bachmann said it caused mental retardation. Her source? The New England Journal of A Lady Who Stopped Me on the Street and Told Me That. (audience applause)

Yes, Republicans actually think this vaccine encourages girls to have sex, because now there are no consequences. Just the way when I got my first tetanus shot, I couldn't wait to jab rusty nails into my feet! (audience laughter) It was a freebie!

But studies have been done on this, and girls who get the HPV shot become no more sexually active than girls who do not. It's not like they see the needle getting stuck in and go, ""Ooh, that gives me an idea!"" (audience laughter)

They already have the idea. One in three 16-year-olds in America are having intercourse. To deny them access to the vaccine or Plan B as a means of preventing them from doing it, is like not giving them an umbrella so it won't rain. (audience applause)

And Plan B, again, is not an abortion pill. Quite the opposite. It's a dose of hormones that prevents ovulation. You know, ovulation, when a tramp's ovaries release an egg. (audience laughter) So there is no egg for the sperm to fertilize. So ""unborn life"" doesn't enter into it. If you have a problem with it, it's because you and your invisible friend just don't like people having sex.

If Republicans were really pro-life, they'd endorse making Plan B free to women everywhere. Of course, plenty of ministers' daughters are going to be using Plan B too. And good. Why should there be shame if on one night, a curious teenager loses herself in a moment of passion and says, ""OK, you can stick it in, but just for a minute."" Not knowing that a 16-year-old boy couldn't last a minute if he tried! (wild audience laughter and applause)"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/31/Half-Of-Obamacare-Enrollees-Have-Yet-To-Pay,2013-12-31 00:00:00,['Wynton Hall'],Half of Obamacare 'Enrollees' Have Yet to Pay,"Half of the people who have signed up for Obamacare in 17 states have not activated their health insurance plans by making their first premium payment, a trend that threatens to further embarrass and frustrate President Barack Obama and the highly unpopular Obamacare program.

Health insurance plans purchased through Obamacare only kick in once a customer pays their first month’s premium. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that “only about half of enrollees billed for plans offered by more than 100 insurers in 17 states had paid their first month’s premium,” according to Benaissance chief strategy officer Mark Waterstraat, whose firm serves as a third-party billing company for insurers. Another insurer, Scott & White Health Plan, told the Journal that only 35% of its enrollees have paid for the plans they applied for.

The Obama administration remains far behind its 7 million enrollment target but has recently celebrated what it calls two million Obamacare “enrollments.” Yet that figure merely reflects the number of applications submitted, not the number of paying customers who have turned on their plans by actually paying for coverage. Whether insurers in the other 33 states are experiencing nonpayment rates in the 35% to 50% range is presently unknown. If those rates extended nationally, they would mean the Obama administration’s claim that it has enrolled two million people in Obamacare would plunge to just 700,000 to one million.

Even progressive groups like the left-leaning journalism group ProPublica say the emergence of an Obamacare nonpayment gap raises “the prospect that actual enrollment will be far lower than the figures HHS [Health and Human Services] is releasing.”

Part of the problem may be the costs of the plans offered through Obamacare. A recent USA Today analysis found that over half of all counties in the 34 states on the federal HealthCare.gov exchange “lack even a bronze plan that’s affordable by the government’s own definition.”

“There is also a lot of worrying going on over people making payments,” industry consultant Robert Laszewski told ProPublica.

Experts say that first-time insurance buyers may not fully understand the duties and responsibilities that come with ownership. A recent study published in the Journal of Health Economics found that only 14% of individuals who have health coverage could correctly answer all four of four basic questions about health insurance, including understanding what a “deductible” and “copay” mean. If comprehension levels are that low for those who already have insurance, analysts worry what that might mean for first-time insurance purchasers, especially for a program as complex as Obamacare.

Persistence of the Obamacare nonpayment trend would pose serious challenges for the Obama administration’s ability to hit its goal of seven million paying customers by the end of March.

According to the latest CNN poll, support for Obamacare is now at a record low 35%.

Obamacare will cost U.S. taxpayers $2.6 trillion over the next ten years."
http://news.yahoo.com/pressure-mounts-fix-health-insurance-exchanges-192624934.html,,[],Pressure mounts to fix health insurance exchanges,"The pressure is on for the federal government and states running their own health insurance exchanges to get the systems up and running after overloaded websites and jammed phone lines frustrated consumers for a second day as they tried to sign up for coverage using the new marketplaces.

In some ways, the delays that persisted Wednesday were good news for President Barack Obama and supporters of his signature domestic policy achievement because the holdups showed what appeared to be exceptionally high interest in the overhauled insurance system. But if the glitches aren't fixed quickly, they could dampen enthusiasm for the law at the same time Republicans are using it as a rallying cry to keep most of the federal government closed.

""It was worse today than it was yesterday,"" Denise Rathman of Des Moines said after she tried for a second day to log onto the Iowa site.

Rathman has insurance through Dec. 31 but said she is eager to sign up for a policy because of her psoriatic arthritis, which has caused her to be denied insurance in the past.

David Berge, a pastor with two young children in Shoreview, Minn., tried unsuccessfully at least 10 times to create an online account on the state-run site MNsure. His high-deductible plan expires at the end of the year.

""I'm anxious to see what the insurance is going to look like for my family at the beginning of the year,"" Berge said. ""That's a big unknown right now. I want to figure that out as soon as possible so we can begin planning.""

In California, home to 15 percent of the nation's uninsured, officials pulled the enrollment portion of the Covered California site down overnight for emergency upgrades. It was restored midmorning Wednesday, and 7,770 people had started applications by then, spokesman Roy Kennedy said.

California is one of a handful of mostly Democratic states that opted to set up their own exchanges rather than let the federal government do it for them. In the 36 states being operated by the federal Department of Health and Human Services, consumer patience was still being tested.

Story continues

Agency spokeswoman Joanne Peters said many Americans successfully enrolled on the first day, but she declined to put a number on it. She said the delays were due to ""overwhelming interest"" and high volume.

It's not as if nobody warned them. Just three months ago, the congressional Government Accountability Office said a smooth and timely rollout could not be guaranteed because the online system was still getting finishing touches and had not been fully tested.

The Obama administration shrugged off the evaluation.

The bumpy debut has the hallmarks of a technology project that may have rushed to meet the Oct. 1 deadline, said Bill Curtis, chief scientist at CAST, a software quality analysis firm, and director of the Consortium for IT Software Quality, which develops standards.

""When you are in a rush, you typically make a lot of mistakes and you don't have time to test them all out,"" he said.

High volume can also expose software flaws that were not detected in testing, Curtis said, like the recurring problem consumers encountered trying to set up accounts on the federal site. Drop-down menus that were supposed to provide security questions did not work.

The department issued survival tips for aggravated consumers after 4.7 million unique visitors logged in to the healthcare.gov website on Tuesday. As new health insurance markets went live around the country, the federal call center also received 190,000 calls.

In suburban Cleveland, Sharon Schorr finally gave up on the federal exchange website after eight hours of failed clicks.

""It almost reminded me of going online and trying to buy Springsteen tickets,"" said Schorr, a self-employed accountant who works for her husband's recruiting firm in Orange, Ohio.

Others simply resorted to old-fashioned pen and paper.

Luis Veloz, a college student in Dallas, was so eager to have insurance that he had already mailed in a paper application by Tuesday night. He is hoping to avoid racking up major bills like his parents, who incurred $250,000 in debt when his father had a heart attack.

""It's an exciting moment because my family has never had preventative care,"" Veloz said.

Workers at the Florida Association of Community Health Centers printed out applications ahead of time.

""We don't care about the politics. This is about people so we were trying to make it easy for the patients,"" President and CEO Andy Behrman said.

Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, said the law also known as Obamacare was working well because his state embraced the health reform law early on instead of fighting it. The state processed 373 applications for coverage by the end of Wednesday.

""Because we took the time and effort to be ready, to handle the calls, to have our ducks in a row if you will, we are in far better shape than those states and governors that have turned their back on this historic program and historic offering,"" Malloy said.

The Obama administration hopes to sign up 7 million people during the first year. Using an expansion of Medicaid or government-subsidized plans, the White House would eventually like to cover at least half of the nearly 50 million Americans who are uninsured.

Many states expect people to sign up closer to the Dec. 15 deadline to enroll for coverage starting Jan. 1. Most customers will need to pay the first month's premium when they do, which could lead them to put off choosing, said Bob Dickes, director of sales and marketing for the nonprofit insurer Oregon's Health CO-OP.

""I expect people to shop and see what's out there,"" Dickes said.

Customers have until the end of March to sign up to avoid tax penalties.

Under the law, health insurance companies can no longer deny coverage to someone with a pre-existing medical condition and cannot impose lifetime caps on coverage. They also must cover a list of essential services, ranging from mental health treatment to maternity care.

Washington (CNN) – Sen. Ted Cruz got a lot of pushback from Republican colleagues during a closed-door meeting questioning his relentless effort to tie government funding to derailing Obamacare.

""Cruz was completely unapologetic about the ads that he is featured in on the Senate Conservatives Fund website that attack other Republicans. He sees himself as the only truly pure Republican. His colleagues are furious. He has no successful strategy but has managed to generate grass roots support for his position,"" one senior Republican source at Wednesday's meeting told CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger.



Cruz has urged Republicans in the House to stand firm and continue pushing any plan to fund the government to proposals aimed at curtailing the Affordable Care Act.

This summer, he appeared in ads produced by the Senate Conservatives Fund urging Republicans to push Congress to defund Obamacare.

This strategy has upset Senate Republicans and some House GOP members because some privately blame the freshman Texas lawmaker for causing the shutdown and boxing House Speaker John Boehner into a corner.

Cruz's spokesman did not have a response to reports of pushback during the Wednesday meeting. Cruz told Politico the media loves to cover internal Republican disagreements and ""apparently some senators are content to fuel those stories with anonymous quotes.""

Cruz also was unapologetic talking to conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham earlier Wednesday.

""We've had now three times, the House has endeavored to pass compromise bills that would keep the government funded, but at the same time would start to address the enormous harms that Obamacare is inflicting on the American people. And three times, Harry Reid has said 'no, absolutely not, I will not talk, I will not compromise, I will not do anything – no.' And as long as he maintains that absolutist position, both Reid and President Obama have said they won't even sit down to talk. They want a shutdown,"" he said.

At a previous meeting of Senate Republicans, Sen. Susan Collins spoke about some of the ads in Maine that said she was not conservative enough, blaming Cruz for helping to divide the party.

During the Wednesday session, many senators spoke out and aimed their comments directly at Cruz, the GOP source told Borger.

While Cruz initially drew the anger of some Republicans weeks ago when the House passed the first bill to keep the government operating only if Obamacare was defunded because Democrats controlled the Senate, he then staged a 21-hour talkathon last week trying to prevent the Obamacare provision from being removed. He lost that effort but helped cement his stature with the Republican base.

That caused some Republicans to go public with their consternation.

Asked why Boehner can't bring up for consideration any bill he wants, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, told CNN Wednesday night that the ""leadership made a decision to take the position that we are going to take the Ted Cruz strategy, and we are not going to fund the government until we get rid of Obamacare.""

Nunes blames Cruz for causing the GOP not to have a choice and causing a shutdown.

""John Boehner said we'll take this Ted Cruz strategy. You guys went out for two months, made these commitments. We'll take it. We'll implement it. And now, here we are, it's fully implemented. ... I think Ted Cruz is one of the best politicians that's come around in a long time. He's able to rally the base, he's got a lot of money … There's a lot of consultants making money off this and lots of TV ads going on. The problem with it is, it's one thing to be good at politics. It's another thing to be not good at strategy.""

Rep. Peter King, R-New York, has previously called Cruz ""a fraud"" for his promises of defunding Obamacare. But other Republicans are not backing away from Cruz, including Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli, who is scheduled to hold an event with the senator on Saturday.

For Democrats, there is little question of who is in fact leading the anti-Obamacare effort and are eager to highlight Cruz's efforts.

""Senator Cruz is now a joint speaker,"" Reid said Thursday on the Senate floor. ""He lectures the House on occasion as he does people over here.""

Mo Elleithee, communications director for the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement regarding Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus: ""I think he probably has Speaker Cruz Boehner's number somewhere.""

I suggested yesterday that we’re probably heading for a turning point in the health reform discussion. Conservatives are operating on the assumption that it’s an irredeemable disaster that they can ride all the way to 2016; but the facts on the ground are getting better by the day, and Obamacare will turn into a Benghazi-type affair where Republicans are screaming about a scandal nobody else cares about.

And it’s already starting to happen.

White House officials are sounding increasingly upbeat. They could be deluded or spinning; but after what happened two months ago one suspects that the last thing they want is to inflate expectations unduly.

Meanwhile, media coverage is shifting fast. It’s still mostly trying for equivalence — each positive story of people being helped matched by a negative story of people hurt. But the stories don’t actually match up at all.

Small example: earlier today I found myself trapped in a place with CNN on in the background, showing a fair-and-balanced account of losers and winners. First, the loser: a guy who admits that Obamacare has gotten him a plan cheaper than the insurance he had, but who has found that his current allergist is off-network. Annoying, no doubt; but there are other allergists, and this particular one probably didn’t help the case by saying that he’s thinking of refusing to take Medicare patients, too.

And in any case, insurance with restricted networks is hardly something new to Obamacare.

Then, the winners: a couple with no insurance at all, because her premium would have been prohibitive and he has a preexisting condition that won’t let him buy any kind of insurance at all — but now both covered, at a very affordable price, by Covered California.

I don’t know about you, but these don’t sound to me like equivalent stories.

At this rate, the whole horrors-of-Obamacare meme will be gone in weeks, not months. But the GOP echo chamber won’t be able to let it go."

He Is A Fellow At The American Enterprise Institute', 'The Former Chief Speechwriter For President George W. Bush.']",Marc Thiessen: The tea party needs a General Washington,"Amid the smoldering wreckage of the government shutdown and the failed effort to defund Obamacare, it is time for conservatives to figure out why they lost — and how they can win the next time.

Since the tea party takes its inspiration from the American Revolution, it might want look to that period for answers. It can learn a lot from the contrasting strategies of two revolutionary war generals: Horatio Gates and George Washington. One led the patriots into disaster, while the other led them to victory.

Gates commanded American forces at the Battle of Camden, the British victory depicted in Mel Gibson’s classic movie ‘The Patriot.’ Gates thought he had the British cornered but played right into their hands, positioning inexperienced militia fighters opposite the best troops the crown had. When the more capable redcoat forces advanced with bayonets, Gates’s forces (who did not have bayonets) were compelled to flee. The continentals were routed. It is considered to this day one of the most catastrophic defeats in U.S. military history.

By contrast, George Washington knew better than to go muzzle-to-muzzle with superior British forces in an open field. He followed what was known as the “Fabian Strategy” (named for the Roman leader Quintus Fabius Maximus), avoiding large, unwinnable battles in favor of smaller strategic engagements. As historian James Scythes explains it, “unless his army enjoyed a distinct advantage, Washington believed he must avoid direct battle” and “instead resorted to swift raids against detachments of the enemy’s army.” In the Battle of Princeton, for example, Washington knew he could not defeat Cornwallis’s 8,000-man force in direct combat. So he left his campfires burning as a diversionary tactic, snuck around the British camp, and took on the British in a series of smaller rear-guard engagements.

For taking this cautious approach, Washington was accused by some at the time of being a RINO (“Revolutionary in Name Only”). Scythes writes, “Critics of his strategy would grow impatient with Washington’s lack of victories, which would lead to frustration amongst patriots.” They wanted him to fight! But despite his aggressive nature, Washington refused to send his troops on suicide missions. His Fabian Strategy worked because he picked smaller, winnable fights and defeated the British in a war of attrition.

This is precisely the approach today’s patriots should have taken in the fight against Obamacare. Shutting down the government had zero chance of succeeding, and it played right into Democratic hands.

Today, some on the right are rationalizing defeat, claiming they won in a lot of ways. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) boasted: “Oh my gosh, we’ve lit up Obamacare for the whole nation.” No, you didn’t. You distracted the nation from Obamacare’s disastrous rollout, pushing the Obamacare implosion off the front pages and giving the media an excuse to focus on the disarray in the Republican Party instead of the disarray in the Obama administration. You ruined the chance to delay implementation of at least parts of Obamacare. And you alienated independent voters who agree that Obamacare is a disaster but opposed a government shutdown.

Tea party patriots need to understand: There is no silver lining in the shutdown cloud. It was an unmitigated disaster. Remember the tea party’s successful fight to ban earmarks? The continuing resolution passed to reopen the government contains earmarks for things like the Olmstead Locks and Dam in Kentucky and Colorado highway funds. The Obamacare income verification provision was watered down to be meaningless. The final legislation was worse than what Sen. Harry Reid put forward before the shutdown.

Amazingly, even some leaders of the defund debacle are now admitting the fight was unwinnable from the start. Last week, Heritage Action CEO Michael Needham told Fox News, “Everybody understands that we’ll not be able to repeal this law until 2017. And we have to win the Senate and win the White House.” Now he tell us? Then what on earth was the point of the government shutdown?

If conservatives had instead followed the Fabian approach of Gen. Washington — avoiding a battle they knew could not be won in favor of smaller engagements — they might have succeeded in delaying parts of Obamacare and rallying the American people for its eventual repeal. Instead, they were completely routed.

Those responsible for this disaster ought to be held to account. After leading his forces into an unwinnable fight with a disastrous strategy, Gen. Gates was fired by the Continental Congress. No one questioned his patriotism, but they questioned his competence. His reputation never recovered.

Those who led the tea party into an unwinnable fight with a disastrous strategy should be equally discredited today. Yet many on the right are hailing Sen. Ted Cruz and the rest of the defund caucus as heroes. At least they stood and fought, they say. No, they led us into a trap. Make no mistake: The shutdown was the tea party’s Battle of Camden. Those who botched it are the modern equivalent of Gen. Gates.

The tea party needs a Gen. Washington.

Most mental health experts agree that the link between mental illness and violence is not imaginary. Studies suggest that people with an untreated severe mental illness are more likely to be violent, especially when drug or alcohol abuse is involved. And many rampage killers have some type of serious mental disorder: James E. Holmes, accused of opening fire in a movie theater in Colorado in July, was seeing a psychiatrist who became alarmed about his behavior; Jared L. Loughner, who killed 6 people and injured 13 others in Arizona, including former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, was severely mentally ill.

But such killings account for only a tiny fraction of gun homicides in the United States, mental health experts point out. Besides the research indicating that little violent crime can be linked to perpetrators who are mentally ill, studies show that those crimes are far more likely to involve battery — punching another person, for example — than weapons, which account for only 2 percent of violent crimes committed by the mentally ill.

Because of this, some criminal justice experts say it makes more sense to pass laws addressing behavior, rather than a diagnosis of mental illness. In Indiana, for example, firearms can be confiscated from people deemed a potential threat, whether or not they have a mental illness.

Proposals in a number of states seek to redefine the threshold for involuntary commitment to psychiatric treatment. But in doing so, they have reignited a longstanding debate about the role of forced treatment.

In Ohio, lawmakers are expected to consider a proposal to increase access to outpatient commitment instead of hospitalization, while also doing away with language requiring people with mental illness to show a “grave and imminent risk to substantial rights” of themselves or others before they can be committed.

In Colorado, where legislators are undertaking a broad overhaul of the state’s mental health system proposed by Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, the proposal also includes changing the criteria for involuntary commitment."

Like the Scarecrow, whoever came up with House Republicans’ plan to deal with Kathleen Sebelius on Wednesday didn’t have a brain.

It was their big chance to flambé the secretary of health and human services and the person who has overseen the disastrous launch of Obamacare. Instead, they wound up casting her as Judy Garland’s Dorothy.

“In ‘The Wizard of Oz,’ there is a great line,” Barton, one of the first Republican questioners, informed Sebelius, a former two-term governor of Kansas. “Dorothy at some point in the movie turns to her little dog, Toto, and says, ‘Toto, we’re not in Kansas anymore.’ Well, Madam Secretary, while you’re from Kansas, we’re not in Kansas anymore.”

Thus began several references, each more painful than the last, to Oz, Kansas, following the yellow brick road, pulling back the curtain, the wonderful things the Wizard does — and, for good measure, something about Chicken Little, although he did not appear in the 1939 classic.

And, sure enough, the Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee went after Sebelius like so many flying monkeys. But — spoiler alert! — the film doesn’t turn out well for Dorothy’s persecutors, and the hearing, likewise, didn’t turn out to be the humiliation for Sebelius that Republicans had in mind. Dorothy melted the Wicked Witch with a bucket of water; Sebelius doused her questioners with an unexpected and extended confession of responsibility.

“Access to HealthCare.gov has been a miserably frustrating experience for way too many Americans,” she said in her opening statement. “So let me say directly to these Americans: You deserve better. I apologize. I’m accountable to you for fixing these problems. And I’m committed to earning your confidence back by fixing the site.”

This was a sneaky and dastardly thing for her to do: sneaky, because it wasn’t in the advance testimony she gave the committee, and dastardly, because in today’s Washington, any acceptance of responsibility is so rare that the Republicans — who were counting on her evading and deflecting — were bound to be caught off-guard.

Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) seemed not to have heard the secretary’s apology. “You’re now blaming it on the contractors and saying it’s Verizon’s fault,” she said.

“Let me be clear. I’m not pointing fingers at Verizon,” Sebelius said. “We own the site.”

Blackburn pressed Sebelius to tell her who led the team overseeing the project, and when Sebelius provided it, Blackburn pounced. “Michelle Snyder is the one responsible for this debacle?”

“Michelle Snyder is not responsible for the debacle,” Sebelius said. “Hold me accountable for the debacle. I’m responsible.”

Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.) declined this offer. “The president is ultimately responsible for the rollout,” he declared.

“No, sir. We are responsible for the rollout,” Sebelius replied.

After more such back and forth, Harper insisted: “While I think it’s great that you’re a team player and taking responsibility, it is the president’s ultimate responsibility, correct?”

“You clearly — whatever,” Sebelius said, allowing herself a rare moment of exasperation. “Yes, he is the president. He is responsible for government programs.”

Otherwise, Sebelius, in a gray pinstriped jacket, her white hair well-coiffed and her fingernails manicured, was generally poised, keeping her voice measured even though Republican lawmakers took photos of her with their phones, and their staff members, lined up against a wall, laughed and applauded when their bosses scored points.

She bluntly refused their requests to fire one of her deputies (“I will not, sir”), to make enrollment voluntary for the first year (“No, sir”) and to hand over enrollment numbers (“No, sir”). She answered mildly even as a red-faced Rep. Billy Long (Mo.) and a furious Rep. Cory Gardner (Colo.) demanded that she drop her health-care coverage and join an Obamacare exchange (she pointed out that the law wouldn’t allow it). She did not respond to Blackburn’s contention that Obamacare had deprived people of having a health plan that is “a Ford, not a Ferrari” or a “red Solo cup and not a crystal stem.”

But many of her interrogators were unusually mild, probably disarmed by Sebelius’s self-criticism. “I told the president that we were ready to go. Clearly I was wrong,” she admitted. “No one ever imagined the volume of issues and problems that we’ve had.”

After 31 / 2 hours of Fords and Ferraris and “Wizard of Oz” references, Sebelius finally got to go home. But she had the power to do so all along: All she had to do was click her heels together three times and think, “There’s no place like the House.”

A number of states that use their own systems, including California, are on track to hit enrollment targets for 2014 because of a sharp increase in November, according to state officials.

“What we are seeing is incredible momentum,” said Peter Lee, director of Covered California, the nation’s largest state insurance marketplace, which accounted for a third of all enrollments nationally in October. California — which enrolled about 31,000 people in health plans last month — nearly doubled that in the first two weeks of this month.

Several other states, including Connecticut and Kentucky, are outpacing their enrollment estimates, even as states that depend on the federal website lag far behind. In Minnesota, enrollment in the second half of October ran at triple the rate of the first half, officials said. Washington state is also on track to easily exceed its October enrollment figure, officials said.

The growing enrollment in those states is a rare bit of good news for backers of the Affordable Care Act and suggests that the serious problems with the law’s rollout may not be fatal, despite critics’ renewed calls for repeal.

But the trend also emphasizes how widely experience with the new law varies by location.

Fourteen states and the District of Columbia, covering about one-third of the nation’s population, are operating their own Obamacare marketplaces and have their own enrollment websites. The others, including most states with Republican-led governments, have declined to do so, making their residents dependent on the malfunctioning federal site.

In addition to better-functioning websites, many states that are running their own marketplaces also have significantly more resources to help consumers sign up for coverage.

Many of the states that have declined to run their own websites have also refused to expand the joint federal-state Medicaid program, as the new law allows.

Overall enrollment totals in states using the federal site were dismal in October, according to figures released last week by the Health and Human Services Department.

For example, just 2,991 people successfully enrolled in health plans in Texas in October. That was fewer enrollees than in Kentucky, which has a sixth as many residents.

Altogether, 106,000 people enrolled in health coverage nationwide last month, a figure far below administration projections.

Nearly half of those who enrolled in October were in California or New York. Both states have continued to show growth in their numbers. In New York, enrollment has continued at roughly October’s rate and stands at 24,509, according to state officials.

Even with the growing consumer interest in health insurance in many states, the new marketplaces created by the health law need millions more enrollees. The Obama administration aims to get 7 million consumers into health insurance plans in 2014 to ensure that the marketplaces have enough people to be sustainable.

With fixes still being made to the federal website, it is unclear whether enrollment will catch up everywhere.

White House officials repeatedly have said they hope to have the healthcare.gov website working for the “vast majority” of users by the end of this month. But spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that the administration also is working with insurance companies to allow consumers to bypass the troubled site and enroll directly with insurers.

In California, Lee said Monday that the federal troubles have made enrollment more difficult even for states that use their own sites. State officials believe enrollment through Covered California has been depressed by media reports of problems with the federal site, Lee told reporters during a call organized by the consumer group Families USA.

Covered California has had to change its marketing strategy to remind Californians that the state website is different from healthcare.gov.

But while politicians in Washington, D.C., have been fixated on the website problems, many state officials are feeling considerably more optimistic about the law’s long-term prospects.

“We’re going to ride all this stuff out,” said Kevin Counihan, chief executive of Access Health CT, Connecticut’s marketplace.

Counihan, who worked for the marketplace that Massachusetts created after its trailblazing 2006 reforms, said he had been expecting even lower enrollment. Connecticut saw growing enrollment in November: 3,201 people signed up for health plans in the first two weeks of this month, nearing the 4,371 total for all of October.

Enrollment has been even stronger in many Medicaid programs.

About half the states have agreed to expand their Medicaid programs to most low-income residents in 2014. Under the law, the federal government picks up nearly the entire cost of that expansion for the first several years.

Nationwide, nearly 400,000 new people qualified for Medicaid coverage in October, according to federal data. In Oregon, whose marketplace has been one of the few trouble-plagued state sites, the state reported that it had already signed up 70,000 new people for Medicaid.

Officials nationwide cautioned that drawing firm conclusions about enrollment patterns was difficult at this early stage.

“It’s hard to know what normal looks like yet,” said Bethany Frey, a spokeswoman for Washington state’s marketplace, known as Washington Healthplanfinder.

Many state officials say they think the biggest enrollment surge will take place after Thanksgiving. Consumers face a Dec. 15 deadline to sign up if coverage is to be effective Jan. 1.

The open enrollment period under the law lasts until March 31, giving consumers an additional three months to select health plans in 2014.

Experts also expect more people to sign up for coverage through 2014 as their circumstances change in ways that make them eligible to enroll outside of the regular enrollment period.

“We are in the beginning of the first inning of a nine-inning game,” Lee said.

Text of the Continuing Resolution (CR) that will fund the government for 60-75 days will be released on Tuesday, the conservative source said, before a House vote on Thursday. The move comes abruptly as conservatives are ramping up their final push on House leadership with a big Tea Party rally outside the Capitol on Tuesday calling for Obamacare’s defunding.

House Speaker John Boehner’s spokesman Michael Steel told Breitbart News the “CR will include defunding ObamaCare,” but would not specify whether or not a certain procedural “trick” the GOP leadership used in a similar situation in 2011 will be employed yet again.

Breitbart News’ source, a high-ranking conservative movement figure close to House conservatives, said that this CR from House leadership will continue to pay for Obamacare’s implementation without cutting from current levels of taxpayer funding for the healthcare law’s rollout, despite claims from Boehner’s office it will “include defunding ObamaCare.” The source said the budget riders that will be attached to the CR can be removed easily by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, allowing him to pass a CR through the Senate funding Obamacare–a procedural move that does not require the House to revisit its CR and makes the Senate version final.

The source added that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is “shopping an idea of passing defund through the House with the CR, but with a mechanism that would allow it to be decoupled in the Senate, defeated, and then the base CR be passed without coming back to the House.”

The source said the conservative movement should “reject and pan” this “trick” from Cantor, which allows House GOP members to claim they voted to defund Obamacare but allows Reid to strip out budget riders defunding Obamacare and pass a Senate CR without them.

In rushing the CR to the floor for a vote, Breitbart News’ source said that House GOP leadership will put votes on whether the U.S. should authorize use of military force in Syria off until next week.

Politico has also confirmed the GOP leadership’s plans, reporting that Cantor and House Speaker John Boehner are “dusting off an old legislative gambit from April 2011 as one way to move ahead this week with a stopgap spending bill for the first months of the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.”

“The goal is to give conservatives a vote on defunding health care reform without resulting in a government shutdown,” Politico’s David Rogers wrote. “It’s worked before, but ‘before’ is the operative word.”

“And until Tuesday’s Republican Conference, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) won’t really know if this flash-from-the-past can flash again,” Rogers continued. “Most simply the procedure calls for sending the Senate a stopgap spending bill together with a resolution that would alter the text of the bill once it’s enrolled for presentation to President Barack Obama.”

Red State’s Daniel Horowitz notes that this trick from House GOP leadership could give GOP members political cover to oppose the grassroots and Tea Party movement by allowing them to claim they voted not to pay for Obamacare’s implementation. “Based on what I’m hearing from House sources, the worst suspicions are confirmed,” Horowitz wrote. “Eric Cantor is floating an idea to pass a short-term CR with a defund rider. But just as we predicted, they plan to write a rule that will sever the defund rider from the body of the bill after it passes the House.”

“This will allow the Senate to vote down the defund part separately, and send a clean CR straight to the President’s desk without ever returning to the House,” he explained. “This will ensure that we capitulate while allowing House and Senate Republicans to be shielded from charges of voting to defund Obamacare.”

Rick Manning, the vice president for public policy and communications at Americans for Limited Government, told Breitbart News such a strategy from leadership to buy political cover will likely fail in the end.

“If Congress ends up funding Obamacare in the Continuing Resolution, House Republicans will own it every bit as much as if they had voted for it in the beginning,” Manning said. “Parliamentary tricks will not save them from this reality.”

Conservative talk radio host Mark Levin said recently that if House Speaker John Boehner allowed a situation like this to happen, Obamacare would forever become known as “BoehnerCare.”

Club for Growth president Chris Chocola denounced the reported plan in a statement Monday afternoon: “Are these news reports from The Onion? Or are they real?” Chocola said. “When members were at home over recess, did they hear their constituents ask for legislative tricks or principled leadership?

“Trying to fool Republicans into voting to fund Obamacare is even worse than offering a bill that deliberately funds it,” Chocola declared. “I hope this proposal is nothing more than a bad joke and is quickly discarded. Republicans should simply do what they say they are for by passing a Continuing Resolution that doesn’t fund Obamacare.”"

Chris Christie will agree to expand the state’s Medicaid program under Obamacare on Tuesday.

According to the Newark, NJ-based Star-Ledger, Christie will announce the expansion when he unveils the governor’s new budget in a 3 p.m. speech to a joint session of New Jersey’s Legislature on Tuesday.

Christie joins Florida’s Rick Scott and Virginia’s Bob McDonnell as two Republican governors who have completely reversed course on the issue after rejecting addition Medicaid funds.

As recently as last summer, Christie had suggested that he would refuse the Medicaid expansion. As he told Fox & Friends in July: “Medicaid is pretty well expanded in our state already because of the legacy of previous Democratic governors. So, I don’t think there’s a lot for us to do in New Jersey in that regard.”

Likewise, McDonnell had said in July: “Expanding Medicaid without fixing Medicaid is a terrible idea.”

Christie and McDonnell were both elected in 2009 in the first wave of Tea Party-supported Republican campaigns. McDonnell is leaving office after this year; Christie is widely favored to win re-election.

State Sen. Joe Vitale, a Democrat who is chairman of the New Jersey Senate committee that deals with health care, told the Associated Press that he “had been briefed” on Christie’s decision. Health advocacy groups also said they were told by Christie’s staff of the decision that will cover 300,000 uninsured people in New Jersey.

The Supreme Court, in its Obamacare ruling last year, made Medicaid expansion, which was mandatory in the Obamacare law, optional for the states. However, the federal government attempted to encourage the states to participate by offering to pay 100% of the cost for the first three years, and 90% of the costs thereafter, provided Medicaid eligibility is expanded to include those living within 133% of the poverty line.

In essence, states that accept the federal government’s deal will have the short-term costs subsidized by federal taxpayers. The Star-Ledger notes that New Jersey is expected to receive “$1.7 billion a year” to cover the initial costs. A recent Government Accountability Office report predicted that Obamacare would add $6.2 trillion to the long-term federal deficit.

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 22 states, including the District of Columbia, have now agreed to the Medicaid expansion. Seven of those states are governed by Republicans.

Though once a conservative hero for his tough stances on the state budget and his willingness to confront New Jersey’s public sector unions, Christie has fallen from grace. In late October, he offered effusive praise for President Barack Obama’s handling of Hurricane Sandy, though all Obama had done was visit the area briefly. Many residents are still struggling to rebuild, and face numerous obstacles, including the federal bureaucracy.

ELLMERS: I know you had the clip of the governor and God bless him. He’s talking about a situation that he supports. American people cannot wait for this. There are hard working taxpayers – CAROL COSTELLO (HOST): Was the governor joshing us? Is he not telling the truth? ELLMERS: I’m not exactly sure it is working in Kentucky….. COSTELLO: So the governor when he says he’s signing up 1,000 people a day and wants to get the 640,000 people in Kentucky insured, he’s just saying that for political purposes? ELLMERS: Well, you know, let’s look again at the grand scheme of things. It is a failure at monumental levels. [...] COSTELLO: But you’re discounting everything that the Kentucky governor is saying. Instead of sitting down with him and saying, governor, let’s talk and figure this out together. Let’s figure out what’s political in what you’re saying. You’re discounting what he has to say outright. Though the federal HealthCare.gov appears to face serious technical problems, state-run marketplaces like Kentucky appear adept at quickly fixing problems and are successfully enrolling people. In Kentucky, 10,766 applications for health coverage were initiated on the first day and “6,909 completed and 2,989 families were enrolled.” Nearly 150,000 New Yorkers have signed up for Obamacare and 35,528 enrollments were completed in three weeks in Washington state.

During the discussion Rep. Ellmers endorses the Republicans American Healthcare Reform Act which it seems is largely just another big Tort Reform Bill that would remove the Ban on Pre-Existing Conditions, would remove the ability to keep your children on your healthcare until they're 26 - (although it would provide a Fund for the poor to purchase these seperately) it would take away ""Obama Regulators"" - which in short, would remove all the protections, minimum coverage requirements and life-time caps - and put ""Decisions in the hands the Consumers"" - in other words, ""Good Luck, Chumps!"" And of course, no more Exchanges where cost can be amortized across are large pool of applicants.

There you have it. Typical Tea Bagging. When confronted with Facts that contradict their delusions they try to Huff and Puff and Blow Your Reality Down!.

""Buy Health Insurance,"" it touted with premiums as low as $25 a month. I was tempted.

Health insurance, for me and for most Americans, is a necessary part of life, similar to home rent or mortgage, grocery bills and gasoline. Insurance is essential because a hospitalization for a few days costs $10,000 and medical bills for a major illness can lead to hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments. So it is no wonder that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), aka Obamacare, has created anxiety among many Americans.

And, without doubt, the ACA has caused the health insurance market to go into upheaval, with a nonfunctional healthcare.gov website, with unexpected insurance cancellation notices, and now with a proposed ""fix"" by President Obama.

So let me try to put things in perspective.

The ACA is really a ""Health Insurance Reform Act"" -- its greatest impact is to increase the number of insured individuals, to guarantee essential benefits, and to regulate health insurance companies. Perhaps most importantly, it promises health insurance no matter what your preexisting conditions are.

I have patients who stop coming to the clinic after the few initial visits and then become so ill they have to be admitted to the hospital. When I ask them why they stopped taking their lifesaving medicine and making clinic visits, their response is simple: ""My insurance ran out.""

We know such substandard insurance plans abound. Of all the bankruptcies in America, 60 percent are due to medical bills, and 78 percent of these, are among patients who had health insurance and paid their monthly premiums. Imagine, going bankrupt from medical bills when you have health insurance. This defeats the purpose of having insurance. The ACA helps individuals by standardizing insurance benefits into 10 essential categories which include coverage for hospitalization, maternity, chronic disease and mental health, among others.

Some say the ACA standardization is an upgrade of the insurance coverage. But I don't believe it's an upgrade from ""economy to the business class"" -- it's more like having all the basic safety features. It's like going from a single engine Cessna to a commercial plane.

That insurance coverage offered on the telephone pole for $25 a month and those policies being cancelled fall into this category.

The transition from substandard policy to standardized coverage will be difficult. A 30-year-old man is upset because he now has to pay a higher premium than a 30-year-old woman has to pay. But honestly, discriminating against a young woman by having her pay higher health insurance premiums because she might bear children one day is morally unacceptable.

To ease the transitions, the ACA had a ""grandfather clause"" -- which is where the phrase ""If you like your coverage you could keep it"" originated. However it was only if no changes where made to it after March 2010 when the law was passed. The ""fix"" President Obama has proposed is to extend the grandfather clause.



Another major impact of ACA on health insurance is stricter regulation. Now, insurance companies are required to spend 80 to 85 percent of the premium money towards clinical care services (not administration) -- and any additional money has to be refunded. In 2012, under the ACA, $1.1 billion dollars were returned to policyholders through refunds. Such regulations ensure that insurance companies don't make a killing off of policyholders.

The biggest question looming on the mind of most Americans is probably this: How will all these changes impact premiums? It's hard to tell. But it will not be a repeat of the decade before the ACA, where premiums doubled and many were dropped from their insurance just when they needed it most. Yet, the transition will be a bumpy ride.

State legislatures are passing many limits on abortion-related services

Deluge of state restrictions began in 2011

Restrictions include waiting periods%2C required counseling and more

Forty years after the Supreme Court legalized abortion, the constitutional right many Americans take for granted is coming under increased scrutiny.

State legislatures are passing limits on abortion-related services. More abortion providers face stepped-up regulations, and more patients face strictly worded counseling sessions or ultrasound tests. At least four states have just one clinic performing abortions.

As a result, dozens of challenges to those laws have been lodged in state and federal courts, and it may not be long before the issue is before the high court again. ""There's a lot of states that are just one clinic away from having no services altogether,"" says Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights. ""I think the next couple of years are going to be critical.""

Despite winning many battles over the past four decades, anti-abortion forces may be losing the war. The landmark Roe v. Wade decision of Jan. 22, 1973, still stands. The Supreme Court's slim majority in favor of abortion rights remains intact. And at least for another four years, presumably, President Obama will ensure that doesn't change.

""So many factors play a role in whether or not we will have the majority on the Supreme Court,"" says Mary Spaulding Balch, state legislation director for the National Right to Life Committee. ""But we're working to get all those factors lined up so that sometime in the future, we will have the ability to reverse Roe.""

In the meantime, the number and rate of abortions have declined over the past decade, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, because of a drop in teen pregnancies and increased use of birth control. The impact of the state restrictions isn't clear.

Although public opinion polls have been relatively steady for two generations in favor of legal abortion, one trend is growing: Among the majority of Americans born since Roe was decided, nearly four in 10 don't know it's about abortion, the Pew Research Center found. Support for Roe, though strong, is giving way ever so gradually to ambivalence.

Taken together, all those trends — legislative, legal, political, medical, public opinion — show why both sides continue to fight like it's still 1973. Ask Teresa Collett, an abortion opponent and scholar at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minnesota, who's winning and she has a ready answer: ""nobody.""

A new president in the White House or a change on the Supreme Court could change things. But after 40 years, legal abortion has become a way of life in America.

""Roe v. Wade is considered now to be the law of the land,"" says Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood. ""Voters consistently, no matter what state, believe that women should be making decisions about their own pregnancies. I really do believe that this country is not going to go backwards.""

After Roe, restrictions grow

Jan. 22, 1973, will forever be frozen in history for proponents and opponents of abortion rights.

In the court's 7-2 decision, Justice Harry Blackmun declared all state abortion bans unconstitutional because they interfered with the rights to privacy and liberty. Any future decision reversing Roe would not end legal abortion; rather, the authority would return to the states.

Less understood is the pregnancy timetable set by the decision. It allowed states to regulate abortions once the fetus reaches a state of viability capable of living outside the womb — providing for exceptions when the mother's health is at risk.

In the decades since, limitations have increased. A 1980 case restricted the use of Medicaid funds for abortions to cases involving rape, incest or the life of the mother.

Then, in 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the court granted states broad authority to require counseling and waiting periods, and parental consent for minors, before any abortions — as long as such laws didn't constitute an ""undue burden.""

The last major ruling came in 2007, when the court upheld a federal ban on so-called partial-birth abortions, usually performed between 20 and 24 weeks of pregnancy.

The decision was written by Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, who became the court's swing vote after Sandra Day O'Connor retired in 2006.

""That was a real turning point for Supreme Court observers, 'They allowed this prohibition, what else will they allow?' "" says Charmaine Yoest, president of Americans United for Life.

Since then, states have experimented with tougher restrictions, and supporters of abortion rights have challenged many in court. At the same time, the abortion rights cause has had victories at the federal level. Last month, Congress lifted the ban that had prohibited women in the military from using their federal health insurance to get abortions after rape or incest.

Even with the limitations, an average of 3,300 abortions are performed daily in the USA, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

""Abortions are still constitutionally protected,"" says Caitlin Borgmann, a City University of New York law professor who maintains a blog on reproductive rights. ""They're still widely available in the U.S., and the polling has not changed.""

Battles from Ariz. to Va.

The trickle of state restrictions on abortion became a deluge in 2011, when 92 provisions passed in 24 states. Last year produced 43 more, according to a survey by the Guttmacher Institute, a sexual and reproductive health think tank that supports abortion rights. The restrictions, passed mostly in states with Republican governors and legislatures, fall into several categories:

Earlier bans. Laws in Arizona and Georgia that seek to ban abortion at about 20 weeks, or in cases where the fetus could feel pain, have been blocked in court. Seven other states have similar bans — Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina and Oklahoma. Since fetal pain is a potentially earlier threshold than viability, the laws represent a challenge to Roe. ""I think it's the most realistic threat of the extreme measures that challenge Roe directly,"" Borgmann says.

More than half the nation's states require waiting periods, usually 24 hours, between counseling and abortions.

As a result of all the restrictions, ""women have more information available to them as they make the decision whether to continue or curtail their pregnancy,"" Collett says.

Abortion rights supporters don't see it that way.

""What they've done is really make women walk through a gantlet to get access,"" Richards says."

http://news.yahoo.com/not-fast-obamas-health-care-law-changing-222047704--politics.html,,[],Not so fast: Obama's health care law is changing,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Just when you thought you had the president's health care law figured out, it's changing.

Some questions and answers about what's afoot and who's affected:

Q: What's the nub of the change, and why is President Barack Obama changing course at this late date?

A: The president is letting insurance companies offer people another year of coverage under their existing plans even if those plans don't meet the requirements set out in his health care overhaul law. He's doing so because of mounting frustration — even anger — over the millions of cancellation notices that have been going out to Americans whose plans don't measure up to the law's coverage standards.

Q: Problem solved?

A: Not so fast. Obama's so-called fix doesn't force insurance companies to do anything. It just gives them the option of extending old plans for existing customers in the individual market, and only if state insurance commissioners also give their OK.

Q: Sounds like a no-brainer. Why wouldn't insurance companies let people re-up?

A: The companies aren't happy about being thrown a curve ball after they've already firmed up 2014 rates and plans. It will take a while to see how many of them agree to reinstate old plans for another year — and at what price.

Q: What's the early word?

A: Most companies and state insurance commissioners say they need time to study the changes before making a commitment. Aetna Inc., the nation's third largest health insurer, said it plans to extend some of its canceled policies. Washington state's insurance commissioner said he won't allow insurance companies there to extend the old policies. He said people can get better coverage on the new health care exchange.

Q: Why not force insurance companies to extend those old policies, not just give them that option?

A: That's a more radical step. Some Democrats want that to happen but it almost certainly would require legislation from Congress — not just a presidential decision — and Republicans would object to such a stiff new requirement on the insurance industry. More steps may be required, though, to restore coverage for people losing it.

Story continues

Q: The changes mainly affect the 5 percent of people who get their own insurance policies through the individual market. What's the big deal?

A: In a country of more than 300 million people, 5 percent is a big number. Roughly 14 million people buy their own policies, and many of those plans are not just junk insurance, contrary to what White House officials suggest. Already, more than 4 million people have gotten cancellation notices. And some small businesses are losing coverage for their workers too.

Plus, if the government can't get its HealthCare.gov website running better by Dec. 15, some people who got cancellations run the risk of having a break in coverage. The health care law was supposed to reduce the number of uninsured people, not increase it.

Q: So people who successfully make the switch to the new insurance marketplaces can rest easy?

A: Not really. If lots of healthy people who get cheaper insurance through the individual market end up keeping that coverage instead of switching to the more robust plans offered through ""Obamacare,"" that could weaken the financial footing of plans offered by the insurance marketplaces.

Q: How so?

A: People with current plans are a known risk to insurers. At some point, they all had to pass the stiff medical screening that the law forbids starting next year. Insurers were counting on premiums from those with current individual plans to help balance out the cost of care for people who have been shut out of the system, and who represent a potentially high risk. To the extent that healthier people stay out of the new insurance pool being created under the law, that would raise costs.

Q: What would happen then?

A: You guessed it: higher rates, potentially. Premiums for 2014 are set; where the increases would show up is in premiums for 2015. In a letter to state insurance commissioners Thursday, the Obama administration referred to the risk of ""unanticipated changes in premium revenue."" It promised to provide assistance through other provisions of the health care law.

Q: I get my insurance through my job. Sounds like I don't need to worry.

A: The vast majority of people with employer-based plans shouldn't be affected by the changes announced by Obama.

Q: The health care law was signed into law in 2010. Why is this issue coming up at the last minute?

A: The Obama administration miscalculated — big time — how many people would lose coverage in the transition to the new health insurance marketplace. It specified that people who had plans before the law took effect could hang on to those plans. But it didn't anticipate the big wave of cancellations among people who had plans that changed after the law took effect or who bought new plans after the law kicked in.

Q: The president says ""this fix"" won't solve every problem and that doing more will require working with Congress. What else needs to be done? And is there any hope of Obama and the Congress agreeing on changes?

A: Before Washington became so politically polarized, major legislation was usually followed within a year or two by a ""technical corrections"" bill that addressed inevitable unintended consequences and shortcomings. A bill as massive as the Affordable Care Act has many such issues, which the administration has tried to address through regulations, ""guidance"" and other administrative steps. For example, the White House last summer delayed the law's employer coverage requirement by one year to allow more time to work out regulatory issues.

Obama seems to be yearning for a return to earlier days, but Republicans are so adamant in opposing the health care law that it seems far from likely.

Just like every commander in chief before him, Obama has his share of critics. And in the Internet age, those critics have been given a bigger voice than ever before.

But what do you when the president writes back? The New York Post reports that fifth-grade schoolteacher Thomas J. Ritter was shocked to receive a handwritten response from Obama that reads in part:

“I believe that health care reform will be the right thing for the country . . . It certainly wasn’t the smart ‘political’ thing! And I hope that in the months to come, you will keep an open mind and evaluate it based not on the political attacks but on what it does or doesn’t do to improve people’s lives. Sincerely, Barack Obama.”

It’s not the first personal letter someone has received from President Obama that made headlines. In 2012, Obama famously wrote to a 10-year-old girl to answer questions about same-sex marriage . And in 2009, the New York Times wrote about how Obama has instructed White House staff to select 10 personal letters a day for him to read in order to help him stay outside of the “bubble” that inoculates so many public figures.

Still, the letter is a strangely personal exchange between the president and Ritter, 49. After all, Ritter’s letter is emotional and contains some questionable assertions.

Ritter wrote:

“This bill has caused such a divisive, dirisive [sic], and toxic environment … The reality is that any citizen that disagrees with your ­administration is targeted and ridiculed. I hesitated to write for fear of some kind of retribution. I watched you make fun of tea baggers and your press secretary make fun of Ms. Palin which was especially beneath the dignity of the White House.”

The abrasive tone of Ritter’s letter makes it all the more unusual that Obama would respond. And in responding, Obama even borrows Ritter’s phrasing of “tea baggers” to describe members of the tea party.

Story continues

In his reply, Obama acknowledges the “toxic political environment” that Ritter writes about in his letter, then continues, “I do have to challenge you, though, on the notion that any citizen that disagrees with me has been ‘targeted and ridiculed’ or that I have ‘made fun’ of tea baggers . . . [I] defend strongly the right of everyone to speak their mind — ­including those who call me ‘socialist’ or worse.”

So, did a personal, handwritten note make an impression on Ritter, helping him get past his political differences with the leader of the free world?

Not exactly.

Ritter is trying to make the best of the situation but only in the most literal sense. He’s put the letter up for auction, asking for minimum bid of $24,000.

“I am selling the letter because I am just so disappointed, and this ObamaCare bill is wrong,” Ritter told the Post. “The president told me what he thought I wanted to hear. The letter is just words on a paper. It doesn’t mean anything to me because Obama doesn’t mean any of it.”"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) went through a litany of examples that he said highlighted the abject failures of President Barack Obama's policies.

One of them involved the case of John Connelly, a Rutgers student who found himself in debt, without a permanent job, and forced to sleep on his friend's couch. His story was one that was all too common in the age of Obama, Cruz concluded.

Well, it turns out that Connelly isn't the biggest fan of Cruz. What's more, he is actually a beneficiary of the very health care law that Cruz was protesting during his speech. And in an appearance on MSNBC Friday morning, Connelly explained just how ironic it was that the senator would use his story to bludgeon the president and the Affordable Care Act.

""A friend of mine called me the next morning as I was on the way to an optometrist appointment .... [and said], 'While Ted Cruz was talking about why the ACA's bad, he mentioned your name.' And I said, 'Well, that's funny. I'm heading to an appointment I can only go to because of Obamacare.'""

Cruz had apparently gotten Connelly's story from a recent Wall Street Journal article that focused primarily on student debt, not on health care reform.

Consumers, insurance companies and federal and state authorities are scrambling ahead of Monday, the last day people in nearly all states have to choose a health insurance plan that is guaranteed to be in place on Jan. 1.

Even after revamps of HealthCare.gov, the federal portal to health coverage in 36 states, and improvements to some state-run insurance exchanges, technological problems and a tight time frame pose major challenges to people looking for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Those include uninsured people and insured people whose policies expire Dec. 31, risking potentially costly gaps in their health benefits.

The coming days could strain the insurance exchanges, rendering a stark verdict on whether the Obama administration's weeks-long effort to fix HealthCare.gov was enough to handle an expected surge in people trying to get a health plan, while working through backlogs of pending applications. Failure would mean more than frustration for people trying to get covered, as those who fall through the cracks will be at risk of huge medical expenses if they become ill or injured in 2014.

The risks of failure were clearly evident Friday, when HealthCare.gov was inoperable, the Wall Street Journal reported.

After more than two months of frustrating struggles with HealthCare.gov and the federal exchange's telephone customer service system, Sharon Van Daele, a retiree in Tucson, Ariz., feels tantalizingly close to the finish line and intends to cross it by this weekend.

""I'm trying desperately to get this resolved before the 23rd,"" said Van Daele, 64. ""It's been a long and difficult road. I started this on Oct. 4,"" she said. Van Daele's application was held up by a litany of problems that no one could help with, until she used the option made available this month to delete an application and start over, which she did last week.

""It was smooth -- very smooth. When I started in early October, it was horrible,"" said Van Daele, a cancer survivor. She's currently enrolled in a temporary Obamacare program for people who can't get private coverage, the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, which expires next month. Van Daele thinks she can get a comparable policy for about $250 a month, including the tax credits she will receive. ""Now I'm seeing a light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said.

If she's able to complete the process in time, Van Daele will follow a rapidly growing number of people who've used the insurance exchanges to sign up for coverage in recent weeks.

Although nationwide enrollment in private coverage through the exchanges has a long way to go toward the 7 million people the Congressional Budget Office initially projected would enroll by the end of the sign-up period on March 31, the pace has picked up, and the share of enrollments threatened by faulty data delivered to insurance companies appears to be shrinking.

Through the end of November, nearly 365,000 people enrolled in private insurance via the exchanges, and more than 800,000 were deemed eligible for Medicaid, the Department of Health and Human Services announced last week. And Obama announced on Friday that half a million people have signed up in December alone, suggesting the pace of signups has accelerated.

In some state-run health insurance marketplaces, new figures could portend a big uptick by the end of the year. Enrollments into private insurance via Covered California sped up to more than 17,000 a day this week, and more than 50,000 people signed up from Monday to Wednesday. The jump brings Covered California's total enrollment above 200,000 since October, the exchange announced Thursday. New York, Kentucky, Connecticut and other states reported similar increases.

Ahead of the Dec. 23 deadline, the federal government and several state exchanges have taken steps to ease the messy transition into 2014, as has the insurance industry.

The federal government has increased staffing at its call centers to more than 12,000 people, and is reaching out directly to consumers who haven't completed their applications, senior administration officials told reporters Thursday. The insurance exchanges in California, Connecticut, Kentucky, New York and Washington state have taken similar measures, executives said during a conference call with reporters hosted by the advocacy group Families USA on Wednesday.

On Thursday, the administration revealed that individuals whose policies were canceled because they don't meet the Affordable Care Act's standards won't be subject to the law's individual mandate, and will be allowed to buy bare-bones catastrophic plans originally intended for people younger than 30 or those who demonstrated financial hardship. Senior administration officials estimated this option will apply to fewer than 500,000 people.

""If people are trying to get coverage by Jan. 1, have a policy that's running out and need that coverage, we are committed to getting them through the system,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on HuffPost Live Thursday.

Insurance companies like Health Care Service Corp., a Chicago-based company that operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in five states, and Bloomfield, Conn.-based Cigna also have geared up for the pre-holiday rush by bolstering their customer service and sales teams, according to spokespeople for the companies.

""We've staffed up for it. We know that there's a crunch,"" said Lisa Rubino, the executive at Long Beach, Calif.-based Molina Healthcare who oversees its exchange business in nine states. ""There's a lot of folks looking to enroll,"" she said.

Concerns linger, however, about the federal exchanges' ability to provide insurers with accurate data about their new customers, which would jeopardize people's enrollments. And the situation in several states, such as Oregon, Maryland and Hawaii, is considerably shakier.

""We are aware of the fact that we are going to have to struggle with folks who went through the Cover Oregon process but somehow did not get to us in a timely manner,"" said Dawn Bonder, CEO of Health Republic Insurance of Oregon, based in Lake Oswego. ""What we've been encouraging folks to do is, you can buy our plan directly through our website, and put your application into Cover Oregon immediately,"" she said.

In spite of indications that enrollment is rising, and stories of failures-turned-potential-successes like Sharon Van Daele, other consumers continue to struggle with the balky system.

Alan Wells of Bluff City, Tenn., was eager to get into the exchanges and tried to start the process in October. But the 61-year-old retired information technology professional is still stuck. ""I kind of gave up,"" Wells said.

Wells is looking to replace the COBRA plan he's had since his involuntary retirement, which costs $340 a month. Wells' only income is Social Security, so he expects the law's tax credits would save him money. But he's been stymied at every turn, including his most recent attempt on Thursday. ""I'm going to try it periodically,"" Wells said. ""When it works, it will work.""

This story has been updated with December's enrollment number."

If you spend any time watching cable news networks you've seen Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-FL)attempt to whip up grassroots support for his increasingly unpopular defund Obamacare campaign. True to the teabagger audience Cruz is aiming for, this ad is as full of lies as every other attack they've made on the law.fact checker counts the ways

First up, this statement from the ad: ""Democratic Senator Max Baucus, the lead author of Obamacare, says it’s a huge train wreck.""



Ever since the Montana senator, a key writer of the bill, uttered the phrase “huge train wreck” during an April 17 budget hearing, his words have become a major GOP talking point. But Baucus’s comment has been taken out of context—and he has since said that his concerns have been addressed. [...] In other words, no more train wreck. In fact, contrary to Cruz’s suggestion, Baucus is still highly supportive of the law. [...] Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said Baucus’s new stance “makes no difference, it’s what he said. We still agree with his original assertion that it’s a train wreck.”

Well, of course new facts make no difference to Cruz, just like old facts don't make any difference. Facts in general aren't really a priority for the guy. Why should they be a priority? You obviously don't need them to get elected to statewide office in Texas.

Cruz also says in the ad, ""The president is quietly granting Obamacare waivers to big corporations,"" citing a New York Times article that doesn't focus on waivers. As Kessler points out, the article the ad is misusing is about the delay the administration announced in implementing the employer mandate in the law. Not a waiver, a delay. Yeah, facts again.

Finally, Cruz leaps on statements by Teamsters President James Hoffa and other union leaders, saying that even big labor admits that the law will ""destroy the foundation of the 40-hour week that is the backbone of the American middle class."" It's true that labor officials, while praising the law's ultimate goals, have complained about the possibility that employers will cut worker's hours to avoid the law. That's part of what the delay in the employer mandate was all about, giving employers more time to figure this out. But so far the only evidence for that comes from a few highly publicized and politicized claims by big employers, nothing more.

So, it's official, according to the Washington Post. Ted Cruz is a big, fat liar. Not that you need the WaPo to tell you that. All you need is to see Ted Cruz open his mouth."

Not the same thing.

The disastrous rollout of [President Obama's] health care law not only threatens the rest of his agenda but also raises questions about his competence in the same way that the Bush administration’s botched response to Hurricane Katrina undermined any semblance of Republican efficiency.

Obamacare's rollout does not involve an American city underwater. There are no bodies in the streets. Rather, a website is not working well and a set of mostly crappy insurance plans are being canceled, with insurance companies taking the Affordable Care Act as their excuse for canceling some decent policies, after years of canceling decent policies without that excuse. The Affordable Care Act is an attempt to fix a big problem—tens of millions of Americans without health insurance and many more paying more than they can afford or finding out that what they've been paying for won't cover them if they really need it. Parts of its rollout have been botched, but, with six weeks left before the insurance plans go into effect and with months before the end of the open enrollment period, 106,000 people have signed up for insurance and 396,000 people have become eligible for Medicaid. So what we're looking at is a law designed to help people not helping them as much as hoped, not a failure to respond with urgency, competence, or compassion to a massive natural disaster.

The' Michael Shear, demonstrating how if Republicans repeat a talking point enough times, they can get reporters to write it up as if it's a fact, not a Republican talking point:Whereas if the rollout had gone smoothly, House Republicans would be passing comprehensive immigration reform right this minute. But about that Katrina comparison. Let's review two key differences:

Of course Republicans want to compare Obamacare to Katrina. After first denying that Katrina was a political disaster for them, they switched gears to trying to use it for political advantage against Democrats, and have been looking for something they can stick with the name ""Obama's Katrina"" for years. Previous ""Obama's Katrina"" attempts have included the Haiti earthquake, Benghazi and the IRS, Hurricane Sandy, the BP oil spill, and at least half a dozen other things. It's a knee-jerk reaction by now—for Republicans. New York Times reporters shouldn't participate in it. It's not like there aren't ways to say ""the Obama administration screwed up"" without invoking a generation-shaping disaster, after all."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/07/cbs-news-obamacare-about-to-hit-employer-provided-insurance,2013-11-07 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],CBS News: ObamaCare About to Hit Employer-Provided Insurance,"With his credibility shot, CBS News has apparently decided to not take President Obama’s latest ObamaCare promise at face value. Now that millions whom the president reassured could keep their insurance are losing it, CBS dug into Obama’s latest reassurance about the 80% not in the individual market, and also found that that’s not exactly true. The truth is that a so-called “Cadillac Tax” is about to turn millions of employer-based plans into something a little closer to a “junk plan.”

“If you’re one of the 80 percent of Americans who is insured or covered through an employer plan or through Medicare or Medicaid, or the Veterans’ Administration, there is no change for you except for an increase in benefits that everyone receives as a result of the Affordable Care Act,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday.

Yet in the years to come, some workers with employer-provided benefits will see their benefits scaled back because of an Obamacare tax. That portion of the law — known as the “Cadillac tax” — isn’t set to take effect until 2018, but it’s already influencing the benefits packages that employers offer.

“Every employer plan since the passage of the health care law has been working to make sure their health care cost trends keep their plans under the ‘Cadillac tax,'” Steve Wojcik of the National Business Group on Health, a nonprofit that represents large employers, told CBSNews.com.

It is hard to tell if CBS News is just getting on the record with this report, or if the media is actually going to start doing its job with ObamaCare and give America a heads up on the fallout yet to come.

From the moment ObamaCare looked like a reality, conservative think tanks and Republican lawmakers sounded the warning that millions would lose their health insurance as a result. All the media did in response, though, was to either ignore those warnings or push back on behalf of the White House and Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.

The effect ObamaCare will have on the employer-based market — over a hundred million people — is not limited to this Cadillac Tax. The White House itself estimated that tens of millions could be dropped by their employers and shoved into these ObamaCare exchanges. This could mean losing your doctor and having your health care options limited in a traumatic way, especially if you are already ill.

Though this unsettling White House report is out there, the media have yet to give it the attention deserved or to push the Administration to explain it, especially now that the president is claiming those 80% have nothing to worry about.

The carnage that has already blindsided millions of middle class families in the individual market is only the beginning of the financial chaos ObamaCare is almost certain to rain down on tens of millions who made the mistake of taking a president at his word.

To offer the same opportunities to residents in the thirty states that did not create an exchange, however, there will also be an exchange offered by the federal government. The marketing effort for the federal exchange, however, will be woefully underfunded as an intentional product of Republican intransigence. Meanwhile, the state plans are being sold and marketed under names specific to each. Plans offered under the California exchange are being sold through an entity that will be known as Covered California, while Kentuckians will shop for plans from Kynect.

The early years of these exchanges are the most crucial, as Joan McCarter summarized when discussing the irony of Kentuckians signing up for Kynect without realizing that it is a part of the dreaded ""Obamacare"" system:



That's absolutely why Republicans are frantic to try to find a way to stop Obamacare from starting. As the message about its benefits get out, as people sign up and start receiving those benefits, they're going to forget all about being scared of it and they're going to like it. But it's not a slam-dunk, and the public education effort is key because Republican lies have taken hold with plenty of people. Erin Hoven, an outreach worker with Kentucky Voices for Health, and her efforts to do outreach and education on Obamacare faces those lies—repeated regularly by both of the state's Republican senators, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul—at every turn.

In short, the state-based insurance exchanges will be branded at purely state programs, and the federal exchanges will likely have much slower adoption rates because they are not being marketed at all. The message about the benefits will get out, especially in the states that have set up exchanges and received more generous federal funds to market them. People will benefit, even those who were vociferous opponents of the Affordable Care Act to begin with. But when the messages about those benefits start spreading, will the beneficiaries realized that it is the Affordable Care Act that provides them, or will the branding of the plans make it such that people may subscribe to plans created by the law without realizing they have done so?

Meanwhile, the example of Idaho shows that even people who have experienced the abject failure of the free-market, anti-government methodology they love to espouse will not change their ideological stripes, despite the evidence staring them in the face:



On election night, Bill McCarrel Jr. watched teary-eyed residents crowd into his historic bar, The Gathering Place, after President Obama won a second term. His customers worried aloud about losing access to their guns and having to accept the federal health law that many revile as socialized medicine. Like most people in this fiercely Republican state, McCarrel opposes Obamacare — even though he's uninsured and can't find affordable coverage as a result of his artificial hip and knees. But the former junior high principal is looking forward to shopping in the law's online insurance marketplace, also called an exchange, starting in October to see if he can get a plan he could afford.

It is foreseeable that the Affordable Care Act will be a great success and do wonders to help people get insurance who would have stood no chance of doing so without it, yet the people it helps will not realize that it is the federal government that has helped them, and will experience no change in their perception of the role of government, or realize the failure of conservative free-market fundamentalism. The ultimate irony is what the promoters of Kynect have experienced : the more that people know that these plans they like are actually ""Obamacare,"" the less likely the law is to succeed.

Sometimes, helping people is a thankless job."

Ms. Tavenner, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that “nearly 700,000 applications have been submitted to the federal and state marketplaces” in the last four weeks. But she repeatedly refused to say how many of those people had actually enrolled in health insurance plans since the federal and state marketplaces, or exchanges, opened on Oct. 1. “That number will not be available until mid-November,” Ms. Tavenner said. “We expect the initial number to be small.”

The testimony from Tavenner was actually very credible if you saw or heard it, reviewing that prior to ACA, insurance was far from adequate. The fact is it's going to be impossible to really judge how things are working for weeks to come, until we get a sense of enrollment numbers beyond success stories like KY and failures like the healthcare.gov rollout. But that won't stop media from chasing the shiny object and offering judgment anyway. And nothing will stop GOP criticism, which ought not to be taken at face value from people who have a stake in having the program fail even as Americans want it to succeed. Republicans can't run away from that no matter how many hearings they hold.

CHIRBlog:

There’s been a lot of breathless journalism lately – with each day’s events apparently a referendum on the success – or failure – of the Affordable Care Act. One of the latest story lines involves people with individual health insurance policies receiving policy cancellations from their insurance companies. What’s Really Happening? Having an insurance company discontinue an insurance policy is not anything new. And actually, the term “policy cancellation” is a misnomer. Generally, an individual health insurance policy is sold via a 12-month contract between the insurer and the consumer. At the end of that contract period, the insurer has the option to discontinue or change that policy – nothing in federal law changes that. Current policyholders are not having their current policy cancelled – rather, the insurance company is exercising its option to discontinue the policy at the end of the contract year.

Though some people might pay more than they did before, they and many others will also get more. Among other things, they will be less financially vulnerable when they get sick — in some cases dramatically less. Their new plans will also put taxpayers at less risk of having to cover big medical bills when under-insured patients unexpectedly fall very ill. That goes, too, for people who currently decline to buy insurance but who will have to next year. Reform still might not sound like a great deal to people who are young, feel healthy and don’t want to pay for coverage . Yet having lots of healthy people paying into the new system on its terms will not only limit their financial risk, but also their participation will allow others who have been priced out of the health-insurance market — those with serious preexisting conditions, for example — to obtain good coverage. They deserve compassion, too. None of this is an outrage. It’s the predictable result of a defensible policy choice embedded in the reform.

The story, however, wasn’t as straightforward as the CBS News account suggested. As pointed out here and here, Barrette’s $50 insurance plan was shot through with holes, particularly with respect to hospitalization. The Obamacare-compliant plan that she was offered in its place must comply with a set of basic standards, including hospitalization. Following all the ruckus, Fox News host Greta Van Susteren interviewed Barrette on last night’s edition of her program “On the Record.” The deficiencies of Barrette’s longtime plan got plenty of attention from Van Susteren: VAN SUSTEREN: I must say though that your policy is like, you know, if you are walking across the street and someone runs a red light, you are in deep trouble under your existing policy.

BARRETTE: That is true. Now there’s something: Fox News, clearing up the distorted and negative impressions left by the mainstream media on Obamacare. Following her chat with Van Susteren, Barrette got word from a network producer that her appointment to appear this morning on Fox News was cancelled, she tells the Erik Wemple Blog.

It would have been perfectly fine for Obama to say most Americans get to keep their coverage or to qualify his statement in some other way. And administration officials offered such nuance when asked. But Obama offered more absolute and ironclad promises when he spoke publicly—and, distressingly, some of his advisors are making similarly sweeping statements now. Such declarations lie ""somewhere between an oversimplification and a falsehood,"" as Jonathan Chait puts it. In short, the president's critics have a point. But ultimately the more important question is about what’s actually happening to these people losing their current policies—and why. This transformation is not just a consequence of Obamacare. It's very much the intent. And for very good reason. By nearly everybody's reckoning, the ""non-group"" market is the most dysfunctional part of the American health insurance system. The dysfunction takes two primary forms. First, insurers have been selective about whom they would cover and how—charging higher premiums, covering fewer services, or simply denying benefits outright to people with pre-existing medical conditions. About half of all Americans have at least one such condition, according to official estimates, so roughly speaking about half the population couldn't reliably find comprehensive, affordable coverage if they had to buy it on their own.

It isn’t over yet, but a bookie today would predict a Terry McAuliffe victory in the Virginia governor’s election next week. Washington Post polling shows the Democratic businessman and fundraiser with a double-digit lead (51 percent to 39 percent) over Republican Ken Cuccinelli II following a campaign ad blitz that shredded the sitting attorney general over his conservative views. It’s not that voters love McAuliffe. They just don’t like Cuccinelli — and they really don’t like the Republican Party. ... So it isn’t over yet, in Virginia or elsewhere, but Republicans have little time to regain the trust and confidence of the non-ideological centrist majority. It’s time to dump the tea party in the Potomac.

Howard, which nurtured civil rights warriors like Andrew Young, Thurgood Marshall and Charles Hamilton Houston, has played a special role in the work of integration. But an unspeakable conclusion has followed from that work — that the job of Howard University is to pave the way for its own obsolescence. That terrible tension was on vivid display last weekend at Howard. A group of us — black parents with ties to The Mecca, as we call it — returned for Homecoming weekend. The football game (versus Morgan State University) was sloppy. A great many of the best college football players are black, but since the fall of Jim Crow, schools like Howard have not been able to compete for them. But at a black school, football is barely the point. The point is the bands that battle at halftime. The point is the affection in the stands, the warm banter between us, which we invented out on the margins of America. Howard won. We cheered and walked out on the Yard where thousands of black college students and black college graduates assembled in reunion. Love was free-flowing. Cameras were passed. Memory cards were filled. I walked past Douglass Hall, and thought of my professors who put The Struggle in my heart and Consciousness in my head. There was tailgating just off campus. The entire community was there, from hustlers running card games to Kappas running steps."

Earlier this month, 38 news organizations, including the Associated Press, ABC News, The Washington Post, and Reuters demanded more photojournalist access to the president. The White House responded with what one reporter described as a middle finger. Now some news organizations are responding by formalizing policies not to publish White House-distributed photographs.

Last week the USA Today announced that it will not use “handout photos originating from the White House Press Office, except in very extraordinary circumstances.” The next day McClatchy joined the conditional boycott:

“The editors of McClatchy newspapers have agreed not to publish photography issued by the White House,” McClatchy Vice President for News/Washington Editor Anders Gyllenhaal told staffers in an email Tuesday night. The policy is not “a significant departure from current practices,” he says.

Both McClatchy and USA Today claim that these were their policies anyway, which makes one wonder what the point is.

For those of us outside the DC-Manhattan bubble, it is really quite incredible to watch the elite media crybaby in this way. Our media has extraordinary power, when they choose to use it. The problem is that, when it comes to this president, they rarely choose to use it.

No one respects their sycophants, which is why this White House is so comfortable ignoring, dismissing, and even ridiculing the mainstream media.

This whole brouhaha surrounding photojournalist access is a perfect example. Nothing changes and what happens? The White House receives a strongly worded internal policy affirmation.

If the media want some respect from this White House, they need to start doing something as simple as their jobs. But the White House knows that no matter how shabbily they treat the media, the media will still carry their water. For example, the ObamaCare cover ups continue to this day. Sure, the media is covering the smoking guns as they become too obvious to ignore, but they still refuse to warn the public that millions more insurance cancellations are coming.

The media’s laughable and humiliating impotence will continue until they man up and stop running point for Obama’s agenda.

Personally, I don’t believe the media’s protests about a lack of photojournalist access have anything to do with journalistic integrity. I think the media’s upset because they can’t get close to their sun king.

How do we know?,"Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett has lately been getting credit in the political press for being one of those Republican governors coming around on the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Advocates for the underprivileged can’t understand why.

They’re right to wonder. Corbett’s “Healthy Pennsylvania” plan, which was released for public comment this week, is a sham. It would reduce health benefits for many of his neediest citizens and impose punitive conditions on their coverage. It requires waiver approval from the federal government that’s almost certain to be refused, because some of its provisions are in flagrant violation of federal law. And even if it were approved, Corbett waited so long to put his plan together that it probably couldn’t be implemented until 2015. In the meantime, 500,000 of his citizens will be medically uncovered.

“He’s being very disingenuous,” says Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. “He knows a lot of this proposal is not approvable” under federal law.

Corbett’s proposal shows that many Republicans still aren’t done posturing with their citizens’ lives, even as some have done the right thing--among them Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Jan Brewer of Arizona. Some GOP governors, like Rick Perry of Texas and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, seem determined to take their neediest citizens all the way down--they’re not budging on their refusal to expand Medicaid coverage.

Corbett wants to have it both ways. He intends to masquerade as a feeling governor intent on bringing healthcare to the masses at practical cost. But beneath the fancy dress lies a cynical politician who knows his plan isn’t practical. If it gets rejected he’ll blame the Obama administration. “We tried,” he’ll say. “But they blocked us.” Don’t be taken in.

The plan requires premiums to be paid by Medicaid enrollees with monthly incomes as low as $479, at which level the premiums would be $13 a month. Think that’s not too bad? Try living on that monthly income and scraping together a single extra dollar. What’s worse is that Corbett’s plan would throw people off the coverage rolls for three months if they miss a single premium payment. The second miss gets them barred for six months and the third for nine months.

This punitive provision belongs in the dictionary next to the term “counterproductive.” If your goal is to enroll people in a health program, the idea is to lower barriers to entry, not raise them. The Medicaid population, by definition, is one with spotty income at best. The likelihood that they might miss a premium payment is high. The last thing they need is for their government to stack the deck against their continuing access to healthcare.

Corbett’s administration describes this provision in its waiver application designed “to instill a sense of personal responsibility into the program and reinforce incentives for healthier behaviors.” If there’s a depiction of the poor that drips more with contempt and arrogance than that, I’m not sure I want to hear it.

Corbett would also require that adults in the program sign up for “work search.” This is another punitive feature barred by federal law; healthcare programs are not employment programs, and mixing them is likely to harm both efforts. Corbett argues that working people are healthier people, so it’s all to the good. But that’s the sort of facile claim that dishonest politicians make.

“He has the correlation backwards,” Alker says. “Healthcare helps address the medical problems that may be keeping people from working. Shutting people from coverage is not a smart way to impose health.” Conditioning healthcare on efforts to find work is more likely to condemn the target population to a cycle of illness and joblessness. It sounds good, but only if you’re tone deaf.

Some analysts in Pennsylvania had Corbett’s number on this plan from the very start. As long ago as September, the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center saw the plan as a device to impose “significant reductions to the healthcare program that has served the state’s most vulnerable citizens for more than 50 years.”

As enacted under the Affordable Care Act, the expansion of Medicaid was clear and simple. Raise the income eligibility limits, which varied by state) to 138% of the poverty line and add populations otherwise uncovered, including poor single adults, and the federal government would cover 100% of the increased cost for three years, and 90% or more after that, through 2022.

This is obviously a bargain, as is evident to anyone not still playing with his toes. Only the most rock-ribbed ideologues have turned it down, but they’re in control of 25 states. As we’ve reported before, those states are giving up a net $40 billion a year in federal aid. Corbett wants to be considered a hero for finding a middle way, but he knows in his heart that he’s found no way.

It’s always the weapon and never the shooter. Twelve people are murdered in a rampage at the Washington Navy Yard, and before sundown Sen. Dianne Feinstein has called for yet another debate on gun violence. Major opprobrium is heaped on the AR-15, the semiautomatic used in the Newtown massacre.

Turns out no AR-15 was used at the Navy Yard. And the shotgun that was used was obtained legally in Virginia after the buyer, Aaron Alexis, had passed both a state and federal background check.

As was the case in the Tucson shooting — instantly politicized into a gun-control and (fabricated) tea-party-climate-of-violence issue — the origin of this crime lies not in any politically expedient externality but in the nature of the shooter.

On Aug. 7, that same Alexis had called police from a Newport, R.I., Marriott. He was hearing voices. Three people were following him, he told the cops. They were sending microwaves through walls, making his skin vibrate and preventing him from sleeping. He had already twice changed hotels to escape the men, the radiation, the voices.

Delusions, paranoid ideation, auditory (and somatic) hallucinations: the classic symptoms of schizophrenia.

So here is this panic-stricken soul, psychotic and in terrible distress. And what does modern policing do for him? The cops tell him to “stay away from the individuals that are following him.” Then they leave.

But the three “individuals” were imaginary, for God’s sake. This is how a civilized society deals with a man in such a state of terror?

Had this happened 35 years ago in Boston, Alexis would have been brought to me as the psychiatrist on duty at the emergency room of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Were he as agitated and distressed as in the police report, I probably would have administered an immediate dose of Haldol, the most powerful fast-acting antipsychotic of the time.

This would generally have relieved the hallucinations and delusions, a blessing not only in itself, but also for the lucidity brought on that would have allowed him to give us important diagnostic details — psychiatric history, family history, social history, medical history, etc. If I had thought he could be sufficiently cared for by family or friends to receive regular oral medication, therapy and follow-up, I would have discharged him. Otherwise, I’d have admitted him. And if he refused, I’d have ordered a 14-day involuntary commitment.

Sounds cruel? On the contrary. For many people living on park benches, commitment means a warm bed, shelter and three hot meals a day. For Alexis, it would have meant the beginning of a treatment regimen designed to bring him back to himself before discharging him to a world heretofore madly radioactive.

That’s what a compassionate society does. It would no more abandon this man to fend for himself than it would a man suffering a stroke. And as a side effect, that compassion might even extend to potential victims of his psychosis — in the event, remote but real, that he might someday burst into some place of work and kill 12 innocent people.

Instead, what happened? The Newport police sent their report to the local naval station, where it promptly disappeared into the ether. Alexis subsequently twice visited VA hospital ERs, but without any florid symptoms of psychosis and complaining only of sleeplessness, the diagnosis was missed. (He was given a sleep medication.) He fell back through the cracks.

True, psychiatric care is underfunded and often scarce. But Alexis had full access to the VA system. The problem here was not fiscal but political and, yes, even moral.

I know the civil libertarian arguments. I know that involuntary commitment is outright paternalism. But paternalism is essential for children because they don’t have a fully developed rational will. Do you think Alexis was in command of his will that night in Newport?

We cannot, of course, be cavalier about commitment. We should have layers of review, albeit rapid. But it’s both cruel and reckless to turn loose people as lost and profoundly suffering as Alexis, even apart from any potential dangerousness.

More than half of those you see sleeping on grates have suffered mental illness. It’s a national scandal. It’s time we recalibrated the pendulum that today allows the mentally ill to die with their rights on — and, rarely but unforgivably, take a dozen innocents with them.

Bobby Jindal sees the infighting that has seized the GOP in Washington as ""fratricide"" – brother killing brother.

Moderate conservatives have criticized the House Republican strategy of tying the defunding of Obamacare to government spending, the core dispute that has triggered the shutdown.

But Jindal, who last year said Republicans have to ""stop being the stupid party,"" held back.

""I don't even want to engage in Republican fratricide. There are more than enough Republicans fighting each other, going after each other,"" Jindal said in an interview on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper.""



The Louisiana governor said it makes sense to repeal and replace Obamacare, but maybe it should be left to Republicans outside the capital. Jindal is chairman of the Republican Governors Association, which is launching a new national program.

""We want to take back the Republican brand from D.C. For too long, we've outsourced it to Washington. We've got 30 Republican governors doing a great job across the state capitals, across the country. The important discussions aren't happening in D.C.,"" said Jindal

New Orleans newspaper The Times-Picayune reported that as of Thursday, only 12 people had signed up for Obamacare in Louisiana state through healthcare.gov. About 20% of the state does not have health insurance. Jindal did not take Obamacare money to expand Medicaid to provide insurance for them.

""The wrong thing to do is to expand the government control,"" said Jindal. ""In my own state, for example, for every uninsured person that would have been covered by a Medicaid expansion, more than one person who would have otherwise had private insurance would then be kicked out or lose that private insurance instead of going to a government-run program. That makes no sense.""

Though Jindal acknowledged some positive aspects of the president's health care law.

""The president was right. There are real problems in health care. I think if you've got a preexisting condition, if you’re trying to buy an individual policy outside the group market, it can be too expensive and may not be available to you,"" he said.

Republicans need to do more than repeat cries to repeal Obamacare, said Jindal

""We need to replace it. I've written extensively on some of the ideas for example, allowing folks to buy insurance across state lines, tax credits and rebates to make it more affordable for those who can’t afford it,"" said Jindal.

The governor released a press release yesterday indicating he has privacy concerns surrounding the Obama Administrations use of taxpayer-funded organizers called 'Navigators' to sign up Floridians on federal health exchanges. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

State leaders in Florida ""should hang their heads in shame,"" according to a scathing missive from the New York Times' editorial board.

That's because Florida has the second-highest number of residents without health insurance, according to new census data, yet the Republican-controlled government remains opposed to expanding Medicaid coverage to the poor under the Affordable Care Act.

Only Texas beats the uninsured population of the Sunshine State, where 24.8 percent of residents under 65 were uninsured in 2011, the most recent year figures were available from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Associated Press reports.

Of those 3.8 million uninsured Floridians, more than 500,000 are younger than 19, according to the Miami Herald.

Despite the alarming rates, Florida has moved to thwart the expansion of Medicaid, a key component of the ACA. The state refused to enlarge the program using federal funds and also declined to set up a state-run exchange. While Governor Rick Scott (R) led an unsuccessful push to overturn the ACA in court, Florida's House republicans turned their backs on the Senate's bipartisan expansion plan, choosing to use $300 million in state funds to purchase coverage for 130,000 Floridians instead of federal grants that would cover an estimated 1.1 million residents.

By insisting on an alternative to the ACA, Florida turned away an estimated total of $50 billion in federal funding spread over the next decade to a number of crucial programs -- including a federally funded, voluntary home visitation program proven to prevent child abuse, infant drug dependency, and unemployment.

State Rep. Matt Hudson (R-Naples), then chair of the state's Health Care Appropriations Subcommittee, told the Times in 2011 that the state was not required to accept federal grants.

“I do not believe that act is the right thing for the country or the right thing for Florida,” he said, ""and I am not going to start implementing things that I don’t believe in.""

Florida voters rejected a symbolic amendment against the ACA last fall -- and Scott eventually endorsed expansion -- but the legislature didn't stop there. Scott and others approved a law last month requiring a disclosure form that will tell policyholders how the Affordable Care Act will impact their premiums. An ""incredible waste of money,"" Florida Consumer Action Network's Bill Newton called the move, while others criticized the state for knowingly using inaccurate numbers to describe the cost of expansion.

Scott even raised privacy concerns over data that will collected by ""navigators"" hired to help low-income Floridians negotiate the new national insurance exchanges.

""In states like Florida that seem determined to sabotage reform,"" wrote the Times editorial board, ""the uninsured may have a very hard time getting the coverage they need and deserve."""
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/05/obamacare-premiums_n_3869782.html,2013-09-05 00:00:00,['Senior Reporter'],Obamacare Premiums Will Vary Widely By State And City: Report,"The premiums for coverage available on the health insurance exchanges created by President Barack Obama's health care reform law will vary widely from state to state, according to a new Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of data published by 17 states and the District of Columbia.

Retail prices for health insurance can be considerably different based in part on the cost of health care services where a person lives, even within the same state, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported Wednesday. Premiums also vary based on age, family size and tobacco use. But under Obamacare, prices cannot be based on someone's medical history and patients with preexisting condition cannot be turned away. The law also mandates a set of minimum benefits that includes hospitalizations, prescription drugs and maternity care.

The prices included in the report don't include health benefits provided by employers because the health insurance exchanges are intended for the uninsured and those who don't get job-based health plans.

The actual premiums for the health plans on the exchanges have been a chief unknown since Obama enacted the health care law in 2010 and although complete information won't be available until the exchanges open, the Kaiser Family Foundation examined detailed data published by state authorities to create a snapshot of what coverage will cost.

In Baltimore, a 40-year-old will be able to buy a so-called bronze health insurance plan for as little as $146 a month, compared to $336 a month in Burlington, Vt., not including the savings from tax credits available to people who earn up to four times the federal poverty level -- $45,960 for a single person this year -- according to the report.

The health insurance exchanges in all 50 states and the District of Columbia are slated to open Oct. 1 for small businesses, uninsured people, and for people who don't get health benefits at work, to comparison shop and to learn whether they qualify for financial assistance. People who get health benefits from large employers or who are enrolled in government programs like Medicare don't need to use the exchanges. Employers provide coverage to 150 million U.S. residents, according to census data, and virtually all large firms are expected to continue doing so next year despite the Obama administration's one-year delay of the law's requirement that large companies cover workers or pay a penalty.

The exchanges will sell four tiers of health insurance -- bronze, silver, gold and platinum -- indicating how generous the coverage is. Bronze plans will tend to have the lowest premiums, but expose consumers to the highest possible out-of-pocket costs and platinum plans will have the highest prices but the lowest additional expenses. Those younger than 30 can purchase so-called catastrophic insurance with minimal coverage at a lower price, but cannot apply federal tax credits to these plans.

The Kaiser Family Foundation didn't compare the premiums on the health insurance exchange with the cost of health insurance for those who don't get health benefits at work today, however. The new law's guaranteed benefits, prohibition against turning down people with preexisting conditions will make health insurance on this market too different from what's currently available, the report says.

""These changes make direct comparisons of exchange premiums and existing individual market premiums complicated, and doing so would require speculative assumptions and data that are not publicly available,"" it says. Some people, most likely young adults who don't qualify for financial assistance, may see higher prices as a result.

The variation isn't limited to bronze plans, the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis reveals. ""The lowest cost exchange silver exchange plan available range in cost for a 40-year-old from $194 per month in Portland, Oregon, to $395 per month for a 40-year-old in Burlington, Vermont, before tax credits,"" the report says.

Under Obamacare, people whose incomes range from poverty, $11,490 for a single person this year, and 400 percent of poverty may be eligible for tax credits to buy private insurance. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia are running their own exchanges while the federal government will at least partly manage exchanges, also called marketplaces, in the remaining states.

""Most people buying their own insurance will qualify for premium tax credits, which will significantly lower the cost of their premiums,"" the Kaiser Family Foundation report says. The foundation also notes that premiums released so far are lower than projected by the Congressional Budget Office.

People who earn up to 133 percent of poverty, or $15,282 for an individual this year, can enroll in Medicaid if they live in the District of Columbia or one of the 24 states that are expanding the program under the law.

The Kaiser Family Foundation examined insurance company filings to state regulators in 17 states and the District of Columbia and analyzed the prices in the largest cities in each jurisdiction for people at ages 25, 40, and 60. At least two health insurance companies are offering products in all of the locations included in the report. California has the largest number of companies participating in its exchange, Covered California, at 12, while HealthSource RI in Rhode Island and Maine's federally run marketplace each have two companies.

Eligibility for tax credits via the exchanges is determined based on the maximum amount of a person's income they must spend on health insurance and the price of the second-cheapest silver-level health insurance plan where they live. In addition to the tax credits for annual premiums, people who earn up to two-and-a-half times poverty can qualify for additional subsidies to cover their out-of-pocket costs like copayments and deductibles. Most legal residents of the United States must obtain coverage or face a tax penalty under the law's individual mandate.

The full Kaiser Family Foundation report includes breakdowns for each example in every one of the metropolitan areas examined."

As thousands of Americans receive insurance plan cancellation notices, President Obama's oft-repeated statement that anyone who likes their health plan can keep it is now a ripe target. And an Aug. 4, 2009 White House blog that tried to calm rising concerns over the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare -- in the context of today's developments -- makes some spurious claims.

""Opponents of health insurance reform may find the truth a little inconvenient, but as our second president famously said, 'facts are stubborn things,'"" Macon Phillips, then-director of White House digital strategy, wrote at the time.

The blog, part of the White House website's so-called ""reality check,"" is chockfull of ""explainer"" videos from people like Linda Douglass, the communications director for the White House's Health Reform Office. In one, she says one of her jobs ""is to keep track of all the disinformation about health insurance reform.""

She admonishes the media for causing alarm and alerting the public on the possible pitfalls associated with the law. She then throws to a video of Obama speaking at a July 28, 2009 AARP event.

""Here's a guarantee that I've made,"" Obama says in the video. ""If you have insurance that you like, then you will be able to keep that insurance.""

""Nobody is trying to change what works in the system,"" Obama says. ""We are trying to change what doesn't work in the system.""

Douglass then throws to another clip from a speech the president made on June 23, 2009 touting the benefits of the health care law.

""If you like your plan, and you like your doctor, you won't have to do a thing,"" Obama said. ""You keep your plan. You keep your doctor. If your employer is providing you with good insurance, terrific! We're not going to mess with it.""

In the years since the video warning the public about the media spin on ObamaCare was made, the administration has had a lot of explaining to do. Most recently, they've acknowledged how plans from March 2010 and earlier would be grandfathered in -- but only if the insurance provider has not made significant changes to them.

The president has recently come under fire for promising to make buying insurance as easy as purchasing a plane ticket online or a ""TV on Amazon."" The turbulence that followed the rocky rollout of the Oct. 1 online healthcare exchanges were brushed aside by the White House as ""glitches.""

On Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified at a House hearing where she personally apologized for the failures associated with the rollout. ""Hold me accountable for the debacle,"" she said. ""I'm responsible.""

She deflected charges that the administration misled the American people about being able to keep their health plans.

When asked by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, about why people were getting cancellation notices from their insurance companies and why a change was made allowing certain insurance policies to be ruled ineligible under ObamaCare, Sebelius claimed, ""There was no change."""
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/18/obama-health-care_n_3617836.html,2013-07-18 00:00:00,['Senior Reporter'],Obama Health Care Speech Touts Rebates For Health Insurance Customers,"Flanked by health insurance customers who received rebates because of Obamacare, President Barack Obama on Thursday highlighted his health care reform law's benefits for people who already have coverage.

Over the past two years, 21.5 million health insurance consumers have gotten $1.6 billion in rebates because their providers spent less than 80 percent of the premiums they paid on medical care, rather than overhead or profit, as the Obama administration announced last month. On Thursday, Obama sought to heighten awareness of such parts of the health care law that already are in effect, ahead of a major campaign to enroll a targeted 7 million more people in health insurance starting Oct. 1.

""If you're one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance -- could be through your employer or through Medicare or through Medicaid -- you already have an array of new benefits in place,"" Obama said during remarks at the White House. ""You don't have to wait until Oct. 1. You're already getting benefits even if you don't know if it's because of the Affordable Care Act.""

The administration faces significant challenges to getting those health insurance exchanges ready for the six-month enrollment period that begins in October, and it is embarking on a major effort to promote enrollment in health insurance and Medicaid among people -- especially the young, healthy, and poor -- who are uninsured or currently buy their own health insurance. The difficulty of the task and doubts about the administration's readiness are underscored by the White House's decision to delay a separate requirement that large employers cover their workers of face penalties of up to $3,000 per worker.

The biggest parts of the health care law not yet online -- and the hardest measures to put into place -- will affect the uninsured.

""Our broken health care system threatened the hopes and dreams of families and business across the country who feared that one illness or one accident could cost them everything they spent a lifetime building. Step by step, we're fixing that system,"" Obama said Thursday. ""Affordable health care is not some privilege just for the few. It's a basic right that everybody should be able to enjoy.""

But he also must assuage concerns of the majority of Americans who already are covered by job-based health insurance and government programs like Medicare and Medicaid that Obamacare will upend their benefits. The president sought to promote the insurance rebates as an example of how the law has positively affected currently insured people.

""Millions of Americans opened letters from their insurance companies, but instead of the usual dread that comes from getting a bill, they were pleasantly surprised with a check,"" he said. ""Most folks wouldn't know when that check comes in that this was because of Obamacare.""

Obama also touted the news, reported Wednesday by The New York Times, that health insurance premiums in New York state will decline by as much as half under Obamacare next year, not counting the tax credits available to low- and middle-income people.

Health insurance premiums in 10 states and the District of Columbia will be lower on average than projected by the Congressional Budget Office, the Department of Health and Human Services reported in an analysis released Thursday. Premiums will vary greatly from state to state and based on individuals' ages and other factors, and will be higher for some people next year.

On average, the lowest premium for a ""silver"" plan -- the second-least-generous of four levels of coverage available to anyone on the exchanges -- in those states will be $321 a month for a single person, compared to the $392 the CBO predicted, according to HHS. That represents an 18 percent difference, although the prices in those states could change before October.

HHS produced charts comparing the lowest and second-lowest average premiums for a silver-level plan in those 10 states and the District of Columbia. The first bar on the right represents the department's analysis of the CBO projections and the second shows the average across the states. New Mexico will have the lowest average health insurance premiums among the states, at $226, while the highest will be in Vermont, at $400, according to the analysis.

Republican opposition to Obamacare remains fierce, and the GOP brushed aside Obama's messages about New York's premiums and other positive effects of the law, emphasizing instead its potential negatives, like that some Americans may pay more for coverage next year. The House voted Wednesday to to repeal parts of the law, marking nearly 40 such attempts to eliminate, scale back or defund Obamacare since 2011.

""The picture that the president paints of his health care law looks nothing like the reality facing struggling American families,"" House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a press release after Obama's speech Thursday. ""House Republicans will continue our efforts to fully repeal the president’s health care law in its entirety once and for all.""

In his speech, Obama acknowledged political opposition to the law was affecting his administration's ability to carry it out and criticized House Republicans for ""re-fighting these old battles.""

But it's resistance to Obamacare at the state level that is having a more tangible impact on the law's reach. Just 16 states and the District of Columbia elected to manage their own health insurance exchanges, leaving the federal government responsible for the remainder, and as many as half of states won't expand Medicaid to more poor people under the law.

""In states that are working hard to make sure that this law delivers for their people, what we're seeing is that consumers are getting a hint of how much money that's going to be saved because of this law,"" Obama said, citing California, New York, Oregon and Washington state, where health insurance premiums for next year beat estimates.

""It's hard, it's a big country, and the health care industry is massive,"" he said. ""As we implement, there are going to be glitches and there are going to be certain states that, for political reasons, are resisting implementation. And we're just steadily working through all that stuff.""

(CNN) —

Can someone please explain to me the details of Obamacare? And when I say “someone,” I’m looking at you, President Obama – or at least members of your administration.

I can’t fathom how Obama, one of the best orators of modern-day politics, could be such a poor advocate for what’s arguably the crowning legislative achievement of his administration. I can assure you that if there were a law named after me – such as “Obeidallahcare” or “Deanaid” – I would be crisscrossing the country explaining it so people would understand and support it.

Sure, most of us get the broad strokes of the Affordable Care Act commonly known as Obamacare: the individual mandate, coverage for the uninsured, children on parents’ policy until 26, carriers cannot deny you coverage or charge you more due to a pre-existing condition. But the law is close to 1,000 pages and will spur hundreds, if not thousands, of regulations. What else does the law offer, and how will Americans be able to gain access to its benefits?

Will Obamacare help primary care?

Dean Obeidallah

We hear about state health insurance exchanges going into effect in October, but in the same breath we hear that many governors won’t implement them. We hear about the individual mandate obligating everyone to buy health insurance by 2014 or face a penalty, but then we hear the Obama administration has delayed the requirement that employers with more than 50 employees be required to provide health coverage until 2015.

It’s remarkable that there’s such confusion surrounding a piece of legislation signed into law more than three years ago – in March 2010. And I’m far from alone on this. A poll in April found that 40% of Americans didn’t even know if Obamacare is still in effect, which translates into roughly 130 million Americans not even knowing if the law still exists, let alone understanding the details of it.

Even more concerning is that a recent poll of doctors found by a wide margin that they are “not at all familiar” with how certain key provisions of the law will be implemented. And astoundingly, it appears that Democratic members of Congress don’t even fully grasp how Obamacare will be put into effect. That point was made crystal clear when Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, one of the early champions of the law, recently labeled the rollout of Obamacare “a huge train wreck coming down.” In response, Obama’s chief of staff has been spending time over the past three months giving presentations to Democrats in Congress so they can better understand the law.

Who loses out under Obamacare?

What’s even more surprising is that Obama has allowed the void of information from his end to be filled almost unchallenged by Republicans, who have been actively working to define the law in the worst possible terms. Unless Obama is mimicking the rope-a-dope fighting strategy made famous by Muhammad Ali, his administration’s outreach to the public on Obamacare has been an abysmal failure.

The consequence of Obama ceding the battlefield can be seen in a new poll that found 54% of Americans disapprove of the law and a record-high 39% want Congress to repeal it. The poll also found just 13% of Americans say the health care law will personally “help me,” but 38% believe the law will personally “hurt me.”

Maybe it was these poll numbers or perhaps being pushed by members of his own party, but it seems that Obama is finally aware of the public relations nightmare and possible policy failure staring him in the face. The administration has recently started organizing faith-based and community groups to help get out the word. The federal government just launched a multimillion-dollar campaign to educate people about coverage options under Obamacare.

It has even secured the support of the people at the Funny or Die comedy website to produce videos with well-known comedic actors explaining Obamacare – because nothing says “comedy gold” like a law about health insurance.

Obama meets with celebs who want to promote Obamacare

But why didn’t Obama utilize his great communication skills to explain this law to us sooner? Why hasn’t he traveled across the country waging something akin to his election campaign to sell his program?

And it’s not like Obama doesn’t see the value in taking his ideas directly to the American public to build support. Indeed, we saw Obama use this very tactic last week as he kicked off the first of a series of speeches regarding his proposals to strengthen and grow the economy. The president did mention Obamacare in that speech, pointing out that “the states that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down. Just last week, New York announced that premiums for consumers who buy their insurance in these online marketplaces will be at least 50% less than what they pay today.”

And what’s even more bizarre is that polls show strong support for many key provisions of Obamacare. The president could have (and should have) been touting these popular parts of the law for years, given that 61% of Americans favor allowing children to stay on the policy until they are 26 and 82% like the ban on insurance carriers from denying coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.

Could it be that Obama isn’t waging such a campaign because even he can’t explain this mammoth program in a way that will attract support? Is it possible that the president’s idealistic dream of what Obamacare was intended to be has been replaced three years later by an administrative nightmare?

The real reason why the Obama administration has remained largely invisible as Republicans have pummeled Obamacare may never truly be known. But it’s clear that Obamacare needs a massive infusion of PR care if it is going to succeed.

The host and producer of the original series, Spurlock will spend each of his eight episode's offering a ""deep-dive into pressing issues facing the U.S."" This weekend's premier episode covers the medical marijuana industry, and appearing on ""Piers Morgan Live,"" he offered some of his insights:

""What I was really intrigued by is the number of people who came in there, who for years had been strung out on countless medication,"" he says, speaking of his stint as an employee inside a California medical marijuana dispensary. ""We live in a country that medicates everything. You go to a doctor, suddenly we're going to give you a pill for whatever the problem may be.""

Spurlock detailed cases in which the marijuana helped those who took it as directed:

""There were people who were on six, seven different medications, that once they started going to the clinic, taking whatever cannabis they were prescribed by the doctor, suddenly they're off all this medication. Soldiers who were coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan who were so medicated they couldn't even function around their family members, couldn't even connect with them. Now suddenly can have a life back.""

Though allowing that such an example is a positive, the man behind ""Super Size Me"" also explained what one might describe as the problems with pot:

""A lot of folks that we spoke to who were kind of anti the campaign, they feel like, suddenly it's going to be the 60's again and kids are going to be out just wanting to get high, and not wanting to go to school, and we're going to become a lazy bunch of people who just sit around and eat Twinkies all the time.""

USATODAY

As of Saturday%2C officials said 50%2C000 people could visit the page at a time

States seeing success are bragging about their accomplishments

Insurers say there are still some concerns

All the glitches won't be gone, but the troubled federal health care website is expected to be working more smoothly on Sunday, the deadline that the administration set for improvements and fixes.

But beyond the HealthCare.gov update, experts say the best predictor for the federal exchange could be state health exchanges, where the technology already operates smoothly.

And though November enrollment numbers for HealthCare.gov are not expected to be released until later this month, a look at state enrollment numbers could hint at their direction, health experts say.

""I think we're already seeing this dichotomy unfold,"" said Stan Dorn, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. ""In California, they're ahead of their own targets.""

Now that officials say the federal website is functioning properly for most Americans, health care proponents — and politicians, including the president, who have staked their careers on the merits of the Affordable Care Act — are hoping for a similar boon for HealthCare.gov's enrollment numbers. As of Saturday, officials said 50,000 people could visit the page at a time, with a potential for 800,000 visitors a day.

After a glitch-filled rollout kept Americans from even attempting to access the federal health insurance plans, federal officials reported that only about 23,000 people signed up for private insurance through HealthCare.gov. And only about 100,000 signed up for private plans through both the federal and state-based exchanges.

But the state numbers quickly began to go up as the states addressed their own website glitches, while at the same time boosting marketing efforts. Early successes included Kentucky, a Republican stronghold that decided to expand Medicaid and build a state-based exchange.

""There is great variation by state,"" Dorn said. ""In states that are enthusiastically implementing the law and trying to implement the state exchanges and trying to increase enrollment, there's going to be greater numbers.""

In other states, such as Oklahoma where there's no mention of the Affordable Care Act on the state website beyond to bash the law, it's going to be a tougher ride, he said.

""There are a lot more resources available in the states that are doing their own exchange,"" Dorn said. Those states received federal funds to market their exchanges.

And, he said, it's easier for one state to handle marketing, technology and enrollment for just one exchange than it is for the federal government to manage all of those issues for the 35 states that chose not to create state-based exchanges.

The states seeing success are bragging about their accomplishments, while at the same time carefully edging around commenting about the problems at the federal site. But they've also been pretty vocal about the problems the state websites faced, too.

""We opened on Oct. 1, and we had an overwhelming volume,"" said Donna Frescatore, executive director of the New York state health exchange. ""In the next three to four days, we quadrupled the capacity of the system, but that was something we planned for.""

As of Tuesday, New York's enrollment numbers showed 76,177 had enrolled in a health plan, up from 48,162 on Nov. 12. And 257,414 people had completed their exchange applications, up from 197,011.

""I think that from the very beginning, we had a very engaged community in New York state,"" Frescatore said. ""We have lots of helpers on the ground.""

Before the launch, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said the states and federal government would share with each other what was working best to get people enrolled.

""We've had ongoing discussions throughout the entire process,"" Frescatore said. ""We think that there are opportunities here for all states and the federal marketplace to gain coverage, so we're certainly supportive.""

New York officials expected 1.1 million to sign up by the end of three years.

""We are at or slightly above target, so we are very pleased,"" Frescatore said.

Tuesday, California said enrollment applications grew from 334,027 as of Nov. 16 to 385,556 as of Nov. 23. Kentucky announced it would add an 80% increase in capacity by Dec. 2, and that more than 60,000 people had enrolled in coverage by Nov. 26. In Washington, more than 150,000 have started applications.





But Oregon still hasn't gotten its website off the ground, so people are manually entering paper applications, and Colorado's exchange is falling behind projections.



Doug Piper, vice president of product strategy at Vision Solutions, a technology protection and disaster recovery provider, said the next step for the federal exchange, even if there's a sudden jump in enrollment, needs to be an aggressive, clear marketing campaign.

""To drive this thing home, you need a Gen. Patton or someone who's going to take no prisoners and drive this project home,"" he said. ""I think confidence needs to be restored, and that comes from articulating a clear, demonstrated plan, and that you can then show your track record. You have to distill that down to some meaningful set of milestones to restore confidence.""

Insurers say there are still some concerns. Karen Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans, said that while the site continues to improve, she's worried that ""back-end"" issues — or the non-consumer portion of the site that ensures insurers receive subsidy payments — will not be ready by Jan. 1. There have also been problems with ""834"" forms, or the process by which the government gives insurers data about whom they're insuring.

""HealthCare.gov and the overall enrollment process continue to improve, but there are significant issues that still need to be addressed,"" Ignagni said. ""Health plans will continue to support federal and state officials' efforts to fix the ongoing technical problems and improve the direct enrollment process so that consumers can get the coverage they need.""

Julie Bataille, director of the office of communications for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said those back-end processes will be completed by the middle of January, and that officials made an ""intentional decision"" to focus on the consumer end of the website.

Last week, Bataille announced a pilot program where people may enroll directly in the federal program through one of 16 insurers, rather than through the federal website.

""We continue to work with issuers to understand their issues, both as the fixes we put in place improve their processes for things like direct enrollment, and we'll also work with them as we continue to build the system for some of those financial management functions,"" Bataille said."

Acting at the request of an order of nuns in Colorado, Justice Sotomayor issued the stay just hours before the requirement was to go into effect on New Year’s Day. She gave the Obama administration until Friday to respond to the Supreme Court.

Justice Sotomayor’s order applies to the nuns, the Little Sisters of the Poor, and other Roman Catholic nonprofit groups that use the same health plan, known as the Christian Brothers Employee Benefit Trust. The groups’ lawsuit is one of many challenging the federal requirement for contraceptive coverage, but a decision on the merits of that case by the full Supreme Court could have broader implications.

“We are delighted with the ruling,” said Mark L. Rienzi, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, who represented the nuns in the lawsuit. “We are delighted that the Supreme Court will require the government to file briefs in the court on this matter.” The Little Sisters of the Poor operate nursing homes for low-income people in the United States and around the world."

At least eight others states -- California, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington -- have rejected the president’s Nov. 14 proposal that insurance companies offer plans that don’t comply with ObamaCare requirements for at least a year. Connecticut decided Friday.

Though ObamaCare is federal law, governors and insurance commissioners must allow providers to make the exceptions because insurance is regulated differently in each state.

Obama in touting his sweeping health-care reform law before signing it in 2010 told Americans they could keep their existing insurance plans if they liked them.

However, many of those plans do not meet the law's new standards, which has resulted in millions of cancellation notices being mailed out over the past few months and the president announcing his proposed solution.

""We are not going to gut this law,"" Obama said during a speech in Cleveland. ""We will fix what needs to be fixed, but we're going to make the Affordable Care Act work.""

This is not the first so-called fix the president has proposed, starting with him putting a one-year delay on the ObamaCare mandate that small businesses provide insurance to employees, to allow owners to sort through the complex paperwork.

And the White House this week extended the enrollment deadline after the disastrous Oct. 1 rollout of the healthcare.gov website.

Officials said Friday they would extend the Dec. 15 deadline to Dec. 23 for insurance coverage that kicks in Jan 1. Those who fail to enroll by March 15 face a tax penalty.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, last week rejected the offer, saying his state exchange is working well and the state-run website has not had the technical glitches like the federal site.

One of the biggest concerns among state officials is that allowing residents to wait a year will make the overall ObamaCare situation worse because the young, healthy people needed to enroll and cover the cost of the elderly and other more costly customers will indeed wait.

Minnesota Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton and other governors reportedly said no to the Obama offer over concerns it would destabilize their states insurance markets and result in higher premiums for too many residents.

On Thursday, California’s health insurance exchange voted unanimously against the proposal.

The Covered California Board of Directors decided instead to stick with its approach of phasing out the non-compliant policies by year’s end, saying Obama’s request that insurers let Americans keep those plans through 2014 will not help consumers in the end.

“The board cited that extending the deadline offers no benefit to the consumer and may create confusion about accessing affordable health care coverage through Covered California,” it said in a press release.

However, at least a dozen states have agreed to the proposal or were already allowing insurers to let customers renew existing plans.

Among them are Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon and Texas. Roughly another 20 states have yet to decide.

The other major factor is whether insurance companies will comply.

North Carolina Blue Cross Blue Shield and Florida Blue have agreed but Blue Cross Blue Shield Alabama did not.

The Alabama group said Wednesday that temporarily reinstating out-of-compliance policies would “destabilize” the state’s insurance market and that “the ultimate impact would be higher healthcare costs for all of our customers, now and in the near future.”"

Measure would restrict abortions to the first 20 weeks after conception

The White House has released a veto threat

The bill has little chance of passing the Senate

WASHINGTON — The Republican-led House of Representatives approved a far-reaching bill to ban a woman's ability to seek an abortion after 20 weeks on a mostly party-line 228-196 vote Tuesday.

It stands no chance of becoming law under the Obama administration. The White House issued a veto threat Monday, calling the bill an ""assault on a woman's right to choose."" The Democratic Senate also has not scheduled a vote on the legislation.

However, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, justified the vote as a response to the recent murder conviction of Philadelphia physician Kermit Gosnell for abortion procedures conducted in his medical clinic. ""Listen, after this Kermit Gosnell trial and some of the horrific acts that were going on, the vast majority of the American people believe in the substance of this bill, and so do I,"" Boehner said.

The bill included an exemption for women who get pregnant through rape or incest as long as they first report the sexual assault to legal authorities. It was added at the last minute by House Republican leaders after a broader Democratic amendment to add the exemption was defeated in the House Judiciary Committee last week. ""It shows a distrust of women and a lack of the reality of sexual assaults,"" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., regarding the legal conditions placed on the exemption.

The legislation stirred a heated debate in the House. The majority of Democrats opposed the legislation and argued that House Republicans— 88% of whom are white males —were out of touch with women.

Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., the sponsor of the bill and a long-time abortion rights opponent, was a target of criticism last week when he commented in a June 12 committee hearing on the bill that the ""incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy (is) very low."" He later said he meant that third-trimester abortions of pregnancies caused by rape are rare.

Republicans tapped a woman, Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, to moderate the House floor debate, although she does not serve on the Judiciary Committee that has jurisdiction over the legislation. There are no Republican women on that panel. Another Republican woman, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, presided over the debate. Democrats also tapped a female lawmaker, Judiciary Committee member Lofgren, to lead the debate for their party.

""This is an area that has overwhelming public support,"" Blackburn said. ""This is a step that needs to be taken to protect life.""

The debate invigorated outside groups and activists on both sides of the abortion debate. Penny Nance, president of Concerned Women for America, called it ""the most important pro-life bill to be considered by the U.S. Congress in the last 10 years"" and expressed confidence that it would eventually become law. NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue called the bill ""shameless politics"" and accused abortion opponents in Congress of ""catering to the most extreme wing of their political base.""

Most states allow abortions up to the point when the fetus becomes viable, generally considered to be about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Franks' bill would ban abortions that take place 20 weeks after conception, which is equivalent to 22 weeks of pregnancy.

Ten states have passed laws similar to the House bill, and several are facing court challenges. Last month, a federal court struck down as unconstitutional Arizona's law, which differs slightly in banning abortion 20 weeks after pregnancy rather than conception.

According to the Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based reproductive health research organization that supports abortion rights, in 2009 1.3% of the 1.2 million abortions in the country, about 15,600, occurred 20 weeks after the fetus was conceived.

Brian Schweitzer has pledged his support for single-payer health care in the past, but his recent efforts to bring zero-cost sharing primary and preventive care to Montana government employees and retirees may be doing something that most progressives would only dream could happen in America: bringing NHS-style, socialized medicine to Montana.

This is a big deal and -- while currently limited to state employees and retirees -- could be laying the groundwork for America's most socially-just health care system. NPR has the details:



A year ago, Montana opened the nation's first clinic for free primary healthcare services to its state government employees. The Helena, Mont., clinic was pitched as a way to improve overall employee health, but the idea has faced its fair share of political opposition. A year later, the state says the clinic is already saving money. Pamela Weitz, a 61-year-old state library technician, was skeptical about the place at first. ""I thought it was just the goofiest idea, but you know, it's really good,"" she says. In the last year, she's been there for checkups, blood tests and flu shots. She doesn't have to go; she still has her normal health insurance provided by the state. But at the clinic, she has no co-pays, no deductibles. It's free. That's the case for the Helena area's 11,000 state workers and their dependents. With an appointment, patients wait just a couple minutes to see a doctor. Visitation is more than 75 percent higher than initial estimates.

The state contracts with a private company to run the facility and pays for everything — wages of the staff, total costs of all the visits. Those are all new expenses, and they all come from the budget for state employee healthcare. Even so, division manager Russ Hill says it's actually costing the state $1,500,000 less for healthcare than before the clinic opened. ""Because there's no markup, our cost per visit is lower than in a private fee-for-service environment,"" Hill says. Physicians are paid by the hour, not by the number of procedures they prescribe like many in the private sector. The state is able to buy supplies at lower prices. Bottom line: a patient's visit to the employee health clinic costs the state about half what it would cost if that patient went to a private doctor. And because it's free to patients, hundreds of people have come in who had not seen a doctor for at least two years.

Hill says the facility is catching a lot, including 600 people who have diabetes, 1,300 people with high cholesterol, 1,600 people with high blood pressure and 2,600 patients diagnosed as obese. Treating these conditions early could avoid heart attacks, amputations, or other expensive hospital visits down the line, saving the state more money. Clinic operations director and physician's assistant Jimmie Barnwell says this model feels more rewarding to him. ""Having those barriers of time and money taken out of the way are a big part [of what gets] people to come into the clinic. But then, when they come into the clinic, they get a lot of face time with the nurses and the doctors,"" Barnwell says.

Yup, nobody is forced to visit this publicly-financed clinic run by a private operator. If they wish, they can take their big-profit, private health insurance and head to any doctor they want, but folks are recognizing that this, err... public option, provides better care. And, when patients do make this choice, both the state and patients save money.Take a second and let the words above sink in real deep. There you have exactly why the UK, Canada, Australia, Italy, Costa Rica, Cuba and other first-world -- and third-world -- countries are able to secure better health care outcomes than the United States with dramatically lower health care spending. Imagine what -- let's call it the Montana model -- could do for our national debt . And, you know, even more importantly, the health of our people and the wellbeing of our medical professionals.Again, common sense that's not too common in these United States -- with the exception of Montana -- at the moment. High-deductible garbage plans -- promoted by big wigs at Aetna and Cigna who want patients to have more 'skin in the game' -- lead patients to delay putting off that chest pain until it becomes a heart attack...and open-heart surgery. When doctors aren't dealing with private health insurer bureaucracy and any sort of medical billing, the entire resources of the practice go towards taking care of human beings. When doctors are salaried instead of operating with a fee-for-service model, they emphasize quality over quantity. This is how medicine works in the UK, Canada and many other countries where protecting the wealth of hospital and insurance company CEOs is not the primary goal of the health care system.

Even Republicans -- who, you know, are naturally predisposed to hate the idea of patients seeing doctors without cost-sharing -- have a tough time faulting the new clinics.



""For goodness sakes, of course the employees and the retirees like it, it's free,"" says Republican State Sen. Dave Lewis. ... Now, Lewis is a retired state employee himself. He says, personally, he does like going there, too. ""They're wonderful people, they do a great job, but as a legislator, I wonder how in the heck we can pay for it very long,"" Lewis says.

Well, Mr. Republican, they're saving the state millions -- you just won't admit it, but at least you admit you love the socialized medicine.

What's most exciting about these clinics? More are on the way.



Montana recently opened a second state employee health clinic in Billings, the state's largest city. Others are in the works.

And best of all? Schweitzer went right around the backs of Republicans to set up these life- and money-saving clinics. That's bold, progressive leadership. Let's do our best to spread the news far and wide about how the ""Montana model"" is proving what much of the rest of the world already knows: the ideal primary health care system should be free at point of use."

Monday is the last chance for consumers to sign up for Obamacare insurance that starts Jan. 1 under the federal healthcare law.

Last-minute shoppers should prepare for busy signals if they call the Covered California insurance exchange, or for long waits at some enrollment events.

There’s been a sharp increase in applications in recent days ahead of Monday’s deadline for January coverage, according to state officials, agents and enrollment counselors. More than 53,000 people enrolled in health plans over a three-day period last week.

“The pace is frenetic right now,” said Dede Kennedy-Simington, a vice president at Polenzani Benefits in Pasadena who has been working at numerous enrollment events. “There’s growing interest, not from a sense of desperation, but from a desire to get it done.”

If you miss this deadline, there will be other opportunities. Open enrollment lasts through March 31 under the Affordable Care Act.

Here are five things to know for Monday’s deadline:

1. The Shop and Compare tool at the state website, www.coveredca.com, is a good place to start.

You can get a quick idea of health plan options and prices in your area and what government assistance you may be eligible for. You can do all that without having to create an account or complete a lengthy application.

2. Filling out an application and selecting an insurance plan takes time.

Some individuals can get through the process in 30 to 45 minutes, but agents and enrollment counselors warn that it could take up to two hours for some families to enter their information and sort through the various coverage options.

It takes extra time, in particular, when some family members qualify for Medi-Cal and others need to purchase regular health insurance.

3. Applying over the phone or on paper may not be your best bet.

The Covered California service-center number is 800-300-1506. But the average wait time has been more than 30 minutes, if you get through at all.

“Our staff is working at top speed to answer questions and process all the applications,” said Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California.

The exchange said it is still accepting paper applications Monday, but it recommended that people go online instead so they can get immediate feedback on whether the application includes all the required information.

4. There may be help nearby.

Statewide, thousands of county health workers, enrollment counselors and state-certified insurance agents are sitting down with folks and helping them enroll. Many of them are working at special enrollment events Monday at libraries, community centers, clinics and other locations.

This link at the Covered California website can give you names and locations for assistance near you.

5. Don’t forget to pay.

Health insurers won’t start coverage until you pay the first month’s premium. In California, the deadline to pay that first premium is Jan. 6, with coverage retroactive to Jan. 1.

The exchange says insurers should send out member identification cards and an enrollment packet within 10 days of receiving payment.

Some consumers who enrolled weeks ago have complained about not getting a bill yet from their insurer. People should contact the insurance company, not the exchange, about billing matters.

After Monday, the next sign-up deadline is Jan. 15 for insurance starting Feb. 1.

President defends health care law in Massachusetts%2C which has similar plan

Republicans criticize health care website and note that people are losing policies

Obama says Massachusetts also faced early problems but surmounted them

President Obama promoted his embattled health care law Wednesday by arguing that a similar plan in Massachusetts surmounted its early problems.

""Health care reform in this state was a success,"" Obama said during a speech at Boston's Faneuil Hall, the same place where then-Gov. Mitt Romney signed the Massachusetts plan into law in 2006.

""That doesn't mean it was perfect right away,"" Obama added. ""There were early problems to solve.""

With the rollout of Obamacare under fire from Republicans and some consumers, Obama said his plan will provide quality, affordable health care when it is fully operational.

Officials are ""working overtime"" to fix a website that has prevented many people from signing up, Obama said.

He also said that people who have had their insurance policies canceled are being offered better plans with more coverage as demanded by the Affordable Care Act.

""You're going to get a better deal,"" Obama said.

Obama also stressed that the Massachusetts law had bipartisan political support, a dig at Republicans who have consistently opposed the Obama plan.

Republicans said Obamacare has already been undermined by a malfunctioning website and people who have had policies canceled because of new regulations.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Obama had promised people they could keep their existing insurance, and they now feel betrayed.

""A website can be fixed,"" McConnell said. ""But the pain this law is causing — higher premiums and canceled coverage — that's what's really important. And that's what Democrats need to work with us to address by starting over fresh with true, bipartisan health reform.""

Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, said health care policy should be a responsibility of the states and that Obama has misread the lessons of the Massachusetts experience.

In a Facebook post, Romney said: ""Health reform is best crafted by states with bipartisan support and input from its employers, as we did, without raising taxes, and by carefully phasing it in to avoid the type of disruptions we are seeing nationally.""

Obama spoke just hours after congressional testimony by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who apologized for the poor website but also argued that the plan will work in the long run.

In his Boston speech, Obama said people who have had their insurance canceled had ""cut-rate"" policies that did not provide adequate coverage when people got sick.

The Affordable Care Act requires certain types of coverage and ends discrimination that has led to higher costs and cancellations for women and people with pre-existing medical conditions, the president said.

Some people will face higher costs, Obama said: ""To help pay for the law, the wealthiest Americans, families who make more than $250,000 a year, have got to pay a little bit more. The most expensive employer health insurance plans no longer qualify for unlimited tax breaks.""

He said, ""Some folks aren't happy about that, but it's the right thing to do.""

Obama also decried what he called the politics surrounding Obamacare, saying some Republicans who are attacking it didn't want to overhaul health care in the first place.

""We are just going to keep on working at it,"" Obama said. ""We're going to grind it out, just like you did here in Massachusetts."""

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/11/08/CNN-Blames-Christians-for-Obamacare-Problems,2013-11-08 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],CNN Blames Christians for Obamacare Problems,"CNN has blamed Christians for the problem of Americans without health insurance, calling it “The Obamacare ‘scandal’ you haven’t heard about.” In an article on CNN.com’s Belief Blog, CNN writer John Blake says that, while famous pastors “preach in states where crosses and church steeples dot the skyline,” they do nothing about “the poor who can’t get the health insurance they would receive if they lived elsewhere.”

That refers, in turn, to the decision of twenty-five states not to participate in Obamacare’s expanded Medicaid funding. The states were allowed to opt out following last year’s controversial Supreme Court decision on Obamacare, which upheld the law as a whole but struck down the mandatory state participation in Medicaid expansion, citing the protection provided to state powers under the Tenth Amendment.

Some Republican states took the funding anyway, which provides health insurance subsidies for households with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level. Though the federal government will initially cover almost all of the cost, many Republican governors are wary of potential future costs, and are also worried about the effect on the federal budget itself. Many are also opposed to participating in the Obamacare program on principle.

CNN seems to think that the choice to opt out of Obamacare is somehow the responsibility of well-known pastors such as Joel Osteen and T.D. Jakes, who declined to comment for Blake’s article. One minister, Rev. Phil Wages, said he would not preach that states should accept Medicaid funding because he does not believe that care for the poor is the primary responsibility of the government, according to Christian teachings.

Beyond that, most churches are non-profit organizations whose tax-exempt status might be threatened if they became involved in political causes. Blake recognizes that, but strongly suggests that churches have a duty regardless. (Curiously, he does not suggest that churches should preach against Obamacare because of the millions of families that are losing their health insurance plans, contrary to the president’s promises.)

Blake covers different perspectives on the question of speaking out. But the premise of CNN’s article is that churches are to blame for Obamacare’s failures–not the federal government, not the Democrats who passed it, and not President Barack Obama himself. The thinly-veiled implication–a repeated theme in leftist critiques–is that Christians are hypocrites who care about personal salvation, but not about good works."
http://news.yahoo.com/house-passes-republican-health-bill-39-democratic-votes-071544716--sector.html,,[],House passes Republican health bill with 39 Democratic votes,"By Mark Felsenthal and Susan Cornwell WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the most significant legislative rebuke to President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul, 39 members of his Democratic Party voted for a Republican bill in the House of Representatives on Friday aimed at undermining his signature domestic policy. The measure, which would allow insurance companies to renew and sell inexpensive, limited-coverage policies that have been canceled because they don't meet the standards of the new healthcare law that took effect on October 1, passed 261-157. The 39 Democrats who supported the bill - nearly one-fifth of the party's caucus - reflected the alarm that spread within Obama's party this week over the political damage from the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Republicans have vowed to make Democratic support for the troubled law the top issue in the 2014 elections. Twenty-nine of the 39 Democrats who voted for the Republican bill are running for re-election in competitive races, according to rankings by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Obama's approval ratings have plunged during the past six weeks, as the rollout of the healthcare program that is his top domestic achievement has been beset by technical glitches with the federal online insurance website designed to allow consumers to shop for policies. In recent days, HealthCare.gov's problems have been overshadowed by reports that insurance companies were canceling the policies of millions of Americans whose policies did not meet the new law's requirements that policies cover emergency treatment, hospital stays and prescription drugs, among other things. For years, Obama had promised that Americans would be able to keep their policies if they liked them. But the wave of cancellations has fueled the biggest political crisis of Obama's presidency and led to an extraordinary scene at the White House on Thursday, as a contrite Obama took the blame for the healthcare program's dismal start. He said he believed that he had to win back the confidence of the American people, and offered an administrative ""fix"" that would allow some people to retain their non-conforming insurance policies for at least a year. Obama's plan dismayed some of his supporters who say that the cheap, limited-coverage plans that the new law aims to phase out often give consumers a false sense of having meaningful health coverage. It also created concern in the insurance industry - which for years had planned the health insurance exchanges created by Obamacare - and among state insurance commissioners. Industry advocates warned that Obama effectively was tinkering with the delicate and complex funding behind the healthcare law, and that premiums could begin soaring in 2015 if millions of consumers who were projected to be in Obamacare's health exchanges continued to hold limited-coverage policies instead. Obama met with health insurance chief executives at the White House on Friday to discuss his proposal's potential impact on the insurance market. ""What we're going to be doing is brainstorming on how do we make sure that everybody understands what their options are,"" Obama told reporters in a brief photo opportunity as the meeting began. ""We're going to be soliciting ideas from them."" 'FRUSTRATED AND ANGERED' Friday's bill, introduced by Republican Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, represented the latest in a series of legislative attacks on the healthcare law by the chamber, which has held more than 40 votes to limit or curtail Obamacare. In touting his bill, Upton said that Obama ""personally promised that if people liked their current health care plan, they could keep it ‘no matter what.' But cancellation notices are now arriving in millions of mailboxes across the country. It's cancellation today, sticker shock tomorrow."" It is unlikely to pass the Democrat-controlled Senate, and the White House has said Obama would veto the legislation if it reached his desk. The House bill would allow people whose low-cost coverage was canceled to keep those policies, and also would allow insurers to continue selling policies that do not cover basic services and offer little financial help for catastrophic health events. Critics said the House bill would undermine Obamacare's attempt to improve the healthcare system. House Democratic opponents cast the vote as another Republican effort to sabotage the healthcare law. Republicans ""are perfectly satisfied with 40 million Americans having no health insurance at all,"" said Representative James McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat. ""If you want to go back to a system where the insurance companies can turn people away because they are sick, by all means vote for this bill."" But Representative Ron Barber, a Democrat from Arizona, summarized why he and 38 other Democrats voted for the Republican bill. ""I am frustrated and angered by the continuing problems with the healthcare website and I know Southern Arizonans are frustrated and angry, too,"" Barber said. ""Today I voted to give people the option to keep their current plan until these and other issues are resolved. That's only fair."" House Democrats were blocked in an effort to offer a scaled-down version of Upton's bill.

http://news.yahoo.com/builders-obamas-health-website-saw-red-flags-070429400.html,,[],Builders of Obama's health website saw red flags,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Crammed into conference rooms with pizza for dinner, some programmers building the Obama administration's showcase health insurance website were growing increasingly stressed. Some worked past 10 p.m., energy drinks in hand. Others rewrote computer code over and over to meet what they considered last-minute requests for changes from the government or other contractors.

As questions mount over the website's failure, insider interviews and a review of technical specifications by The Associated Press found a mind-numbingly complex system put together by harried programmers who pushed out a final product that congressional investigators said was tested by the government and not private developers with more expertise.

Meanwhile, the White House said that President Barack Obama's longtime adviser Jeffrey Zients will provide management advice to help fix the system. White House press secretary Jay Carney says Zients will be on a short-term assignment at the Health and Human Services Department before he's due to take over as director of Obama's National Economic Council Jan. 1.

Carney cited Zients' expertise as a longtime management consultant and his ""proven track record"" since coming to the White House in 2009, both as interim budget director and as chief performance officer, when he headed an effort to streamline government and cut costs. ""We're engaged in an all-out effort to improve the online experience,"" Carney said.

This is not the first time Obama has turned to Zients for help solving a major problem. In the 2009, after far more drivers than anticipated signed up for the Cash for Clunkers program that promised rebates to people who traded in their old cars for more fuel-efficient vehicles, Obama assigned Zients, his deputy budget director at the time, to help eliminate the backlog.

When the same thing happened with sign-ups for an updated version of the GI Bill, one designed to help the 9/11 generation of veterans get a college education, Obama again turned to Zients.

Story continues

""He's not going to be looking under the hood and tell you 'I can fix the coding, I can fix it,'"" Kenneth Baer, who was a senior adviser to Zients at the budget office, said of Zients' newest assignment. ""His skill is going to be how to identify challenges, prioritize what solutions need to be done next, assessing what talent is already available and then how to motivate them to do that job as quickly and as ably as possible.""

Aneesh Chopra, who was Obama's chief technology officer, said Zients is extremely skilled in figuring things out from a management perspective.

""If I was confident this issue would be resolved before his participation, I am doubly so now,"" said Chopra, who also worked with Zients at the Advisory Board Co., one of two business advisory firms where Zients held top posts. ""Jeff's track record is really a relentless focus on execution.""

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a post on HealthCare.gov that her agency is also bringing in more experts and specialists from government and industry, including top Silicon Valley companies.

""This new infusion of talent will bring a powerful array of subject matter expertise and skills, including extensive experience scaling major IT systems,"" she said. ""This effort is being marshaled as part of a cross-functional team that is working aggressively to diagnose parts of HealthCare.gov that are experiencing problems, learn from successful states, prioritize issues, and fix them.""

Project developers for the health care website who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity — because they feared they would otherwise be fired — said they raised doubts among themselves whether the website could be ready in time. They complained openly to each other about what they considered tight and unrealistic deadlines. One was nearly brought to tears over the stress of finishing on time, one developer said. Website builders saw red flags for months.

A review of internal architectural diagrams obtained by the AP revealed the system's complexity. Insurance applicants have a host of personal information verified, including income and immigration status. The system connects to other federal computer networks, including ones at the Social Security Administration, IRS, Veterans Administration, Office of Personnel Management and the Peace Corps.

Obama on Monday acknowledged technical problems that he described as ""kinks in the system."" But in remarks at a Rose Garden event, Obama offered no explanation for the failure except to note that high traffic to the website caused some of the slowdowns. He said it had been visited nearly 20 million times — fewer monthly visits so far than many commercial websites, such as PayPal, AOL, Wikipedia or Pinterest.

""The problem has been that the website that's supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance is not working the way it should for everybody,"" Obama said. ""There's no sugarcoating it. The website has been too slow. People have been getting stuck during the application process. And I think it's fair to say that nobody is more frustrated by that than I am.""

The online system was envisioned as a simple way for people without health insurance to comparison-shop among competing plans offered in their state, pick their preferred level of coverage and cost and sign up. For many, it's not worked out that way so far.

Just weeks before the launch of HealthCare.gov on Oct. 1, one programmer said, colleagues huddled in conference rooms trying to patch ""bugs,"" or deficiencies in computer code. Unresolved problems led to visitors experiencing cryptic error messages or enduring long waits trying to sign up.

Congressional investigators have concluded that the government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, not private software developers, tested the exchange's computer systems during the final weeks. That task, known as integration testing, is usually handled by software companies because it ferrets out problems before the public sees the final product.

The government spent at least $394 million in contracts to build the federal health care exchange and the data hub. Those contracts included major awards to Virginia-based CGI Federal Inc., Maryland-based Quality Software Services Inc. and Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.

CGI Federal said in a statement Monday it was working with the government and other contractors ""around the clock"" to improve the system, which it called ""complex, ambitious and unprecedented.""

The schematics from late 2012 show how officials designated a ""data services hub"" — a traffic cop for managing information — in lieu of a design that would have allowed state exchanges to connect directly to government servers when verifying an applicant's information. On Sunday, the Health and Human Services Department said the data hub was working but not meeting public expectations: ""We are committed to doing better.""

Administration officials so far have refused to say how many people actually have managed to enroll in insurance during the three weeks since the new marketplaces became available. Without enrollment numbers, it's impossible to know whether the program is on track to reach projections from the Congressional Budget Office that 7 million people would gain coverage during the first year the exchanges were available.

Instead, officials have selectively cited figures that put the insurance exchanges in a positive light. They say more than 19 million people have logged on to the federal website and nearly 500,000 have filled out applications for insurance through both the federal and state-run sites.

The flood of computer problems since the website went online has been deeply embarrassing for the White House. The snags have called into question whether the administration is capable of implementing the complex policy and why senior administration officials — including the president — appear to have been unaware of the scope of the problems when the exchange sites opened.

Even as the president spoke at the Rose Garden, more problems were coming to light. The administration acknowledged that a planned upgrade to the website had been postponed indefinitely and that online Spanish-language signups would remain unavailable, despite a promise to Hispanic groups that the capability would start this week. And the government tweaked the website's home page so visitors can now view phone numbers to apply the old-fashioned way or window-shop for insurance rates without registering first.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee was expected to conduct an oversight hearing Thursday, probably without Sebelius testifying. She could testify on Capitol Hill on the subject as early as next week.

Uninsured Americans have until about mid-February to sign up for coverage if they are to meet the law's requirement that they be insured by the end of March. If they don't, they will face a penalty. The administration says it's working to address the timing issue to provide more flexibility.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., plans to introduce legislation to delay that requirement because: ""It's not fair to punish people for not buying something that's not available,"" Rubio told ""CBS This Morning"" on Tuesday.

Citing the website problems, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., also urged the White House to extend the open enrollment period past March 31, 2014.

In a letter Tuesday to Obama, Shaheen suggested extending open enrollment to ""provide greater flexibility for the American people seeking to access health insurance,"" according to an emailed statement from her office. Shaheen also asked the White House to clarify how the ""individual responsibility penalty will be administered and enforced"" in light of the website's difficulties.

On Monday, the White House advised people frustrated by the online tangle that they can enroll by calling 1-800-318-2596 in a process that should take 25 minutes for an individual or 45 minutes for a family. Assistance is also available in communities from helpers who can be found at LocalHelp.HealthCare.gov.

However, he explained to his supporters over the years that a “potential transition” would be necessary to break away from the current system.

Interestingly, as the implementation of the Obamacare exchanges face problems and millions begin to lose coverage from their private insurers, something President Obama promised would not happen, Democrats and their liberal allies are now beginning to suggest a single payer system as a solution to the rickety exchanges.

Rep. John Larson (D – CT) told Breitbart News last Wednesday that under a single payer system Americans would not be losing their private health care coverage, claiming, “You would be covered automatically. But that’s not the law. The law is that it’s a free enterprise system and they have the right not to enter into the exchange or not to provide for you in the exchange. That is their right.”

The video below shows clips of Obama explaining to supporters his views over the years about how he would transition a single payer system into the United States. At the same time he criticizes his detractors, saying the Affordable Care Act is not a “government take over” of American health care.

Obama – Remarks to AFL – CIO

“I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer health care plan. The United States of America–the wealthiest country in the history of the world, spending 14 percent–14 percent of its gross national product on health care and cannot provide basic health insurance to everybody and that’s what Jim is talking about when he says, ‘Everybody in. Nobody out.’ A single payer health care credit–universal healthcare credit. That’s what I’d like to see, but as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we have to take back the White House and we’ve got to take back the Senate and we’ve got to take back the House.”

Obama – Remarks – 8/4/07

“This is a two trillion dollar part of our economy and it is my belief that it’s not just politically but economically it is better for us to start getting a system in place–a universal healthcare system signed into law by the end of my first term as president and build off that system to further to make it more rational…”

“By the way, Canada did not start immediately with a single payer system. They had a similar transition step. “

Obama- New Hampshire Public Radio 11/21/07

OBAMA: It’s a transitional system building on the existing systems that we have.

HOST: Transitional to what?

OBAMA: Transitional, hopefully, because the system is currently a patchwork of inefficiency that over time I would want to see Medicaid, Medicare, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)–all those integrated more effectively.

Obama – Public Remarks 4/3/07

“Let’s say that I proposed a plan that moved to a single payer system–Let’s say Medicare plus. Essentially, everybody can buy Medicare, for example…”

“Transitioning a system is a very difficult and costly and lengthy enterprise. It’s not like you can turn on a switch and you go from one system to another. So it’s possible that up front, you wouldn’t need not just– you might need an additional ninety or a hundred billion dollars a year.”

Obama – (SEIU Healthcare Forum) – 3/24/07

“But I don’t think we’re going to be able to eliminate employer coverage immediately. There’s going to be potentially some transition process. I can envision a decade out or 15 years out or 20 years out..”

Obama – Public Remarks – 1/27/05

“There’s no denying that part of the solution in the health care arena as we transition and deal with the legacy systems that we’ve inherited will probably require some additional money.”

Obama – Remarks to American Medical Association – 6/15/2009

“The public option is not your enemy. It is your friend…Let me also address an illegitimate concern that is being put forward by those who are claiming a public option is somehow a Trojan horse for a single payer system.”

Obama – (SEIU Healthcare Forum) – 3/24/07



“My commitment is to make sure we’ve got universal health care for all Americans by the end of my first term as president…”

“I would hope that we could set up a system that allows those who can’t go through their employers to access a federal system or a state pool of some sort…but I don’t think we’re going to be able to eliminate employer coverage immediately. There’s going to be potentially some transition process. I can envision a decade out or 15 years out or 20 years out..”

Rep. Barney Frank (D – MA) – 7/27/09

“I think if we get a good public option, it could lead to single payer and that’s the best way to reach single payer.”

Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D – IL) – 4/18/09

“And next to me was a guy from the insurance company who then argued against the public health insurance option saying, ‘It wouldn’t let private insurance compete–that a public option will put the private insurance industry out of business and lead to single payer.’ He was right. The man was right.”

Obama – Public Remarks

“Nobody is talking about some government take over of health care.”"

David and Charles Koch, the immensely rich industrialists, presumably have health insurance, though they don’t really need it. More than 25 million Americans don’t have it and really do need it, however, and the Koch brothers are working hard to make sure the government doesn’t give it to them.

The advocacy group backed by the Kochs, Americans for Prosperity, is spending more than $1 million on an advertising campaign to (yet again) discredit President Obama’s health care reform law. It’s already been in effect for three years, but they want to soften it up just as its most important changes (mostly, the insurance mandate) begin to go into effect on Oct. 1. That will benefit Republican lawmakers, gearing up for the 2014 elections, who want to reignite the misguided fury against the law that gave them control of the House in 2010.

Naturally, the Kochs can’t give voice to their real concerns: That the law raises taxes on the rich to help pay for health insurance subsidies for the poor. That it expands the role of government in individual lives, as a protection against market forces that most cannot control or understand. That its benefits to society may be so profound that Democrats can use it as a badge of accomplishment for generations, as they have with Social Security and Medicare.



So they’ve decided to resort to a well-used tactic on this subject: outright lying. Remember death panels, rated PolitiFact’s “Lie of the Year” for 2009? That proved the effectiveness of deception, so why not keep at it?

A.F.P.’s first ad, designed to appeal to women and appearing on the Food Channel and other outlets, features a young mother of two whose child had seizures two years ago and who now has “some questions about Obamacare.”

“If we can’t pick our own doctor, how do I know my family’s going to get the care they need?” she asks. “And what am I getting in exchange for higher premiums and a smaller paycheck?”

Lie No. 1: The law doesn’t limit the choice of doctors or insurance plans. People can choose any primary-care doctor participating in their plan, just as the vast majority of insured people can now. The law even guarantees that right, for the first time, for people covered under their employer’s plan.

Lie No. 2: While some insurers have raised rates, the initial bids from insurance companies competing under the law strongly suggested that most consumers will benefit from the new competition. The law includes limits and protections against unwarranted rate increases, and will make it much easier to get insurance despite pre-existing conditions, like the child’s seizure disorder mentioned in the ad.

The Kochs and their Republican allies continue to take advantage of the law’s complexity and public ignorance to spread the worst kind of misinformation, hoping once again to create chaotic town halls and anti-government protests once the mandate goes into effect. Senate Republicans have also tried to stop the Obama administration from telling the truth about the law, cutting off money for publicity and warning sports teams not to join any explanatory ads.

Organizing for Action, the advocacy group that supports the White House, has begun running counter-ads, pointing out, for example, that the law ends lifetime caps on benefits. But given the immense firepower being readied by opponents of the law, supporters will have to step up their efforts to disseminate the truth."

Democratic lawmakers blasted the proposal this week because it would force women to anticipate being raped, ThinkProgress reported.

""Forcing women to decide whether they want to buy 'rape insurance' and even compelling parents to make the unfathomable decision about whether to buy it for their daughters is truly despicable,"" State Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer (D) said Monday. ""Requiring Michigan women to plan ahead for an unplanned pregnancy is not only illogical, it’s one of the most misogynistic proposals I have ever seen in the Michigan Legislature.""

More than 80 percent of private insurance plans currently cover abortions, so the measure would have a broad effect.

Michigan lawmakers passed the same bill last year, but Governor Rick Snyder (R) vetoed it, saying he does not ""believe it is appropriate to tell a woman who becomes pregnant due to a rape that she needed to select elective insurance coverage.""

But anti-abortion activists were able to collect enough signatures on a petition this year to force a vote on the measure again. If the Republican-controlled legislature approves it, it will automatically become law, even if Snyder does not sign it. If lawmakers do not pass it, citizens will consider it as a ballot measure in 2014.

Right to Life Michigan gathered protesters this week who had been born as a result of rape and incest to speak out in support of the measure. ""We are people, we are not exceptions,"" Mary Rathke, a 34-year-old from Essexville whose birth mother was raped, told reporters.

The group's president, Barbara Listing, compared rape and incest to car accidents and floods earlier this year.

""It’s simply, like, nobody plans to have an accident in a car accident, nobody plans to have their homes flooded,"" Listing said. ""You have to buy extra insurance for those."""
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/08/opinion/krugman-insurance-and-freedom.html,2013-04-08 00:00:00,['Paul Krugman'],Insurance and Freedom - The New York Times,"President Obama will soon release a new budget, and the commentary is already flowing fast and furious. Progressives are angry (with good reason) over proposed cuts to Social Security; conservatives are denouncing the call for more revenues. But it’s all Kabuki. Since House Republicans will block anything Mr. Obama proposes, his budget is best seen not as policy but as positioning, an attempt to gain praise from “centrist” pundits.

No, the real policy action at this point is in the states, where the question is, How many Americans will be denied essential health care in the name of freedom?

I’m referring, of course, to the question of how many Republican governors will reject the Medicaid expansion that is a key part of Obamacare. What does that have to do with freedom? In reality, nothing. But when it comes to politics, it’s a different story.

It goes without saying that Republicans oppose any expansion of programs that help the less fortunate — along with tax cuts for the wealthy, such opposition is pretty much what defines modern conservatism. But they seem to be having more trouble than in the past defending their opposition without simply coming across as big meanies."

In effect, the administration gave itself a passing grade. Because of hundreds of software fixes and hardware upgrades in the past month, it said, the website — the main channel for people seeking to buy insurance under President Obama’s health care law — is now working more than 90 percent of the time, up from 40 percent during some weeks in October.

Jeffrey D. Zients, the Obama adviser leading the website repair effort, said consumers were having a much better experience now than in early October. Pages on the website load faster — in less than a second — compared with an average of eight seconds in late October, Mr. Zients said. “The site is now stable and operating at its intended capacity, with greatly improved performance,” he said.

In a “progress and performance report,” the administration summarized five weeks of frantic activity to repair the website and undo damage to Mr. Obama’s political standing."

David and Charles Koch, the immensely rich industrialists, presumably have health insurance, though they don’t really need it. More than 25 million Americans don’t have it and really do need it, however, and the Koch brothers are working hard to make sure the government doesn’t give it to them.

The advocacy group backed by the Kochs, Americans for Prosperity, is spending more than $1 million on an advertising campaign to (yet again) discredit President Obama’s health care reform law. It’s already been in effect for three years, but they want to soften it up just as its most important changes (mostly, the insurance mandate) begin to go into effect on Oct. 1. That will benefit Republican lawmakers, gearing up for the 2014 elections, who want to reignite the misguided fury against the law that gave them control of the House in 2010.

Naturally, the Kochs can’t give voice to their real concerns: That the law raises taxes on the rich to help pay for health insurance subsidies for the poor. That it expands the role of government in individual lives, as a protection against market forces that most cannot control or understand. That its benefits to society may be so profound that Democrats can use it as a badge of accomplishment for generations, as they have with Social Security and Medicare.



So they’ve decided to resort to a well-used tactic on this subject: outright lying. Remember death panels, rated PolitiFact’s “Lie of the Year” for 2009? That proved the effectiveness of deception, so why not keep at it?

A.F.P.’s first ad, designed to appeal to women and appearing on the Food Channel and other outlets, features a young mother of two whose child had seizures two years ago and who now has “some questions about Obamacare.”

“If we can’t pick our own doctor, how do I know my family’s going to get the care they need?” she asks. “And what am I getting in exchange for higher premiums and a smaller paycheck?”

Lie No. 1: The law doesn’t limit the choice of doctors or insurance plans. People can choose any primary-care doctor participating in their plan, just as the vast majority of insured people can now. The law even guarantees that right, for the first time, for people covered under their employer’s plan.

Lie No. 2: While some insurers have raised rates, the initial bids from insurance companies competing under the law strongly suggested that most consumers will benefit from the new competition. The law includes limits and protections against unwarranted rate increases, and will make it much easier to get insurance despite pre-existing conditions, like the child’s seizure disorder mentioned in the ad.

The Kochs and their Republican allies continue to take advantage of the law’s complexity and public ignorance to spread the worst kind of misinformation, hoping once again to create chaotic town halls and anti-government protests once the mandate goes into effect. Senate Republicans have also tried to stop the Obama administration from telling the truth about the law, cutting off money for publicity and warning sports teams not to join any explanatory ads.

Organizing for Action, the advocacy group that supports the White House, has begun running counter-ads, pointing out, for example, that the law ends lifetime caps on benefits. But given the immense firepower being readied by opponents of the law, supporters will have to step up their efforts to disseminate the truth."

Under a wrinkle that dates back to enactment of the law, members of Congress and thousands of their aides are required to get their coverage through new state-based markets known as insurance exchanges.

But the law does not provide any obvious way for the federal government to continue paying its share of the premiums for the comprehensive coverage.

If the government cannot do so, it could mean an additional expense of $5,000 a year for individuals and $11,000 for families under some of the most popular plans."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/26/ObamaCare-Puts-IA-CO-MI-Into-Play,2013-11-26 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],"ObamaCare Puts IA, CO, MI Senate Seats Into Play","For the past year, most political observers have focused on Republican opportunities to capture Senate seats in red-states like Louisiana and Arkansas. The GOP had a plausible, but narrow, path to capture enough of these seats to win control of the Senate. The ObamaCare disaster, however, has expanded the battlefield for control of the Senate. New polls show high-profile Democrats with negligible leads against phantom Republicans in IA, CO and MI. If these states are in play next year, Dem control of the Senate will be especially vulnerable.

Republicans, so far, have been unable to attract high-profile candidates to contest the open seats in Iowa and Michigan or challenge Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado. All three seats have been safely in the Democrat column for much of the year. The terrible rollout of ObamaCare, however, has hurt the poll numbers of Democrats everywhere. This has become most pronounced in states that weren’t considered competitive.

In Colorado, incumbent Sen. Mark Udall doesn’t draw more than 45% support against a host of possible GOP opponents. That level of support is a clear sign of vulnerability. Just a few months ago, Udall was a prohibitive favorite to win reelection.

Democrats in Iowa have rallied behind Rep. Bruce Braley for the seat of retiring Sen. Tom Harkin. There is no clear GOP challenger, yet Braley can’t reach more than 42% against a number of possible challengers.

In Michigan, Rep. Gary Peters, a typical union-backed Democrat, is running to replace Sen. Carl Levin. Again, there is no high-profile consensus GOP candidate, yet Peters can’t even crack 40% support in the polls. The most recent poll found Peters leading Republican former Secretary of State, Terri Land, by just one point, 37-36. Months ago, again, Peters was considered the overwhelming favorite.

Polls in these three states suggest that ObamaCare represents an existential threat to the Democrat party next year. Setting aside the problems with the website, the program will exert a gravitational pull on everyone’s health insurance. For most voters, the impact will be negative.

Barring some unexpected event, Democrats could be slow-walking to their own political oblivion. If the party has to spend money to defend its seat in Michigan, it is unlikely to hold its seats in states like North Carolina or Alaska.

The 2014 elections may be getting past the point that Republicans can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The party still hasn’t learned the lessons of 2010. They are about to get another primer from voters. Hopefully, the party will know now how to listen."

Brown to Sign Bill Legalizing Non-Physician Abortions in CA,"A bill that would allow non-physicians to perform abortions in the first trimester of pregnancy is awaiting signature by Gov. Jerry Brown of California by Sep. 30. The bill, AB 154, passed both houses of the state legislature with strong support from Planned Parenthood and pro-choice groups. Planned Parenthood stands to benefit most directly from the bill, as non-physician staff at its clinics would be able to obtain abortion licenses.

One doctor–who identified himself as pro-choice–told Breitbart News that “the bill is a disaster since it sends us back 100 years to the problems of the complications from back-steet abortions.” The bill’s critics warn that the training provided to non-physician staff is weak, that supervision by physicians in clinics will be minimal, and that there is real risk of injury or death to women who will be treated in such conditions.

The California Medical Association has endorsed AB 154 because of “provisions for training in the bill and the amendments that clarify physician supervision.” Yet the training is to be provided by the Board of Registered Nursing, not by physicians, and the protocols for defining “supervision” have not been specified. There is nothing in the legislation requiring a physician to be present or on-site during an abortion.

The bill permits licensed non-physicians to perform two kinds of abortion in the first trimester–by medication, and by aspiration, which requires the insertion of medical instruments into the uterus. Though many doctors agree that non-physicians could provide medications with few risks, the idea that a non-physician would perform an invasive procedure such as aspiration strikes many as rife with risks.

Debate about AB 154, which was introduced by California State Assembly Majority Leader Toni Atkins (D-San Diego), has been muted in a state that pro-choice advocates see as sympathetic to their cause. The Los Angeles Times came out strongly in favor of the measure in an editorial on September 3, arguing that it does not pose safety risks and that it could increase access to abortion services for women early in pregnancy:

In underserved urban areas, women face delays in getting medical appointments at clinics. When a woman can’t get an abortion in the first trimester, she may end up getting one in the later stages of pregnancy, which can mean a more complicated and more expensive abortion.

Advocates of AB 154 also argue that other states have allowed non-physicians to perform abortions safely, including in Planned Parenthood clinics.

Opponents describe AB 154 as an effort by Planned Parenthood and other groups to profit from Obamacare, since the legislation will expand the number of patients eligible for the state Medi-Cal program, and Medi-Cal pays for abortion. They also dispute assurances about the bill’s safety for women, arguing that there has been inadequate monitoring of California abortion clinics even prior to the passage of the new legislation."

Seriously. That’s what all the yelling and screaming is about. As my grandmother used to say, it’s hard to know whether to laugh or cry.

The GOP has tried its best to make Obamacare a synonym for bogeyman and convince people that it’s coming in the night to snatch the children. In fact, and I know this comes as a shock to some, Obamacare is not a mythical creature. It is a law, incorporating what were originally Republican ideas, that will make it possible for up to 30 million people now lacking health insurance to obtain it.

Officially, the law in question is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Republicans intended the term “Obamacare” to be mocking, which is perhaps why President Obama started using it with pride.

It is, indeed, an achievement of which the nation can be proud. About 48 million individuals in this country lacked health insurance in 2012, according to the Census Bureau, representing about 15 percent of the population. Other industrialized nations provide universal health care — and wonder if this is what we mean when we talk about American exceptionalism.

About 25 percent of people in households with annual incomes below $25,000 are uninsured, compared with just 8 percent in households earning more than $75,000. Do the working poor not deserve to have their chronic medical conditions treated as punishment for not making enough money?

Other rich countries provide truly universal care through single-payer systems of various kinds. Obama chose instead to model the Affordable Care Act after a program implemented on the state level by the Republican governor who became Obama’s opponent in the 2012 presidential election. Yes, before Obamacare there was Romneycare, a private-sector, free-market solution designed to be in accord with the GOP’s most hallowed principles.

But in the years between Mitt Romney’s tenure in Massachusetts and his presidential run, the Republican Party lost its way, or perhaps its mind.

The party shows no serious interest in finding a GOP-friendly way to provide the uninsured with access to health care. Rather, it pursues two goals at any cost: opposing Obama no matter what he does, and making people see Obamacare as a failure.

For the radical far right, making health care more widely available through the existing network of insurers, most of them for-profit companies, is a giant leap toward godless socialism. These extremists hold outsize power in the GOP — enough to make sane Republican officials fear, with some reason, that anything short of massive resistance to Obamacare could lead to a primary challenge and a shortened career.

Some of Obamacare’s provisions are already in force and seem to be having the intended effect. For example, young adults are now allowed to stay on their parents’ health insurance policies until age 26. In 2009, 29.8 percent of those 19 through 25 were uninsured; in 2012, 27.2 percent lacked insurance, a modest but significant decline.

Now the central provisions of the Affordable Care Act are set to come into effect — the individual mandate, the insurance exchanges, the guarantee of coverage for those with preexisting conditions. Republicans scream that Obamacare is sure to fail. But what they really fear is that it will succeed.

That’s the reason for all the desperation. Republicans are afraid that Obamacare will not prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare — that Americans, in fact, will find they actually like it. The GOP fears that Obamacare will even be credited with slowing the rise of health-care costs to a more manageable rate. There are signs, in fact, that this “bending of the curve” is already taking place: Medical costs are still rising much faster than inflation but at the slowest rate in decades.

Keeping premiums under control will require persuading lots of young, healthy people to buy insurance — and thus, in effect, subsidize those who are older and sicker. That is why a group called Generation Opportunity, funded by the ultraconservative Koch brothers, plans to tour college campuses with disgusting ads in which a creepy Uncle Sam subjects a young woman to a pelvic examination.

The GOP message: Whatever you do, don’t buy health insurance. It may be — shudder — good for you.

Pope Benedict sent his encouragement via his Twitter account

Event wants to appeal to a younger crowd through use of social media

Marchers are coming from across the USA

Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to fill the National Mall on Friday to protest the 40-year-old landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the first trimester.

Buses are shuttling in anti-abortion protesters from all over the country for the annual March for Life. Organizers predict many of them will be young people rallied by church groups and social media.

Pope Benedict sent them his encouragement by way his personal Twitter account,@pontifex : ""I join all those marching for life from afar, and pray that political leaders will protect the unborn and promote a culture of life,"" he posted early Friday morning.

""We are expecting record-breaking crowds — 80% under the age of 20,"" said Jeanne Monahan, president of the March for Life Education & Defense Fund. ""Mostly teenagers come and we get a lot of high school groups.""

This is Monahan's first year leading the march. She predicts the event will be different from past years.

""It's a pretty big event to pull off — the planning for next year's march started last week,"" Monahan said.

Nellie Gray, who had led the anti-abortion demonstrators every year since the Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion in 1973, died in August at age 88.

""We want to appeal to the younger crowd, so we made big changes,"" Monahan said. ""We shortened the program from longer than two hours to an hour, picked speakers who are more engaging and we are deeply engaging social media.""

According to a recent Pew Research Center poll, 37% of Americans do not know that Roe v. Wade dealt with the issue of abortion. Among the age group targeted by the March for Life, the number is higher — 57% of adults under age 30 don't know what the case is about.

Americans remain divided on abortion, according to a recent USA TODAY/Gallup Poll. Significantly more Americans — 53% to 29% — want the decision kept in place rather than overturned. Another 18% have no opinion, the highest level of uncertainty Gallup has recorded on the issue.

Sydney Goldstein, 16, of Charlotte, is heading to the march with about 30 students from her government class at Charlotte Christian School.

""I am going to speak for the babies that are dying every day that don't have a voice to speak for themselves,"" Goldstein said. ""This is one way to voice my opinion because I cannot vote.""

Friday's rally will begin before noon on the Mall and around 1:15 p.m. the march will begin and follow its traditional route up Constitution Avenue to the Supreme Court building on Capitol Hill.

Speakers include Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn.

Benedictine College has sent seven full buses — nearly 400 people — for a 30-hour ride from Atchison, Kan., to Washington, D.C., for the march.

This is the largest group to go in the school's 28 years of involvement, spokesman Humam AlMukhtar said."

More than two weeks into the disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov, the website created by President Barack Obama's health care reform law still isn't working right.

""The website that was supposed to do this all in a seamless way has had way more glitches than I think are acceptable,"" Obama said during a Tuesday interview with KCCI television in Des Moines, Iowa. But the administration won't disclose exactly what's wrong with the health insurance exchange website, or when consumers can expect to see the promise of convenient, one-stop shopping for health benefits and financial assistance fulfilled.

Time remains for these problems to be resolved, but not much. ""If things aren't resolved in three weeks, we've got some serious, serious problems,"" said Timothy Jost, a law professor and health care reform expert at Washington & Lee University in Lexington, Va., and an Obamacare supporter. ""I don't think we're anywhere close to there yet, but if the whole thing collapses, it'll be another generation before we get this problem fixed.""

The White House vowed to fix the problem and said people are managing to sign up for health care. ""The website is unacceptable, but we're working to improve it and the product is good,"" said White House official Tara McGuinness. ""Across the country people today are getting access to affordable care. We're going to work intensely for the next six months to make sure we meet the demand. We're going to make affordable health care accessible through the website, through the phone, in communities across the country, and with in-person assistance.""

The stakes are high for uninsured people, individuals and families who buy their health insurance directly and the entire health care industry. Without a functioning health insurance exchange, many people too sick or too poor to get health insurance under the old rules will remain shut out of the system. The millions of Americans who already buy their own insurance will face major disruptions. Health insurance companies could experience a nightmare scenario where the bulk of the individuals who brave the frustrating sign-up process are those who are sick, desperate for coverage and expensive to treat.

And anyone who isn't able to get coverage because of the exchanges' problems could confront the prospect of tax penalties through no fault of their own.

For Obama and the Democrats who've stood behind Obamacare during four years of relentless attacks from Republicans -- including a face-off that led to a 16-day government shutdown and a threat of U.S. default -- failure of this magnitude would discredit a core premise of this presidency, that government can do big things to improve Americans' lives.

Although there are signs of incremental improvement, HealthCare.gov is unable to reliably allow consumers to create accounts, verify their identifies, apply for tax credits available to low- and middle-income people or shop for health insurance plans. Insurers are receiving bad enrollment data and states are reporting difficulties in accessing the federal system.

The administration won't say how many people have signed up so far, but its reported goal of enrolling 500,000 people this month appears difficult to reach. Some thousands of dogged shoppers appear to have signed up for plans on the federal health insurance exchanges, also called marketplaces. But others have become discouraged, and traffic to HealthCare.gov has waned, according to one independent analysis. People working to help consumers are using paper applications for financial assistance that eventually will have to be entered into the computer system.

If the administration does succeed in getting the website in working order in the coming weeks, the system will be strained by a backlog of pending applications and a crush of consumers frantically trying to get their coverage in place before the new year.

Consumers have until Dec. 15 to choose a plan for Jan. 1, and until Feb. 15 to avoid being hit with tax penalties for violating the law's mandate that individuals obtain health insurance. The 2014 enrollment period ends March 31.

The administration insists it's doing everything it can to get HealthCare.gov into shape. In states operating their own health insurance exchanges, a small but growing number of people are signing up.

""We really do need to get this thing resolved pretty quickly. And then, of course, the longer you wait to resolve it, the more you have piling up for the last minute with the risk of another crash,"" Jost said.

Robert Laszewski, a health care industry consultant, is skeptical that the health insurance exchanges' information technology failings can be mitigated in time to prevent chaos. ""The fix might be to take it down and start over,"" he said. ""I don't know what the best-case scenario for these guys fixing this thing is, but it's got to be two or three weeks, minimum.""

The urgency is underscored not only by the fact that the low-income Americans and the 48 million uninsured -- those whom the law was primarily intended to benefit -- won't get the help they were promised. There's also the plight of those who currently have coverage they bought themselves that now has to be replaced, said Laszewski, who is president of Alexandria, Va.-based Health Policy and Strategy Associates. That represents about 3.6 percent of the population, according to census data.

Many health insurance products currently on the market don't meet Obamacare's benefit standards and consumer protections so they are being discontinued. Consumers with these plans are the most likely to see rate increases next year, especially if they earn too much to get tax credits. ""They've got to convert to a new policy -- no ifs, ands or buts about it,"" Laszewski said.

And while people who currently pay for their own health insurance are likely to do whatever they can to remain covered, buying a plan directly from an insurance carrier or using a private online broker isn't what Obamacare promised, and tax-credit subsidies aren't available without the federal system. Moreover, these private companies aren't prepared to deal with millions of customers who were supposed to be using the government marketplace, Laszewski said.

Under these circumstances, the lion's share of the people who do whatever is necessary to sign up through HealthCare.gov are likely to be the sickest and most expensive to cover because they have the greatest need, Laszewski said. That would make the pool of people covered very costly, causing health insurers to lose money and likely rethink whether they want to participate in the exchanges, he said. ""The fundamental threat to Obamacare is we don't get enough healthy people in the pool to keep the rates reasonable, and they are in grave danger of that problem,"" he said.

If these problems persist longer -- weeks, months, a whole year -- the entire Obamacare project falls apart, Laszewski said: ""It's a holy shit moment.""

The media has been covering Korte v. HHS, where on Nov. 8 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit struck down Kathleen Sebelius’ regulation that implements a provision of the Affordable Care Act by requiring employers to provide abortion and contraception in their healthcare plans.

The only religious exemption is for churches and other purely-religious employers. But countless secular and for-profit businesses are wholly owned by people of faith, who treat how they run their business as part of how they practice their religious faith, and object to providing products or services they regard as immoral or sinful.

Five federal appellate courts have ruled on the issue thus far. Three have sided with religious business owners, and two have sided with the Obama administration.

On Sept. 18, Breibart News broke the news that the first of these cases has been offered to the Supreme Court when lawyers from the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) filed a petition with the justices in Conestoga Wood Specialties v. Sebelius. Later that same day, the Obama administration asked the Supreme Court to review the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, which ruled in favor of the Green family in Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius.

Two other federal appeals courts have weighed in on the issue. On Nov. 1, the D.C. Circuit sided with religious business owners in Gilardi v. HHS in a well-written opinion by Judge Janice Rogers Brown. And on Sept. 17, the Cincinnati-based Sixth Circuit supported President Obama and Secretary Sebelius.

Judge Diane Sykes’ excellent opinion for the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit in Korte has deepened this national split in the federal courts. But despite the significant media attention that decision is getting, last week’s opinion is probably the end of the line for Korte.

This is because the Supreme Court has now scheduled the petitions from Hobby Lobby and Conestoga for the justices’ closed-door conference on Nov. 26. The results of that conference could be released that afternoon or, more likely, will be announced when the Court holds its next session on Dec. 2.

It is virtually certain the Supreme Court will take one or both cases. If review is granted, arguments will be in March or April, with a final decision on this issue before July 2014.

The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday had lowered the age at which people can buy the Plan B One-Step morning-after pill without a prescription to 15 - younger than the current limit of 17. The FDA decided that the pill could be sold on drugstore shelves near condoms, instead of locked behind pharmacy counters.

Obama, speaking at a news conference while in Mexico, said the FDA's decision was based on ""solid scientific evidence.""

What's still unclear is whether the administration will prevail on its appeal of a court order that would lift all age limits on purchasers of the pill.

That decision to appeal set off a storm of criticism from reproductive rights groups, who denounced it as politically motivated and a step backward for women's health.

""We are profoundly disappointed. This appeal takes away the promise of all women having timely access to emergency contraception,"" Susannah Baruch, Interim President & CEO of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project, said in a statement late Wednesday.

""It is especially troubling in light of the Food and Drug Administration's move yesterday to continue age restrictions and ID requirements, despite a court order to make emergency contraception accessible for women of all ages. Both announcements, particularly in tandem, highlight the administration's corner-cutting on women's health,"" Baruch said. ""It's a sad day for women's health when politics prevails.""

After the appeal was announced late Wednesday, Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, said, ""The prevention of unwanted pregnancy, particularly in adolescents, should not be obstructed by politicians."" She called it a ""step backwards for women's health.""

Last week, O'Neill noted, Obama was applauded when he addressed members of Planned Parenthood and spoke of the organization's ""core principle"" that women should be allowed to make their own decisions about their health.

""President Obama should practice what he preaches,"" O'Neill said.

In appealing the ruling Wednesday, the administration recommitted itself to a position Obama took during his re-election campaign that younger teens shouldn't have unabated access to emergency contraceptives, despite the insistence by physicians groups and much of his Democratic base that the pill should be readily available.

The Justice Department's appeal responded to an order by U.S. District Judge Edward Korman in New York that would allow girls and women of any age to buy not only Plan B but its cheaper generic competition as easily as they can buy aspirin. Korman gave the FDA 30 days to comply, and the Monday deadline was approaching.

In its filing, the Justice Department said Korman exceeded his authority and that his decision should be suspended while that appeal is under way, meaning only Plan B One-Step would appear on drugstore shelves until the case is finally settled. If Korman's order isn't suspended during the appeals process, the result would be ""substantial market confusion, harming FDA's and the public's interest"" as drugstores receive conflicting orders about who's allowed to buy what, the Justice Department concluded.

Reluctant to get drawn into a messy second-term spat over social issues, White House officials insisted Wednesday that both the FDA and the Justice Department were acting independently of the White House in deciding how to proceed. But the decision to appeal was certain to irk abortion-rights advocates who say they can't understand why a Democratic president is siding with social conservatives in favor of limiting women's reproductive choices.

Current and former White House aides said Obama's approach to the issue has been heavily influenced by his experience as the father of two school-age daughters. Obama and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have also questioned whether there's enough data available to show the morning-after pill is safe and appropriate for younger girls, even though physicians groups insist that it is.

Rather than take matters into his own hands, the Justice Department argued to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Korman should have ordered the FDA to reconsider its options for regulating emergency contraception. The court cannot overturn the rules and processes that federal agencies must follow ""by instead mandating a particular substantive outcome,"" the appeal stated.

Social conservatives were outraged by the FDA's move to lower the age limits for Plan B - as well as the possibility that Korman's ruling might take effect and lift age restrictions altogether.

""This decision undermines the right of parents to make important health decisions for their young daughters,"" said Anna Higgins of the Family Research Council.

If a woman already is pregnant, the morning-after pill has no effect. It prevents ovulation or fertilization of an egg. According to the medical definition, pregnancy doesn't begin until a fertilized egg implants itself into the wall of the uterus. Still, some critics say Plan B is the equivalent of an abortion pill because it may also be able to prevent a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus, a contention that many scientists - and Korman, in his ruling - said has been discredited."

Now, President Obama has one move left in his attempt to salvage the rollout of his healthcare law: hope the website works soon.

The White House, knowing a functional website is needed to calm its panicky allies, has now entered the wait-and-see period of its triage after the turmoil that has followed the Oct. 1 rollout. With the latest fix to the law unveiled, a bruising House vote behind them and experts working feverishly on the broken website, administration officials believe they may have weathered the worst.

Although Obama’s standing in polls and support within his party have dropped sharply, much like the downward trajectory of George W. Bush’s second term, White House officials believe he can still recover.

That optimistic assessment depends almost entirely on the administration’s ability to reboot healthcare.gov, the once-hyped online insurance marketplace now undergoing extensive repair. At stake are the future of the president’s signature domestic achievement, his political standing and reelection prospects for vulnerable Democrats in Congress.

If the administration meets its goal of a mostly glitch-free site by the end of November, the last two months may be remembered as just another near-death experience for a healthcare overhaul that has had many. Even though many insurance executives and congressional Democrats are angry at Obama for his handling of the healthcare law, both groups have strong incentives to help the Affordable Care Act succeed.

But if the White House fails, the recent setbacks could become the beginning of years of trouble for Democrats in office, as well as those seeking to get there, officials concede.

Administration officials privately acknowledge that no argument defending Obamacare will connect with Americans until they begin to see the effects of the law at work. No work-around or temporary fix will reach enough people to build a critical mass of support. The website has to function, admit edgy aides who sometimes spit the word “website” with the contempt familiar to anyone who has ever called a tech help desk.

Obama revealed his own frustrations Thursday, saying at a White House news conference that he has an obligation to show Americans that the law has made health insurance more affordable and accessible — “if we can just get the darn website working and smooth this thing out.”

Officials said Friday they were making progress on the site’s many glitches and bugs. It now takes less than one second, on average, to load a page, down from eight seconds in the weeks after the launch, said Jeffrey Zients, a former top administration official who was brought back to oversee the repairs. The site can “comfortably” handle 20,000 to 25,000 consumers at the same time and more capacity is being added, he said.

Still, problems persist in the system that sends consumer information to insurers, and as experts have ticked off 200 software problems, more continue to pop up. Zients said the officials expect to make the Nov. 30 goal, but added: “Not all consumers going on the website will have a seamless experience.”

While the tech team works, the president must convince his allies as well as his potential adversaries that, as he said Thursday, he’s a clutch player who knows how to recover from a fumble.

That group includes insurance executives who were called to the White House on Friday to discuss Obama’s answer to the millions of policy cancellation notices sent to surprised consumers. After announcing Thursday that he would allow insurers to rescind those cancellations and extend the policies for another year, the president sought to persuade the executives to take him up on the offer.

The group also includes Democrats on Capitol Hill, many of whom have gone from disgruntled to distrustful of the White House. On Friday, 39 House Democrats voted for the GOP alternative to Obama’s extension fix.

That sizable number of largely swing-district lawmakers was only the most visible sign of broader dissatisfaction that makes Obama’s current holding pattern a challenge. Even those who stuck with the White House on Friday’s vote have expressed frustration. In the wake of Obama’s announcement, lawmakers were left to figure out whether their state officials and insurers would go along with the plan. Skepticism was high.

“The message from the White House is, ‘OK, you can be mad, it’s frustrating. But be on the program,’” said one advisor to a House Democrat, who asked for anonymity while characterizing internal discussions. “But what program is that? The program where every five minutes there’s a different plan?”

Polling shows the public has similar doubts. For the first time in his presidency, fewer than half of Americans polled told Gallup that Obama was a “strong and decisive leader,” a 6-percentage-point drop since September. The perception of Obama as “honest and trustworthy” and public confidence in his ability to manage government took a similar tumble.

A continued slide, combined with continued technical glitches, could leave the White House little choice but to make additional changes to the law — mostly likely extending the enrollment period and delaying the penalties for people who don’t carry insurance. Senate Democrats already have urged such a move.

But in the face of ardent Republican opposition to the law — House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) on Friday repeated his hope to repeal “this train wreck” — the White House has resisted any fix that puts it at the mercy of House Republicans and pushes votes on the law well into an election year.

“That will always be an option of extreme last resort,” said Drew Altman, president and chief executive of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The White House has long argued that the popularity of the healthcare law will hinge on the popularity of its benefits — an untested theory until the public can easily access the online marketplaces that showcase most of those benefits. Still, in the pileup of bad news for Obama, there was some reason to hope that the policy now largely locked behind the broken site might have a chance of winning over the public.

Though enrollment numbers in October were dismal, consumer interest was strong. Nationwide, more than 1.1 million people completed applications to get coverage; 106,000 actually selected a plan.

Data from several states operating their own marketplaces suggest demand for health plans may be accelerating.

In California, 35,000 people selected a health plan in October. Nearly the same number signed up in just the first two weeks of November, according to Covered California, the state’s marketplace. Kentucky has seen similar growth: 5,586 people signed up in October, and nearly 4,000 did in the first two weeks of November.

“We are feeling incredibly optimistic,” said Gwenda Bond, a spokeswoman for the state health agency that operates Kentucky’s marketplace, known as kynect.

The White House may have a long wait, Altman noted, before it knows how far that optimism will spread.

“In the long term, ultimately, the website will be working, this issue of cancellations will be in the rear-view mirror and the real question will be whether people who get coverage under the law like it or not,” Altman said. “The real story about whether the law works or not will unfold next year and the year after that.”

Two landmark laws — including the sweeping 2010 health law — have been enacted since 2008 to improve mental health treatment. But the Obama administration is still writing rules for both measures that will change how insurers deal with millions of Americans who suffer from mental illness and addiction.

Advertisement

That unfinished task has proved extremely fraught, as administration officials struggle to find a balance between the mental health needs of patients and concerns that more government mandates will inflate insurance premiums or complicate implementation of the president’s healthcare law.

“There have been difficult issues to deal with,” Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services, acknowledged Friday in an interview.

Obama this week directed Sebelius’ department to quickly complete the regulations that will direct insurers to cover more mental health services. When the 2010 Affordable Care Act is fully implemented next year, millions of Americans stand to gain access to such care for the first time.

Nationwide, more than 45 million adults suffered from some mental illness in 2011, according to an annual survey by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. About 11 million had a serious illness, and of those more than 40% did not get care.

Among the biggest barriers to treatment have been cost and limits placed on care by insurance companies.

In 2008, President George W. Bush signed legislation that ended differences in the way health plans treat medical benefits and benefits for people who suffer from mental illness or substance abuse. No longer could health plans charge higher co-payments or deductibles for mental health services or place tighter limits on the number of therapy visits they would cover.

The protections in the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act applied only to health plans offered by large employers, however. Obama’s health law is slated to extend those protections in 2014 to plans offered by small employers and to insurance that Americans buy on their own.

The Obama administration also made it clear this week that Medicaid, which together with the Children’s Health Insurance Program covers more than 65 million mostly poor Americans every year, will also have to offer equivalent mental health benefits.

Advertisement

“This was a giant step forward,” said Carol McDaid, a lobbyist who has been working for nearly two decades to expand protections for the mentally ill.

It remains unclear how the Obama administration will resolve a debate over how much information insurance plans must reveal about the way they structure their mental health and medical benefits.

Advertisement

For example, insurance companies sometimes require prior authorization for some treatments, or they may limit provider networks or require patients to undergo less costly treatments first.

But companies do not typically disclose these practices in detail, which can make it difficult for patients to know if insurers are treating mental health benefits differently than medical benefits.

“The consumer is at a complete loss,” said Julie A. Clements, deputy director of regulatory affairs at the American Psychiatric Assn., a leading advocate of more information for consumers.

The insurance industry has resisted more disclosure, however, arguing that outlining these limits would be extremely complicated and unhelpful to consumers.

“We supported the Mental Health Parity Act, and our members are committed to implementing it in the best way for patients,” said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group. “But comparing a treatment plan for a patient with a mental health condition to one with a medical condition is not as simple as just comparing co-pays.”

Sebelius said Friday that the administration would issue final regulations later this year.

Three days over the past few years have been especially meaningful (after, of course, Election Night '08 and the January 2009 inauguration): the day the PPACA law passed, the day the SCOTUS mostly upheld it, and this past Election Day (which seemed to seal its prospects against ever being repealed, though at the moment I'm less sure of that).

My wife works as a primary school special ed teacher. Her job provides decent insurance for her with no premium. To add me and our kids to the policy, though, would cost $577 a month out of a paycheck that right now is only $2400 a month, take home, and does not stretch super far as it is. This is just plain unaffordable for us. Yet the news is, we are shit out of luck.

Almost insulting are the paltry breadcrumbs found in the ""silver lining"":



Under the law, people who go without insurance will generally be subject to tax penalties. In a separate proposed regulation issued on Wednesday, the Internal Revenue Service said that the uninsured children and spouse of an employee would be exempt from the penalties if the cost of coverage for the entire family under an employer’s plan was more than 8 percent of household income.

So rather than helping me get my family covered, you just won't punish us because we can't afford it? Thank you Obama.

As someone pithily put it on the SDMB thread I coincidentally started the day before this news came out (because I was trying to figure out where we stood vis-a-vis the law):This will be comforting to Tea Party paranoiacs, I suppose. To me? Not so much.

The same commenter wrote:



Democrats had better be careful. It looks like the Pubs might be right on what a clusterfuck this will be.

Indeed. I am beyond livid here...despairing, really. How can this be happening?!?

Our total gross income is $46,000, about 200 percent of the FPL so no dice on the Medicaid expansion. The truly perverse part is that if my wife's job had no health insurance at all, we could all get on the exchange for just over $200 a month total.

I may actually have to consider divorcing her as my own income is less than the threshold to get the Medicaid expansion (if my reddish state joins that) or at least get a cheap policy from the federal exchange. Not exactly a pro-marriage policy though!

Anyone who might doubt me when I say, essentially, that if they are losing ME of all people, they are really screwing the pooch, just take a quick peek at this diary I wrote a year and a half ago:

What a perfect way to celebrate the document that is a testament to our liberties and that ensures our rights such as the right to freedom of speech.

On Constitution Day, September 17, 2013 I attended the Obamacare town hall meeting sponsored by St. Louis radio station 97.1 and Americans for Prosperity [Koch brothers].

So what free speech were we subjected to? Dr. Randy Tobler, a physician and radio personality, showobama_syringe_smallered slides depicting President Obama in doctor scrubs, smiling broadly and holding an oversize syringe. The label? “This is going to hurt!”

Another slide had a caricature of President Obama, a large figure, looming over the shoulder of a doctor who was leaning down toward a young child in diapers with a thermometer in his mouth. The label? “Oh, don’t mind me….”

One graphic Dr. Tobler presented showed pieces and parts of what we learned was a medical device from the last century. Apparently it was some sort of pipe used to clear the lungs. Dr. Tobler said that Obamacare is like that pipe, “blowing smoke up your arse.”

Those slides may have been in bad taste but we can all agree with his right to show them. Certainly the 500 or so people in the auditorium enjoyed them; the slides were received with laughter and cheers.

Dr. Tobler showed the slides while freely expressing his view of the horrible “truths” about the effects of Obamacare, “the worst bill ever passed by the United States Congress.” Tobler said:

…with Obamacare we will have insurance but no access to care. The law will “take the wind out of the sails of medical care in the U.S. Doctors will be so overburdened that patients will get fewer services. Patients will only be seen for 7 minutes when and if they can get an appointment. Electronic medical records are costly and doctors will spend too much time dealing with regulations.

He even said that doctors (whom he earlier said care about their patients welfare) would have an incentive to withhold care.

We will be like Canada and Great Britain with patients having to wait months for hip replacements and even for mastectomies. And remember those death panels? There is one - under Obamacare we will experience the death of medical ingenuity in this country. And what about Medicare? Reimbursements will go down by 750 billion dollars.

One woman, a member of the progressive group, Women’s Voices Raised for Social Justice, and Vice President of Missouri Health Care for All, took her opportunity to voice her objection to Dr. Tobler’s remark about the 750 billion dollars. She went to the microphone and said that the $750 billion is being removed from overpayments to private Medicare Advantage plans that charged 14% more than traditional Medicare. She reminded the audience that even Paul Ryan accounted for this removal in his proposed budget.

How were her comments received? Her free speech was booed, and the moderator of the panel made fun of her. On her way back to her seat a man stuck out his foot as though he was stretching, trying to trip her. After she sat back down in her seat on the aisle a woman walked by, punched her hard in the arm and said, “There’s a liberal in every crowd.”

Another woman took the microphone to refute the claim that the majority of Missourians voted against the individual mandate in the health care law. She remarked that the majority of the small number who voted opposed the mandate. Her remarks were not only jeered, but the microphone was turned away so she could no longer speak.

The Missouri legislature’s Speaker of the House, who hosted the town hall meeting, talked about the “facts that shape his policy,” calling on the audience to continue the work of dismantling Obamacare to rid ourselves of that “free plastic health insurance card.” [It doesn’t exist.] Missourians, he noted, voted by a margin of 11.5 percent for Romney, thereby agreeing that the law should be overturned. He told the audience that “We don’t know what is in the law, because “tens of thousands of regulations are being drafted every day.” He called Obamacare “the largest entitlement in the history of the United States” and complained that every state is doing something different. He even blamed President Obama for funds being taken from hospitals for uncompensated care.

No microphone was available to let the audience know that the hospital funds are being lost because Missouri refused to expand Medicaid. If more people are given care under Medicaid, hospitals would receive payments for these patients and have less need for the funds.

One voice of reason among the panelists was Vince Blair, an insurance agent. Blair presented a factual account, with explanatory slides, of what people need to know about how to purchase insurance on the new marketplace. He even encouraged people to go to the online exchange if they are uninsured. He assured the audience that if they are on Medicare they will not lose their benefits but will be unaffected by the new law.

What format should a town hall meeting take? One simple definition describes it as an informal public meeting where everyone in the community is invited to attend and participate in the discussion. Our Constitution Day town hall was a 90-minute, scripted program to present the “facts” as represented by the Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives and a physician who opposes the Affordable Act.

At our town hall, only one side of the issue was presented by the speakers. When the audience jeered those who disagreed with the speakers, and the moderator and panelists mocked the questioners, and the microphone was kept from an audience member, the real mockery being made was that of our tradition of fairness and discussion at a public forum."
"http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-boycott-20131212,0,1785658.story",2013-12-12 22:11:00,['Los Angeles Times Columnist Michael Hiltzik Writes'],Another Obamacare myth exposed: The California doctor ‘boycott’,"You may have heard recently that seven out of 10 California doctors were “boycotting” the state’s Affordable Care Act exchange, known as Covered California.

At least, you’ve heard it if you’ve been following right-wing news sources such as Fox News, which is alive to the irony that so many physicians in “deep-blue California are rebelling against the state’s Obamacare health insurance exchange and won’t participate.”

Like every other mention of this statistic, the Fox story hangs it on Dr. Richard Thorp, a rural internist who is president of the California Medical Assn.

In the news business, this yarn would be classified as “interesting, if true.” But there are a few problems with it, starting with: It’s not true.

Advertisement

In fact, according to Covered California, the only source with verifiable numbers, some 58,000 doctors, or more than 80% of the state’s practicing physicians, will be available to enrollees in the exchange’s health plans.

The “boycott” claim originated with Richard Pollock, a reporter at the conservative Washington Examiner, whose piece doesn’t appear to reflect how the California exchange actually works.

“That article was wrong,” says Molly Weedn, spokeswoman for the CMA. “We have no idea how many doctors are participating. We don’t collect that data.”

In fact, Pollock’s sourcing for the data in his original article, which appeared Dec. 6, is highly questionable, if not flat-out worthless. Pollock revised his story on Tuesday after he got called on it by the CMA. He now says there’s no organized boycott. But he’s still seems to have the story wrong.

Covered California says that the doctors participating in its exchange plans include 100% of Kaiser Permanente’s 14,000 California doctors, 43,000 taking HealthNet patients and 35,000 in Blue Shield’s network. (There’s probably some overlap between the latter two networks.)

Although all Kaiser doctors will be available to all Kaiser enrollees, not all the doctors in other insurance networks will be available to all those insurers’ enrollees; there are reports that some may see patients only in non-exchange plans.

The narrowing of physician networks has long been a fact of life in American healthcare and didn’t originate with the Affordable Care Act. It’s a cost-saving trend and in some respects it makes sense: Insurers make reimbursement deals with doctors, and physicians who don’t want to accept the proffered deals won’t see that company’s customers.

Judging from his original article, Pollock seems to think that Covered California somehow imposed a standard reimbursement rate on all the state’s doctors, or perhaps that insurers in the exchange pegged all reimbursements to the state’s low Medicaid reimbursement rate. Neither is true. Insurers made their own deals with doctors, and it’s unlikely that they were pegged to Medicaid (known in California as Medi-Cal). It’s possible that some were pegged to Medicare, which pays more than Medicaid, but plainly there wasn’t a one-size-fits-all reimbursement figure for all insurers and all plans.

Advertisement

As for Pollock’s 70% nonparticipation figure, he says he arrived at it after talking to “a half-dozen” independent insurance brokers and agents across the state. He told me their estimates were consistent.

The problem is that insurance agents have no way of estimating physician participation across the state; they’re typically small businesses that tend to operate locally; they can check for a client to see if a particular doctor or group is participating in a plan, but they don’t have access to a statewide database. They can concoct an estimate from what they see, but they’re dealing with a specialized clientele and their vision is more likely to be myopic than Lasik-clear.

The CMA says Pollock offered his estimate of 70% nonparticipation to Thorp, the CMA president, who responded that it “wouldn’t surprise” him.

That was an error on Thorp’s part; since his own organization doesn’t have its own estimate, he should have kept his mouth shut. But it’s the Washington Examiner that erected its big alarmist story on the basis of this tiny little foundation, and it’s the anti-Obamacare right-wing noise machine that pumped it up to the volume of a shriek.

Advertisement

As for the very idea of an organized “boycott,” Pollock’s latest article states that “California’s budding doctor rebellion against Obamacare appears to be genuinely spontaneous, lacking leadership from a single individual or organization.”

This is known as taking a quarter-step back when a full step is required. What he should say isn’t that “California’s budding doctor rebellion” is “spontaneous,” but that it’s spurious. It exists in the mind of the Washington Examiner and has spread, like an epidemic, to a bunch of other susceptible patients in the news world. It should never have started, and it’s high time it was eradicated."

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama pledged to stamp out the gremlins plaguing his administration’s signature health-care overhaul Monday, saying there was no “sugarcoating” the difficulties faced by Americans hoping to sign up for insurance coverage online.

“Nobody’s madder than me about the website not working as well as it should, which means it’s going to get fixed,” Obama said during an appearance Monday at the White House Rose Garden.

There’s “no excuse for the problems,” Obama said. But he said tech industry experts were being brought in to help workers trying to fix the site.

“You can bypass the website and apply by phone or in person,” he said. “So don’t let problems with the website deter you from signing up or signing your family up or showing your friends how to sign up, because it is worth it. It will save you money.”

A standoff with congressional Republicans over government spending and raising the federal borrowing limit – triggered by GOP efforts to defund the program – distracted public attention from the problems of the new health care system, popularly known as Obamacare. But with that standoff over, the GOP has turned its fire back onto the problems faced by the website and onto Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, calling for her to resign.

Sebelius attended Monday’s Rose Garden remarks, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced that she was expected to testify at an October 30 hearing on the cause of the problems.

The committee is already scheduled to hold a hearing on Thursday, with website and administrative contractors CGI, Serco and Equifax set to testify on their roles in the situation. Sebelius had been invited to this week’s hearing but had a scheduling conflict, her office said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney defended the program on CNN’s “Piers Morgan Live,” saying that while HealthCare.gov is struggling, the administration’s health care reform “is not failing.”

“Health insurance provides security that a lot of these families haven’t had in the past,” Carney said.

Have you had trouble signing up? Let us know

In the Rose Garden Monday, Obama said “the essence of the law” – aimed at providing access to health insurance for the roughly 48 million Americans without it – “is working just fine.”

“In some cases, actually, it’s exceeding expectations. The prices are lower than expected, and the choice is greater than we expected,” he said.

“But the problem has been that the website that’s supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance is not working the way it should for everybody,” he continued. “There’s no sugarcoating it. The website has been too slow. People are getting stuck during the application process.”

And in a shot at the law’s critics, he said, “It’s time for folks to stop rooting for its failure, because hardworking middle class families are rooting for its success.”

But Rep. Luke Messer, R-Indiana, told CNN that his staffers were trying to sign up via HealthCare.gov while Obama was speaking, “and the website didn’t work.”

“This is one of those areas where the president’s not going to be able to hide behind the rhetoric,” said Messer, who supported the failed Republican effort to halt the program.

HealthCare.gov: What works, what doesn’t

Other Republicans kept up their attacks on the health care reforms on Monday, with the office of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeting that when a visit to the Obamacare website made a trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles seem pleasant, “it’s time for the President to consider delaying this rushed effort.”

A Washington Post/ABC News poll released Monday showed that 56% of respondents consider the website difficulties a harbinger of broader problems with the Affordable Care Act, a constant target of conservative critics who consider it the epitome of big government overreach.

Obama administration officials have highlighted the fact that nearly 500,000 people have filled out applications for Obamacare, though the number who purchased coverage remains unknown. Initial difficulties have started to ease for logging on to the website for the new exchanges, some of which are run by states and others by the federal government.

But problems now are occurring further along the process, with insurance industry sources having said they are getting some applications with missing information. The application portion of the website was brought down this weekend for overnight maintenance, as it has been on previous weekends and some weeknights.

“To ensure that we make swift progress, and that the consumer experience continues to improve, our team has called in additional help to solve some of the more complex technical issues we are encountering,” the Health and Human Services department said in a blog post Sunday. “Our team is bringing in some of the best and brightest from both inside and outside government to scrub in with the team and help improve HealthCare.gov.”

Logging in tough for some early registrants

The administration is still not releasing the numbers on how many people have taken the next step of enrolling: choosing a specific health care plan. The administration has said it will do that monthly, so the first tally of enrollment numbers will come in November.

The Congressional Budget Office has said it expects 7 million people to enroll by April 1.

Although March 31 is the deadline for people to get health insurance or face a fine, officials warn that failure to sign up by February 15 could be a problem because of the time needed for the coverage to take effect. Carney told reporters on Monday afternoon that lingering problems in signing people up could result in relief, noting that the law makes clear that “if you do not have access to affordable health insurance, you will not have to pay a penalty for not having affordable health insurance.”

Hope for a smoother ride on HealthCare.gov

He also repeated the President’s assertion that high demand in the first weeks of the new exchanges contributed to the website problems, noting that the larger-than-expected response exposed existing “glitches and kinks.”

Although the administration tally of applications did not break down how many of the applications came through state-run exchanges, a CNN survey of officials with those exchanges found that at least 257,000 people had signed up for new insurance plans as of Friday afternoon. Not all of them had made a payment, and not every state responded to the CNN request.

A ConsumerReports.org article last week offered tips for people trying to sign up, but had the following advice for those overwhelmed by the difficulties:

“If all this is too much for you to absorb, follow our previous advice: Stay away from HealthCare.gov for at least another month if you can. Hopefully that will be long enough for its software vendors to clean up the mess they’ve made.”

But in a statement issued Monday night, the group said its criticism of the website doesn’t mean it now opposes the Affordable Care Act. Critics of Obamacare are misrepresenting the nonprofit organization’s position, Consumer Reports said.

My parents are too young for Medicare, too rich for Medicaid, and right at the age when one develops conditions that must be ""managed"" and not just cured with a week's worth of antibiotics. When my mother was in the ICU, they gave her steroids to save her life, leaving her with steroids-induced diabetes. My dad, a mechanic who's worked 12+ hours a day since he was a teenager, has high blood pressure. Their conditions are the usual suspects for the 60s set.

My parents were never politically active before. As immigrants, they voted but didn't really follow the ins and out of the process. That changed as I became more politically involved. When my mother voted for Barack Obama (this was before she got sick), she said she was voting for him mainly because of his health insurance ideas. ""He better keep his promise. If he doesn't,"" she told me, ""I want you to write him a letter.""

I've typed up many a complaint letter for my mom. Trust me, you don't want to be on the receiving end of one of her letters.

Health care reform was the issue for my parents in the voting booth. They were, after all, spending most of their income on health insurance and health care costs.

To say my parents' health insurance before Obamacare was a ripoff would be like saying that the universe is kind of large and filled with some stars.

Their premium is $710 a month. Their deductible is $10,000 a year. Their medications are expensive. As a result, they've forgone a lot of preventative care and generally avoid doctor's visits. Here's the breakdown:

$8,520 - premiums

$10,000 - deductible

____

$18,520 out of pocket, not including coinsurance.

$18,520.

That's an obscenity that has no place in a modern, civilized society.

As their premiums have increased year after year, they've tried to shop around for better rates. Almost no one else would take them. If a company was open to taking on a couple with so many pre-existing conditions, it took advantage of the situation and quoted them prices that would have required them both to work two jobs. Ridiculous, to say the least.

Of course, I've tried to defray their costs over the years, as have my sisters. But my parents are very, very proud and refused to accept help, choosing instead to do what millions around the country have been forced to do: build a family budget around the costs of health insurance and hope that they don't get sick(er).





TRYING TO GET ENROLLED UNDER THE ACA: THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE VERY, VERY UGLY

As a digital strategist, I've produced more than enough websites to know how the launch process works. It's complicated, glitchy and no matter how well you test beforehand, something always goes wrong.

I was on healthcare.gov right when it officially launched around midnight, even tweeting out a picture of the site when it quietly went live.

I tried creating an account and hit the security question wall and couldn't get past it. I knew that glitches are part and parcel of any site launch. Time to wait it out.

Hours of glitches turned into days of defects, which turned into weeks of malfunction. I must have tried logging in/working the application dozens of times (no exaggeration). I'm no tech dummie, so I kept trying across browsers, clearing my cache/cookies, etc.

I finally managed to get my mother into the application phase, but her identity could not be proofed. I uploaded her ID and waited. After a week or so, I called the Marketplace again.

I will say this for the call desk workers at the Marketplace: generally, they could not have been more polite. Every person I spoke too was remarkably friendly, apologetic and understanding.

For all the hype in the press, it’s indisputable that the site has been getting better by the day. Every day, I was able to go a little further in the process.

On my mom's birthday, I asked her half-jokingly if she wanted to try logging in once more to get herself the Best Birthday Present Ever.

I sat down with her and we tried again. And finally, it worked.





THE REAL RATE SHOCK: BETTER HEALTH CARE FOR $53 A MONTH



Let there be no mistake, health insurance in this country is still outrageously expensive. At first launch, the marketplace isn't going to dramatically decrease the actual premiums set by the insurance companies. You'll still see those wince-inducing numbers on the screen as you research your choices.

The difference is that now, you may also see your taxes at work. If you're like my parents, you'll see a premium subsidy that takes the bite out of the insurance company price-gouging.

For my parents, their subsidy is a hefty one. They choose a silver plan where the premium will now be $53 a month.

Their new plan covers my mom's pulmonary specialist, all of her screenings (x-rays, CTs, etc), requires only a $1,500 deductible and $4,500 max out of pocket cost and the insurance company kicks in 100 percent after the deductible is met.

Granted, there are still glitches. Although she wanted to make a payment right away, she couldn't and the Marketplace reps say it will take some time for the information to transfer over to the insurance company.

Still, affordable, better coverage is the best birthday present she could ask for.

My parents' story isn't unique. Across the country, those who need help the most paying for their health insurance and health care costs are breathing a sigh of relief. Like the Sherburne family in Utah:



It took half-a-dozen tries over several days. But Phil Sherburne struck gold on Saturday — silver actually — with family health coverage purchased on the Affordable Care Act’s online exchange. After plugging in particulars about his family of five, the Salt Lake City business owner was able to compare 38 plans and apply for tax credits to put toward his monthly premiums. He settled on a silver-level plan from Altius that retails for about $850 a month. After tax credits, the Sherburnes will pay just $123 a month.

[S]he’s grateful for the Affordable Care Act, and she doesn’t have much patience with its many critics. “I think those people have never experienced what I’ve experienced,’’ she says. “They are shutting the door on the cancer survivors and the self-employed.”

I am a retired engineer on Medicare, and my wife had long been insured by Cigna, under a group plan from my engineers' society. Because of minor pre-existing conditions, she could not leave that plan, because no other plan would insure her. The Cigna premiums increased to $5,000 per quarter, or $20,000 per year, just for my wife. This year, Cigna canceled the entire plan, leaving her with no insurance. So, we turned to Obamacare. She found it simple and easy to sign up through an agent in a 10-minute phone call. She obtained their best plan, providing much much better coverage than in the past, at a cost of $3,000 per quarter. My wife would not have insurance coverage at all as of Jan. 1, if not for Obamacare. And, here's the kicker - we now are saving $8,000 per year, for a very much better plan.

FREEDOM TO SHOP AROUND

About a month or so ago, I received a notice that my health insurance company was raising my rates. The 12 percent increase was expected. After all, health premiums have been skyrocketing for years. That alarming rate was why President Obama and the Democrats pushed for health insurance reform in the first place.

Much has been made of the president's promise that ""if you like your health insurance, you can keep it."" Less has been made of a much more important fact: If you hate your health insurance, you can leave it.

Now, if an insurance company jacks up your rate, you have the freedom to shop around. I plan to and I'm sure I'll be able to find a plan with better value now that the exchange has been launched.

As for my parents? Well, in writing this, I asked my mother if she wanted to append a letter to President Obama.

""Just tell him thanks,"" she said. Then she smiled.

""It was a good birthday."""

An august committee had for the first time relied only on the most rigorous scientific evidence to formulate guidelines to prevent heart attacks and strokes, which kill one out of every three Americans. The group had worked for five years, unpaid, to develop them. Then, at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association, it all went horribly awry.

Many leading cardiologists now say the credibility of the guidelines, released Nov. 14, is shattered. And the troubled effort to devise them has raised broader questions about what kind of evidence should be used to direct medical practice, how changes should be introduced and even which guidelines to believe.

“This was a catastrophic misunderstanding of how you go about this sort of huge change in public policy,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, a Cleveland Clinic cardiologist who is a past president of the American College of Cardiology. “There will be a large backlash.”

What went wrong? Some critics say the drafting committee mistakenly relied only on randomized controlled clinical trials, the gold standard of medical evidence, but ignored other strong data that would have led to different conclusions. The group’s efforts were severely underfunded. And it announced fundamental changes in medical practices without allowing a public debate before its guidelines were completed."

A White House spokesman says President Obama cannot take a position on Kermit Gosnell trial

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said aspects of the trial are %22unsettling%22

WASHINGTON — President Obama is keeping abreast of the ongoing murder trial of abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, but the White House is steering clear of delving too deeply into the case.

Gosnell, who is on trial in Philadelphia, has been charged in the murder of a woman during a botched abortion, as well as the murders of seven babies born alive.

""The president does not and cannot take a position on an ongoing trial, so I won't as well,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said on Monday.

Obama is ""aware"" of the case but it would be inappropriate for the president or White House to weigh in on an ongoing legal proceeding, Carney added.

""Certainly, the things that you hear and read about this case are unsettling,"" he added.

The trial is in its fifth week. Former employees have described doing ultrasounds, giving intravenous drugs and helping with abortions, even though they lacked medical training or certification, in unsanitary conditions.

One unlicensed doctor, Stephen Massof, testified that Gosnell taught him to cut the necks of babies after they were born to ensure the babies died. Massof has pleaded guilty to two counts of third-degree murder, and seven other former employees of the unlicensed Philadelphia clinic have also been convicted in the case.

Gosnell's defense attorney says no babies were born alive and that the patient died from unexpected complications.

The trial started March 18, but initially received little national media attention. That changed after an opinion column in Thursday's USA TODAY in which contributor Kirsten Powers criticized major media outlets for ignoring the trial."

Bush’s “16 words” in his 2003 State of the Union address making the case for military action in Iraq? Sen. John Kerry charged that Bush “hoodwinked the American people.” Sen. Hillary Clinton said Bush “misled” the country. And Sen. Barack Obama accused the White House of “shading intelligence reports to support its case.”

Well, now it seems President Obama has his own 16 words to answer for: “If you like your health care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health care plan.” (Actually, it was a little more than 16 words if you include what the president said next: “Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.”)

Obama attempted to move the goal posts in his speech in Boston’s Faneuil Hall Wednesday, declaring that if you like your current health plan, “For the vast majority . . . you can keep it.” Sorry, he didn’t say “the vast majority” back in 2009. He said you can keep your plan. Period. No matter what.

Indeed, Obama repeated this promise on at least 24 separate occasions — before and after the law went into effect. It was critical to his case. Without his 16-word pledge that no one would lose his or her health plans, Obamacare might never have become law.

But Obama’s 16 words were untrue. Across the country, Americans are now seeing their health plans discontinued — and experts say the cancellations could eventually reach 16 million. As one woman in California who got a cancellation letter from her insurer told the Los Angeles Times, “All we’ve been hearing the last three years is if you like your policy you can keep it . . . I’m infuriated because I was lied to.”

Indeed, there is good reason to believe that the administration not only knew but fully intended for all these people to lose their existing plans. The Health and Human Services Department specifically wrote regulations to ensure that they would — narrowing a provision in the law “grandfathering” in existing plans so that “40 to 67 percent” of those in the individual market would not be able to keep their policies. That’s because moving millions of customers out of the individual and small group markets and into the exchanges is critical to making the scheme financially viable. Indeed, the survival of Obamacare depends on it.

The individual and small group markets are made up largely of healthy people who don’t use a lot of services. The administration needs at least 2 million healthy people who don’t use a lot of services to join the exchanges in order to subsidize coverage for the poor and the sick. If they don’t join, the risk pool gets worse, prices go up, eventually insurers will flee the exchanges — and the whole thing collapses.

While the individual mandate is supposed to coerce uninsured healthy people without insurance to join the exchanges, the problem is that the penalties are too weak — just $95 in the first year. Why would a healthy person who does not think they need insurance pay $55 a month (or $660 a year) for a $6,000-deductible plan when they could just pay a $95 penalty instead?

So the administration needed some way to force currently insured healthy people into the exchanges. How serendipitous, then, that millions of mostly healthy people are suddenly seeing their health plans cancelled. If they cannot afford the skyrocketing prices to keep similar coverage, they have no choice but to join the exchanges. The result? A massive involuntary transfer of Americans out of private health insurance they were happy with into Obamacare plans.

These folks are the marks the administration has targeted to pay for Obamacare. Or they would be, except for one problem the White House did not anticipate: The Obamacare Web site does not work. So now millions of people who will lose their health coverage on Jan. 1 are unable to sign up for alternative coverage through the Obamacare exchanges.

It was Obama’s objective from the start to destroy the market in order to fund Obamacare. He wants these people to lose coverage so they have no choice but to sign up for the exchanges. Obama all but admitted this in his Boston speech. “If you’re getting one of these [cancellation] letters, just shop around in the new marketplace,” he declared. In other words, don’t worry if the plan you’re happy with is being cancelled, just join Obamacare! That was the plan all along.

All of which suggests that Obama’s 16 words were no accident.

Friday, the same Chicago Tribune called for ObamaCare to be immediately repealed before it can do any more damage:

Stop digging. Start over.

As Friday dawns, here’s what a health insurance crisis looks like to many millions of Americans: Barely six weeks shy of 2014, they do not know whether they will have medical coverage Jan. 1. Or which hospitals and doctors they might patronize. Or what they may pay to protect themselves and their families against the chance of medical and financial catastrophe. How much, that is, they may pay in order to satisfy the Democratic politicians and federal bureaucrats who are worsening a metastasizing health coverage fiasco. …

We understand why the president and leaders of his party want to rescue whatever they can of Obamacare. On their watch, official Washington has blown the launch of a new entitlement program … under the schedule they alone set in early 2010.

What we don’t understand is their reluctance to give that failure more than lip service. Many of the Americans who heard their president say Thursday that “we fumbled the rollout of this health care law” would have been pleased to hear him add: So we’re admitting it. This law is a bust. We’re starting over.

You can expect the calls to repeal ObamaCare to grow from non-GOP sources in the coming days. The news released Saturday that thousands of doctors have been dropped from Medicare Advantage is a likely tipping point. Destroying health care for the elderly is The Third Rail on steroids. This is Armageddon for Democrats. The only chance they have is to repeal. If they do not, they will be wiped out in 2014 and 2016.

Malloy', 'November']",How we got Obamacare to work,"Jay Inslee, a Democrat, is governor of Washington. Steve Beshear, a Democrat, is governor of Kentucky. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, is governor of Connecticut.

In our states — Washington, Kentucky and Connecticut — the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” is working. Tens of thousands of our residents have enrolled in affordable health-care coverage. Many of them could not get insurance before the law was enacted.

People keep asking us why our states have been successful. Here’s a hint: It’s not about our Web sites.

Sure, having functioning Web sites for our health-care exchanges makes the job of meeting the enormous demand for affordable coverage much easier, but each of our state Web sites has had its share of technical glitches. As we have demonstrated on a near-daily basis, Web sites can continually be improved to meet consumers’ needs.

The Affordable Care Act has been successful in our states because our political and community leaders grasped the importance of expanding health-care coverage and have avoided the temptation to use health-care reform as a political football.

In Washington, the legislature authorized Medicaid expansion with overwhelmingly bipartisan votes in the House and Senate this summer because legislators understood that it could help create more than 10,000 jobs, save more than $300 million for the state in the first 18 months, and, most important, provide several hundred thousand uninsured Washingtonians with health coverage.

In Kentucky, two independent studies showed that the Bluegrass State couldn’t afford not to expand Medicaid. Expansion offered huge savings in the state budget and is expected to create 17,000 jobs.

In Connecticut, more than 50 percent of enrollment in the state exchange, Access Health CT, is for private health insurance. The Connecticut exchange has a customer satisfaction level of 96.5 percent, according to a survey of users in October, with more than 82 percent of enrollees either “extremely likely” or “very likely” to recommend the exchange to a colleague or friend.

In our states, elected leaders have decided to put people, not politics, first.

President Obama announced an administrative change last week that would allow insurance companies to continue offering existing plans to those who want to keep them. It is up to state insurance commissioners to determine how and whether this option works for their states, and individual states will come to different conclusions.

What we all agree with completely, though, is the president’s insistence that our country cannot go back to the dark days before health-care reform, when people were regularly dropped from coverage, and those with “bare bones” plans ended up in medical bankruptcy when serious illness struck, many times because their insurance didn’t cover much of anything.

Thanks to health-care reform and the robust exchanges in our states, people are getting better coverage at a better price.

One such person is Brad Camp, a small-business owner in Kingston, Wash., who received a cancellation notice in September from his insurance carrier. He went to the state exchange, the Washington Healthplanfinder, and for close to the same premium his family was paying before got upfront coverage for doctor’s office visits and prescription drug , vision and dental coverage. His family was able to keep the same insurance carrier and doctors and qualified for tax credits to help cover the cost.

Since Howard Stovall opened his sign and graphics business in Lexington, Ky., in 1998, he has paid half the cost of health insurance for his eight employees. With the help of Stovall’s longtime insurance agent and Kentucky’s health exchange, Kynect, Stovall’s employees are saving 5 percent to 40 percent each on new health insurance plans with better benefits. Stovall can afford to provide additional employee benefits, including full disability coverage and part of the cost of vision and dental plans, while still saving the business 50 percent compared with the old plans.

In Connecticut, Anne Masterson was able to reduce her monthly premiums from $965 to $313 for similar coverage, including a $145 tax credit. Masterson is able to use her annual premium savings of $8,000 to pay bills or save for retirement.

These sorts of stories could be happening in every state if politicians would quit rooting for failure and directly undermining implementation of the Affordable Care Act — and, instead, put their constituents first. Health reform is working for the people of Washington, Kentucky and Connecticut because elected leaders on both sides of the aisle came together to do what is right for their residents.

We urge Congress to get out of the way and to support efforts to make health-care reform work for everyone. We urge our fellow governors, most especially those in states that refused to expand Medicaid, to make health-care reform work for their people too."

Administration officials reported Sunday that about 1.1 million people had enrolled in health plans using the federal website, HealthCare.gov, the main entry point for coverage in 36 states. Nearly all the enrollments came in the last couple of weeks as the deadline approached for coverage that would take effect Jan. 1.

Several hundred thousand people have enrolled on separate sites run by 14 states and the District of Columbia, with the largest figure coming from California, where more than 400,000 have signed up.

An exact count nationwide is not yet available because not all states have tallied their figures, but the total appears to be about 2 million. That remains short of the administration’s original goal of 3 million by this point, but marks a significant recovery from the system’s disastrous debut in October.

More than 4 million additional people have been found eligible for coverage under the law’s expansion of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

How the law will ultimately work and whether it can endure remain unclear, though the fact that coverage will now be real for several million people will almost certainly change the debate over Republican efforts to repeal it.

While that broader political fight plays out, doctors, hospitals and pharmacies across the country are bracing for more confusion as patients struggle to understand their new coverage.

Some may show up at physicians’ offices without insurance cards, victims of the error-plagued enrollment process that bedeviled the initial rollout.

Others may discover that although they’re properly enrolled in a health plan, the doctor or hospital they visit or the prescription they want to fill won’t be covered by the plan they have selected.

Still other patients, including many who have never had insurance before, may be shocked to learn they have to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket before their coverage kicks in. Like employer-provided health plans, many insurance plans set up under the health law come with low premiums and high deductibles.

Surveys indicate that many Americans have little understanding of basic insurance concepts such as co-pays and deductibles.

“We still have a lot of education to do for the average man on the street who doesn’t really understand the Affordable Care Act,” said J. Mario Molina, chief executive of Molina Healthcare Inc., a California-based insurer that is selling policies in nine states.

Relatively few healthcare providers are likely to encounter significant numbers of patients with problems related to coverage under the new law. The number of people covered by the law is dwarfed by the more than 270 million people who already have some form of health insurance through an employer or a government program such as Medicare.

Jeff Goldman, vice president for coverage policy at the American Hospital Assn., said most hospitals already had systems to help patients sort out their insurance, something that consumers often struggle with, particularly at the beginning of the year.

“We are pretty confident that people are prepared,” he said.

Still, the health law remains a political lightning rod, and providers and others anticipate every problem will be magnified.

“The fact that not everything will go exactly as was intended by the ACA when most of its biggest changes start to go live … should surprise no one,” the American College of Physicians warned its members in a recent newsletter outlining potential headaches after Jan. 1.

“In a less political environment, the mantra as problems arise with ACA implementation would be fix it, not nix it. Until we get to that point, we’ll have to muddle through.”

HealthCare.gov and the separate state sites are the primary portals created by the health law to help Americans who don’t get coverage through work to select a plan.

Plans sold on these marketplaces must meet new consumer standards. Insurers are prohibited from turning away customers with preexisting medical conditions. Americans making less than four times the federal poverty line — about $46,000 for an individual and $94,000 for a family of four — will qualify for government subsidies to offset the cost of their premiums.

Enrollment in these plans started Oct. 1 and is scheduled to go until March 31. The surge in enrollment in the last few weeks has intensified anxieties about potential mix-ups early next year and prompted administration officials and insurers to take steps to try to head off problems.

TIMELINE: The year in politics

Insurers announced last week they would allow consumers who selected a health plan in December to begin getting coverage Wednesday even if they don’t make their first premium payment until later in the month. Initially, consumers had to pay before Tuesday to be guaranteed coverage in January.

Administration officials have also asked insurers to initially cover some out-of-network care and prescriptions to help consumers who are moving from one provider network to another. That could be particularly important for patients with complex conditions such as cancer or AIDS. Industry officials said doing so may be difficult.

CVS Caremark Executive Vice President Helena Foulkes said the pharmacy giant may provide some patients with a “transitional supply” of prescriptions if their insurance is temporarily interrupted in January.

Such interruptions dogged the first few weeks of the Medicare prescription drug benefit in 2006, prompting the George W. Bush administration to step in to help seniors who couldn’t get their medications, according to former Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt. Speaking to a group of insurance industry officials in Washington recently, Leavitt cautioned that something similar may again be necessary.

Supporters of the Affordable Care Act are nonetheless urging patients to be careful as they begin trying to use their insurance next year.

Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, the state’s insurance marketplace, emphasized that consumers shouldn’t assume their previous doctor or prescription would be covered under their new health plan.

“Going to an out-of-network provider subjects you to out-of-network rules. Consumers need to understand that,” Lee said.

For their part, physicians and hospitals anticipate they will have to assume more responsibility for educating patients about their insurance, a job many are increasingly doing anyway.

MemorialCare Health System, which runs six hospitals in Southern California, has given its front-line admissions staff additional training on how to deal with a barrage of questions about co-pays, benefits and networks, said John Cascell, a vice president at the system.

In Ohio, the state medical association anticipates calls from members who have problems submitting insurance claims for new patients.

In Texas and elsewhere, physician groups are already increasingly asking patients to leave a credit card on file to make collecting bills easier as co-pays and deductibles increase, said Tom Banning, chief executive of the Texas Academy of Family Physicians.

Despite the challenges of dealing with newly insured patients, however, many medical providers fear that the uninsured still pose a far greater challenge. That’s particularly true in states, including Texas, where lawmakers oppose the health law and have declined to expand their Medicaid programs next year. Millions of poor Americans will lack coverage next year in those states.

“The much bigger issue is uncompensated care,” said Dave Dillon, a spokesman for the Missouri Hospital Assn. “That is what we are most concerned about.”

http://www.nbcnews.com/health/whats-come-obamacare-6C10553860,2013-07-10 08:48:20+00:00,"['Maggie Fox', 'Senior Writer']",What’s to come with Obamacare,"The Obama administration is still taking a political beating for its one-year delay of one major part of health reform – the requirement that all employers with more than 50 full-time workers provide health insurance for them.



That provision was going to go into effect in January. But it’s not the biggest provision, and the White House says the most important reforms are still on track.

The biggest, by far, is the opening of the health insurance exchanges – the online marketplaces where people can buy insurance if they don’t already get it from an employer, or from a public plan such as Medicare, Medicaid or the military.

Other changes yet to come: the requirement that most Americans get health insurance somewhere or pay a fine and new rules that prevent insurers from turning patients away just because they’ve been sick before and from putting lifetime caps on how much patients can run up in medical expenses. Also still to come are limits on the minimum coverage that can be provided, wider eligibility for Medicaid in some states, the formation of so-called accountable care organizations, rules meant to force hospitals to provide better care and, in 2018, a tax on “Cadillac” health insurance plans.

Here’s a rundown:

Exchanges. The exchanges are on track to start enrolling people on Oct. 1, the administration says, and to start paying for people’s health care on Jan. 1.

The Kaiser Family Foundation says about 18 percent of Americans under the age of 65 don’t have health insurance. The exchanges are one way that the 2010 Affordable Care Act aims to fix this. The Congressional Budget Office projects that 26 million people will buy health insurance on the exchanges by 2022.

Expect a big advertising campaign this summer. “We have a very long way to go on public awareness and education on what is going to be available,” says Caroline Pearson, a vice president at the consulting firm Avalere Health in Washington, D.C. “We are going to see a big push from state and federal governments and private groups to educate people.”

According to Kaiser, 79 percent of the general public and 87 percent of people who don’t have health insurance know little or nothing about the exchanges. Groups like Enroll America are planning to send volunteers door to door, while the Obama administration is looking to celebrities, local government officials, non-profit organizations and even public libraries to help spread the message.

Jay Angoff, who helped construct health reform at the Health and Human Services department before returning to private law firm Mehri & Skalet, says the health insurance companies are almost certain to start weighing in, too. After all, it will be private companies that will be providing the insurance – the so-called public option never got off the ground.

“They have been able to persuade people to buy lousy insurance at high rates,” Angoff told NBC News. “I am confident in the insurance companies’ ability to market to people. The main targets will be the healthy young adults who can pay premiums without filing too many claims. They’ll be needed to help provide a pool of cash to pay for the sick people who will sign up – and they’ll be the hardest sell because they know they don’t need the insurance as badly as others.

Individual mandate. This is a provision the insurance companies demanded, so they can be certain to have a big pool of paying customers. Just about everyone will be required to have health insurance starting Jan. 1.

Most Americans already do – through an employer, or via Medicare, Medicaid or Tricare for military families. People without will have to pay a small fine – as low as $95 the first year – if they don’t go either to Medicaid or the exchanges for insurance, or if they choose to skip whatever their employers offer. “The penalties the first year are very low and may not be enough to sway people,” Pearson says.

The federal government will help pay the premiums for anyone making up to about $46,000 for an individual, as much as $94,000 for a family of four.

Some people may fall through the cracks. About half of the states have declined to expand Medicaid to make more people eligible, and the federal government had counted on that Medicaid expansion. So in those states, people who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for the exchanges may have the uncomfortable choice of paying the full premium on an exchange, or breaking the law and perhaps paying a fine.

People who make too little to file for income tax are off the hook – tax returns are where people will be reporting their coverage or lack thereof.

Medicaid expansion. The original 2010 Affordable Care Act required all states to make Medicaid – the state-federal health insurance plan for the poor – more widely available. The federal government was going to pick up the full cost for several years. But the Supreme Court ruled that was unconstitutional in 2012. Now just 26 states say they’ll expand Medicaid, according to the Advisory Board Company.

So people who live in a state expanding Medicaid will start qualifying in January, while those in one of the states that is not will be left with the status quo. The CBO projects that 12 million people will become newly eligible for Medicaid in the states that choose to expand their offerings by 2022.



There may be a “woodwork effect” as well, says Pearson. All the publicity surrounding the Medicaid expansion may make people who were already eligible aware of the program, and they may sign up for the first time.

Guaranteed issue. This is just a jargony way of saying health insurance companies cannot turn you away any more because you have had a pre-existing condition. This is one of the provisions that has worried insurance companies, because they fear an influx of new customers who have not been insured and who have expensive conditions – and a pent-up demand for medical care. That starts with new insurance plans issued Jan 1. Companies can no longer stop covering people once they reach a lifetime limit, either. This provision removes one of the things people hated most about health insurance – they’d get cut off just as they were the sickest and needed it most.

Community rating. Another piece of jargon meaning the insurance companies can only charge a certain amount more for older people, and they cannot charge women higher premiums than men any more. They can charge smokers more, however. This provision also starts with new policies issued after Jan. 1.

Essential benefits. This kicks in on Jan. 1, also. It’s a list of conditions that health insurance must cover, from birth control to mental health care and dental care for children. Any insurance company offering a product on the exchanges has to cover this list.

Insurers and other experts say this list of provisions is what will make health insurance more expensive on the exchanges. “I think there definitely will be sticker shock,” Person says. “The premiums will be significant and for people (who currently buy individual insurance) they are going to be higher than what they are today.” It may take a while for people to appreciate that they are getting value for their money, Pearson says.

Wellness programs. Starting in 2014, employers can expand their wellness programs, offering discounts on premiums, cash rewards, gym memberships and other incentives for those who lose weight, take part in diabetes control programs, or similar plans to improve their health.

Hospital incentives. Starting in 2015, the administration hopes to encourage hospitals to drop some bad habits by lowering what it pays them for treating Medicare patients. Hospitals will get paid less when patients who get some infections, bedsores and other conditions while they are in the hospital. This starts with a 1 percent cut in 2015, and grows over the years.

Cadillac tax. You don’t have to worry about this until 2018. It’s a tax on some of the most generous health insurance plans and is meant to discourage unnecessary and expensive tests and doctor visits that are helping drive up health spending. “That one is certainly a big deal for unionized workers,” Pearson says.

“It’s a time bomb in the law,” says Adam Solander with Epstein Becker Green, a Washington, D.C., legal and consulting firm. Employers who offer health insurance plans worth more than $10,200 a year will have to pay a 40 percent federal tax on that. “Employers will have to figure out ways to make their coverage cheaper,” Solander says. “Hopefully, it will lower the cost of coverage.”

Expect confusion. The bottom line – expect some confusion and some bumps in the road over the next few years. Insurance companies don’t yet know if the exchanges are worth the effort, so companies may hop in and out of the market, and they may change the premiums they charge in different states. Big group insurers that mostly offer company-paid health insurance may not dip their toes into the exchanges immediately.

“The hope is the large insurers will see this is a profitable market and jump in over the next year or two,“ says Timothy Jost, a health law expert at Washington & Lee University in Virginia.

In smaller states without many choices, insurers may continue to hang back. “I think it is fair to say in many states there are not going to be that many insurers in the exchanges,” Jost says.

If people refuse to sign up for ObamaCare, the program collapses. Nothing would be more satisfying than to see ObamaCare go the way of Prohibition (without the violence): as something else that pushed the wonderfully unruly American people too far.

Contrary to what the media are telling you, the shutdown is not helping ObamaCare. Again and again, conservatives have been taunted by the media with the cry of, “If you hadn’t shut down the government, we’d be covering the ObamaCare launch debacle.”

Huh?

The media are covering the ObamaCare launch debacle, and the coverage is the Obama administration’s worst nightmare because the shutdown has made it impossible for the White House to come up with a plan that would instruct the media in how to mitigate the damage.

You see, if there was no shutdown, the media coverage of the launch would not be anywhere as negative for the White House as it is now, and here is why…

1. The White House Can’t Do Damage Control – Right now the media and the White House are covering the ObamaCare launch debacle in stark, one-dimensional terms: It is an expensive, disappointing, big government debacle. Both are too overwhelmed to figure out a way to make it look less worse, which we all know would happen if they had the time and resources.

2. The White House Can’t Gameplan a Plan B – While the administration obviously bungled the launch, when it comes to cleaning up a mess, this White House can usually move pretty fast. This time the White House can’t. They and the media are too bogged down in the shutdown. With some breathing room, the White House might have been able to set up a massive call center staffed with volunteers — something, anything to get people signed up. But even if they do, there is just no media space available to spread the word.

3. White House Can’t Reassure Anyone – If the shutdown wasn’t gobbling up White House resources and media space, the administration could fan out its supporters to reassure those interested in signing up for ObamaCare that things are going to get better and that the problems are aggressively being worked on. Instead, all potential enrollees are seeing is error messages and all they are hearing is bad news.

4. White House Can’t Spin the Sticker Shock – If anything brings down ObamaCare, it will be sticker shock. For four years, Obama, Democrats, and the media have been lying to the American people about the cost of ObamaCare. On top of adding $2.6 trillion to our deficit, individuals are facing shockingly high premiums and premium increases. This, after being lied to again and again about cheaper premiums. I’m not sure how the White House and its media would spin their way out of this, but heaven knows if they had the time and resources, they would find a way. After all, this is the same media that turned Obama’s Libya debacle into a campaign problem for Mitt Romney.

—

The bottom line to ObamaCare’s success or failure is the number of enrollees paying into the system. In its first year, ObamaCare needs seven million enrollees, three million of them healthy and under age 35.

If those numbers aren’t met, the program is a failure, the disapproval ratings increase, and the chances of ObamaCare slowly being killed increase.

ObamaCare is the president’s baby, his only significant accomplishment, his only hope for a legacy — it is burning down before his eyes and he is helpless to do anything to shape the all-important first impression.

Throughout Obama’s time in the spotlight, this is the only time I have ever witnessed anything he has bungled receiving only harshly negative coverage. It’s a bloodbath because the shutdown is taking up all the space that would normally be used for spin and lies.

She Has Previously Served As The Post'S Bureau Chief In Shanghai"", 'San Francisco', 'As A Correspondent In Baghdad.']",AIDS advocates say drug coverage in some marketplace plans is inadequate,"The nation’s new health-care law says insurers can’t turn anyone away, even people who are sick. But some companies, patient advocates say, have found a way to discourage the chronically ill from enrolling in their plans: offer drug coverage too skimpy for those with expensive conditions.

Some plans sold on the online insurance exchanges, for instance, don’t cover key medications for HIV, or they require patients to pay as much as 50 percent of the cost per prescription in co-insurance — sometimes more than $1,000 a month.

“The fear is that they are putting discriminatory plan designs into place to try to deter certain people from enrolling by not covering the medications they need, or putting policies in place that make them jump through hoops to get care,” said John Peller, vice president of policy for the AIDS Foundation of Chicago.

As the details of the benefits offered by the new health-care plans become clear, patients with cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases also are raising concerns, said Marc Boutin, executive vice president of the National Health Council, a coalition of advocacy groups for the chronically ill.

“The easiest way [for insurers] to identify a core group of people that is going to cost you a lot of money is to look at the medicines they need and the easiest way to make your plan less appealing is to put limitations on these products,” Boutin said.

Insurers say that such accusations are unfounded, and that the drug coverage is more than adequate, with many plans exceeding the minimum levels required by the Affordable Care Act. But they acknowledge that to keep premiums low, they must restrict the use of some costly drugs if there are alternatives. And they say that when high-priced medications must be used, it’s reasonable to expect patients to pick up more of the cost.

Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for American’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, said the exchange plans are designed “to try to give consumers better value for their health-care dollars.”

Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said that the new health-care law will give many consumers access to the medicines they need for the first time but that if a plan doesn’t cover a particular drug, patients can ask insurers for an exception. She said the government is asking the companies to respond to such requests within three days.

The health-care law has been celebrated by people with serious illnesses, some of whom have been unable until now to obtain coverage. Starting Jan. 1, insurers must take all comers and are barred from imposing lifetime limits on reimbursements. For those who purchase on the marketplace, annual out-of-pocket costs will be limited to $6,350 for individuals and $12,700 for families. (The Obama administration granted a one-year grace period for some group plans to implement the new limit.)

But people who expected the new plans to provide pharmaceutical coverage comparable with that of employer-sponsored plans have been disappointed. In recent years, employers have compelled workers to pick up a growing share of the costs, especially for brand-name drugs. But insurers selling policies on the exchanges have pared their drug benefits significantly more, according to health advocates, patients and industry analysts. The plans are curbing their lists of covered drugs and limiting quantities, requiring prior authorizations and insisting on “fail first” or “step therapy” protocols that compel doctors to prescribe a certain drug first before moving on to another — even if it’s not the physician’s and patient’s drug of choice.

Paul Prince, 52, a former information technology manager from Houston, said he was surprised that some of the health plans in the new federal marketplace wouldn’t pay for one or more of his HIV medications. The policy that seemed to provide the best coverage, he said, would cover only about two-thirds of his monthly $2,400 drug tab, leaving him responsible for $840.

“There was no way I could pay that,” said Prince, who is studying to become a teacher after being laid off from his previous job and losing his insurance.

Prince receives help with buying his HIV medications from the government AIDS Drug Assistance Program for low-income people. But he worries about how he’s going to pay for his drugs when he goes back to work.

“I’m hoping the insurance companies will work this out by then, or else I will be in real trouble,” he said.

And there are fears that the government assistance programs, as well as those sponsored by foundations and drug companies, might be trimmed or eliminated on the premise that most Americans will have insurance — not taking into account that the coverage still will leave them with large bills for drugs.

The success of the health-care law hinges in large part on insurers being able to attract enough healthy people to help subsidize enrollees who are sick. Just 5 percent of the nation’s population — those with the most complex, chronic conditions — accounts for nearly half of all of U.S. health-care spending, according to the National Institute for Health Care Management, a research group funded by insurers. If insurers end up with a surplus of sick people, the result could be financially disastrous.

In the past, insurance companies could reject applicants who were sick — or had risk factors for becoming sick — or charge them higher premiums. The Affordable Care Act did away with that and left insurers with only a few ways to try to balance costs and risk. It allows them to charge more by age group (but the oldest group can be asked to pay only three times more than the youngest) and place of residence and if someone smokes.

But what is considered discriminatory in the design of drug benefits is less clear in the law and regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.

The health-care law includes mechanisms to reimburse insurers for a portion of the costs for people with very high medical costs and to help carriers whose expenses may exceed the premiums they collect. But these are temporary measures, and insurers have complained that they are insufficient. HHS has said it is looking for ways to provide additional assistance if claims greatly exceed projections.

A new analysis of health plans sold in the federal exchange — which covers 36 states — and 14 state exchanges found that the benefits tend to be skimpier than in most other private insurance in the United States, with drug benefits a particular weak spot. The analysis, by Avalere Health, a health-care consulting company, was based on a sample of 600 insurance plans.

It showed that among “silver” plans — the second-cheapest of four levels of coverage in the exchanges, and the level on which federal subsidies are based — patients are required to pay a higher share of their drug costs than is typical among those who receive insurance through their jobs.

People who rely on extremely expensive drugs could encounter big bills right away. Patients whose medications cost at least $15,000 per month could face out-of-pocket costs of $1,000 to about $6,000 the first month they use their insurance, Avalere found. The analysis is based on the silver plans of the five states running their own marketplaces that have set their own benefits standards.

Dan Mendelson, Avalere’s chief executive, predicted that employers may soon adapt some of the benefit designs in the exchanges’ health plans. “We are already seeing interest,” he said, because they are less expensive for companies, shifting more of the expense to patients.

Daniel Kantor, a neurologist in Florida, said he has serious concerns about patients with multiple sclerosis who have purchased insurance through the exchanges, because some plans don’t cover widely used drugs. In addition, he said, some require doctors to prescribe a specified medicine before they cover others, which could compel people to take drugs more toxic to them, even though they are all similarly priced.

“2014 is going to be a scary year. People are going to have to stop taking medicines they are already stable on because of this,” said Kantor, the immediate past president of the Southern MS Consortium, a group of doctors, social workers and advocates who work with patients with the condition.

Insurers, he said, are hoping “that if they make it inconvenient for people with MS to get treatment, they will leave their rolls.”

Perhaps the most politically sensitive issue related to drug coverage involves people with HIV.

In an October letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, a coalition of AIDS groups voiced concern about the lack of coverage for a single-tablet regimen, in which three to four HIV medications are combined into one pill. Studies have shown that the tablets improve adherence to drug regimens and, as a result, reduce hospitalizations and enable people with HIV to stay healthier.

In reviewing health plans nationwide, the coalition found that at least 47 did not cover the single-tablet-regimen pills and other standard frontline treatments for HIV.

Robert Greenwald, director of the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation at Harvard University, said some insurers are reconsidering their decisions and may begin covering the drug.

A spokeswoman for Aetna — which initially left the single-tablet regimen off the formulary, or list of medicine covered, for its exchange plans in at least eight states — has decided to add two of the three commonly used single-tablet regimens to all its plans. WellPoint BlueCross BlueShield said it will add one to its list of covered drugs in the 14 states where it has plans.

In Houston, three of the seven plans offered don’t cover single-tablet regimens and three others cover them only with very high coinsurance payments — as much as $1,200 a month — leaving what patients say is only one reasonable choice of carrier for those with HIV.

“We never expected these drugs to be completely left off some formularies,” said Randall Ellis, vice president of public affairs at Legacy Community Health Services, which treats 2,700 patients with HIV/AIDS. “It’s causing a lot of anxiety and confusion.”

The line to enter the packed gallery spilled into the rotunda.

While Davis filibuster attempt ended shortly before midnight, it wasn't until 3 a.m. that Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst declared the bill dead and the special session over.

Opponents of the bill sit in the gallery holding hangers.

Davis spoke for nearly 11 hours. According to her office, Davis had a snack and a small amount of water before beginning. She was not allowed to lean or take a bathroom break.

Davis wore a pair of pink tennis shoes in place of her dress shoes in preparation for hours of speaking.

Davis filibuster took place in an near empty Senate floor. The bill she was fighting would have banned abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and force many clinics to upgrade their facilities and be classified as ambulatory surgical centers.

Members of the gallery react as Davis is called for her third and final violation, ending the filibuster. The reaction in the gallery grew so intense that it drowned out the proceedings, preventing lawmakers from completing their vote by the official end of the session -- killing the bill.

Sen. Wendy Davis attempted to block a Texas abortion bill that would have greatly restricted abortions in the state, by attempting a 13-hour filibuster. The attempt fell short by about three hours when the chairman ruled she had gone off topic.

Story highlights NEW: ""I underestimated how difficult it would be,"" Davis says The filibuster of Texas Sen. Wendy Davis became a viral sensation The White House took notice of her abortion rights stand Critics say the bill would have shut most of the state's abortion clinics

(CNN) —

A day after a filibuster and a raucous crowd in the state Capitol foiled passage of a bill that would have imposed strict new regulations on abortion in Texas, Gov. Rick Perry vowed Wednesday to try again.

Perry said the Legislature would convene July 1 in special session to take up the abortion bill, which was declared dead before dawn Wednesday. The bill failed after a night of drama in Austin during which a lone lawmaker talked for more than 10 hours in an attempt to run out the clock on a special session.

Chants of “shame! shame! shame!” from spectators who had filled the building drowned out the efforts of Republican lawmakers as they tried to pass it minutes before midnight.

“We will not allow the breakdown of decorum and decency to prevent us from doing what the people of this state hired us to do,” Perry said in a statement calling lawmakers back into another special session. Texans “value life and want to protect women and the unborn,” he said.

Perry’s announcement came a day before he was to address the National Right to Life convention in Dallas on Thursday.

Opinion: The truth about the Texas filibuster and abortion

And it came on a day when abortion rights advocates found a new hero in state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth.

Though Republicans control the state Senate, Davis tried to block the abortion bill by attempting a 13-hour filibuster Tuesday.

“I underestimated how difficult it would be – both physically and mentally,” Davis told CNN’s “AC360” on Wednesday. “About two hours in, I realized I was in for a long day. My back started hurting pretty early on and began to really hurt as the hours ticked by.”

But, she said, the energy from the packed gallery “kept me going throughout the day.”

Davis fell short of her goal by less than three hours when the chair ruled she had gone off topic. The gallery erupted in boos. Her fellow Democrats stalled for time with procedural tactics.

And as the clock wound down, opponents of the bill drowned out proceedings on the floor, preventing lawmakers from completing a vote in time to get it passed.

At 3 a.m., Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst stepped to the Senate floor to declare the bill dead and the special session over.

Texas parents agree not to pressure teen to have abortion

“We empowered the voice of people in Texas and people who wanted to stand against this intrusion, this big government intrusion, into their personal lives,” Davis said Wednesday night.

Even if the bill winds up passing in the next special session, the reaction will not be split along partisan lines, she predicted. “It’s a reaction coming from Republicans, independents and Democrats alike, which is saying: Governor Perry, Lieutenant Governor Dewhurst, stay out of my private decision-making.”

The bill would have banned most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and tightened standards on abortion clinics and the doctors who work at them. Critics said the measure would have shut most of the abortion clinics in Texas.

“He (Perry) lost this fight in regular session, and even after they broke the rules he and his allies lost again in front of the entire country last night,” said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a statement.

“They tried every trick in the book, blocking testimony from the very women whose lives would be affected, voting in the middle of the night, shutting down the debate — they couldn’t get this done because Texans would not let them.”

Wearing pink sneakers, Davis, 50, took to the floor of the chamber late Tuesday morning to criticize the bill. Rules called for her to stand, unaided, until midnight, for the filibuster to succeed.

She was not allowed to sit down, lean or take a bathroom break, and she was allowed three warnings before the Senate was to be allowed to vote on whether to stop the filibuster.

The senator spent much of the time reading testimony and messages from women decrying the bill and recounting the struggles they, their friends or relatives faced before birth control and abortion were legalized.

“Women realize that these bills will not protect their health,” she said. “They will only reduce their access to abortion providers and limit their ability to make their own family-planning decisions.”

Early in the diatribe, her comments were ruled off topic and she was given her first warning.

During the evening, a fellow senator helped Davis put on a back brace, which was ruled to have violated filibuster rules, and she got her second warning.

Finally, at about 10 p.m., Davis talked about the abortion pill, RU486, and the chairman ruled again that her comments were off topic.

But a member of the Senate then moved that the ruling be appealed, and the status of the ruling was in doubt.

The final hours of the session were marked by confusing parliamentary maneuvers until Sen. Leticia Van de Putte stepped to the microphone, ending the debate.

“At what point must a female senator raise her hand or her voice to be recognized over the male colleagues in the room?” the Democratic senator asked after she had been ignored.

At 15 minutes before midnight, the gallery erupted in applause and chants of “Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!”

As the session ended, Davis waded into the crowd of supporters and praised them as “the people who truly made this happen.”

Texas Right to Life blamed “the angry mob of protesters in the Senate gallery” for the failure of the bill to pass.

“Ultimately, we should be encouraged that we had the votes and that so many came to support the bill,” the anti-abortion group said on its website. “We will continue to work to pass Pro-Life legislation that protects women and saves lives in Texas.”

The last stand

Davis’ stand captivated abortion rights advocates from coast to coast, prompting the hashtag #standwithwendy on Twitter.

The White House took notice.

“Something special is happening in Austin tonight,” said a post on President Barack Obama’s official Twitter account. The account is run by Organizing for Action, a nonprofit group established to support the president’s legislative agenda.

A post by Aimee Parker of Los Angeles said: “I’m in absolute awe of you, @WendyDavisTexas. Thank you for your passion, perseverance and unparalleled badassery.”

English comedian Ricky Gervais weighed in as well.

“Whatever the outcome, @WendyDavisTexas efforts entered her into the pantheon of American heroes tonight.”

Heady times for Davis, who was first elected to the Texas Senate in 2008, defeating a longtime Republican incumbent to do so.

Last year, she staged a filibuster to force a special session in an attempt to stop $5 billion in cuts to Texas public schools, according to her website.

Davis, who became a single mother at age 19, went on to graduate with honors from Harvard Law School, it says.

Her filibuster was no record. In 1977, Sen. Bill Meier staged a 43-hour marathon.

The special session ends with irony, Twitter user Cody Beckner said, echoing the governor’s own words.

“‘In Texas, we value all life,’ Gov. Perry TX. Said on the eve of the state’s 500th execution.”

http://news.yahoo.com/lawmakers-push-keep-obamas-health-care-pledge-220513736.html,,[],Lawmakers push to keep Obama's health care pledge,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Little more than a week after millions of consumers received health care cancellation notices, lawmakers in both parties are pushing legislation to redeem President Barack Obama's long-ago pledge that anyone liking their coverage will be allowed to keep it under the nation's controversial new law.

The result is a stern new challenge for the White House as it struggles to fix website woes for the signup portal for those seeking to enroll under the law, and simultaneously copes with angry consumers who rightly or wrongly blame ""Obamacare"" for cancellation letters mailed by insurers.

Democratic officials said top administration aides got a close-up view of the cancellation controversy last week, when Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., said at a closed-door meeting of the party's rank and file that his son had received notice his coverage was being terminated.

In response, these officials said White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough referred to a speech Obama had made earlier in the week saying some of those losing coverage would qualify under Medicaid, some would receive federal subsidies for individual coverage, and others would have options in the so-called exchanges the law set up to allow individuals to shop for insurance. Donnelly's office declined several requests for comment. The officials who described the incident did so on condition of anonymity, saying they were not authorized to discuss a private meeting.

In the Republican-controlled House, officials say a vote is likely as early as next week on a bill to let insurers continue selling any individual policies that were in effect on Jan. 1, 2013, even if they provide coverage deemed insufficient under Obamacare.

The measure, drafted by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., and backed by roughly 100 fellow Republicans, would remain in effect throughout 2014, after which the issue would presumably be reviewed.

""Despite the president's repeated promise of 'if you like your plan, you can keep it,' many Americans are now learning the sad reality that their current plan will no longer exist beginning on January 1,"" Upton, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement when he announced his legislation last week.

Story continues

""This legislation is about providing folks the peace of mind that they will be allowed to keep their current coverage if they so choose.""

While Upton's legislation permits insurers to sell existing coverage plans that would otherwise be banned, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., introduced legislation during the day to go one step further by requiring it.

Aides said that under her measure, insurance companies would be obliged to continue offering existing paying customers continued coverage under any plans in effect at the end of 2013. No new consumers could enroll.

""A promise was made that if you like your health plan, you can keep it - and I will do everything I can to see that the promise is kept,"" said Landrieu, who is gearing up for what is expected to be a challenging re-election campaign next year.

In a statement, Landrieu added that ""Many people may find better plans in the marketplaces that offer superior coverage for them at a good value and at a potentially lower cost. But if people want to keep their current plans, they should be able to do so.""

Her measure also requires insurers to explain areas in which the coverage falls short of the law's requirements, and notify consumers they may be able to find an alternative plan that meets the requirements.

The White House declined comment on the two bills.

Both measures are designed to cut through a complicated system in which some plans for individuals that fall short of coverage standards are allowed to continue under Obamacare, while others are not.

In general, individual coverage plans in effect on the date the legislation was enacted, March 23, 2010, may continue to be sold, regardless of their coverage levels. There are exceptions, though, including plans that significantly increase costs to consumers through higher deductibles, copayments or other steps.

According to an explanation published by Families USA, an increase in deductibles above medical inflation plus 15 percentage points would disqualify a plan from continued sale, for example.

Under current law, plans that went into effect after March 23, 2010 and fall short of the law's coverage requirements may not be sold beyond the end of the year.

That means that insurance companies that began selling new policies later throughout much of 2010 or in the two following years did so presumably knowing they would have to be canceled.

The impetus to amend the law is particularly strong among Republicans, who have voted dozens of times to repeal, defund or dismantle a program they voted against unanimously.

Unlike other GOP proposals, Upton's bill could conceivably add to the overall number of individuals gaining coverage. In political terms, it allows lawmakers to recite Obama's pledge delivered before the American Medical Association in 2009. ""If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period,"" he said. ""If you like your health-care plan, you'll be able to keep your health-care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what."""

Wednesday night, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), an ardent Obamacare foe, didn't face an adoring crowd of teabaggers there to shout their support for him and scream their hatred for Obamacare.

Instead, he got a message about the law that he probably wasn't expecting, including from the woman in the video above who lost her son to colon cancer, largely because it was caught too late. It was caught late because he didn't have insurance because of a preexisting condition, a birth defect. She wasn't the only one McHenry heard from.



They all wanted direct answers from the congressman Wednesday evening, and many of them, including Skip Edwards, questioned the Republican’s position on the Affordable Care Act. Edwards and his wife, both 63, had health insurance until he lost his job during the recession and the East Asheville couple found themselves in financial trouble despite staying relatively healthy. Both had pre-existing conditions and were denied insurance, making them eligible for a state plan called Inclusive Health. “It cost us $1,300 bucks a month — extremely expensive,” Edwards said. “It taps us out every month. But at our age and health, we’ve got to have it.”

McHenry's response was typically lame—he loves the stuff about no more discriminating for preexisting conditions and allowing young people to stay on parents' plan until their 26, but didn't explain how his repeated votes to repeal and defund the law that includes those protections preserved them.

Instead, he talked about the usual stuff Republicans talk about: expanding high risk pools, ""adding 'That is more of a solution than I think that Obamacare will be,' as many in the crowd groaned."" He also said that people should be able to buy insurance across state lines, another big Republican ""solution."" Not surprisingly, ""Edwards was not satisfied with the congressman’s answer.""

That's what happens when Republicans are forced to confront the reality of actual people who really need health insurance. They've never had real answers and they've never been able to present a valid alternative. That's why we haven't heard ""repeal and replace"" since 2010; they've never had a ""replace."" It's why the answer now is ""repeal, defund, and/or shutdown government."" It's only ever been about selling the rabid base the idea that they could kill the law.

American Bridge has released their video of the exchange between Mr. Edwards and Rep. McHenry. The audience reaction to McHenry is priceless. And it's about time he heard it."

President Obama says he is mad about health care website problems

Obama says healthcare.gov has problem%2C but the law overall is working

Tech experts are being tapped to help solve the website issues

WASHINGTON — A defiant President Obama said Monday he is mad about problems with a new health care website, but argued that the Affordable Care Act as a whole is working as planned.

While Healthcare.gov ""hasn't worked as smoothly as it was supposed to work,"" Obama said during a White House speech that uninsured Americans have been able to sign up for coverage.

""The product -- the health insurance -- is good,"" Obama said. ""The prices are good. It is a good deal.""

Facing attacks from Republicans and other critics of Obamacare, the president said his health care team is reaching out to tech experts to help fix massive website problems that have hampered the rollout of his landmark piece of legislation.

""There's no excuse for the problems"" on the website, he said.

""Nobody's madder than me about the fact that the website isn't working as well as it should,"" Obama said, ""which means it's going to get fixed.""

Aside from the website, Obama said the 2010 health care law is providing consumer protections and benefits for millions of Americans, including mammograms and birth control services. He told stories of now-covered Americans who had once been denied insurance because of pre-existing conditions.

""The essence of the law, the health insurance that's available to people, is working just fine,"" Obama said.

Congressional Republicans who opposed the health care law — a key factor in this month's partial government shutdown — said the initial problems call the entire program into question.

Citing reports that few people have signed up for health care exchanges, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said that ""another campaign-style event won't solve the myriad problems facing consumers under Obamacare.""

McConnell said that ""for months, the American people have been learning about the impact Obamacare will have on individuals and families in the form of higher premiums, disrupted insurance and lost jobs -- more broken promises from the administration.""

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., a prominent critic of the health law, said the president designed his speech to ""draw the media's attention to a handful of persons who have applied for Obamacare -- while ignoring the untold number of Americans who are losing the plans they liked because of Obamacare.""

Cruz and a number of House Republicans opposed a new budget plan unless it defunded the health care law, leading to the 16-day shutdown that ended just last week. Some Republicans also objected to increasing the debt ceiling unless some provisions of the law were delayed.

In his White House speech, Obama charged Republicans are playing ""politics"" with the health care law, saying that ""they were willing to shut down the government and potentially harm the global economy to try to get it repealed.""

Obama said the website isn't the only way people can sign for health care coverage. He said call centers have expanded, and people can also apply in person at federal offices across the country.

The president twice provided the number of 24-hour call centers -- 1-800-318-2596 -- where he said people would be available to answer questions in 150 languages. He also said that volunteers in community health centers and hospitals can help people apply for coverage, and he suggested that people looking for information also could log onto a website called LocalHelp.HealthCare.gov.

In a blog post, the Department of Health and Human Services said some users of HealthCare.gov ""have had trouble creating accounts and logging in to the site, while others have received confusing error messages, or had to wait for slow page loads or forms that failed to respond in a timely fashion.""

As a result, HHS said it is ""bringing in some of the best and brightest from both inside and outside government to scrub in with the team and help improve HealthCare.gov.""

The administration did not provide specific names of experts, nor have they reported exactly how many people have signed up for new insurance exchanges.

For his speech in the Rose Garden, the president was joined by consumers, small-business owners and pharmacists who, the White House said, ""have either benefited from the health care law already or are helping consumers learn about what the law means for them and how they can get covered.""

Obama's guests also included ""individuals who have already applied for and enrolled in quality, affordable coverage through the marketplaces and those who are planning to after exploring and comparing their new health care options,"" the White House said.

On a sunny day, one of the White House guests nearly fainted during Obama's remarks.

Said the president: ""That's what happens when I talk too long."""

The good folks at snopes.com debunked it some time ago. I’m just going to hit the highlights here. You should check out the above link if you want the whole story.

First: There is no mention of exemptions for Islam or any other specific religion in the health care bill.

Second: There is in fact a mention of a “religious conscience objection” in the law. It states that certain religious sects may be exempt from the health care mandates if they fall into a particular category set out in Section 1402(g)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. When you look up that section of the code, you find that the exemptions are for specific religious sects that have conscientious objections to receiving government assistance, both because they preach self-sufficiency and because their members make a moral commitment to caring for one another themselves. The code was written this way to deal with Social Security and Medicare tax issues. The reasoning, as I understand it, is that the members of these faiths are morally obligated never to participate in Social Security or Medicare, so they should be exempt from those taxes.

For the most part, these religious groups are Old Amish and Mennonite sects with a long history of self-sufficiency and caring for their own. As long as they work for one another only, and do not hire outsiders, they have been allowed not to pay Social Security taxes. The health care law obviously contemplates the same sort of exemptions for these groups. None of the sects recognized under this part of the IRS code is Muslim as far as I can tell. You can check the list for yourself on this spreadsheet (Careful—this link will download an Excel spreadsheet to your computer!), which was compiled by Factcheck.org.

In addition, the IRS has been really hard-nosed about these exemptions. When the exempted groups do hire outsiders, they have been required to pay Social Security taxes for those workers. Factcheck.org sums it up this way:



The Social Security bureaucracy has been slow to respond to our queries about which religious groups have been granted exemptions from the payroll tax. But both the federal government and the courts have been very strict on such exemptions in the past. For instance, in 1982 the Supreme Court found that a member of the Old Order Amish claiming exemption under 1402(g) was in fact subject to payroll tax for his employees. That section, the Court said, is applicable only to the self-employed. And in two cases where self-employed individuals claimed a religious opposition to Social Security but weren’t members of approved sects, they were also ordered to pay the tax.

While it is conceivable that some new religious group may try to become exempt under these sections of the tax code, an extremely high bar has been set for them. They would have to demonstrate not only a conscientious objection to receiving government aid, but also a history of, and a mechanism for, taking care of their own. Most religions, including Catholicism and Islam, would have a very, very difficult time making such a case.

So the notion that the health care law already contains lots of religious exemptions—and, in particular, that it contains exemptions for specifically Muslim groups—is simply mistaken.

But it also points up a real problem with the so-called religious-freedom objections that are being thrown around on the right. Religiously affiliated institutions want to access the government support that makes them viable (religiously affiliated colleges and hospitals, for instance, probably couldn’t exist without government subventions), but they don't want to fulfill the duties to their fellow citizens that taking the support entails. This is especially so in the case of the Roman Catholic bishops’ objections to the health care mandate, in which the only possible conflict of conscience is a Catholic’s putative reluctance to be indirectly involved with someone else’s decision to commit what the Catholic considers to be a sin.

But Catholics really don’t object very much to this kind of indirect involvement, or there would have been much more outcry before now, since a number of states already have health care mandates for birth control coverage. And they don’t seem to object to any other sort of indirect involvement in other people’s decisions to commit sins. I don't think there are too many Catholic NRA supporters who lose much sleep over the fact that their backing for plentiful and easily obtainable guns of all sorts indirectly contributes to the decision of someone else to pick up a gun and murder someone.

* * * * *

Now where did this mistaken idea come from? Like many similar beliefs that have currency inside the conservative bubble (as Bill Maher likes to call it), the Muslim heath-care exemption meme seems to have started with chain emails sent around among conservatives. These emails were being circulated during the furor following passage of the Affordable Care Act in December of 2009—like the following email from early 2010:



Subject: Dhimmitude

Word of the Day: Dhimmitude

Dhimmitude is the Muslim system of controlling non-Muslim populations conquered through jihad. Specifically, it is the TAXING of non-Muslims in exchange for tolerating their presence AND as a coercive means of converting conquered remnants to Islam.

The ObamaCare bill is the establishment of Dhimmitude and Sharia Muslim diktat in the United States. Muslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance, and also from the penalty tax for being uninsured. Islam considers insurance to be “gambling,” “risk-taking,” and “usury,” and is thus banned. Muslims are specifically granted exemption based on this. How convenient. So I, Ann Barnhardt, a Christian, will have crippling IRS liens placed against all of my assets, including real estate, cattle, and even accounts receivables, and will face hard prison time because I refuse to buy insurance or pay the penalty tax. Meanwhile, Louis Farrakhan will have no such penalty and will have 100% of his health needs paid for by the de facto government insurance. Non-Muslims will be paying a tax to subsidize Muslims. Period. This is Dhimmitude. Dhimmitude serves two purposes: it enriches the Muslim masters AND serves to drive conversions to Islam. In this case, the incentive to convert to Islam will be taken up by those in the inner cities as well as the godless Generation X, Y and Z types who have no moral anchor. If you don’t believe in Christ to begin with, it is no problem whatsoever to sell Him for 30 pieces of silver. “Sure, I’ll be a Muslim if it means free health insurance and no taxes. Where do I sign, bro?” I recommend sending this post to your contacts. This is desperately important and people need to know about it—quickly.

The intellectual pedigree of this communication is quite manifest. It comes from the “Christians under attack” subgroup within the conservative bubble. (The obvious racist and Christian supremacist orientation is just icing on the cake.) This subgroup lives in fear of multiculturalism and the inevitable cosmopolitanism that is the quite natural result of instant global communication. As more and more people realize that the universal claims of the world’s various religious faiths cannot all be true, the “Christians under attack” feel increasingly more threatened. Many of their beliefs about the how the world works, and especially their religious beliefs, simply conflict with different beliefs on the same issues held by different people in different parts of the world. Everyone who is plugged into the internet knows that this is simply a fact. Young people, who are disproportionately plugged in, already accept it as a fact.

For the “Christians under attack” group, this is a frightening reality. Since Christianity’s ancient claims to some sort of dominance over temporal goods as well as spiritual goods depended on ignorance of other faiths, those claims are being eroded by the new knowledge. As the relativity of religious beliefs to time and place becomes more obvious, the “Christians under attack” see themselves as losing power. How can they maintain their superiority in a world where their religious beliefs have no privileged status?

And of course, since these people tend to conflate religion and morality, they simply jump to the conclusion that relativity of religious beliefs implies relativity of morality. This is simply not the case. Everyone knows that religion is no guarantee of morality: James Madison famously pointed out in The Federalist No. 10 that “neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control” for the tyranny of the majority. And some people know that you can be a person of extremely high moral standards without religion: anyone who has understood Aristotle’s Nichomachean Ethics knows that you can construct an ethics of virtue based solely on human happiness in this life. The fact that you can be moral with or without religion means that relativity among religious beliefs has nothing to do with relativity of morals. The latter is a sign of poor education and weak-mindedness. The former is just a factual consequence of history and culture.

I understand that none of these objections holds any weight inside the conservative bubble. I understand that fear is very rarely dispelled by reason. But those of us who live outside the bubble shouldn’t allow ourselves to be taken in by the fearful hysteria that reigns inside. Every “bubble fact” that goes unchallenged is a seed of corruption in the real world. And while fear generates far too many “bubble facts” to stay on top of, we should be ready to weed up any that begin to set roots outside the bubble.

So if you hear the one about Muslim exemptions to the Affordable Health Care Act, you know what to say."

When Lauer told Palin that the Tea Party was really into repealing Obamacare, she was very into that. ""Right on!"" she cried.

When he asked about what the Tea Party alternative to Obamacare was, Palin looked him straight in the eye and answered an entirely different question. ""And it's not just the independent grassroots Tea Party movement saying this!"" she said.

""But where's the plan from the Tea Party?"" Lauer beseeched, his increasingly scraggly beard lending him the air of a reproachful professor.

""Especially Democrats running for re-election,"" Palin continued (she had been talking the whole time). She finally ran out of steam and answered the actual question. Oh how she answered it!

""The plan is to allow those things that had been proposed over many years to reform a health care system in America that certainly does need more help so that there's more competition, there's less tort reform threat, there's less trajectory of the cost increases? And those plans have been proposed over and over again. And what thwarts those plans? It's the far left. It's President Obama and his supporters who will not allow the Republicans to usher in free market, patient-centered, doctor-patient relationship links to reform health care!""

""Let's move on,"" Lauer said. Yes, let's! Somewhere, Megyn Kelly was saying to herself, ""Been there.""

Note: An earlier version of this post stated that Lauer's beard was ""gazing reproachfully at Palin."" However, after reader David Rutz pointed out that Lauer's beard is, in his words, ""not nearly cool enough to be personified,"" we found that we were inclined to agree. We pledge now to only personify Lauer's beard when it is truly bushy and wild."

“I feel like I’ve been taken to the cleaners,” salesman Neal Campbell told NBC News senior investigative reporter Lisa Myers in a Sunday report. Campbell, who has a wife and three children, says Obamacare is breeding resentment and anger. “We feel betrayed, lied to, and we’re pissed off.”

“How is this helping the average American that’s working 40 to 50 hours per week?” asked salesperson Terry Hardcastle. “How are we supposed to live?”

Cathy Smith agreed. “You don’t make that much money to begin with,” said Smith with tears in her eyes. “…the prescriptions are going to kill me.”

Under Obamacare, the workers’ employer faced a 50% increase in costs to keep worker plans at the same benefit and deductible levels. To remain economically viable, the dealership decided to give each worker an extra $2,400 and let them find plans on their own. Small business insurance broker Michael Harp says it’s all part of the new Obamacare reality for small businesses and their workers: “The overwhelming majority, they’re paying much higher rates and they have lower benefits.”

Service adviser Steve Williams said Obamacare has destroyed the era of affordable health care.

“The days of low deductibles and all that stuff are gone,” Williams told NBC. “It’s not going to get any better. It’s just going to get worse.”

The NBC News report comes as the Obama administration and its progressive allies are reportedly readying yet another public relations campaign in the hopes of resuscitating Obamacare’s lugubrious approval ratings. The administration’s media blitz will highlight the stories of people who scored taxpayer-funded Obamacare coverage.

The strategy, however, risks further angering the millions of middle-class workers who lost their insurance coverage due to Obamacare or whose premiums and deductibles are soaring in order to pay for the very Obamacare “winners” the administration plans to highlight.

According to the latest CNN poll, Obamacare is at a record low 35% approval rating."

On Thursday, the contrite president announced that Americans whose healthcare insurance policies have been canceled due to requirements of the Affordable Care Act would have another year to keep those policies. This new guarantee is meant to make up for his ill-considered promise that no one would lose their old policies if they wanted to keep what they had.

The problem with Obama’s new promise, though, is that he cannot force insurers to restore policies they have already terminated. And rather than doing the president any favors, those insurers are attacking him for trying to change the rules in the middle of the game.

Obama has a mess on his hands and -- judging by his almost daily apologies for the screwed-up launch of the national healthcare exchange website, as well as for his misstatements about the effect of the plan on several million people who buy their own policies -- it is pretty clear he knows how deep the mess has become.

Instead of anyone offering to help him out, though, everyone is piling on.

His fellow Democrats in the House and Senate are panicked, fearing the bad feelings about Obamacare will imperil their chances for reelection. Some are rushing to concoct a bill -- any bill! -- to do something -- anything! -- about healthcare. Their object is not to provide a fix, but to provide political cover. In the words of NBC’s chief White House correspondent, Chuck Todd, Democratic senators and congressmen want to be able to demonstrate to their constituents that they “stood up to the president.”

It may seem strange that Democrats would prefer to run against Obama rather than put in extra effort to make the president’s healthcare plan work, but fear of losing a political career makes politicians do weird things.

Electoral considerations are also what drive the Republican response to Obama’s predicament. Any bad news for the president is good news for them. The last thing they would think of doing is anything constructive to improve America’s healthcare system if doing so would help the president they despise.

The media are running with the story, of course -- not just the permanent opposition at Fox News, but most of the so-called mainstream media. Obamacare’s shaky start is the hot political crisis of the moment and can hardly be ignored. Still, as Rachel Maddow observed on MSNBC Thursday night, Romneycare -- the Massachusetts healthcare scheme that provided the template for Obamacare -- took a year to catch on and no one at the time thought of the early missteps as a huge scandal or proof that the plan would never get off the ground. Politicians in both parties worked to pull it together, and now 97% of the citizens of Massachusetts have healthcare coverage.

Don’t expect anything like that sensible approach with Obamacare. Healthcare is a political football, above all else, at the national level. Obama has blown several big plays and lost a lot of yardage. His own team is not providing much coverage and the other side is lined up, revved up and ready to sack him, steal the ball and put him out of the game."

Instead of sitting down with him and saying, governor, let’s talk and figure this out together. Let’s figure out what’s political in what you’re saying. You’re discounting what he has to say outright. Though the federal HealthCare.gov appears to face serious technical problems, state-run marketplaces like Kentucky appear adept at quickly fixing problems and are successfully enrolling people. In Kentucky, 10,766 applications for health coverage were initiated on the first day and “6,909 completed and 2,989 families were enrolled.” Nearly 150,000 New Yorkers have signed up for Obamacare and 35,528 enrollments were completed in three weeks in Washington state.

Ellmers endorses the Republicans American Healthcare Reform Act which it seems is largely just another big Tort Reform Bill that would remove the Ban on Pre-Existing Conditions, would remove the ability to keep your children on your healthcare until they're 26 - (although it would provide a Fund for the poor to purchase these seperately) it would take away ""Obama Regulators"" - which in short, would remove all the protections, minimum coverage requirements and life-time caps - and put ""Decisions in the hands the Consumers"" - in other words, ""Good Luck, Chumps!""

Kids: five. Salary: about $14,000 before taxes. “You’re going to qualify for a medical card,” she told Hudson. “Well, thank God,” Hudson said, laughing. “I believe I’m going to be a Democrat.”

Those odds increase given he lives in Breathitt County

This , in Kentucky, sent shivers up the GOP's spine:This interview took place in Breathitt County, solid Red territory:Odds are that Hudson, a male, was a Republican.. The fact that he is white almost guarantees it (in 2008, just 34 percent of white Kentucky males voted for Obama, and Obama lost ground in the state in 2012). And his sentence formulation, ""I'm going to be"" clinches it.

Thus, we have the perfect illustration of why Republicans have fought Obamacare every step of the way, and are still working to sabotage it: A rural southern white male is openly talking about becoming a Democrat. Why? Because Democrats have now made his life a little better.

Republicans could've shared in the credit by working with Democrats to pass what was their Heritage-designed plan. Instead, they've staked their entire existence on its defeat. Thus, Hudson will have a stark choice in 2014: Vote for Mitch McConnell, who wants to take away his health security just as he finally gets it, or for Alison Lundergan Grimes, who won't (no matter how squishy she might currently be on the issue).

And if the GOP's last bastion of support starts liking the law, and as a result, Democrats, just imagine what might happen amongst more swingy demographics. What about married women, who lean GOP, but might suddenly see their families insured? What about Republican-leaning Gen-Xers hitting middle-age, were health issues become more prominent in their lives?

The fight for Obamacare has become an existentialist crisis for the GOP. And Ronald Hudson in Breathitt County, Kentucky, is turning that nightmare into reality.

Update: As pointed out in the comments, Breathitt County goes Democratic when there isn't an Obama on the ballot. Even in the 2010 GOP wave, Jack Conway won the county over Rand Paul. That doesn't change the gist of this post."

Illinois officials under fire for ObamaCare contracts,"Making ObamaCare a reality will require massive computing power to track, store and process the millions of individual cases.

But in Illinois, contracts to compute that state’s cases – valued as high as $190 million – are being awarded without competitive bidding.

The practice already has watchdogs crying foul.

“No transparency and with no bidding -- if that’s legal in Illinois, It shouldn’t be.” said Adam Andrzejewski of openthebooks.com, a watchdog group.

“To the extent that is happening across the country, the citizens need to know it.”

“It has the hallmarks of everything that is Chicago and also Illinois, which is totally imprudent and not the best practices,” says Illinois Republican State Senator Ron Sandack.

Illinois cases are stored and processed in the Medicaid Management Information System or MMIS. The Department of Health and Family Services describes the 30-year-old system as antiquated and needing an upgrade to handle the massive case load expected from ObamaCare.

A company from Gaithersburg, Maryland, Client Network Services Incorporated or CNSI, already has a contract in Michigan to perform similar services.

By forming an alliance with Michigan, Illinois was able to bypass a drawn-out, expensive bidding process because the state procurement code says HFS doesn’t need one if there is an intergovernmental agreement.

“The system can be built in much less time,” wrote Illinois director of HFS, Julie Hamos. “Which is saving taxpayers millions of dollars versus Illinois implementing a much costlier stand-alone system.”

CNSI, however, has encountered problems in other states.

The company sued Louisiana after a contract there was terminated during an investigation into whether CNSI and a handful of other companies violated ethical guidelines during the procurement process.

According to openthebooks.com there were also cost overruns in Washington and Maine and a lawsuit in South Dakota that ended in mediation.

However, the federal government certified CNSI, which was sufficient for Illinois to move forward with the intergovernmental agreement.

“The issues in other states since then do not in any way reflect the technological capabilities and performance Michigan has experienced with CNSI,” wrote director Hamos.

A spokesperson for CNSI said these kinds of partnerships will be part of the future and computing for the Affordable Care Act will be handled in “a cloud” -- meaning cases will be filed in one state, then computed, stored and processed in a mega-computer somewhere else."

Washington (CNN) - Support for the country's new health care law has dropped to a record low, according to a new national poll.

And a CNN/ORC International survey released Monday also indicates that most Americans predict that the Affordable Care Act will actually result in higher prices for their own medical care.



CNN/ORC International survey full results

Only 35% of those questioned in the poll say they support the health care law, a 5-point drop in less than a month. Sixty-two percent say they oppose the law, up four points from November.

Nearly all of the newfound opposition is coming from women.

""Opposition to Obamacare rose six points among women, from 54% in November to 60% now, while opinion of the new law remained virtually unchanged among men,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""That's bad news for an administration that is reaching out to moms across the country in an effort to make Obamacare a success.""

According to the survey, 43% say they oppose the health care law because it is too liberal, with 15% saying they give the measure a thumbs down because it is not liberal enough. That means half the public either favors Obamacare, or opposes it because it's not liberal enough, down four points from last month.

Sixty-three percent say they believe the new law will increase the amount of money they personally pay for medical care, which may not be a good sign for a law known as the ""Affordable Care Act.""

The survey also indicates that 42% say they will be personally worse off under Obamacare, with 16% saying the law will help them, and four in 10 saying it will have no effect on them.

Just over six in 10 say they believe they will be able to receive care from the same doctors that they now use, with 35% saying they will not be able to see the same doctors.

The Affordable Care Act, which is the signature domestic achievement for President Barack Obama, was passed along party lines in 2010, when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. Since that passage, Republicans have fought to either repeal, defund, or severely restrict the law. A push by congressional conservatives to defund the law was the catalyst for October's 16-day long partial federal government shutdown, the first in nearly two decades.

The roll out of the law was extremely flawed, from the rocky startup of HealthCare.gov in October to the controversy over millions of Americans being told they would lose their current insurance plans because they didn't meet standards mandated by the new health care law.

Despite all the problems, the President said things are starting to improve, adding that more than 500,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act through HealthCare.gov during the first three weeks of December.

""So all told, millions of Americans, despite problems with the website, are now poised to be covered by quality affordable health care,"" he said at a news conference.

The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International December 16-19, with 1,035 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/07/cbs-news-obamacare-about-to-hit-employer-provided-insurance,2013-11-07 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],CBS News: ObamaCare About to Hit Employer-Provided Insurance,"With his credibility shot, CBS News has apparently decided to not take President Obama’s latest ObamaCare promise at face value. Now that millions whom the president reassured could keep their insurance are losing it, CBS dug into Obama’s latest reassurance about the 80% not in the individual market, and also found that that’s not exactly true. The truth is that a so-called “Cadillac Tax” is about to turn millions of employer-based plans into something a little closer to a “junk plan.”

“If you’re one of the 80 percent of Americans who is insured or covered through an employer plan or through Medicare or Medicaid, or the Veterans’ Administration, there is no change for you except for an increase in benefits that everyone receives as a result of the Affordable Care Act,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday.

Yet in the years to come, some workers with employer-provided benefits will see their benefits scaled back because of an Obamacare tax. That portion of the law — known as the “Cadillac tax” — isn’t set to take effect until 2018, but it’s already influencing the benefits packages that employers offer.

“Every employer plan since the passage of the health care law has been working to make sure their health care cost trends keep their plans under the ‘Cadillac tax,'” Steve Wojcik of the National Business Group on Health, a nonprofit that represents large employers, told CBSNews.com.

It is hard to tell if CBS News is just getting on the record with this report, or if the media is actually going to start doing its job with ObamaCare and give America a heads up on the fallout yet to come.

From the moment ObamaCare looked like a reality, conservative think tanks and Republican lawmakers sounded the warning that millions would lose their health insurance as a result. All the media did in response, though, was to either ignore those warnings or push back on behalf of the White House and Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.

The effect ObamaCare will have on the employer-based market — over a hundred million people — is not limited to this Cadillac Tax. The White House itself estimated that tens of millions could be dropped by their employers and shoved into these ObamaCare exchanges. This could mean losing your doctor and having your health care options limited in a traumatic way, especially if you are already ill.

Though this unsettling White House report is out there, the media have yet to give it the attention deserved or to push the Administration to explain it, especially now that the president is claiming those 80% have nothing to worry about.

The carnage that has already blindsided millions of middle class families in the individual market is only the beginning of the financial chaos ObamaCare is almost certain to rain down on tens of millions who made the mistake of taking a president at his word.

Seventeen million people will qualify for tax credits to reduce the cost of health insurance under Obamacare, according to a report released Tuesday.

That amounts to about 60 percent of the 29 million people who could make up the market for the health insurance exchanges created by President Barack Obama's health care reform law, the Henry J. Kaiser Family foundation estimates. Enrollment via the insurance exchanges began Oct. 1, but has been hampered by the failed launch of HealthCare.gov, the federal portal to the marketplaces in more than 30 states, and technical problems affecting several of the state-run exchanges.

Residents of five states -- Texas, California, Florida, New York and Pennsylvania -- represent more than 40 percent of the people who would qualify for tax credits across the country, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. California and New York are operating their own insurance exchanges, while the other states are part of the federal system. The report includes breakdowns of how many people are eligible for tax credits in every state.

The insurance exchanges are intended for people who are uninsured or who buy insurance on their own because they don't get health benefits from their employers. Those already covered by job-based health coverage or government programs like Medicare and Medicaid don't need to use the exchanges.

The Affordable Care Act provides two kinds of financial assistance based on income. People who earn up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $46,000 for a single person, are eligible for tax credits to reduce the cost of their monthly insurance premiums. In addition, people who earn up to 250 percent of the poverty level, or about $29,000, can get additional subsidies to cut out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and copayments.

Subsidies mainly will go to younger, working people, according to an analysis published by Families USA in April.

The value of these subsidies will differ based on the price of health insurance, which varies greatly by state and by factors such as age. Although millions of people will get tax credits large enough to cover the full cost of their insurance, others will get smaller subsidies, and people earning above 400 percent of the poverty level will have to pay full price. In some cases, those premiums will be higher than prices available on the current health insurance market.

Although the Kaiser Family Foundation projects close to 30 million people could be using the exchanges, actual enrollment during the first year is expected to be much lower. The Congressional Budget Office projects that 7 million people will use the exchanges to obtain private health insurance for 2014, and that 6 million of them will qualify for tax credits.

The poor performance of HealthCare.gov and ongoing issues in a few states could suppress enrollment, although the Obama administration maintains it will have the federal web portal functional by the end of the month, enabling people to sign up. Consumers have until Dec. 15 to choose a health plan that will be in place on Jan. 1, and the enrollment period ends March 31.

The president’s team acknowledged struggling with how to present its message to the public, but some senators left the meeting more concerned that there were no immediate fixes forthcoming more than a month after healthcare.gov went live.

With reelection battles looming, fellow Democrats have been left to explain the website failures while hoping that the benefits of the Affordable Care Act are just around the corner.

The frustration was on full display Wednesday as 15 Senate Democrats up for reelection and the senator in charge of their coordinated campaigns urged Obama to get the troubled launch behind him and his party.

“It’s absolutely unacceptable in this day and age that the administration can’t deliver on the promises it made to all Americans because of technical problems with a website,” said Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska). “Alaskans should be appreciating the critical benefits of the Affordable Care Act, but there is an understandable crisis in confidence because the administration has yet to get it off the ground.”

PHOTOS: The battle over Obamacare

One Senate aide, who asked for anonymity to discuss the private conversation, said it was clear the White House knows it has a “messaging problem,” but not that it has “any immediate fixes to it, which was disconcerting.”

Obama advisors are fighting a crisis of faith among Democrats as they try to muscle the marketplaces through the rough patch and into widespread use. Already, 11 Senate Democrats have signaled their support for extending the enrollment deadline, a delay that administration officials fear could lead to an unraveling of the larger policy.

White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough has personally led efforts to reassure balky Democrats, traveling to Capitol Hill and routinely talking with those up for reelection in 2014.

But nervousness remains.

“I am very frustrated with the rollout of the exchanges. The dysfunction and delays are unacceptable,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said after the meeting. “I remain deeply convinced that this is a ‘show me’ moment. This will not be resolved until Americans can, day after day, sign onto the health marketplace, review their options and complete their applications.”

Another Senate Democratic aide, who also was not authorized to comment publicly about the private conversation, described the meeting as “civil.”

“The White House understands the situation folks going into reelection are in,” the aide said. “It’s still a concern.”

The chaos surrounding the rocky startup has given ammunition to critics and forced Obama to answer tough questions about his plan, instead of touring the country drawing crowds for healthcare recruiters. Among the questions is whether he described the program accurately over the last three years when he said people could keep their old plans if they desired. But plans that don’t meet the new Obamacare standards are grandfathered in only if they were purchased before the law was signed in 2010.

House Republicans stoked concerns about the grandfather clause Wednesday by announcing the House would vote next week on the “Keep Your Health Plan Act,” which would allow insurance plans being offered today to continue into next year.

The bill’s author, Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.), calls it a “voluntary escape hatch” for people who want to keep their old coverage.

PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political moments

After the White House meeting, Obama traveled to Dallas for a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraiser and to promote healthcare enrollment. Texas is one of 36 states dependent on the federal website because it has declined to create its own exchange.

Speaking to a crowd at Temple Emanu-El in Dallas, Obama thanked a group of volunteers for promoting Obamacare even though state Republican leaders aren’t doing much to help implement the law.

Texas GOP Gov. Rick Perry has refused federal money to expand Medicaid to cover more low-income families. And the state is considering new requirements for recruiters hired under federal grants to help people sign up for Obamacare. A quarter of the state’s population is uninsured, the biggest share in the country. That amounts to about 6 million Texans.

“This task is especially challenging in the great Lone Star State,” Obama told the crowd. “There’s no state that actually needs this more than Texas.”

In a statement, Perry accused the president of coming to Texas “in a desperate attempt to salvage his ill-conceived and unpopular program from a Titanic fate by preaching expansion of the same Medicaid system he himself admits is broken.”

Earlier in the day, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified before the Senate Finance Committee, where even Democratic champions of the healthcare law were upset by the administration’s past failure to keep them informed of potential problems.

“You’ve got to tell us what’s going on candidly, fully,” said Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the committee and a chief architect of the law. “The more you don’t tell us, the greater the problem is going to be.”

http://news.yahoo.com/health-care-tactics-split-republican-senate-rivals-084729655--election.html,,[],Health care tactics split Republican Senate rivals,"ATLANTA (AP) — Republicans who want to regain control of the Senate will first have to do battle among themselves in 2014 primary elections, due largely to differences over how to proceed against the law they deride as ""Obamacare.""

In a number of Senate primary campaigns, conservatives are arguing over the best way to oppose President Barack Obama's health care law. The outcome of those campaigns could affect the battle over which party controls the Senate.

In intraparty skirmishes from Georgia to Nebraska, the GOP's most strident candidates and activists are insisting on a no-holds-barred approach. They accuse fellow Republicans — including several incumbent senators — of being too soft in their opposition to the Affordable Care Act and to the president in general.

The struggle will help determine just how conservative the Senate Republican caucus will be during Obama's final two years. And it could influence which party controls the chamber, with Democrats hoping that the most uncompromising Republican standard-bearers will emerge from the primaries and fare as poorly in general elections as their counterparts did in several 2012 Senate races. Republicans need to gain six seats to retake the majority in the Senate.

Republican Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia, who wants to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss, stepped into the dispute recently when he seemed to scold much of his party during an interview on a conservative talk radio show.

""A lot of conservatives say, 'Nah, just step back and let this thing fall to pieces on its own,"" Kingston said. ""Well, I don't think that's always the responsible thing to do.""

Rep. Paul Broun, one of Kingston's rivals in a crowded primary field, pounced immediately, declaring in an Internet ad, ""I don't want to fix Obamacare, I want to get rid of it."" Conservative commentators hammered Kingston with headlines like ""Kingston has surrendered on Obamacare.""

Story continues

In Tennessee, state Rep. Joe Carr blasted Sen. Lamar Alexander for serving as a key GOP negotiator in the deal to end the partial government shutdown that resulted from House Republicans' efforts to deny funding for the health care law. Alexander subsequently described himself as a ""conservative problem solver,"" a characterization that Carr says ""typifies how out of touch he is.""

Kentucky businessman Matt Bevin is using a similar line of attack in trying to unseat Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, as is Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel in his primary challenge to Sen. Thad Cochran. Carr, Bevin and McDaniel all say they'd be more like freshmen Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas, tea party favorites who pushed the defunding strategy and vexed their longer-serving colleagues.

In Nebraska and Louisiana, Republican candidates who say they oppose the health care law have had to defend their past positions on health care.

National Republicans settled on Rep. Bill Cassidy as their best shot to beat Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. But retired Air Force Colonel Rob Maness notes that Cassidy, as a state senator and a physician in the state's public hospital system, pushed health care policies similar to those in the Affordable Care Act.

""He has to defend his entire record, regardless of how he's voted in Washington,"" said Maness, a GOP candidate who hopes to unseat Landrieu with tea party support.

Midland University President Ben Sasse, one of several Republicans running in Nebraska for retiring Sen. Mike Johanns' seat, says he opposes the health care law but has had to explain previous speeches and writings in which he was less absolute, at one point calling the act ""an important first step"" in overhauling American health care.

""This goes right to the bigger fight between the ideologues and the pragmatists,"" said Republican strategist Todd Rehm of Georgia, who isn't affiliated with any of the eight GOP candidates for Chambliss' seat. Candidates who want to capture the divided Republican electorate, he said, ""see that you can't compromise on any of it. ... The moment you start to sound like you're open to any compromise, you've sold out the ideologues.""

Indeed, Alexander, McConnell, Kingston and Cassidy all voted against the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and for symbolic repeal proposals since then. Some in the GOP leadership say the intraparty struggle is only about tactics, not the bottom line. Carr insists that's exactly the point.

""Their presumption is that tactics don't matter because the outcome would be the same,"" he said. ""But it wouldn't. There wasn't a single Republican vote that passed the Affordable Care Act, whether we're talking establishment, tea party, moderate, conservative, whatever. ... So if it's so bad — and it is — the question is why did establishment Republicans not fight to defund it?""

Leaders of national conservative groups, which have been key players in recent Senate elections, say the distinction is an important consideration as they decide endorsements.

""I would say that any candidate who is a vocal opponent of that (defunding) strategy would certainly cause us hesitation,"" said Easton Randall of FreedomWorks political action committee. ""The burden is on them to explain what they would do differently to achieve a goal we all claim to share.""

So far, FreedomWorks has endorsed McDaniel over Cochran in Mississippi and Nebraska state Treasurer Shane Osborn over Sasse. The group is watching several other races.

The Senate Conservatives Fund, founded by former Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, split with FreedomWorks in Nebraska, siding with Sasse. But the fund endorsed Maness in Louisiana, Bevin in Kentucky and McDaniel in Mississippi, among others. DeMint now runs the Heritage Foundation, whose political arm also is monitoring several other races.

Those groups' recent record is mixed. Democrats are hoping for a repeat of 2010 and 2012 races where the far right groups backed less-viable candidates who lost general elections in Colorado, Nevada, Delaware and Indiana. But the same groups also helped elect Lee, Cruz and Marco Rubio in the presidential swing state of Florida.

At FreedomWorks, PAC treasurer and policy chief Dean Clancy dismissed any notion that his efforts would hurt the party.

""Republicans make a mistake when they try to waffle on these issues or sound like Democrat-lite,"" he said.

Her remarks bolster Rep. Sean Duffy’s (R-WI) claim that the mainstream press may be both ill-prepared and unwilling to critically question the Obama administration on its signature healthcare legislation.

Appearing on Mitchell Reports, Duffy and Mitchell got into a contested debate about whether a one-year delay of the individual mandate, which Republicans want as part of a short-term resolution to fund the government, was negotiable and whether the mainstream media has properly questioned the administration on Obamacare.

At one point during the exchange, Duffy said:

And why won’t he join us in ObamaCare? Why wasn’t Michelle Obama on October 1st at the computer with her family signing up for ObamaCare? Or Jay Carney? They have their own gold-plated health care plan that they’re in and they don’t-

Mitchell then responded, “So do you.”

Instantly, Duffy replied that he did not have a “gold-plated” plan because he had to be on Obamacare:

No I’m not, I’m in ObamaCare. I’m in ObamaCare, Andrea. All members of Congress are, and my family. The President should join us in ObamaCare, and the rest of America. Is that pretty reasonable? We should all be treated equally under the law? Why should members of Congress be in ObamaCare and not the President? Explain that one. Isn’t that fair?

Duffy continued to ask Mitchell if she could “defend why the President shouldn’t be in ObamaCare like members of Congress and their staffs?”

“I think the media should start doing its job,” Duffy said.

Mitchell, visibly annoyed, then semi-sardonically responded, “Thanks for your advice. Thank you, Congressman.”

Earlier in the interview, Mitchell insisted Duffy’s demands were “non-negotiable” before Duffy said Obama is essentially saying, “I get my gold-plated health care plan but I want members of Congress and the rest of America to be in ObamaCare.”

He then pointed out that a big issue many Americans have with the media is that the it does not ask the question, “Why are you treating families different than big businesses?”

“You need Jon Stewart on Comedy Central to ask Secretary Sebelius, ‘Hey, why won’t you treat these two equally?'” Duffy said. “And she can’t answer it. I mean, that’s how pathetic I think news reporting has become, when we won’t ask tough questions to the administration.”

Duffy kept pressing Mitchell and asked her if she and her colleagues have asked Obama and those in his administration, “Why do you want your own health care and you won’t join us in ObamaCare?”

After Mitchell surmised what she thought Sebelius’s response would be to such a question, Duffy pointed out Mitchell could not point out how Sebelius has answered the question because members of the mainstream press have not posed it to her."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/12/05/1260364/-New-report-extols-benefits-of-unemployment-compensation-Pelosi-No-budget-deal-without-UI,2013-12-05 00:00:00,"['Daily Kos Staff', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",New report extols benefits of unemployment compensation. Pelosi: No budget deal without UI,"

@gzornick Whoa--strong pledge from Pelosi just now: ""We cannot sign a budget agreement that does not include unemployment insurance.""

It's encouraging to see this bit of pushback against would-be austerity measures. When a budget agreement was signed off on in early 2011, however, the federally funded Emergency Unemployment Compensation was included but with 26 weeks of extensions hacked out of it. Partly as a consequence, only 34 percent of the nation's 4.1 million long-term unemployed people are now receiving checks under EUC, a program specifically designed to financially assist those who cannot find work after 27 weeks or more without a job. The other 66 percent are flat out of luck.

If EUC is not renewed by Dec. 28, when the program expires, 1.3 million long-term unemployed Americans will lose their average $269 a week from the government. And in 2014, another 3.6 million Americans who would have become eligible for EUC will not receive its benefits.

As Sarah Ayres points out:



This is because unemployment benefits are not just good for workers; they are also good for the economy. By putting money into the pockets of people who will spend it, unemployment benefits boost demand, spur economic growth, and create jobs. In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has found that unemployment benefits are one of the most effective fiscal policies to increase economic growth and employment. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, has found that every $1 spent on unemployment insurance grows the economy by $1.55. All these dollars circulating through the economy create jobs. According to an Economic Policy Institute analysis, extending emergency unemployment benefits would create 310,000 additional jobs in 2014.

Nine out of the 11 times the EUC has been renewed since it was first enacted in June 2008, Republican lawmakers have resisted. Their essential argument: unemployment compensation makes people lazy. In other words, with just one job opening available for every three job seekers, Republicans say Get a Job!

Meanwhile, the Council of Economic Advisers and Department of Labor have published a new report, The Economic Benefits of Extending Unemployment Benefits. Among its findings:



• Including workers’ families, nearly 69 million people have been supported by extended UI benefits, including almost 17 million children • In 2012 alone, UI benefits lifted an estimated 2.5 million people out of poverty [...] • Failing to extend UI benefits would put a dent in job-seekers’ incomes, reducing demand and costing 240,000 jobs in 2014. • Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and JP Morgan suggest that without an

extension of EUC GDP will be .2 to .4 percentage points lower. • In 2011, CBO found that aid to the unemployed is among the policies with “the largest

effects on output and employment per dollar of budgetary cost”

The official unemployment rate of 7.3 percent is higher now than it has been at any time in past recessions when extended unemployment compensation has been removed."

Baristas are eager to tell their customers about the humaneness and the moral responsible stances taken by the company. Starbucks states at their site that:

We have always believed Starbucks can – and should — have a positive impact on the communities it serves. One person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.

They preach community, ethical sourcing of their products, environmental footprint minimization, and global responsibility. Their support for the well-being of their employees is probative.





Starbucks’ stance is in stark contrast to companies like UPS and Papa John’s who have blamed the law for reduced health benefits, potential job losses, and potential store closings. Some small and medium sized businesses are keeping their headcount under 50 and/or their workers under 30 hours to skirt the law. Most corporations will simply fit the new law into their business model as they understand it is the moral thing to do.

It is time for the companies that intend to expand their benefits or companies that do not intend to go through hoops to penalize their employees by denying them the ability to get affordable healthcare through the company, to speak up. It is time for Americans to know which corporations are with the working middle class and which corporations are against the working middle class."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/19/obamacare-enrollment-_n_3779676.html,2013-08-19 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Editor'],New Obamacare Enrollment Campaign Unveiled By Kathleen Sebelius,"WASHINGTON -- With precious time remaining before the health care exchanges established by the president's health care law are up and running, the Obama administration is rolling out new initiatives to encourage enrollment.

The latest of these is set to be unveiled on Monday, when the Department of Health and Human Services will debut a video contest -- complete with cash prizes -- designed to persuade younger consumers to get insurance.

The administration will partner with Young Invincibles, a non-profit youth issues organization, to run the contest, with the goal of reaching those younger Americans who are skeptical of the need for health coverage.

Participants will be encouraged to submit three different types of videos advertising the benefits of the exchanges: a song, an animated short, or a video designed to convince viewers that they aren't invincible. Using funds from the Affordable Care Act's education and outreach budget, HHS will award $3,000 each to the creators of the three most popular and persuasive videos, while second and third place winners will get $2,500 each.

“Educating young people about new coverage options requires an all-hands-on-deck approach,"" Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will say Monday during a speech at a Young Invincibles conference in Houston, according to advanced remarks provided to The Huffington Post. ""For millions of young people, health insurance hasn’t been an option because it’s always been out of reach—because it costs too much, or isn’t offered through a job.""

The contest is designed to dispel the notion that even young and healthy individuals would be better off simply not purchasing health insurance. It may seem like an odd choice of battlegrounds. But attracting the young demographic is key to the effectiveness of the exchanges, providing insurers with the type of low-risk customers that will help lower premiums across the board. It's no coincidence that many conservative opponents of the Affordable Care Act are actively urging young people to skip the exchanges altogether, even though doing so would mean incurring the tax penalty for not having insurance coverage.

The agency's PR budget for the health care law is $75 million (though the $30,000 being spent by the video project comes from a different pool of funds). That may seem like a lot, but HHS will likely be outspent by opponents of the health care law. The department has searched for ways to spread the word about the exchanges at a lower cost, and has turned to allies like Planned Parenthood for help.

People who wish to enter the video submission contest must do so by Sept. 23. On Oct. 1, the day the exchanges go online, the videos will debut on a website created by Young Invincibles and the public will be allowed to vote on them. The winners will be announced on Oct. 21.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/23/Senate-fight-Reid,2013-09-23 00:00:00,['Jenny Beth Martin'],Senate Republicans Can Stop Reid from Funding Obamacare,"When Establishment Republicans and their Democrat comrades claim there is no path to victory in the fight to defund Obamacare, they are intentionally muddying the waters. Do not confuse blundering political expedience with winning.

There is a clear path to victory and the folks comprising the new Republican leadership emerging in the House and Senate are smart enough and bold enough to take that path.

They’re playing to win and deserve our support.

Understanding the options available to these new leaders requires an understanding of a few of the basics of Senate rules and process. Otherwise folks like Karl Rove will tell you to “do the math” counting Democrat Senators without telling you that Senate Republicans have the ability to change the formula.

To help simplify an explanation of the Senate process, think of it like a football game where the rules and timing are set, but there are different plays at your disposal. Winning requires playing the game with a focus on fundamentals.

Let’s go with one possible scenario that could unfold this week. As early as Monday, the Senate could agree to take up the House bill passed last Friday that funds everything in the government but Obamacare. The Senate can do this by something called “unanimous consent,” if no one Senator objects, or if one Senator does object, they can put it to a vote requiring 60 votes to pass. For the purposes of this exercise, let’s say one or the other is successful and the bill goes to the Senate floor for consideration.

What happens next in this process is debate on the Senate floor begins, where each side argues for or against the bill.

During this debate period, Democrat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid could offer an amendment to strip out the language in the House bill that defunds Obamacare. Reid would also likely choose not to allow any other amendments to the bill. That is within his power as the leader of the majority party in the Senate. The hard and fast rules, however, require Reid to file his amendment for consideration and reveal for all to see what’s in the amendment before the debate is over.

This is where things can get deceptive. Establishment Republicans would let you believe the next step in the process is the Senate has a vote on Reid’s amendment. What these politicians are not telling you is Sen. Reid cannot get a vote on his amendment to put Obamacare funding back in the House bill unless some of the Republicans agree to it.

Here’s how that happens.

We last left the House bill on the Senate floor being debated. To end that debate period, 60 Senators have to vote to do so. In Capitol Hillspeak, that vote to end debate is called reaching “cloture.” Currently, there are 52 Democrats, two independents (who work with the Democrats) and 46 Republican Senators. Republicans can win that cloture vote with 41 votes, and debate continues on the Senate floor until Democrats can get 60 votes to stop it.

A vote for cloture is a vote to fund Obamacare. The people understand this, so Senators beware.

Bottom line: Reid cannot get a vote on his amendment that would strip Obamacare defunding out of the House bill unless six Republicans agree to let that vote take place.

That’s called leverage in anyone’s playbook. Reid loses his advantage. He will have to negotiate on the rest of the process–like whether his amendment to fund Obamacare requires 60 votes to pass. Or not. That’s up for negotiation, too, if Senate Republicans fight for it.

If Republicans hold together on this, Reid will not be able to change the House bill. That leaves Harry Reid with some tough choices. Senate Democrats running for re-election do not want to be forced to vote against the House bill that defunds Obamacare.

Republicans can use this leverage to force Senate Democrats to make concessions.

Americans lucky enough to have a job right now are losing their healthcare plans they liked and wanted to keep. Obamacare is causing full-time jobs to become part-time jobs to get under the 30-hour workweek mandate. Doctors are choosing to retire rather than comply with the Obamacare boondoggle. We are seeing this every single day in the newspapers.

Even the unions hate Obamacare.

If Republicans will force Senate Democrats to support Obamacare in this vote, some will bolt or they will lose their elections next year. By then, Obamacare will have reached out and touched everyone. The consequences in some instances could be fatal.

When Democrats and Establishment Republicans shriek “government shutdown,” and “the military won’t be paid,” or “law enforcement won’t be paid,” and every other item in the parade of horribles they’ll put forth, remember this: the House can keep sending bills to the Senate to fund anything they want.

Air traffic controllers? Done! Military? Done! Border Patrol? Done!

Funding the government at this point is this and only this: the Senate must stop holding America hostage and vote to fund the government, in whole or piece by piece, without Obamacare in it.

In life and as in the game of football, you can never win the victory if you choose to punt every time you touch the ball."

Questionable Medicaid reports coming from states including Illinois%2C Texas and Michigan

Woman due in February fears she%27ll be without insurance coverage when her baby is born.

More complete Medicaid files going from HHS to states this week

The federal health care exchange is incorrectly determining that some people are eligible for Medicaid when they clearly are not, leaving them with little chance to get the subsidized insurance they are entitled to as the Dec. 23 deadline for enrollment approaches.

State and industry officials haven't quantified the problem yet, but the National Association of State Medicaid Directors may release information next week after following up on reports from around the country, says Executive Director Matt Salo.

Here's what happens: When consumers applying for insurance put their income information into subsidy calculators on HealthCare.gov — the exchange handling insurance sales for 36 states — it tells them how much financial assistance they qualify for or that they are eligible for Medicaid. If it's the latter, consumers aren't able to obtain subsidies toward the insurance, although they could buy full-priced plans.

If the Medicaid determination is wrong, consumers should file an appeal with the federal marketplace, says Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters, but she says she does not have an estimate on how long that would take.

Brokers are reporting that some of their clients are in insurance limbo as they wait for the error to be corrected by HHS or their states so they can reapply.

Jessica Waltman, top lobbyist for the National Association of Health Underwriters, says she's heard a number of reports from around the country of people making as much as $80,000 a year being told they qualify for Medicaid on HealthCare.gov.

""I have heard on multiple occasions from brokers in various states over the past eight weeks that they have had wacky Medicaid determinations with people who clearly make way too much money for Medicaid,"" she says.

HealthCare.gov is ""working smoothly for the vast majority of users,"" says Peters, but she noted some people may have technical difficulties or complicated family or tax situations that require extra assistance.

HHS has added more call center employees and in-person assistants for people who need extra help, she says.

But insurance brokers say that when people call the HealthCare.gov ""800"" number to explain that they can't possibly be eligible for Medicaid, they are told they are eligible if the site says so.

""It's a very, very unfortunate state of affairs,"" says Waltman.

HHS said it will begin sending Medicaid application files to states this week given that HealthCare.gov's mechanism to transfer accounts to state Medicaid offices still isn't working. The data received up until now haven't given states enough information to determine Medicaid eligibility, says Salo, but he hopes that, as promised, the new files will.

""Claims from some states about our process for testing the Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems are inaccurate,"" says Peters. ""We are eager to work with states to ensure their systems are functioning properly and to extend Medicaid coverage to those who are eligible through the generous Medicaid funding made possible by the Affordable Care Act.""

HHS is working ""extremely hard"" to make sure people will have coverage no matter what on Jan. 1, says Salo. While states support that goal, ""some want more assurances that people enrolled in Medicaid are actually eligible,"" he says.

HHS has told states they won't be penalized if they enroll people in Medicaid who HHS erroneously said were eligible, says Salo.

That's little consolation for consumers who can't buy subsidized insurance on the exchange because of apparent mistakes.

Jacob Hawkins of Plano, Texas, makes about $50,000 a year as a self-employed pool builder, yet his family of three was deemed eligible for Medicaid. His wife, Holly, is due to have their second child in February and is worried she won't have insurance in time. She filed an appeal of the Medicaid determination, but doubts it will be approved before the Dec. 23 deadline.

""I'm frustrated, mad and there's no one to help,"" says Hawkins.

Being married with a $50,000 income will get you a decline from Medicaid, even with a pregnant wife, says Hawkins' broker, Connie Louanne Trebing. "" I know, because I just had a couple declined in a similar situation,"" she says.

Some of the files of those supposedly eligible for Medicaid in Texas include people who don't live in Texas and who are already signed up for Medicaid, says Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.

Illinois expects about 19,000 files shortly from HHS. Illinois state spokesman Mike Claffey says he doesn't know how many may have problems, but Chicago broker Jordan Wishner says seven of them will be from his office and definitely will be wrong.

He has three clients of his own and an agent in his office has another four who are clearly above 138% of the federal poverty limit ($32,499 for a family of four), yet are being told they are eligible for Medicaid, which blocks their efforts to buy subsidized insurance.

""What am I supposed to do with the clients that are being told they qualify for Medicaid when they actually do not?"" asks Wishner, who owns The Health Insurance Shoppe, a retail insurance store. ""Send in an appeal with 16 days left? Seriously?""

With this much uncertainty, ""it's frustrating that there is no place for a broker to get help with errant cases and try to avert problems,"" says Waltman.

State exchanges and insurance companies have dedicated customer service support for insurance agents and brokers who try to correct problems ""before they escalate,"" says Waltman. On the federal exchange, brokers call the same help line as consumers.

""We do not want this woman giving birth and not having coverage,"" says Waltman, referring to Hawkins. ""This is absolutely what the law was trying to prevent from ever happening again.""

New poll shows confusion and misinformation still exists about the law

Among young people%2C just 56%25 realize there%27s a mandate to be insured

Knowledge about the law is higher in states that are setting up their own exchanges

This story was originally published Sept. 16, 2013.

WASHINGTON -- Republican lawmakers have failed in dozens of attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but a new USA TODAY/Pew Research Center Poll shows just how difficult they have made it for President Obama's signature legislative achievement to succeed.

As the health care exchanges at the heart of the law open for enrollment in two weeks, the public's views of it are as negative as they have ever been, and disapproval of the president's handling of health care has hit a new high. Confusion and misinformation about the law haven't significantly abated, especially among the law's main targets.

Among the 19% polled who are uninsured, nearly four in 10 don't realize the law requires them to get health insurance next year. Among young people, whose participation is seen as crucial for the exchanges to work, just 56% realize there's a mandate to be insured or face a fine.

And in the states that have refused to participate in the insurance marketplaces — defaulting instead to the federal exchange — knowledge about the Affordable Care Act and support for it are notably lower than in states that are setting up their own exchanges.

""There has been a full-court press from Day One from the opposition to characterize and demonize the plan,"" says Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution, who wrote about the GOP efforts in a 2012 book about Washington he co-authored, It's Even Worse Than It Looks. ""The campaign against the law after it was enacted, the range of steps taken, the effort to delegitimize it — it is unprecedented. We'd probably have to go back to the nullification efforts of the Southern states in the pre-Civil War period to find anything of this intensity.""

Opponents say the law's own shortcomings are responsible for its travails. ""This program is not ready for prime time,"" says Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., chief sponsor of a bill passed by the U.S. House last week to delay the exchanges until additional anti-fraud measures are put in place. (Like dozens of previous House-passed measures on Obamacare, it isn't expected to pass the Senate.)

When Obama signed the law more than three years ago, supporters predicted Americans would embrace it as some of the most popular provisions went into effect, including measures that have helped seniors pay prescription costs, protected children who have serious medical conditions and enabled young adults to stay on their parents' insurance plans until age 26.

But that turnaround in public opinion hasn't happened, at least not yet. Now the biggest test for the Affordable Care Act looms in two weeks, when the marketplaces for the uninsured are scheduled to open for enrollment on Oct. 1.

In the USA TODAY/Pew poll:

Opposition hits new highs: 53% disapprove of the health care law, the highest level since it was signed; 42% approve. By an even wider margin, intensity favors the opposition; 41% of those surveyed strongly disapprove while just 26% strongly approve. Fifty-three percent disapprove of Obama's handling of health care policy, an historic high. And Democrats have lost their traditional advantage on the issue. For the first time in polling that stretches back more than two decades, Americans narrowly prefer Republicans in dealing with health care policy, 40%-39%.

A boost in approval for the law that followed the Supreme Court decision in July 2012 upholding most of its provisions, to 47% approve-43% disapprove, has disappeared.

Confusion continues: Only one in four say they understand the law's impact on them and their families well while one-third say they have little or no understanding about how the law will work. Despite increasing education efforts by the administration, advocacy groups and some states, the percentage of Americans who don't understand the law has declined only modestly, to 34% from 44%, since it was passed.

Expectations are downbeat: Most haven't seen much impact from the law, but they are inclined to expect bad news down the road. Forty-one percent predict in coming years the effect on themselves and their families will be negative; just 25% think it will be positive. Even more, 47%, say the law will have a negative impact on the country as a whole; 35% expect a positive impact.

The poll of 1,506 adults was taken Sept. 4-8. The margin of error is +/–3 percentage points.

A GOP DIVIDE ON WHAT NEXT

Republicans were united in opposing the law when it was proposed, and they haven't budged since. Just 12% of Republicans surveyed favored the health care proposals being considered by Congress in the summer of 2009, when opponents flooded congressional town halls. Now an almost identical 11% of Republicans approve of the law.

Still, significant differences have developed within the GOP over what to do now that the Affordable Care Act is law, a division that could complicate the hard line party leaders are taking. The most fervent opposition, the poll finds, is driven by Tea Party Republicans; two-thirds of those who oppose the law want elected officials to do what they can to make sure it fails.

However, non-Tea Party Republicans who oppose the law are inclined to think officials should do what they can to make the law work as well as possible. Among all opponents of the law, a narrow majority, 51%-42%, want officials to help the law succeed.

Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, says voters eventually will appreciate officials who are now ""scrambling"" to implement the law and create state exchanges that work. ""It's been politically popular to be against the Affordable Care Act,"" he says. ""My prediction is it's going to be much less popular when constituents understand that your political posturing is costing them affordable health care.""

In the Green Mountain State, officials and advocates of the state exchange called Vermont Health Connect have held more than 200 events at community forums and local festivals. They have aired TV, radio, print and on-line ads and posted informational videos on YouTube.com. (""For Vermonters, By Vermonters,"" the videos declare.) Organizers expect about a quarter-million people to have signed up for private insurance or Medicaid through the exchange by next March, when open enrollment is scheduled to close.

But in Tennessee, Rep. Black says she doesn't feel comfortable giving information to constituents who call her congressional office with questions about how the program will work. Since the Volunteer State isn't setting up a state exchange, residents will use the federal exchange.

""At this point, we don't really have a good idea, because the president and the administration doesn't have a good idea,"" she says. And she's reluctant to refer them to so-called ""navigators"" who have been hired to provide guidance because of what she sees as a lack of safeguards protecting applicants' Social Security numbers and other personal information.

The decision by 27 states (all but three of them with GOP governors) against participating in a state exchange may be contributing to the law's considerable challenges.

In the 23 states and the District of Columbia that will have state exchanges, residents split about evenly on approval and disapproval of the law. In the states that are defaulting to a federal exchange, however, residents oppose the law by an overwhelming 20 percentage points.

In states with their own exchanges, 59% of those surveyed understand that an exchange will be available to people in their state. In states using the federal exchange, just 44% realize that.

WHAT'S IN THE LAW?

Most Americans know the act, also known as Obamacare, means uninsured people have to get health insurance. About seven of 10 correctly say that's the case; just 12% say it's not.

On other specific provisions of the law, however, only half of those surveyed know there will be a health care exchange available in their state. Only half are aware that there will be federal subsidies for lower-income citizens to buy insurance.

Even so, for a starting point, consider this: Nearly two-thirds of the uninsured say they plan to get health insurance over the next six months, and not quite half of them say they're going to do so because of the law. That means 12% of those who don't have insurance now plan to get it soon. That translates to millions of Americans, more than double the administration's estimate that 7 million will enroll through the exchanges next year.

Shumlin cautions there are sure to be problems ahead.

""This is not going to be a hiccup-free ride,"" he says. ""Just from the technology perspective, there are going to be bumps in the road."" But time is on the side of supporters of the Affordable Care Act, he says, once the exchanges are implemented and Americans understand how they actually work. ""When constituents in states governed by Republican governors who are trying to make a political point with Obamacare figure out that their son, their daughter, is not getting health care because of their political posturing, well, I wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of that.""

Black expresses equal confidence that time is on the side of opponents of the Affordable Care Act, when the exchanges open for business and Americans understand how they actually work. ""Once this actually starts impacting people in their real lives, in their everyday life — 'My rates are going up; my full-time job is becoming a part-time job because of Obamacare' — once all of that starts happening, that's a negative,"" she says."

Like hard-liners in the far right corner of the House, Mr. Cruz has grabbed for every possible lever in his campaign against President Obama’s health law, fully aware that he will not succeed but eager for the accolades and donations that will inevitably follow from the Tea Party’s misguided faithful. In the process, he has demonstrated how little he understands Senate rules and, more important, how little he appreciates the public’s desire for a collaborative Congress.

Mr. Cruz’s campaign to defund health reform consists largely of an absurd plan to filibuster the very House bill that kept the government from closing and defunded the health law, a notion that was rejected by the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, and most Senate Republicans. After he lost their support, he began an extended tirade anyway, a stunt that might resemble a filibuster but in fact will have to end Wednesday morning before a prescheduled vote on the House bill takes place.

In just the first hour of his speech, Mr. Cruz said his fellow senators were no more sincere than professional wrestlers and that accepting the health law was like appeasing the Nazis. His own goal of tearing down the law, he said, was a dream on par with President John F. Kennedy’s promise to put a man on the moon. This combination of grandiosity and pure nastiness helps explain why the senator has become the least popular man in Washington."

Fox News' Ed Henry told Megyn Kelly on “The Kelly File” Thursday that the documents, released by committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, are not official enrollment numbers, but say that as of the morning of Oct. 2, “six enrollments have occurred so far with five different issuers.”

The notes were taken at a “war room” meeting of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which has been tasked with implementing ObamaCare.

They say that at the next meeting, which took place on the afternoon of Oct. 2, “approximately 100” people had signed up and 248 enrollments had occurred by the morning of Oct. 3.

The Obama administration has thus far not released any official numbers on ObamaCare enrollment, saying the first numbers would be released in mid-November after the HHS collects data from a variety of different sources.

A HHS spokesman told Fox News the documents “appear to be notes,” and do not include official enrollment statistics.

“As the Secretary said before Congress, we are focused on providing reliable and accurate information and we do not have that at this time due to the issues with 834 forms,” Joanne Peters said. “We have always anticipated that the pace of enrollment will increase throughout the enrollment period.”

Health care industry consultant Robert Laszewski told Kelly the numbers are not surprising, saying ""clearly the White House does not want insurance companies talking about what's going here.""

""And given what was released tonight, the news that so very few people are signing up, you can see why,"" he continued. ""If four weeks ago the enrollment numbers were public it would look very bad. I can tell you based upon the information that I continue to get this trickle of enrollment that you're reporting on for the first three days has really continued for the first month.""

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee received the documents in response to its request to 11 of the contractors involved in the ObamaCare website rollout.

Jan Brewer pushes through Obama’s Medicaid expansion,"TUCSON — Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer won a battle with state lawmakers this week, defying most other conservatives in her party to get a key component of President Obama’s Medicaid expansion through the Legislature.

The Arizona Senate voted Thursday to approve the measure 18 to 11. That followed approval earlier this week by the state House of Representatives.

The issue had inflamed passions and divided the Legislature for weeks. Things came to a head Tuesday when Brewer called lawmakers into the Capitol in Phoenix for a surprise special session.

Brewer — a vocal opponent of President Obama’s healthcare reform law — came out in support of Medicaid expansion for her state in January and ended up leading a contingent of moderate Democrats and Republicans who won over the objections of some conservative Republicans.

“By joining me in extending health coverage to hundreds of thousands of Arizonans, legislators of my own party have come under sharp criticism in some quarters. Some have had threats made not just against their political future, but also their personal livelihood,” Brewer said in a prepared statement.

Brewer added: “But I also know this in my heart: The great majority of Arizonans stand with us. Our citizens have — time and again — voted to extend cost-effective care to the working poor.”

Opponents of Medicaid expansion blasted Brewer and those who supported her, charging that the expansion would raise insurance premiums for Arizona residents.

“Tyranny rears its head in Arizona,” tweeted state Sen. Kelli Ward. “Those of us who voted against it were unable to stop the hijacking of the legislative process by the few. It was a sad day in AZ.”

Brewer, whose state joined 25 others in fighting Obama’s Affordable Care Act in court, later became a staunch proponent for Medicaid expansion in Arizona. She said the expansion effort would secure a stream of federal revenue — $1.6 billion — that would cover the costs of the uninsured who already show up in doctors’ offices and emergency rooms across the state.

Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Obama’s healthcare overhaul but allowed states to opt out of Medicaid expansion.

Like other GOP governors, Brewer opted out of the health insurance exchange component of the law, leaving it to the federal government to set up the marketplace where the uninsured in the state and businesses can choose their providers.

Still, the federal funding for Medicaid expansion was too good an opportunity to pass up. The $1.6 billion in federal funding will enable Arizona to provide health insurance for an additional 240,000 residents and continue insuring 50,000 childless adults.

Arizona would become the 24th state to move toward participating in expanded Medicaid, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization that tracks the issue.

In the latest surprise to emerge during the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, people seeking insurance on the ObamaCare exchanges are finding the plans limit access to some of the best-ranked hospitals and cancer centers in the country.

The access problem is a byproduct of the effort to drive down costs of subsidized coverage, prompting insurance companies to shy away from more expensive facilities.

That doesn't necessarily mean someone buying insurance through ObamaCare is locked out of those hospitals. In some cases, patients could go ""out of network"" in order to use the medical center of their choosing -- but would have to pay more in the process.

According to a former top health care adviser for the White House, that's how the program was designed.

Challenged on ""Fox News Sunday"" over why Americans are losing access to their current doctors and hospitals, ObamaCare architect Ezekiel Emanuel claimed President Obama did not mislead on that point, despite his refrain that if people liked their doctors and policies they could keep them.

""The president never said you were going to have unlimited choice of any doctor in the country you want to go to,"" Emanuel said. ""He didn't say you could have unlimited choice.""

In a remark that has since generated considerable controversy, Emanuel added: ""If you want to pay more for an insurance company that covers your doctor, you can do that.""

Indeed, The Financial Times reported that most plans being sold on the exchanges in New York, Texas and California do not offer access to some of the top medical centers in those states.

New York's Memorial Sloan Kettering, Houston's MD Anderson Cancer Center and Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center are left out of most plans -- meaning those who want to go there would likely have to pay more.

Watchdog.org, in a recent report, found that 11 of the top 18 hospitals (as ranked by U.S. News & World Report) were connected with just one or two insurance carriers on the exchanges. In Ohio, for instance, the Cleveland Clinic was connected with one insurance company.

Asked about the shifting policies under ObamaCare and their impact on choice, a representative with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center released a statement to FoxNews.com saying, ""all patients deserve access to top tier cancer care"" -- and that while not everyone needs to come to MD Anderson, ""we believe both insurance providers and our health care system must work together to ensure patients have that option so that all of us have the best chance of beating cancer.""

Though some complain about these centers' high costs, the statement argued that ""our country's leading cancer centers help bring down the cost of care for all patients by conducting research that leads to new and better treatments, better cancer fighting strategies and increased efficiencies that lead to cost savings.""

""We're very concerned,"" Thomas Priselac, president of Cedars-Sinai Health System in California, told The Financial Times. ""[Insurers] know patients that are sick come to places like ours. What this is trying to do is redirect those patients elsewhere, but there is a reason why they come here. These patients need what it is that we are capable of providing.""

It's not just the insurance companies that are deciding to drop certain hospitals from their plans. In some cases, the hospitals themselves are opting out, unwilling to go along with proposed lower rates.

Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, defended the insurance industry's move to trim costs where it can -- noting that the law's benefit requirements end up raising costs.

""Establishing high-value provider networks is one way health plans can help make coverage more affordable for consumers, which is particularly important at a time when costs are increasing due to the new health insurance tax and minimum benefit requirements included in the health care reform law,"" he told FoxNews.com.

Emanuel, though, said ""the issue isn't the selective networks.""

""People are going to have a choice as to whether they want to pay a certain amount for a selective network or pay more for a broader network,"" Emanuel said.

Under the law, people who do not have insurance have until the end of March to sign up in order to avoid a penalty. For those wishing to get new coverage by Jan. 1, the deadline to sign up is Dec. 23.

Despite problems with HealthCare.gov and other state-based exchanges, officials say they're improving the websites and making progress in signing more people up as the deadlines near.

Editor’s Note: For more on this story, watch Sanjay Gupta, MD, Saturday at 4:30 p.m. and Sunday at 7:30 a.m. ET.

(CNN) —

Theo Visser was thirsty. He got up from his seat during the half-time break in a soccer match to purchase a drink from the concession stand.

“There she was, standing behind the bar,” he recounts, 58 years later. “It was love at first sight.” Theo asked the young woman out to a movie – and the rest, they say, is history.

It’s quite a shame, then, that Corrie Visser doesn’t remember any of this. Or if she does, she can’t say so. Corrie is one of 152 residents at Hogewey, a cutting-edge elder care facility on the outskirts of Weesp, the Netherlands, just minutes from downtown Amsterdam.

’Dementia Village’ - as it has become known – is a place where residents can live a seemingly normal life, but in reality are being watched all the time. Caretakers staff the restaurant, grocery store, hair salon and theater – although the residents don’t always realize they are carers – and are also watching in the residents’ living quarters.

Residents are allowed to roam freely around the courtyard-like grounds with its landscaped trees, fountains and benches – but they can’t leave the premises.

Their two-story dormitory-style homes form a perimeter wall for the village, meaning there is no way a resident can accidentally wander out.

And if they do approach the one exit door, a staffer will politely suggest the door is locked and propose another route.

Elderly Germans try to avoid care homes

Placing an aging family member here is far less expensive than round-the-clock, in-home care. It also takes an enormous amount of stress off family members who don’t have ample time or proper training to care for their loved ones.

Corrie has received a diagnosis of severe dementia, meaning she requires attention and support 24 hours a day. That clinical indication is necessary to gain admittance into Hogewey.

The burden of caring for Corrie eventually became unmanageable for Theo and his daughters, so together, they made the decision to place her here.

He says: “It’s perfect. I wouldn’t know a better place for her. It’s 100% good.”

Nearly every day of the week, Theo drives 15 kilometers (10 miles) each way to spend a few hours with his 80-year-old wife.

“I do it for myself,” he says. “I need it for myself. She (still) recognizes everyone… so it’s important I be here every day.”

Although they can’t chat with each other, Theo and Corrie will often sit for hours, holding hands and lovingly look into each other’s eyes. Every so often, Corrie offers a smile, a laugh, a squeeze of the hand. At least part of her memory, it seems, is still intact, though she can’t verbalize much these days.

Like other residents of Hogewey, Corrie may not know exactly where she is, but she always feels right at home. That’s precisely the idea.

For Yvonne van Amerongen, one of Hogewey’s founders, the need to create the small village was deeply personal.

“It was the moment my mother called me and told me my father had passed away suddenly,” she recalls. “Nothing was wrong with him. He just had a heart attack and he died. One of the first things I thought was, ‘Thank God he never had to be in a nursing home.’ That’s crazy that I have to think that! I’m in the management of a nursing home and I don’t want my father to come here.”

Five things CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta learned at the center

Van Amerongen sat down with her colleagues in November 1992 to discuss how they could transform the typical nursing home into more worthwhile living.

They created a 1.5 hectare (four-acre) complex, completed in 2009, that is home to 23 housing units and seven different “lifestyle themes,” such as crafts, culture, religious and urban.

Art lovers get paintings on the walls and music is always playing while the religious get more conservative décor and Christian crosses on the walls.

The simple goal: provide the most normal possible life, reminiscent of each individual’s formative years.

From the furnishing of her unit to the decorations and the type of food served, Corrie is led to believe that nothing in her life has changed. It’s this sense of normalcy that they strive for day in and day out at Hogewey.

Study finds loneliness linked to dementia

In some ways, this is similar to the manufactured reality depicted in the movie “The Truman Show,” where a man played by Jim Carrey discovers his entire life is actually a TV program. Everything he thinks is real is in fact a mirage, created by television producers for the viewing public’s entertainment.

Van Amerongen dismisses any accusations that she and her staff are duping their residents. “We have a real society here,” she says. “I don’t think people feel fooled. They feel fooled if we just tell them a story that’s not true and they know it. We’re not telling stories.”

But telling stories is exactly what some of the residents do, all day long, including Corrie’s housemate, Jo Verhoef. Like all of Hogewey’s residents, Jo’s dementia is rapidly progressing. Her “loop” is getting shorter; the conversations she carries and the questions she asks are becoming more repetitive in a shorter amount of time.

“Do you know Steve Matthew?” she asks, multiple times over the course of an hour. Of course, no one does, but each time she seems surprised that we haven’t met. *

Steve may be a relic of Jo’s past, a distant, foggy memory of a baseball player she says lived with her for a short time when she was younger. Or, he may be a figment of her imagination. Sadly, we’ll never know.

Brain map seeks to unlock mysteries of the mind

Worldwide, 35.6 million people have dementia, according to the World Health Organization, with 7.7 million new cases being diagnosed every year. At that rate, the number of people with dementia is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050. This will be an additional burden for governments already struggling to contain the runaway costs of health care.

In Holland, everyone pays into the state health care system during their working years, with the money then disbursed to pay for later-in-life expenses - and that means living in Hogewey does not cost any more than a traditional nursing home.

Could this innovative model work in other countries? Health care industry leaders in Germany, England, Switzerland and Japan are all beginning to take notice. At Hogewey, says van Amerongen, “We have Dutch design, Dutch cultures, Dutch lifestyles, but the concept is to value the person, the individual… to support them to live their life as usual, and you can do that anywhere.”

On a physical level, residents at Hogewey require fewer medications; they eat better, and yes, they live longer. On a mental level, they also seem to have more joy. It’s a difficult thing to measure, but that is the most important thing here at Hogewey.

So could this work in other parts of the world? That’s the next question.

* After reading this story the real Steve Matthew (not Matthews) contacted CNN to confirm he does indeed exist and this part of Jo’s memory is accurate. He says he still visits her every three weeks and that she became his ‘artificial mother’ while he was in Holland playing baseball.

We have also corrected the spelling of his name in this story."

It may be either (or both). But the idea of closing down the government, and even threatening to precipitate a global credit crisis, over the healthcare law has been widely written off as myopia on the part of the live-free-or-die crowd.

We’re not so sure. Focusing on Obamacare in general, and mandatory coverage in particular, could prove a plausible strategy for broadening the anti-Obama coalition to include voters in their 20s and 30s by bringing attention to what economists call the “cross-subsidy” inherent in any insurance system based on mandatory coverage. And, with hindsight, it may yet be seen as the opening salvo in a generational war, one fed by the reality that older Americans are a rapidly growing burden on younger workers, who can ill afford it.

As everybody with a pulse must know by now, if the only folks who buy Obamacare coverage are the sick and those in late middle age, the system will be self-supporting only at very high premiums, hardly a recipe for cementing popular support. That’s why candidate Obama reluctantly accepted the individual mandate as part of his health insurance plan, adding a spoonful of sugar for those who are poorly paid (but Medicaid ineligible) in the form of need-based subsidies. Indeed, as pundit Matt Miller has pointed out, such generational transfers are the keystone to virtually all health insurance: Employer-based group insurance works only because younger workers help carry older ones.

There are powerful economic arguments in favor of universal coverage. For one thing, it solves the “free-riding” problem. Because we collectively assume responsibility for the uninsured when they end up in the hospital anyway, why not ask them to take some responsibility before the fact? Equally to the point, mandatory coverage would probably cut the country’s total medical bill, reducing the financial incentive for an individual to delay treatment until a garden-variety illness morphs into a case for the ICU.

That said, it is still foolish to ignore the leverage that the individual mandate gives opponents of Obamacare. America’s healthcare system for the elderly (Medicare, plus Medicaid for nursing-home care) is already edging the country toward generational war because Washington will sooner or later be forced to choose between drastic limitations on coverage in those programs or drastic increases in taxes on the decreasing portion of working Americans. Now we’re adding a parallel obligation on younger workers to subsidize healthcare for fiftysomethings.

What to do? The path of least political resistance is to tough it out, hoping younger households will be unable to figure out what’s happening, or simply unwilling to throw in their lot with opponents of gay marriage, marijuana reform and the like. Alternatively, we could start paying attention to the building crisis as younger households scramble ever harder for a middle-class living standard.

And none too soon, because the signs of generational conflict are already appearing. Think, for example, of the flare in anger over the burden of college loans. Or the popular resentment of government employees who (at least until recently) could count on job stability, adequate health insurance and even pensions.

Those of us who are doing very well in a system that isn’t working very well for the majority would be wise to do something about it before the doo-doo hits the fan. Then again, in light of what’s been happening in Washington lately, maybe it’s already too late.

They shimmy and eventually end up topless.

The risqué performance was part of an Obamacare registration drive last week in San Francisco, dubbed the ""Healthy Ho's Party.""

Organized by ""Siouxsie Q,"" a Bay Area sex worker, the event was meant to encourage other sex workers to enroll in the new insurance exchanges. It was a rousing success: Nearly 40 men and women attended and almost all of them filed enrollment paperwork.

In the all-cash, off-the-books sex industry, workers can be particularly high risk and insurance is often out of reach. Many sex workers -- a broad term that can refer to a number of services, including sexual massage, prostitution, and escort and dominatrix work -- consider themselves self-employed entrepreneurs who can't afford to purchase healthcare. But that could all change with the Affordable Care Act.

Siouxsie, 28, has shopped for plans countless times since 2008, coming up empty each time. She and her partner recently reviewed their healthcare options and found that a joint plan would have cost between $400 and $500 a month -- an unaffordably large chunk of their incomes.

""We just couldn't swing [insurance] in the Bay Area -- we're lower middle class, recent college graduates, in Startup Land trying to make our way,"" she said.

But come January 1, when the new law goes into effect, she and her partner will be looking at a monthly bill of between $175 and $200. They're deciding between two plans on the California exchange and will receive a tax credit of about $275 a month (without the credit it would have cost nearly $500).

California's exchange site was down the first few times Siouxsie tried to navigate it, but she was able to successfully browse policies several times. (She nevertheless arrived at the party with stacks of paper applications so the night could continue even if the website was disrupted.)

Volunteers from Siouxsie's weekly podcast, The WhoreCast, staffed the event. ""Jolene,"" another sex worker who had already enrolled through the California exchange, was also on hand to talk users through the process. A key detail for the crowd: Enrollment doesn't require users to report their employment.

""I am here mostly to put my skill at filling out bureaucratic forms to use,"" Jolene joked.

Through the California exchange, Jolene will receive a $211 monthly tax credit, which will bring her payments to just $36 a month.

Individuals making less than $46,000 are eligible for a tax credit to offset their monthly costs. Many of the sex workers at the event file W-2s for their legal work, whether it be a part-time job or sex work that falls within the law. Sex workers interviewed by CNNMoney estimated this income to be less than $45,000 a year.

The Affordable Care Act will cover contraception, screening for sexually transmitted infections, and violence counseling at no additional charge, which the sex workers said would make a big difference in their community. The legislation will also make it more difficult for insurance companies to deny coverage based on gender identity and HIV status.

For Jolene and others in her line of work, it's cause for celebration.

Steve Beshear have not always been friendly. When Obama paid his first presidential visit in May 2011, his fellow Democrat was somewhere else. Later, Beshear lashed out at the administration’s environmental regulators, telling them to “get off our backs.”

But leading one of the nation’s poorest, sickest states, Beshear has improbably overseen one of the most successful rollouts of Obama’s troubled healthcare overhaul and become, deep in his long public career, a hero to Democrats grasping to find a redeeming figure amid the political wreckage.

He’s an unlikely champion, not least because Kentucky’s two U.S. senators are both implacable opponents of the program.

“I knew if I was going to make a huge difference in the health status of Kentucky, it was going to take some kind of transformational tool to do that, and that’s what the Affordable Care Act is for me,” Beshear, white-haired and greyhound-lean, said as he sat behind a big maple desk in his office. “I think we’ve started something here,” he later added, “that a generation from now you’ll see a very different Kentucky than what you see today.”

For now, Kentuckians may feel understandably whiplashed.

While Beshear, serving his second and final term, has become one of the foremost proponents of Obamacare, the state’s senior senator, Republican leader Mitch McConnell, has been an even more visible foe. Facing a tough 2014 reelection fight, he calls the law “a disaster,” “a huge mistake” and “a monstrosity” that “needs to be pulled out root and branch.” The sentiment is seconded by Kentucky’s junior senator, Republican Rand Paul, who was elected in 2010 in a tea party fever born of seething opposition to the president and his healthcare plan.

Both sides marshal selective facts to argue their cases. About 640,000 Kentuckians, or about 1 in 6, lack healthcare insurance. As of this week, more than 60,000 of them had signed up for coverage through the state’s insurance marketplace, which has operated smoothly from the start.

At the same time, about 280,000 Kentucky residents could lose their existing health insurance under standards set by the new federal law, which would force them to scramble in the next few weeks to find replacement coverage in the state exchange or elsewhere.

The need for care in this pretty but hard-pressed state is unarguable. Kentucky leads the nation in cancer deaths and preventable hospitalizations and suffers some of the highest rates of diabetes, cardiovascular illness and premature death. Extending healthcare to as many as possible could make a difference, the 69-year-old Beshear said, long after he is gone. “To me,” he said, “it was the morally responsible and the right thing to do.”

Born in rural western Kentucky, the son of a Baptist minister, Beshear first won office at age 29. After three terms in the Legislature, he was elected state attorney general at 35. But unlike a young, ambitious Democrat from Arkansas whose early success propelled him to the White House, Beshear’s political career stalled after a series of setbacks, including an unsuccessful 1996 Senate run against McConnell.

After several years practicing law, Beshear staged a political comeback in 2007 when he beat a scandal-stained Republican to become governor. He arrived just in time for the Great Recession, which, along with an intransigent GOP-led state Senate, thwarted most of his larger ambitions. A signature plan to expand legal gambling to boost education funding has stalled. An attempt at overhauling the state tax system appears similarly stymied.

Obamacare presented a chance to do something big, and lasting.

Empowered to act without the Legislature’s approval, Beshear became the only Southern governor to embrace a provision vastly expanding Medicaid eligibility and open a state-run exchange for others seeking insurance. He conceded, with a small smile, that it was easier knowing he would never face voters again. “But,” he went on, “I’m convinced that in the end this is not going to [be] a negative political issue.”

He acted, Beshear said, only after independent analysts predicted the healthcare overhaul would inject more than $15 billion into Kentucky’s economy over the next eight years, create about 17,000 new jobs and produce about $800 million in state revenue. “You cannot afford not to do this,” he said he was told.

Paul, for one, is skeptical. At a sort of impromptu debate at the Kentucky Farm Bureau’s annual breakfast this summer, the senator followed Beshear to the microphone and challenged his optimistic forecast. “It’s going to bring $15 billion to our state. From where?” Paul demanded, his voice rising. “From the Federal Reserve, which is already sitting at minus-$17 trillion. It’s not free. There are consequences to this.”

Embracing Obamacare is not without political risk. Undaunted by the early success in Kentucky, Republicans plan to make the controversial program a major issue in 2014, when the GOP will be vying to take control of the state House for the first time in close to a century.

Beshear, who steps down in a little over two years, insisted he was not concerned about his legacy. But there is something he hopes to leave behind in Frankfort: His son, Andy, is running for attorney general in 2015.

“Obviously, his mom and I are excited about that, and we’re going to fully support him,” Beshear said, grinning. The healthcare issue, the governor suggested, won’t make a difference in the race for the state’s law enforcement chief one way or the other.

Often, because he understands the economic impact of certain decisions, he is able to lay out what the political consequences will be, while others offer thoughts that may seemingly make political sense to the conventional thinkers of the DC village, but since they are based on wrong-headed economic thinking inevitably turn out incorrectly.

Krugman lays out in detail what the problems are in insuring a population in which only some had health insurance. If you merely require coverage of pre-existing condition and the healthy uninsured do not sign up, as was the case in New York, premiums can skyrocket, as the healthy risk going uninsured. Or else you confront the situation where those with previous conditions can be reject for insurance. To these observations I would add the additional one of being locked into a job once a condition is diagnosed, even at pay levels far below what one could make elsewhere, because either the employee or a family member now has a preexisting condition.



Obamacare closes this gap with a three-part approach. First, community rating everywhere — no more exclusion based on pre-existing conditions. Second, the “mandate” — you must buy insurance even if you’re currently healthy. Third, subsidies to make insurance affordable for those with lower incomes.

This is, as Krugman notes, the approach taken in Massachusetts, where it has been successful and remains popular, even if the former governor responsible for the approach Krugman labels ""ObamaRomneyCare"" tried to distance himself from it in the most recent presidential campaign.

But the Bay State already had community rating and relatively low rates of uninsured (and for the latter I might argue that because of heavy unionization even non-union workplaces tended to offer good medical insurance as a means of dissuading employees from organizing)> A state like California, which lacked both, was supposed to demonstrate the problems with the approach taken in ACA.

Except as we all know, as the bids have come in, they have been lower than expected.

Krugman is aware that the plan ia complicated, because simpler options like Medicare for all were taken off the table. And there are states where Republicans have done all they can to block ACA, which will create more confusion - although we are seeing the oddities like that of Arizona, which Krugman does not mention, where the conservative Republican governor is vetoing all legislation until her conservative Republican legislature agrees to the expansion of Medicaid necessary for those uninsured too poor to afford to buy insurance on their own. Krugman notes, that

in states where Republicans have blocked Medicaid expansion, such unfortunates will be left out in the cold.

Still, here’s what it seems is about to happen: millions of Americans will suddenly gain health coverage, and millions more will feel much more secure knowing that such coverage is available if they lose their jobs or suffer other misfortunes. Only a relative handful of people will be hurt at all. And as contrasts emerge between the experience of states like California that are making the most of the new policy and that of states like Texas whose politicians are doing their best to undermine it, the sheer meanspiritedness of the Obamacare opponents will become ever more obvious.

Above, I talked about the perspicacity of Krugman's political analysis. In that regard, perhaps the most important paragraph in this column is its penultimate:Take Texas for example. A state that is no longer majority White, non-Hispanic. It is also a state where the percentage of uninsured is astronomical. If that population begins to realize what the Republicans are doing to them, and gets registered, is it possible that the state could flip as early as 2014? If the Democrats in the state, running for federal and state offices campaign on this issue, might it be possible to also make significant changes in the House delegation?

Let's recognize something. The insurance companies like ACA, because it expands their pool of customers. They do not care whether they are paid by tax deductible support from employers or by federal and state taxes for Medicaid - it is still revenue for them.

The meanspiritedness of Republicans, particular in the House, where they may well reject a compromise on immigration, will become even more of an issue when people see the difference the Affordable Care Act can make.

And then there is the challenge on the philosophy of government - or should we say in the case of Tea Party Republicans, the philosophy of a lack of government? It is this that Krugman addresses in his final paragraph:

So yes, it does look as if there’s an Obamacare shock coming: the shock of learning that a public program designed to help a lot of people can, strange to say, end up helping a lot of people — especially when government officials actually try to make it work.

CLip and save this column. Remember it when we see the real political impact of ACA in next year's elections.

Peace."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

It's not -- and that's why the rest of the developed world uses some variation of single-payer insurance to cover everyone for less than America spends to cover its elderly and poor alone.

Well, here's great proof from the Charlotte Observer that single-payer health insurance is indeed a mainstream -- dare I say conservative -- idea. Republican Hospital Executive Jack Bernard -- from pretty-damn-red Georgia -- expounds:



Single payer would drive down costs because Medicare (or a utility-like private single payer insurer) would have leverage to keep costs down. With no other game in town, providers would be forced to operate more efficiently. Drug companies would be pressured to give Americans the same drug pricing that is found elsewhere. Friedman pointed out that in multiple state studies (independently done by several groups), single payer turns out to save money. In his own studies, he has shown savings of around 20 percent for North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, and even more in Colorado and Maryland. According to Friedman, a national single payer system would produce enormous savings, $18.7 billion per year. Surely, at a time when wage earners are being faced with ever increasing premiums and higher deductibles, we should at least consider Medicare for all or a similar single payer system. The real question is whether either party is willing to stand up to the drug and insurance lobbies and do what is best for America.

Friedman pointed out that the most basic financial problem with U.S. health care is the for-profit insurance system. Insurance company profits have increased 250 percent in the last decade, Friedman said. The head of Cigna made a whopping $29 million in 2009 while health care premiums and increased deductibles are eating up more and more of workers’ wages. He further pointed out that the administrative cost of health care insurance is one of the major drivers of escalating health care costs from 1980 to 2005. According to Friedman, the administrative cost of private insurance will be $200 billion in 2013. In the U.S. billing costs run $83,975 per doctor per year versus only $22,205 in Ontario.

Well, there you have it -- common sense...from a Republican hospital executive. Hell has not frozen over, because this is simply a smart man stating inarguable facts. You know, like pointing out that paying health insurance CEOs multi-million dollar salaries for doing nothing of value is bad for health care:Single-payer health care is not socialist-communist-pinko-unicorn policy from the Left. It is a reasonable, middle-of-the-road approach to health care that is vastly more 'conservative' than a fully-socialized system (i.e. the NHS or America's VA).

Wouldn't it be tragic for our Democratic Party if it took a conservative third party to finally make it a reality..."

(CNN) —

For all the difficulties of the Affordable Care Act’s rollout, Americans are more patient than you might think: A new poll shows a majority expressing optimism that the problems are going to be ironed out.

Not only that, a majority continues to support the law or think it didn’t go far enough. Nevertheless, the conservatives rooting for its demise have been expressing not just vindication, but triumph. “We could be looking at the collapse of American liberalism,” said columnist Charles Krauthammer. “Liberalism is crumbling in front of our eyes,” echoed Michele Bachmann.

Yes indeed, a glitchy website and people moving from junk insurance to real insurance prove once and for all that government should have as little to do with health care as possible, and the entire liberal project lies in tatters.

That’s a little like proclaiming that your team will inevitably lose the World Series, then go bankrupt and disband because the other team scored a run in the first inning of Game 1. But the momentary political situation aside, conservatives still face a fundamental problem when they confront America’s health care system. Their ideology dictates only one solution to all health care problems, and that solution – less government, more free market – is exactly what gave us our dysfunctional health care system in the first place.

Let’s step back a moment to consider why we needed the Affordable Care Act and what it says about the health care market. The basic conservative position is that the more you let market forces operate, the better the outcome will be. “More markets” is the answer to everything: Let people buy insurance across state lines. Make it virtually impossible to sue for medical malpractice. Create more health savings accounts.

But where do you think the problems of America’s health care system came from? It wasn’t government that gave us nearly 50 million uninsured Americans and denials for pre-existing conditions. It wasn’t government that gave us the yearly and lifetime caps on insurance coverage that have sent so many people into bankruptcy when they’ve faced a serious illness or accident. It wasn’t government that gave us “rescissions,” where your insurance company cancels your policy if you get sick.

It wasn’t government that gave us a system in which the gap between what we spend and what we get is so enormous.

It was the free market.

The conservatives who profess to love markets so dearly seem unable to grasp that the market for health care isn’t like the market for shoes or cars. Other developed countries understand this. Every one of our peer nations has a system with more government control than ours, ranging from almost completely socialized systems like Great Britain’s to ones like those in Switzerland and the Netherlands, which resemble Obamacare but with tighter regulation.

We don’t have to wonder whether a health care system built on capitalist profit-seeking is more efficient and less expensive than those in which the government exercises more control. There has been a test running for decades, with many developed countries doing it one way, and the United States doing it the other. The results couldn’t be clearer.

On almost any criterion you can come up with, the government-controlled systems work better. They cover everyone, while spending far less than we do. Their health outcomes are as good or better than ours. A recent Bloomberg News analysis rated America’s as the world’s 46th most efficient health system, right above Serbia and right below Iran. Among the developed countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the U.S. ranks first (by a mile) in health spending per capita, but 26th in life expectancy.

There are some, however, who love the American health care system. American doctors make far higher salaries than their counterparts in other countries. American insurance companies do very well. As a recent New York Times investigation revealed, makers of devices like artificial hips mark up their prices double, triple, or even more when they sell to American hospitals as they do when they sell the same devices to European hospitals. The same is true of a hundred other devices and procedures. Why? Because in Europe, Japan, and other places with highly regulated health care, government rules keep the costs low.

In the American system, there are multiple points where companies do the rational thing: Extract as much money as possible from the system. That’s why an MRI costs three times as much in the U.S. as it does in France or Holland.

But people living under the oppression of those other governments’ systems must hate them, right? Wrong. The Commonwealth Fund recently released a study of health systems in 10 developed countries around the world which included a survey of satisfaction. America’s health system was the least popular, with only 25% of Americans saying it works well and the other 75% saying it should be fundamentally changed or completely rebuilt.

The most popular was the most socialized, Great Britain’s, with 63% saying it works well. You may remember that the opening ceremonies of the 2012 summer Olympics in London included a tribute to the National Health Service, so proud are Britons of their health system.

Despite all the problems created by America’s private health care market, we do have versions of big-government, socialized insurance. They’re called Medicare and Medicaid. They are far more efficient than private insurance, and Medicare recipients in particular love their coverage. It’s no accident that in every election, Republicans – who fought against the creation of Medicare and would love to privatize it – try to pretend to voters that they’re the program’s greatest defenders. The champions of free-market capitalism decide they can’t get elected without supporting a single-payer insurance program.

In all their glee about the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act, most Republicans are barely bothering to offer an alternative, other than a return to the way things used to be. It isn’t surprising, because to be brutally frank, they never much cared about the spectacular human suffering created by free-market health care.

For decades, liberals have been working to devise policy solutions and create the political conditions for health care reform that would achieve secure, universal coverage. On the other hand, in the face of millions who can’t get insurance because of pre-existing conditions and millions more who just can’t afford it, the conservative response was always, “Whatever.” The market spoke, and you lost. Too bad for you.

The Affordable Care Act can certainly be improved. But in health care – to paraphrase Ronald Reagan – the free market isn’t the answer to our problems. It is the problem.

Yet such is the trifecta with the Republican campaign to call attention to Obamacare’s young “victims.”

Republicans are obsessed with the supposed injustice being done to some healthy young people who will effectively subsidize their sicker elders when Obamacare’s individual mandate takes effect.

The crusaders are nothing if not convinced of the righteousness of their cause. “The whole scheme is enlisting young adults to overpay, so other people can have subsidies,” Dean Clancy, a vice president at FreedomWorks, told my Post colleague Sarah Kliff. “That unfairness reminded us of the military draft.”

Conservatives are therefore urging young Americans to resist. “I’m burning my Obamacare draft card,” runs one theatrical riff from a group called Young Americans for Liberty, “because I’m too busy paying student loans to pay for somebody else’s health insurance.” Republican policy advisors have urged the party to make such child abuse a big part of their anti-Obamacare message.

Sounds like a sexy argument, except for one thing. Republicans seem to have forgotten where most people aged 19 to 34 get health coverage: from their employer. And at virtually every company, young people pay the same premiums as employees who are much older than they are and who get more expensively sick than they do. In other words, the evil cross-subsidy Obamacare’s foes are storming the barricades to roll back already exists, at vastly larger scale, in corporate America.

These youngsters are already in chains! They’ve been put there by the private sector! And, inexplicably, young employees have entered this servitude of their own volition. (To extend the GOP’s draft analogy, it turns out there’s a voluntary army of health care masochists from sea to shining sea.)

How could injustice on this scale escape the GOP’s searing moral scrutiny?

After all, the president is only hoping thatabout 2.7 million young people will purchase coverage in the new exchanges. But 20 million Americans between the ages of 19 and 34 get coverage from their employer right now, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

If you’re keeping score, that makes employer-based health care’s cross-subsidy about eight times more evil than Obamacare’s.

How does it work? Compare a typical, strapping young employee of 28 to her broken- down 58-year-old colleague. These two employees have very different annual health expenses. Yet under the nefarious plot known as “group health insurance,” they basically pay the same premiums. It turns out every big company in America is essentially a socialized health care republic, in which the young subsidize the old, and the healthy subsidize the sick — all of whom pay the same premiums for the same plans.

Similar dynamics explain why, in the federal health-care plan, spry 42-year-olds like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz subsidize 79-year-old geezers like Chuck Grassley and Orrin Hatch.

Of course, most people in civilized nations know and accept that this is how insurance works. But Republicans nowadays aren’t like most people in civilized nations. They think Obamacare is a form of injustice akin to slavery. Which makes employer-provided health care slavery on steroids. Where’s the outrage? If conservatives were consistent and principled, they would devote far more time and effort to liberating 20 million young Americans from the socialism baked into employer-based insurance and look past the Obamacare exchanges as a puny sideshow.

But, alas, conservatives are not consistent and principled, save for their consistent determination to hurt the president politically.

It would be better if all those smart GOP thinkers devoted their talent and energy to the question of how they would expand coverage to the 50 million uninsured — but to raise that question is to enter the policy cul de sac in all its delicious irony.

Because the answer to that question is RomneyObamacare, the only sound way (as Republicans rightly taught us) that a country can move toward universal coverage using private health plans. The GOP could offer a tweaked version with slightly fewer regulations. Or structure it to offer universal catastrophic coverage to save money. But if Republicans were serious, they’d offer the same basic reform architecture.

So Republicans choose not to be serious. And it shows.

In the end, the GOP’s Obamacare youth hoax shows how silly a party can look when a political focus on one corner of a policy leads it to latch on to “insights” that utterly miss the big picture. It’s a reminder, if we needed another, of how close the connection can be between ideology and idiocy.

Democrats on Capitol Hill said they were unhappy with the performance of the Obamacare website, which has been plagued with problems since its debut Oct. 1. Even the president’s longtime campaign guru, David Axelrod, was critical of the administration’s handling of the issue.

“This has been shrouded in a little bit of mystery. I don’t quite understand why that is,” Axelrod said in an MSNBC interview this week. He added that if he were at the White House, he would be “very, very tough on the people who are responsible.”

Even those who support the new healthcare law — and its promise of providing affordable insurance coverage to millions of Americans — suggested that aspects of it may need to be postponed unless changes can be put into place quickly. Some were calling on Obama to hold people accountable for the mistakes.

“Somebody’s got to man up here — get rid of these people,” said Rep. Rick Nolan (D-Minn.), who stopped short of calling for the ouster of any specific administration official or contractor but characterized the president’s response to the rollout as “weak.”

“There are people like myself who supported the Affordable Care Act, but I’m not oblivious to the fact that this layout has done harm and damage to the brand,” Nolan said.

Democratic Party leaders also suggested that heads should roll, even while maintaining strong support for Obamacare.

“I absolutely believe that somebody should be held accountable,” said Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), the No. 4 Democrat in the House.

Becerra called website problems disturbing, but said, “I think it’s even more disturbing when individuals intentionally work against the American people and the rights that they have now secured to access quality, affordable healthcare.”

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, in an interview on CNN late Tuesday, would not say whether she and the president had discussed the possibility of her stepping down.

“I think my job is to get this fully implemented and to get the website working right,” she said. “And that’s really what I’m focused on.”

At the moment, the White House is not contemplating firing anyone, aides to the president say. Obama is more interested in fixing the problem than in assigning blame, they said.

Frustration among Democrats marked a turning point as the administration scrambled to subdue the mounting anxiety over Obama’s signature achievement.

After years of withstanding Republican efforts to stop Obamacare, the administration now must act quickly to quell concerns from its Democratic partners.

It appears that if improvements aren’t made, several Democratic lawmakers are ready to consider a delay or adjustment in the law’s provisions that all Americans carry insurance by Jan. 1 or face a fine. That idea could gain momentum if Americans are unable to easily use the website to purchase policies soon. Americans can also sign up by phone or in person at certain centers, and those methods have had a smoother debut.

PHOTOS: Team Obama, where are they now?

“I don’t know that the answer is to delay the mandate; the answer may be to delay the penalties,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.).

Seeking to tamp down growing concerns, administration officials fanned out on the airwaves and on Capitol Hill to discuss efforts underway to improve the website.

Top officials, including Sebelius, met with health insurance executives from more than a dozen companies and organizations at the White House as part of Obama’s promised “tech surge” to address the issues.

The White House was running two full-scale operations: one to fix the problems and another to reassure consumers and supporters that things will get better.

In the CNN interview, Sebelius tried to deflect criticism from the president, telling interviewer Sanjay Gupta that Obama did not know about the problems with the website before its launch.

But Sebelius was vague about how much other administration officials knew about the site’s readiness before it went live. Problems “became clear fairly early on, the first couple of days,” she said.

Since the rollout of https://www.healthcare.gov this month, the website has been beset with mishaps.

The online marketplace is intended to link uninsured Americans to affordable private insurance plans. But users have had trouble signing on, getting accurate cost estimates and completing enrollment.

Officials have acknowledged that the high volume of visitors — 19 million, Sebelius said — only partly explained the shortcomings. The Health and Human Services Department has not released the number of people who have successfully enrolled in insurance plans.

Republicans, meanwhile, have seized on the glitches as another reason that Obamacare should be scrapped.

In Congress, Republicans have tried repeatedly, and unsuccessfully, to stop the healthcare law, including efforts that recently led to the 16-day federal government shutdown.

“The rollout of Obamacare is nothing short of a debacle and the American people are now fearful of their healthcare,” said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). “I mean, they’re downright scared about what’s going to happen with their healthcare next year.”

Republicans are bringing the website’s contractors before an oversight committee Thursday to find out what went wrong. They also want to hear from Sebelius, who has agreed to testify next week after declining to appear at this week’s hearing.

A top Obama economic advisor, Jeffrey Zients, was at work after being recruited two days ago to help fix the problems. White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to say how long it would take to have the system running smoothly.

“Each day we’re going to make some progress,” Carney said.

At the same time, Americans’ approval of the Affordable Care Act rose slightly in October, to 45%, according to polling from Gallup. That was up from 41% in August.

But what kind of disaster was it? Was it a failure of management, messing up the initial implementation of a fundamentally sound policy? Or was it a demonstration that the Affordable Care Act is inherently unworkable?

We know what each side of the partisan divide wants you to believe. The Obama administration is telling the public that everything will eventually be fixed, and urging Congressional Democrats to keep their nerve. Republicans, on the other hand, are declaring the program an irredeemable failure, which must be scrapped and replaced with ... well, they don’t really want to replace it with anything.

At a time like this, you really want a controlled experiment. What would happen if we unveiled a program that looked like Obamacare, in a place that looked like America, but with competent project management that produced a working website?

Well, your wish is granted. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you California.

Now, California isn’t the only place where Obamacare is looking pretty good. A number of states that are running their own online health exchanges instead of relying on HealthCare.gov are doing well. Kentucky’s Kynect is a huge success; so is Access Health CT in Connecticut. New York is doing O.K. And we shouldn’t forget that Massachusetts has had an Obamacare-like program since 2006, put into effect by a guy named Mitt Romney."

As a result, it has had more success enrolling people than the disastrous federal exchange. Still, Colorado’s relative “success” reveals a deeper problem with the new health care entitlement. So far, just 226 people have enrolled for private health insurance. At the same time, 25,000 Coloradans will be newly eligible for Medicaid benefits in January.

Since the opening of the exchange in Colorado, 16,000 residents have used the system to enroll in the newly expanded Medicaid program. Another 9,000 adults without children were on waiting lists for the program. These individuals will also gain new Medicaid coverage next year.

Medicaid, a shared federal-state health care entitlement, reimburses health care providers the least amount. Providers typically receive around 18 cents on each dollar billed. Medicare, the federal health program for seniors, pays 23 cents. Private insurers reimburse providers around 38 cents for each dollar billed.

Pushing more Americans into the system through Medicaid not only increases the demand for health care services, but reduces at the margin the funds available to maintain that system. Either those with private insurance will have to bear a larger burden funding the system or the system will contract so that health care services are difficult to receive.

Even if a magical pot of money were found to fund these services, it isn’t clear that having Medicaid coverage actually helps anyone. As my former colleague Nick Gillespie recently pointed out, a respected study out of Oregon found no difference in health outcomes from those on Medicaid and those uninsured.

The problems with ObamaCare and future funding are not just confined to Medicaid, which is the dominant vehicle to provide new health coverage. Some percentage of the 226 Coloradans who have enrolled for private coverage will get federal subsidies to help purchase their insurance. The US Treasury, for the first time, will send premium payments to insurance companies to cover these subsidies. Medicaid and Medicare are already the fastest growing segments of the federal budget. These two programs, as well as the new health insurance subsidies, will likely soon consume all federal revenue.

Math will prove to be the biggest obstacle to ObamaCare."

What are his constituents going to think when they realize he's been lying to them about Obamacare?

LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A middle-aged man in a red golf shirt shuffles up to a small folding table with gold trim, in a booth adorned with a flotilla of helium balloons, where government workers at the Kentucky State Fair are hawking the virtues of Kynect, the state’s health benefit exchange established by Obamacare. The man is impressed. ""This beats Obamacare I hope,"" he mutters to one of the workers. ""Do I burst his bubble?"" wonders Reina Diaz-Dempsey, overseeing the operation. She doesn't. If he signs up, it's a win-win, whether he knows he's been ensnared by Obamacare or not.

The polling has been around for a while: if you ask people about the various provisions of Obamacare, they love it; if you ask them about Obamacare, they hate it. Now that the program is about to kick off, that's being confirmed on the ground . In Kentucky.That's absolutely why Republicans are frantic to try to find a way to stop Obamacare from starting. As the message about its benefits get out, as people sign up and start receiving those benefits, they're going to forget all about being scared of it and they're going to like it.

But it's not a slam-dunk, and the public education effort is key because Republican lies have taken hold with plenty of people. Erin Hoven, an outreach worker with Kentucky Voices for Health, and her efforts to do outreach and education on Obamacare faces those lies—repeated regularly by both of the state's Republican senators, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul—at every turn.



A woman Hoben had been working with in Hazard called her recently to tell her that the tea party had urged her not to enroll because the exchange wasn’t happening. [Hoben] went door to door with a free lunch program in Laurel County. She met a mother in a trailer, she recalls, who believed she was going to jail if she didn't sign up for insurance. What startled Hoben was that the mother seemed to just erroneously accept the potential jail time as a fact of life. ""I quickly explained to her that was not going to happen,"" Hoben says.

Will these people believe it when Hoben or others tell them that none of this stuff is true? Not until they see the lies be disproved and they see it start working. That gives Republicans in the states one more chance to defeat Obamacare: sabotage it at the state level in its implementation, like in the states where the new health care navigators , community workers hired under the law to help people navigate the new system, are being hindered by onerous new requirements and regulations.

Because the worst thing in the world for Republicans is having more people get affordable health care."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/06/obamacare-virginia-governor_n_4229062.html,2013-11-06 00:00:00,"['Senior Political Correspondent', 'Yahoo']",Scant Evidence That Obamacare Actually Moved Numbers In Virginia Governor's Race,"WASHINGTON –- Two weeks before Virginia's gubernatorial election Tuesday, Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli's pollster e-mailed his senior campaign advisers with the latest polling results. They weren't good.



""There is nothing in the data that suggests it's not all that bad,"" pollster Glen Bolger wrote. ""It's pretty bad.""



Cuccinelli was down 9 percentage-points among voters labeled ""10's"" by the campaign because they were considered most likely to vote, trailing Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe 38 percent to 47 percent. Cuccinelli was also down 33 percent to 44 percent among all the voters surveyed, with 10 percent for Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis.



Public polling was about the same. The HuffPost Pollster average on Oct. 18 gave McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, an 8.5-point lead, 45.5 to 37 percent. Bolger informed the Cuccinelli brain trust that the numbers were terrible for a few reasons: ""We are being badly outspent, and the shutdown/end game has not been successful at revving up Republicans OR deflating Democrats.""



The claim by Bolger and by many Republicans now, in the wake of a much narrower than expected, 2.5-point McAuliffe win on Tuesday, is that the numbers closed in in the last two weeks as Cuccinelli honed in on Obamacare. He stressed his early opposition to the law in 2010 as attorney general, just as the law kicked in, suffering massive implementation problems.



The takeaway, then, for some, is that Obamacare became a millstone that almost dragged McAuliffe from a sure victory to an epic collapse.



""Despite being outspent by an unprecedented $15 million, this race came down to the wire because of Obamacare,"" Cuccinelli said in his concession speech Tuesday night.



The problem is, there's not much evidence for this.

Closer to Election Day, on Nov. 1, Cuccinelli campaign manager Chris LaCivita e-mailed supporters and claimed that among the ""10's,"" McAuliffe had just a 1-point lead. This wasn't from a poll done by the campaign, however. Bolger told HuffPost on Wednesday that the Oct. 18 poll was the last one the campaign conducted. ""Had no more money,"" he wrote in an e-mail. (LaCivita did not respond to an e-mail asking what he had based his Nov. 1 claim on.)



In addition, the public polling itself was not as volatile as people thought. In mid-July, McAuliffe began opening a lead, and the HuffPost/Pollster average of the public polling showed that advantage at around 5 points for most of August and September, and at 7 points in October, all the way up to Election Day. A cluster of polls showing McAuliffe up by double digits in mid- to late October, followed by two polls showing him up only four points and two points, respectively, created the impression of a tightening race.



Late last week, in a briefing with reporters, McAuliffe's pollster said that their internal polling had showed the race steady for a month.



""Our margin both in the head-to-head and in the three-way race are exactly what they were a month ago,"" Geoff Garin, the Democratic pollster, said. Garin didn't say then what the margin was, but in a phone conversation the same day he told HuffPost's Mark Blumenthal that it was 4 points. The day after the election, Garin said, ""Terry’s lead from mid-summer on was always in the 2-4 range.""



Voter modeling conducted for McAuliffe by a group of former Obama campaign analytics experts gave McAuliffe a 2-point lead. McAuliffe's team believes they drove up Cuccinelli's negatives over the summer with attack ads, and the race never moved from there. McAuliffe communications director Brennan Bilberry said Wednesday that the Cuccinelli number showing the Republican trailing by 11 in mid-October was ""lunacy.""



Here's why the Democrats might be right, and why the Republican theory that Obamacare gave Cuccinelli momentum may be wrong: the Democrats continue to hold a data advantage over Republicans. The quality of their voter information is better, but perhaps more importantly, there is a greater cultural willingness among Democratic pollsters and campaigns to do surveys and voter targeting based on enhanced voter files.

And so McAuliffe’s polling, predictive modeling and voter targeting was, quite likely, vastly superior to Cuccinelli's and to the public polling. If that is the case, it is a repeat of what happened in 2012, when Mitt Romney's pollsters, and the public pollsters, were outclassed by the Obama machine and its deadly combination of rigorous quantitative analysis and a vast army of ground volunteers vacuuming up large quantities of raw data and feeding it back to headquarters.



Because of the 2012 election and the massive amount of resources thrown into Virginia by President Obama's reelection campaign, the Democrats said they had better data on which to base their predictive models for who was going to vote, who they were going to vote for and who was open to being persuaded.



""We just have richer data. We've been collecting more data and we've been using the same file more consistently for the past few years,"" McAuliffe campaign manager Robby Mook said last week.



This data edge drove the McAuliffe campaign's decisions on how to conduct its polling, which then dictated the results it got. It also drove the campaign's decisions on how to allocate ground-game resources, and early voting effort, as well as TV ad strategy.



If Republicans had hard data showing them closing to within a point or two, wouldn't that have drawn money for more ads into the race in the last few days? The fact that this didn't happen suggests the GOP was flying blind in Virginia, and that they are still struggling to catch up to Democrats in the realm of data-driven campaigns.



Although Republicans have promised that they are going to leapfrog the Democrats in running data-centric campaigns, the bottom line is they are trying to make up ground that has been lost over several years, which will take time to rectify.



""The problem is not that this stuff takes a ton of money to figure out once you have the data. The problem is the gathering of the data is so fucking labor intensive and requires so much work,"" said one Republican operative. ""The richer the data you have, the better targeting you can do.""



That explains why the Republican National Committee dedicated its resources in Virginia to building out a ground operation. They spent $3 million on the race, but an RNC official acknowledged that their efforts were also “building the party’s presence in Virginia.”



“We went into this race working with the campaigns about what they needed to win based on their plans. We committed to funding/running the ground games and minority engagement –- that’s what we did,” the RNC official said.



The residue of the 2012 Obama campaign also helped McAuliffe with his ground game. The Democrat claimed to have 13,513 volunteers working for the campaign in the last four days, and said his campaign knocked on over 2 million doors and made 2 million phone calls. Cuccinelli said he doubted these numbers, but neither his campaign nor the RNC ever disclosed their own ground-game numbers, despite repeated requests before and after Election Day.

None of this is to say that Obamacare is not a political problem for Democrats, and could play a big role in the 2014 midterms.

“They have to get it fixed and they have to get it fixed fast,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost’s Sam Stein.

But it’s not clear that in Virginia, Obamacare played the role some Republicans say it did.

How do we know?,"Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett has lately been getting credit in the political press for being one of those Republican governors coming around on the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Advocates for the underprivileged can’t understand why.

They’re right to wonder. Corbett’s “Healthy Pennsylvania” plan, which was released for public comment this week, is a sham. It would reduce health benefits for many of his neediest citizens and impose punitive conditions on their coverage. It requires waiver approval from the federal government that’s almost certain to be refused, because some of its provisions are in flagrant violation of federal law. And even if it were approved, Corbett waited so long to put his plan together that it probably couldn’t be implemented until 2015. In the meantime, 500,000 of his citizens will be medically uncovered.

“He’s being very disingenuous,” says Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. “He knows a lot of this proposal is not approvable” under federal law.

Corbett’s proposal shows that many Republicans still aren’t done posturing with their citizens’ lives, even as some have done the right thing--among them Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Jan Brewer of Arizona. Some GOP governors, like Rick Perry of Texas and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, seem determined to take their neediest citizens all the way down--they’re not budging on their refusal to expand Medicaid coverage.

Corbett wants to have it both ways. He intends to masquerade as a feeling governor intent on bringing healthcare to the masses at practical cost. But beneath the fancy dress lies a cynical politician who knows his plan isn’t practical. If it gets rejected he’ll blame the Obama administration. “We tried,” he’ll say. “But they blocked us.” Don’t be taken in.

The plan requires premiums to be paid by Medicaid enrollees with monthly incomes as low as $479, at which level the premiums would be $13 a month. Think that’s not too bad? Try living on that monthly income and scraping together a single extra dollar. What’s worse is that Corbett’s plan would throw people off the coverage rolls for three months if they miss a single premium payment. The second miss gets them barred for six months and the third for nine months.

This punitive provision belongs in the dictionary next to the term “counterproductive.” If your goal is to enroll people in a health program, the idea is to lower barriers to entry, not raise them. The Medicaid population, by definition, is one with spotty income at best. The likelihood that they might miss a premium payment is high. The last thing they need is for their government to stack the deck against their continuing access to healthcare.

Corbett’s administration describes this provision in its waiver application designed “to instill a sense of personal responsibility into the program and reinforce incentives for healthier behaviors.” If there’s a depiction of the poor that drips more with contempt and arrogance than that, I’m not sure I want to hear it.

Corbett would also require that adults in the program sign up for “work search.” This is another punitive feature barred by federal law; healthcare programs are not employment programs, and mixing them is likely to harm both efforts. Corbett argues that working people are healthier people, so it’s all to the good. But that’s the sort of facile claim that dishonest politicians make.

“He has the correlation backwards,” Alker says. “Healthcare helps address the medical problems that may be keeping people from working. Shutting people from coverage is not a smart way to impose health.” Conditioning healthcare on efforts to find work is more likely to condemn the target population to a cycle of illness and joblessness. It sounds good, but only if you’re tone deaf.

Some analysts in Pennsylvania had Corbett’s number on this plan from the very start. As long ago as September, the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center saw the plan as a device to impose “significant reductions to the healthcare program that has served the state’s most vulnerable citizens for more than 50 years.”

As enacted under the Affordable Care Act, the expansion of Medicaid was clear and simple. Raise the income eligibility limits, which varied by state) to 138% of the poverty line and add populations otherwise uncovered, including poor single adults, and the federal government would cover 100% of the increased cost for three years, and 90% or more after that, through 2022.

This is obviously a bargain, as is evident to anyone not still playing with his toes. Only the most rock-ribbed ideologues have turned it down, but they’re in control of 25 states. As we’ve reported before, those states are giving up a net $40 billion a year in federal aid. Corbett wants to be considered a hero for finding a middle way, but he knows in his heart that he’s found no way.

An eradication effort was launched that included agents going door to door to warn people about standing water. But soon the mosquito was found in Clovis and Fowler. It turned up in August in the Bay Area’s San Mateo County, and this week in Fresno. Officials are spraying insecticide around infected homes.

“This affects all of California,” Irby said. “It requires everyone’s help: Turn over plant saucers, wash out dog bowls, remember this mosquito can lay eggs even in the cracks of cement if water is left there for a couple of days.” The bug can even lay eggs in flowering plants such as bromeliads.

None of the mosquitoes have been found in the Los Angeles area. Across California, vector control agents constantly trap mosquitoes to look for any invasive species.

Because of a recent infestation of the Asian Tiger mosquito in Southern California, agencies were already monitoring more traps, said Mark Daniel, director of operations for the Greater Los Angeles County Vector Control District.

“There is no evidence of aegypti in Los Angeles. But you can never say with 100% certainty,” he said. “Our brother and sister agencies in the Central Valley are being very aggressive and we’re on high alert.”

So far, none of the trapped mosquitoes have carried disease. The California Department of Public Health reported 200 cases of dengue fever since 2010, all contracted out of the country.

“Presently, dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya do not occur within California,” Dr. Gilberto Chavez, deputy director of the California Department of Public Health’s Center for Infectious Disease, said in an email. “There is presently no risk of these diseases being acquired locally and traveling within the state.”

But the state is warning the medical community to be on the lookout for cases.

Yellow fever is a virus that causes fever, chills, nausea, headache and a prominent backache. Extreme cases cause jaundice, and can be deadly. Dengue causes head and muscle aches, a rash similar to measles and can also kill. Chikungunya is characterized by high fever, rash and months of joint pain.

It is not clear where the bugs are coming from.

The first detections were in affluent neighborhoods. Vector Control agents asked people whether they’d traveled recently or bought plants. Many had. But agents have found no mosquitoes at local nurseries or big box stores and few shared travel destinations, officials said. So far, they’ve found nothing in common among the infected areas.

As they searched for clues, officials launched a public awareness campaign, including posters at the Big Fresno Fair.

“A lady read the flyer and she remembered earlier thinking, ‘Hmm, there are mosquitoes biting during the day. That’s different’ and noticing bites on her baby,” Phillips said. “She went home, trapped a mosquito and called us.”

Phillips was on a Department of Public Health conference call about abatement efforts when a biologist identified the mosquito from the woman’s house as Aedes aegypti.

He sent a photo of the brown bug with white markings to the other 14 people on the call. There was silence.

“When the aegypti was in Madera there was concern, then Clovis — more concern, then it got to Fowler and it was ‘Criminy!’” Phillips said. “But, now Fresno. It’s got some people questioning whether we can stop it.”

The hope is that winter temperatures will freeze the eggs and eradicate the bugs. But people are often told to bring sensitive plants indoors during a freeze. The mosquito lays eggs just above the water line in containers. After the eggs dry out, they can still survive when more water is added, experts said.

The mosquito has been in some parts of the United States for centuries, arriving on New World ships from Africa. It is present in Florida, Texas and Arizona. But this is believed to be the first time it has reached California.

“We don’t want it here,” Phillips said. “But it’s going to take a heck of a lot to stop it.”

Consumer advocates, doctors groups and many health industry leaders remain committed to helping the law succeed. Most believe in its goals of expanding health coverage and restructuring the medical system to improve quality and control costs. Few see any viable alternatives.

But even as President Obama launched another attempt last week to rally Americans behind the law, many of his allies believe his administration is no better prepared for the inevitable challenges of moving millions of people into new health plans than it was for the rollout of the federal HealthCare.gov website.

“The refrain we most often hear is: ‘Where is the administration?’” said M. Ryan Barker, vice president of the Missouri Foundation for Health, which has been working for nearly four years to help smooth implementation of the law in the state. “It is very frustrating.”

Like many of the law’s backers, foundation leaders have decided they and their local partners must take responsibility for educating consumers about their new coverage and responding to questions and complaints because the Obama administration has shown little ability to do it.

Many physician groups, hospitals and insurers have come to the same conclusion.

“I have never seen medical providers more dismissive of a White House,” said one longtime healthcare lobbyist, who asked not to be identified in speaking so frankly about the president’s leadership.

A health industry chief executive who supports the law bemoaned the Obama administration’s lack of preparation for even foreseeable complications, such as the recent cancellations of millions of health insurance plans that don’t meet the law’s new standards. “There just doesn’t seem to be much strategic thinking,” he said.

White House officials acknowledge the disastrous debut of HealthCare.gov has made it difficult to highlight the law’s benefits and respond to criticisms. But they say they are now prepared for a sustained campaign through next year, building on their work with advocates nationwide to enroll people in health coverage.

David Simas, senior advisor to the president on healthcare, said this new sales effort will not only showcase people who are benefiting from the law, but also compare the new protections with the shortcomings of the prior system, which left millions of Americans without health coverage.

Starting in 2014, health plans will be prohibited from turning away sick customers and will have to offer a basic set of benefits, including coverage of prescription drugs, hospitalizations and preventive care.

“Now, we can begin to tell a story,” Simas said. “We just have to execute. Period.... That’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to execute on that day after day after day after day.”

The White House last week publicized some of its efforts to protect the law from more political trouble. The administration is distributing talking points to Democrats and other allies, as well as hosting daily calls with advocates and key lawmakers to coordinate messages and responses to critics, an official said. And a former White House liaison to Capitol Hill who worked to pass the law, Phil Schiliro, will return temporarily to coordinate strategy with congressional Democrats.

Several administration allies in Washington said they are hopeful this campaign may be more successful.

“I don’t want to be Pollyannaish about this, having gone through great difficulties in the past, but I feel better than I’ve felt in months,” said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and a former administration official.

Many advocates and industry leaders who support the Affordable Care Act also believe the law’s benefits will become clearer to Americans as more experience the security of health coverage, especially if they are ill.

“A lot of people are going to be pleasantly surprised by how good the coverage is,” said Daniel Zingale, senior vice president of the nonprofit California Endowment, which has committed more than $200 million to help implement the law in the state.

Indeed, despite the problems with the launch of HealthCare.gov, the online insurance marketplace for consumers in 36 states, there has been strong interest, with hundreds of thousands of people a day viewing the federal site and similar state sites.

But experts acknowledge public appreciation will take time. “We are in the beginning of a very long-term transition in the nation’s healthcare system,” said Dan Mendelson, chief executive of Avalere Health, a Washington-based consulting firm.

In the interim, many supporters worry that more bumps in the law’s implementation could further undermine public confidence, especially without a sustained, strategic plan from the Obama administration.

“This is going to be a battle every step of the way,” said one Democratic official involved in the new messaging push who asked not to be identified in order to candidly discuss the work of White House officials. “It’s unclear whether or not they realize that this is not a three-week PR campaign.... There’s a long list of issues, serious issues that are going to come up as part of implementation, where Republicans are going to try to score political points or derail the law. And we have to be ready.”

Many advocates are particularly worried that consumers who are confused or angered about their new insurance could turn their frustrations on the law.

Some patients are likely to find that their doctors cannot verify their coverage because their applications weren’t processed accurately by the troubled enrollment system.

In October and November, before repairs were made to the website, as many as a quarter of insurance sign-ups had errors. The administration said last week that the rate is about 1 in 10. Administration officials say they are contacting consumers and telling them to confirm their enrollment with their insurer.

Advocates worry that other headaches await patients trying to use health insurance for the first time.

Some will discover the doctor they want to see is not in their network, an issue Republicans have already started to cite in their efforts to discredit Obamacare.

Others will find that a preferred prescription drug is not covered by their health plan.

For others, the high deductibles in many plans may come as a shock. Some who have never had insurance may not realize that their monthly premiums will not cover many of their medical expenses.

“A lot of patients are not going to be real happy,” said Tom Banning, chief executive of the Texas Academy of Family Physicians.

Molly Firth, public policy director at Community Health Network of Washington, which provides health coverage to poor Washington state residents, said she and others are concerned that low-income patients may select health plans with low monthly premiums, saddling themselves with high out-of-pocket costs.

More challenges could emerge as insurers decide which plans to offer in 2015 and how much they will cost. Some rates, which will start becoming public over the summer, may increase substantially.

The White House says it is anticipating these and other concerns, but declined to offer many details on how it would address them. Officials said HealthCare.gov had been updated to improve consumer education on such issues as deductibles and prescriptions. The so-called doc shock was the subject of talking points recently sent to lawmakers and allied groups. The White House also plans to assemble state data on the impact of the law to distribute to local officials.

Outside Washington, however, few are waiting for the White House.

“For us, it’s turned from a frustration to a motivation,” said Baker, the Missouri Foundation for Health vice president. “We’ve decided, ‘Let’s just do it.’”

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/13/trumka-calls-for-obamacare-concessions-for-unions-after-white-house-meeting/,2013-09-13 00:00:00,[],White House backs off ObamaCare deal for unions,"The Obama administration on Friday appeared to rule out giving unions a special deal to offer their workers extra ObamaCare subsidies, but left the door open to other changes after a private White House meeting with labor leaders who are concerned over the law.

Earlier in the day, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka had urged the White House to act within a week to address labor unions’ concerns over ObamaCare.

The sit-down with President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden came amid concerns from Republicans that Obama might be preparing to offer the unions a special deal to assuage their concerns.

But on Friday night, the White House said the Treasury Department had issued a letter ""making clear that it does not see a legal way for individuals in multi-employer group health plans to receive individual market tax credits as well as the favorable tax treatment associated with employer-provided health insurance at the same time.""

However, the White House did not specify exactly what it might do instead, if anything. It said only it would work with various plans to create ""new, high-quality, affordable options"" for everyone.

Later, spokesmen for ranking House member Orrin Hatch of Utah and Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp of Michigan issued a joint statement saying,“There has been far too much special treatment for politically-favored friends of ObamaCare. But when it comes to employers and taxpayers picking up the health care tab for labor unions – it appears that is a price that is simply too high.

""Perhaps even this Administration recognizes that there are limits to them stretching the law to reward their friends.”

The AFL-CIO just passed a resolution blasting ObamaCare as “highly disruptive,” and the administration has been trying to convince the unions to lower the volume on their complaints about the law’s implementation.

The Republican National Committee asked Friday whether the president would “cave” to the unions.

Trumka was coy after emerging from the meeting with Obama and Biden.

He called the meeting a ""problem-solving session,"" but declined to specify exactly what type of fixes were discussed.

“We’re going to try to get it done in the next week,” he said. Asked if that meant a new regulation or Congress-approved law, he said: “A solution.”

The meeting comes days after the AFL-CIO approved a resolution warning the law would drive up the cost of union-sponsored health plans and encourage some employers to drop coverage.

Unions want members to be eligible for the same federal subsidies available to low-income workers in the new health exchanges. The White House has resisted that remedy, saying the law doesn't allow it.

Capitol Hill Republicans, though, are now pursuing legislation that would prevent the administration from offering extra subsidies to union workers.

Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., on Monday introduced the ""Union Bailout Prevention Act,"" which would stop the granting of subsidies to offset premium costs for the multi-employer plans held by many union members. Separately, the House voted on Thursday to stop all subsidies until the administration launches a system to verify recipients are eligible.

Unions argue that workers without additional subsidies will switch to less-expensive, major-insurer plans, creating a withering effect on the so-called Taft-Hartley plans.

Thune and others argue the plans are already government-subsidized and the workers’ contributions are already tax-exempt.

“A deal such as this by the administration for the union would be illegal,” Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch and Michigan Rep. Dave Camp said in a letter Tuesday to the Treasury Department. “Giving union workers exchange subsidies in addition to the income-tax exclusion would be double dipping.”

USA TODAY

An aging nation that's living longer but with growing rates of obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases points to an emerging health care crisis, says a report out Tuesday that analyzes seniors' health status state-by-state.

Just two years ago, the first Baby Boomers turned 65, setting into motion a ""tremendous demographic shift in the U.S. population,"" said physician Rhonda Randall, a senior adviser to the not-for-profit United Health Foundation, which released America's Health Rankings Senior Report Tuesday.

The report focuses on 34 measures of senior health, including physical inactivity, obesity, self-reported health status, poverty, drug coverage, hospital re-admission rates and flu vaccinations. The data analyzed is from more than a dozen government agencies and private research groups.

As generations move into retirement, they become greater consumers of health care, Randall said. But those turning 65 today ""are more likely to live longer than their parents and grandparents, and much more likely to live sicker for a longer period of time,"" she said.

Among signs of impending challenges the report cites:

• 1 in 8 Americans (13% or 40.3 million) are 65 or older, and that is projected to grow to 1 in 5 (19.3%, or 72.1) in 2030, the year all members of the Baby Boomer generation will have turned 65, according to Census data. By 2050, seniors will make up 25% of the population. Those 85 and older are projected to increase from 5.8 million in 2010 to 8.7 million in 2030.

• Nearly 8 in 10 seniors are living with at least one chronic health condition; 50% have two or more, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates. About 25% of older Americans are obese; 20% have been diagnosed with diabetes; more than 70% have heart disease; nearly 60% have arthritis, a leading cause of disability.

• Adults 65 and older spend nearly twice as much as those 45 to 64 on health care each year; they spend three to five times more than all adults younger than 65, according to CDC.

If not addressed, the increased burden of chronic disease will not only have severe economic consequences but affect older adults' overall well-being, Randall said. ""This is a really important time in our nation's history for us to take a look at this demographic change and the health and behavior outcomes for this population. If we don't measure it, we won't know what to do about it.""

The report offers ""an important set of messages ... for personal focus, family and community focus, and a heads-up to the providers, and a real heads-up to policy makers,"" said Jennie Chin Hansen, CEO of the American Geriatrics Society and author of one of several commentaries in the report.

Some of the trends are ""very cautionary,"" Hansen added. They highlight ""that we really do have to be thoughtful, strategic and intentional if we are going to insure that people's health and well-being is going to be made better. There's stuff we know, but now there's stuff we have to do. ""

Overall, Minnesota tops the list in senior health, followed by Vermont (2), New Hampshire (3), Massachusetts (4) and Iowa (5).

At the bottom: Mississippi (50), Oklahoma (49), Louisiana (48), West Virginia (47) and Arkansas (46).

Minnesota's top ranking reflects a combination of factors, including a large number of seniors who report being in very good or excellent health, high rates of creditable drug coverage, relatively high availability of home health care workers, as well as a low rate of seniors at risk of going hungry and a low rate of hospitalization for hip fractures, according to the study.

But it notes challenges for Minnesota, as well, including a high percentage of chronic drinking, a low percentage of senior residents with a dedicated health care provider, and low per-person expenditures by the state to assist older adults in poverty.

In bottom-ranked Mississippi, a high percentage of seniors live in poverty and are at risk of going hungry; there is a high rate of premature death; a low percentage of seniors report very good or excellent health and a low rate report annual dental visits. But Mississippi scored well for a low prevalence of chronic drinking and a high rate of flu vaccination.

The senior population in Mississippi is predicted to grow 46% between 2015 and 2030. In Minnesota, the population is expected to grow 54%. Arizona tops that category with an expected increase of 101%, followed by Nevada (89%), Florida (88%), Alaska (70%) and Texas (67%).

Among other trends noted in the report:

• Alaska (21%) has the lowest percentage of seniors with multiple chronic health conditions, followed by Wyoming (22%) and Montana (23%). The highest percentages are in Florida (44%), New Jersey (43%) and Delaware (40%).

• Nationally, 30% of seniors in fair or better health report doing no physical activity or exercise other than their regular job in the last 30 days.

—

—

The president is lying though omission there. The argument that health care costs aren’t as high as the worst nightmare scenarios predicted does not mean costs are going down, even though that is what Obama is trying to hustle people into believing. The fact is, is that while pushing his health care plan, Obama promised premiums would go down for a family of four by at least $2400 per year. The reality, however, is that costs will increase by almost two times that amount.

For example, while Obama pointed to a reduction in premiums in New York state, state officials in Ohio say the average premium proposal for individual coverage next year is up 88 percent from this year’s average price as reported by the Society of Actuaries. In Maryland, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield proposed a 25 percent increase in premiums next year, after first seeking a 50 percent increase. Final rates haven’t been determined in either state.

The higher rates, supporters say, buy a health insurance system that guarantees access to coverage for everyone and improves benefits, such as requiring insurers to cover older children and outlawing lifetime spending limits on claims.

Obama did a good job injecting a little energy into the 100th time he’s given a speech that has already failed 99 times. But attacking Fox News by name is just another example of the smallness of a man who seems to delight in making his office smaller in the eyes of the country and his country smaller in the eyes of the world.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) in his campaign to defund Obamacare.

“Right now in the Senate, Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn are actively whipping Senators to shut down debate on the House continuing resolution so that Harry Reid can gut it with just 51 votes,” a senior congressional staffer with intimate knowledge of the situation said in an email to Breitbart News. “Unbelievably, they actually are leading the fight to fully fund Obamacare.”

McConnell and Cornyn stated earlier Monday that they oppose a possible filibuster from Cruz to keep Reid from adding language funding the Affordable Care Act to the continuing resolution passed by the House of Representatives.

As Breitbart News reported on Saturday, McConnell and Cornyn could help Cruz win:

First, when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid brings the House continuing resolution (CR) to the floor next week, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell needs to deliver 41 Republican votes to filibuster it until Senator Reid agrees not to try and restore funding for Obamacare. McConnell has the power to ensure that Reid cannot get an amendment onto the bill that strips the Obamacare defunding language with a simple majority vote. As Breitbart News laid out on Friday, McConnell has closed down one pathway that Reid could use: If [Reid] introduces an amendment before the Senate votes on cloture for the House CR[, t]hat would require a 60-vote threshold, and McConnell’s spokesman Don Stewart told Breitbart News that if Reid attempted that tactic, all Senate Republicans would stand together to block it. However, a major avenue is still open through which Reid can get the amendment onto the bill with a simple majority. If McConnell decides Obamacare is worth fighting in earnest on must-pass legislation (ie non-symbolic votes), then he will deliver the 41 necessary votes to filibuster until Reid is forced to agree to a clean up-or-down Senate floor vote on the Obamacare defunding CR the House just passed. There is something McConnell can do using his power that could accomplish this: Filibuster the House CR until there is a unanimous consent agreement that any amendments added to it after cloture is invoked would also each require a 60-vote threshold. The power rests now with McConnell. Delivering the 41 votes is essential to help Ted Cruz.

Instead of helping Cruz with their power as Senate GOP leaders, McConnell and Cornyn are working against him, this senior staffer said. But in the end, they will try to make it appear as though they do not support funding Obamacare by voting against Reid’s amendment after allowing Reid to implement it. “Once it’s a 51-vote threshold, both McConnell and Cornyn will hide behind a ‘no’ vote on Reid’s amendment–so they will have yet another show vote,” the staffer said.

“To be clear, nobody is fighting harder to make sure Obamacare is funded than Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn,” the senior staffer added."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/27/1211929/-Krugman-on-The-Obamacare-Shock,2013-05-27 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']","Krugman on ""The Obamacare Shock""","It is important to remember that Krugman is not merely a brilliant economist, but an astute political observer, as his columns over the past decade have made clear. Often, because he understands the economic impact of certain decisions, he is able to lay out what the political consequences will be, while others offer thoughts that may seemingly make political sense to the conventional thinkers of the DC village, but since they are based on wrong-headed economic thinking inevitably turn out incorrectly.

Krugman lays out in detail what the problems are in insuring a population in which only some had health insurance. If you merely require coverage of pre-existing condition and the healthy uninsured do not sign up, as was the case in New York, premiums can skyrocket, as the healthy risk going uninsured. Or else you confront the situation where those with previous conditions can be reject for insurance. To these observations I would add the additional one of being locked into a job once a condition is diagnosed, even at pay levels far below what one could make elsewhere, because either the employee or a family member now has a preexisting condition.



Obamacare closes this gap with a three-part approach. First, community rating everywhere — no more exclusion based on pre-existing conditions. Second, the “mandate” — you must buy insurance even if you’re currently healthy. Third, subsidies to make insurance affordable for those with lower incomes.

This is, as Krugman notes, the approach taken in Massachusetts, where it has been successful and remains popular, even if the former governor responsible for the approach Krugman labels ""ObamaRomneyCare"" tried to distance himself from it in the most recent presidential campaign.

But the Bay State already had community rating and relatively low rates of uninsured (and for the latter I might argue that because of heavy unionization even non-union workplaces tended to offer good medical insurance as a means of dissuading employees from organizing)> A state like California, which lacked both, was supposed to demonstrate the problems with the approach taken in ACA.

Except as we all know, as the bids have come in, they have been lower than expected.

Krugman is aware that the plan ia complicated, because simpler options like Medicare for all were taken off the table. And there are states where Republicans have done all they can to block ACA, which will create more confusion - although we are seeing the oddities like that of Arizona, which Krugman does not mention, where the conservative Republican governor is vetoing all legislation until her conservative Republican legislature agrees to the expansion of Medicaid necessary for those uninsured too poor to afford to buy insurance on their own. Krugman notes, that

in states where Republicans have blocked Medicaid expansion, such unfortunates will be left out in the cold.

Still, here’s what it seems is about to happen: millions of Americans will suddenly gain health coverage, and millions more will feel much more secure knowing that such coverage is available if they lose their jobs or suffer other misfortunes. Only a relative handful of people will be hurt at all. And as contrasts emerge between the experience of states like California that are making the most of the new policy and that of states like Texas whose politicians are doing their best to undermine it, the sheer meanspiritedness of the Obamacare opponents will become ever more obvious.

Above, I talked about the perspicacity of Krugman's political analysis. In that regard, perhaps the most important paragraph in this column is its penultimate:Take Texas for example. A state that is no longer majority White, non-Hispanic. It is also a state where the percentage of uninsured is astronomical. If that population begins to realize what the Republicans are doing to them, and gets registered, is it possible that the state could flip as early as 2014? If the Democrats in the state, running for federal and state offices campaign on this issue, might it be possible to also make significant changes in the House delegation?

Let's recognize something. The insurance companies like ACA, because it expands their pool of customers. They do not care whether they are paid by tax deductible support from employers or by federal and state taxes for Medicaid - it is still revenue for them.

The meanspiritedness of Republicans, particular in the House, where they may well reject a compromise on immigration, will become even more of an issue when people see the difference the Affordable Care Act can make.

And then there is the challenge on the philosophy of government - or should we say in the case of Tea Party Republicans, the philosophy of a lack of government? It is this that Krugman addresses in his final paragraph:

So yes, it does look as if there’s an Obamacare shock coming: the shock of learning that a public program designed to help a lot of people can, strange to say, end up helping a lot of people — especially when government officials actually try to make it work.

CLip and save this column. Remember it when we see the real political impact of ACA in next year's elections.

Peace."

Software and hardware upgrades put in place since late October have been effective, said Jeffrey Zients, the Obama aide overseeing the repair effort to the online portal for health insurance enrollment in more than 30 states.

""HealthCare.gov on Dec. 1 is night and day from where it was on Oct. 1,"" when the health insurance exchanges debuted, Zients said during a conference call with reporters Sunday. ""While we still have work to do, we've made significant progress with HealthCare.gov working smoothly for the vast majority of consumers."" The website can now handle 50,000 users at a time, which was the original goal, and 800,000 visitors a day, he said.

The early consumer experience of Obamacare's health insurance exchanges was characterized by crashes, error messages, long wait times and faulty information, threatening the rollout of Obama's signature domestic policy achievement.

A crush of consumers scrambling to get health insurance for the new year could test the rigor of the administration's fixes, and Zients said traffic to HealthCare.gov spiked over the Thanksgiving holiday compared a typical weekend, although he didn't provide figures.

HuffPost readers: Do you plan to try HealthCare.gov or a state-run health insurance exchange website in December? Tell us about your experience -- email jeffrey.young@huffingtonpost.com. Please include your phone number if you're willing to be interviewed.

Poor enrollment during the first month, when only about 106,000 people were able to enroll in private insurance via the exchanges, left the administration far from the 7 million projected to sign up by the end of the enrollment period on March 31. During that same time period, 1.5 million people had completed applications and more than 200,000 were pending, suggesting that demand for coverage is high.

Almost 20,000 people signed up using HealthCare.gov between Nov. 24 and Nov. 26, the most so far in a three-day stretch, The New York Times reported Friday. And enrollment in some state-run health insurance exchanges, such as those in California, Kentucky, New York and Washington state, accelerated during November.

Health insurance consumers who failed to get through the application and enrollment process during the first two months of the sign-up period will be the administration's first targets, Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said during the Sunday conference call.

""While we certainly want to and will invite new consumers into the site, our focus is on making sure that those who have tried to enroll in the past several weeks are able to successfully complete that process,"" Bataille said.

A large majority of visitors to HealthCare.gov should now be able to submit an application for health coverage and enroll into a plan online, Bataille said. ""About five weeks ago, we were seeing only about 30 percent of consumers with information on hand able to complete the application successfully online. Today, we're now more in the zone of about 80 percent of users being able to do that same process successfully,"" she said.

The remaining consumers can still use alternate methods to enroll, such as the health insurance exchanges' telephone hotline, Bataille said. And people can purchase health plans directly from insurers or from agents and brokers, although tax credits to cut the cost of coverage are available only via the exchanges in most cases. The administration is testing a system that would let people apply for tax credits directly through 16 insurers in Florida, Ohio and Texas, and the early results are ""encouraging,"" Bataille said.

In late October, the White House placed Zients in charge of the overhaul effort, and the Department of Health and Human Services appointed Quality Software Services Inc., a unit of the health insurance company UnitedHealth Group that is one of the exchanges' main architects, as lead contractor. Since that time, administration officials have maintained that HealthCare.gov would work for most users by the end of November.

Zients said that goal has been met and emphasized that work on improving the website and its underlying technology will continue through March. The team repairing HealthCare.gov made more than 400 software fixes and upgraded the hardware supporting the system using a ""punch list"" of identified problems.

""Over the last five weeks, we've made substantial progress working through the punch list. We've executed hundreds of software fixes and hardware upgrades and the site is now stable and operating at its intended capacity with greatly improved performance,"" Zients said.

HealthCare.gov's failure rate has dropped from about 6 percent in October to 0.75 percent as of Friday, according to a report issued by the Department of Health and Human Services on Sunday. The website was up and running 95 percent of the time as of Saturday, not counting scheduled maintenance, like an 11-hour period this weekend when applications and enrollments were offline -- an improvement from a low of 43 percent two months ago, the report says.

Some problems remain unresolved and consumers and health insurance companies will still face difficulties, Bataille said. ""With any web project, there is not a magic moment but a process of continual improvement over time and we will continue to make enhances in the days, weeks and months ahead,"" she said.

Health insurance companies have reported receiving incorrect information about their new customers since the beginning of the enrollment period and the administration is still working to fix these issues. Problems with the data HealthCare.gov sends to insurance issuers were a major part of the administration's push over recent says, Bataille said.

Whether these flaws have been adequately addressed -- and whether consumers can be confident their enrollments are complete and their coverage will be effective next month -- won't be fully clear until more people sign up, Bataille said.

""We need to see increased volumes of traffic and transactions, which we anticipate seeing over the course of the weekdays, to make sure that we get information from issuers and see the success rates they are having with the fixes put in place this week,"" Bataille said.

Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has said he would sign the bill into law, after reaching an agreement with the legislature to include a provision that the law would not take effect unless four other states, at least one of which shares a border with Connecticut, passed similar regulations.

The Connecticut bill also hinges on those states including Northeastern states with a total population of at least 20 million.

“This bill strikes an important balance by ensuring the consumers’ right to know what is in their food while shielding our small businesses from liability that could leave them at a competitive disadvantage,” Mr. Malloy said in a statement issued over the weekend after negotiations on the necessary provisions."

The secretary voiced confidence in the law as her department announced what it claimed was a ""surge"" in enrollment. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Tuesday that more than 2.1 million people have enrolled through the federal- and state-run marketplaces.

""I'm thrilled that we're going to have millions of people for the first time that have health security, and it should be a great New Year for lots of families across America,"" Sebelius told Fox News in an exclusive interview, as she left a downtown D.C. restaurant Tuesday afternoon.

Sebelius acknowledged there could continue to be hiccups going into 2014. ""There always are,"" she said. ""People change plans every year.""

But she predicted a relatively smooth transition and said she doesn't see more delays in the future.

The administration, though, has announced a string of delays and exemptions over the last several weeks. Among the changes, the administration recently announced it would let people whose health care policies were canceled under ObamaCare buy bare-bones ""catastrophic coverage"" plans which would have otherwise been unavailable.

The requirement on mid-sized and large employers to provide insurance was also delayed by a year. Given all the changes being punched in the law, one Republican lawmaker has likened it to a ""Jenga game.""

A big part of the problem was the difficulty individuals had signing up through the slow, error-prone federal website.

But the secretary's remarks Tuesday marked a significant change in tone from just a few weeks ago when, during testimony on Capitol Hill, she agreed with a Republican congresswoman who called the launch of HealthCare.gov a ""debacle.""

The administration has scrambled to fix the technical problems with the site, though several states are still grappling with technical difficulties.

CMS announced Tuesday that December enrollment is ""nearly 6 times that of October and November combined.""

""We expect these numbers to continue to grow through the end of March when open enrollment ends,"" the agency said.

Republicans have signaled they're not impressed by the growth in enrollment.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said Sunday that the surge is nothing to ""celebrate.""

""It was a failed [website] launch, a flawed law and it needs real change,"" he said.

With coverage beginning Jan. 1, the administration is hoping a total of 7 million sign up through the exchanges by March 31. That's when the federal government will begin to assess a penalty on those who do not buy health insurance, as required under the law.

Ms. Tavenner, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that “nearly 700,000 applications have been submitted to the federal and state marketplaces” in the last four weeks. But she repeatedly refused to say how many of those people had actually enrolled in health insurance plans since the federal and state marketplaces, or exchanges, opened on Oct. 1. “That number will not be available until mid-November,” Ms. Tavenner said. “We expect the initial number to be small.”

The testimony from Tavenner was actually very credible if you saw or heard it, reviewing that prior to ACA, insurance was far from adequate. The fact is it's going to be impossible to really judge how things are working for weeks to come, until we get a sense of enrollment numbers beyond success stories like KY and failures like the healthcare.gov rollout. But that won't stop media from chasing the shiny object and offering judgment anyway. And nothing will stop GOP criticism, which ought not to be taken at face value from people who have a stake in having the program fail even as Americans want it to succeed. Republicans can't run away from that no matter how many hearings they hold.

CHIRBlog:

There’s been a lot of breathless journalism lately – with each day’s events apparently a referendum on the success – or failure – of the Affordable Care Act. One of the latest story lines involves people with individual health insurance policies receiving policy cancellations from their insurance companies. What’s Really Happening? Having an insurance company discontinue an insurance policy is not anything new. And actually, the term “policy cancellation” is a misnomer. Generally, an individual health insurance policy is sold via a 12-month contract between the insurer and the consumer. At the end of that contract period, the insurer has the option to discontinue or change that policy – nothing in federal law changes that. Current policyholders are not having their current policy cancelled – rather, the insurance company is exercising its option to discontinue the policy at the end of the contract year.

Though some people might pay more than they did before, they and many others will also get more. Among other things, they will be less financially vulnerable when they get sick — in some cases dramatically less. Their new plans will also put taxpayers at less risk of having to cover big medical bills when under-insured patients unexpectedly fall very ill. That goes, too, for people who currently decline to buy insurance but who will have to next year. Reform still might not sound like a great deal to people who are young, feel healthy and don’t want to pay for coverage . Yet having lots of healthy people paying into the new system on its terms will not only limit their financial risk, but also their participation will allow others who have been priced out of the health-insurance market — those with serious preexisting conditions, for example — to obtain good coverage. They deserve compassion, too. None of this is an outrage. It’s the predictable result of a defensible policy choice embedded in the reform.

The story, however, wasn’t as straightforward as the CBS News account suggested. As pointed out here and here, Barrette’s $50 insurance plan was shot through with holes, particularly with respect to hospitalization. The Obamacare-compliant plan that she was offered in its place must comply with a set of basic standards, including hospitalization. Following all the ruckus, Fox News host Greta Van Susteren interviewed Barrette on last night’s edition of her program “On the Record.” The deficiencies of Barrette’s longtime plan got plenty of attention from Van Susteren: VAN SUSTEREN: I must say though that your policy is like, you know, if you are walking across the street and someone runs a red light, you are in deep trouble under your existing policy.

BARRETTE: That is true. Now there’s something: Fox News, clearing up the distorted and negative impressions left by the mainstream media on Obamacare. Following her chat with Van Susteren, Barrette got word from a network producer that her appointment to appear this morning on Fox News was cancelled, she tells the Erik Wemple Blog.

It would have been perfectly fine for Obama to say most Americans get to keep their coverage or to qualify his statement in some other way. And administration officials offered such nuance when asked. But Obama offered more absolute and ironclad promises when he spoke publicly—and, distressingly, some of his advisors are making similarly sweeping statements now. Such declarations lie ""somewhere between an oversimplification and a falsehood,"" as Jonathan Chait puts it. In short, the president's critics have a point. But ultimately the more important question is about what’s actually happening to these people losing their current policies—and why. This transformation is not just a consequence of Obamacare. It's very much the intent. And for very good reason. By nearly everybody's reckoning, the ""non-group"" market is the most dysfunctional part of the American health insurance system. The dysfunction takes two primary forms. First, insurers have been selective about whom they would cover and how—charging higher premiums, covering fewer services, or simply denying benefits outright to people with pre-existing medical conditions. About half of all Americans have at least one such condition, according to official estimates, so roughly speaking about half the population couldn't reliably find comprehensive, affordable coverage if they had to buy it on their own.

It isn’t over yet, but a bookie today would predict a Terry McAuliffe victory in the Virginia governor’s election next week. Washington Post polling shows the Democratic businessman and fundraiser with a double-digit lead (51 percent to 39 percent) over Republican Ken Cuccinelli II following a campaign ad blitz that shredded the sitting attorney general over his conservative views. It’s not that voters love McAuliffe. They just don’t like Cuccinelli — and they really don’t like the Republican Party. ... So it isn’t over yet, in Virginia or elsewhere, but Republicans have little time to regain the trust and confidence of the non-ideological centrist majority. It’s time to dump the tea party in the Potomac.

Howard, which nurtured civil rights warriors like Andrew Young, Thurgood Marshall and Charles Hamilton Houston, has played a special role in the work of integration. But an unspeakable conclusion has followed from that work — that the job of Howard University is to pave the way for its own obsolescence. That terrible tension was on vivid display last weekend at Howard. A group of us — black parents with ties to The Mecca, as we call it — returned for Homecoming weekend. The football game (versus Morgan State University) was sloppy. A great many of the best college football players are black, but since the fall of Jim Crow, schools like Howard have not been able to compete for them. But at a black school, football is barely the point. The point is the bands that battle at halftime. The point is the affection in the stands, the warm banter between us, which we invented out on the margins of America. Howard won. We cheered and walked out on the Yard where thousands of black college students and black college graduates assembled in reunion. Love was free-flowing. Cameras were passed. Memory cards were filled. I walked past Douglass Hall, and thought of my professors who put The Struggle in my heart and Consciousness in my head. There was tailgating just off campus. The entire community was there, from hustlers running card games to Kappas running steps."

“These are not glitches. The extent of the problems is pretty enormous,” an insurance executive who participated in Obamacare conference calls told the Times. “At the end of our calls, people say, ‘It’s awful, just awful.'”

The Times says those closest to the three-and-a-half year-long building of Obamacare, like embattled Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, ignored or quashed the myriad warning bells sounding all around them. On Tuesday, the Republican National Committee released a #FireSebelius web ad calling for Sebelius’s ousting.

“We foresee a train wreck,” one insurance executive working on Obamacare IT said in February. “We don’t have the IT specifications. The level of angst in health plans is growing by leaps and bounds. The political people in the administration do not understand how far behind they are.”

The comments mirror those made in April by Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT) who helped craft Obamacare. At the time, Baucus said Obamacare was “a huge train wreck coming down.”

Now, the companies that bagged millions to build the Obamacare digital architecture are scurrying to avoid public ridicule and scrutiny. “Worried about their reputations, contractors are now publicly distancing themselves from the troubled parts of the federally run project,” reports the Times.

Development Seed President Eric Gundersen told the Times his company built the busted HealthCare.org website but “had nothing to do with what happened after a user hit the ‘Apply Now’ button.”

Oracle, which was subcontracted to handle identity management software used in the Obamacare registration process, claims its services are running swimmingly. “Our software is running properly,” said Oracle communications vice president Deborah Hellinger.

One of Obamacare’s biggest winners of taxpayer dollars has been CGI Group. Washington Examiner reporter Richard Pollock says that the U.S. subsidiary of Canadian company CGI (which stands for “Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique”) Group, CGI Federal, received a no-bid sweetheart contract worth $93 million. Since 2009, CGI has scored $678 million in taxpayer money for 185 separate task orders.

Even progressive Democrats are now blasting Obamacare’s failures.

Former Obama White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs says President Barack Obama should fire those responsible for the “excruciatingly embarrassing” Obamacare rollout.

http://news.yahoo.com/ap-sources-revised-gop-attack-obamacare-071338155--finance.html,,[],AP sources: A revised GOP attack on 'Obamacare',"WASHINGTON (AP) — House GOP leaders Wednesday announced that they will move quickly to raise the government's borrowing cap by attaching a wish list of GOP priorities like blocking ""Obamacare,"" forcing construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and setting the stage for reforming the loophole-cluttered tax code.

They also, as expected, promised tea party lawmakers a chance to first use a routine temporary government funding bill to try to muscle the Democratic-controlled Senate into derailing President Barack Obama's health care law.

""That fight will continue as we negotiate the debt limit with the president and the Senate,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va.

Obama said again that he won't knuckle under to the GOP's demands

The GOP strategy appears to assume that the Senate will strip out the ""defund 'Obamacare'"" provision and send it back. The House would then face a choice: pass the measure without the health care provision or continue the battle and risk a partial government shutdown when the new budget year begins Oct. 1.

Speaking to CEOs of the Business Roundtable Wednesday, Obama called on the corporate leaders to use their influence to avoid a potentially damaging showdown over the debt ceiling. He reiterated his promise to not negotiate over the need to raise the nation's borrowing limit, which the government is expected to hit as early as next month.

He blamed ""a faction"" of the Republican Party for budget brinkmanship designed to undo his three-year-old health care law.

""You have never seen in the history of the United States the debt ceiling or the threat of not raising the debt ceiling being used to extort a president or a governing party and trying to force issues that have nothing to do with the budget and have nothing to do with the debt,"" Obama said.

""So I'm happy to negotiate with them around the budget, just as I've done in the past,"" he added. ""What I will not do is to create a habit, a pattern, whereby the full faith and credit of the United States ends up being a bargaining chip to set policy. It's irresponsible. The last time we did this, in 2011, we had negative growth at a time when the recovery was just trying to take off.""

Story continues

GOP leaders telegraphed that they would likely concede to the Senate's demand for a stopgap spending bill shorn of the Obamacare provision — but that they would carry on with the fight on legislation to increase the government's borrowing cap.

""There should be no conversation about shutting the government down. That's not the goal here,"" Said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.

The latest strategy was presented to rank-and-file Republicans at a closed-door meeting Wednesday. GOP lawmakers and aides said it was received well.

It's a reversal from an earlier strategy, rejected last week by angry conservatives, that would have sent the measure to the Senate as two bills to ensure that the Democratic-controlled chamber would be able to ship the spending measure straight to the White House and more easily avert a government shutdown after the Sept. 30 end of the budget year.

The idea then was to avoid a subsequent vote on a ""clean"" stopgap spending bill in the House after Senate Democrats voted to strip out the provision. Stopgap funding bills are typically routine, with neither House nor Senate looking to use them to pick a fight.

There's some risk, however, that if the Senate were to send the measure back, angry GOP conservatives might be looking for a fight and could withhold their votes rather than surrender to the Senate and its top Democrat, Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada.

The latest move attempts to shift the battle to must-pass legislation to raise the government's $16.7 trillion borrowing cap on their own terms by pairing it with a roster of conservative priorities, including a renewed assault on the health care law and a mandate to build the Keystone XL pipeline.

""In the coming week, we will unveil a plan to extend our nation's ability to borrow while delaying Obamacare,"" Cantor said. ""Those discussions will also focus on a path forward on tax reform and the Keystone pipeline.""

Conservatives want to take a must-pass bill hostage and add the assault on the Affordable Care Act in an attempt to force Obama and congressional Democrats to make concessions. GOP leaders have viewed the effort with skepticism since Democrats would never go along.

The idea of defunding Obama's health care law has been a goal of tea party conservatives such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and outside groups like the Heritage Foundation.

Meanwhile, a large group of House conservatives intends to unveil legislation providing an expanded tax break for consumers who purchase their own health coverage and increasing the government funding for high-risk pools, according to lawmakers who said the plan marked the Republicans' first comprehensive alternative to Obama's health care overhaul.

Conservatives are frustrated that Republicans control only one chamber of Congress and have little chance to enact their agenda over the opposition of Obama and Senate Democrats.

Also Wednesday, White House budget office director Sylvia Burwell sent agencies a memo to guide them in their planning in the event of a lapse in funding authority on Oct. 1. As in prior shutdowns, many agency programs would continue.

A shutdown impasse would leave the government without funding authority to pay its workers, including the military, or enter into new contracts until a bill is passed. But essential programs like the military, air traffic control, food inspection, disaster relief and firefighting would continue to function since they're related to protecting life and property. So-called mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare, which are funded as if on autopilot, would also continue.

National parks would mostly close, most passport applications could not be processed and the space program would largely be put on hold, among other results.

A top House Democrat, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, said Tuesday he would not support the stopgap funding bill under any circumstance since it would fund programs at an annualized funding rate of $986 billion, a level consistent with automatic, across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration that Democrats are trying to reverse.

But if the Democratic Senate goes along with that funding level, as insiders have signaled, and if Obama endorses the straightforward funding measure, House Democrats likely could be counted upon to provide the votes. The question is whether GOP leaders would want to pass the measure with help from Democrats, which Boehner did on several occasions earlier this year to the consternation of conservatives.

On Monday, President Obama both criticized and defended the Web site. While he conveyed an all-hands-on-deck attitude and his commitment to solving the problems, he did not give sufficient specifics.

But there are five things we can do now to right the ship of Obamacare.

The president should create a new position: an independent chief executive of the federal exchange. On Tuesday, the White House announced that the economic adviser Jeffrey D. Zients will oversee the “tech surge” in the short term. Mr. Zients is a great manager and was a health care industry consultant, but he is also about to take on an important job as director of the National Economic Council. We need someone who can not just begin the repair process, but also run and refine the exchange’s operations for at least the next two years.

This C.E.O. should meet one on one with the president every week to ensure he or she has full authority to carry out the job. The candidate should have management experience, knowledge of how both the government and health insurance industry work, and at least some familiarity with IT systems. Obviously this is a tall order, but there are such people. And the administration needs to hire one immediately, while Mr. Zients works to put out the fires.

Second, the system needs to borrow from other exchanges. While the federal exchange has been a fiasco, many state exchanges have been working well since they launched earlier this month. One of the assignments for the students in my health policy class at the University of Pennsylvania this semester was to window-shop for insurance policies on the California exchange. They found the site easy to use and said there were many choices and the prices were competitive, even before subsidies. These students are the key demographic — young and healthy — that the sites need if they are going to succeed. Mr. Zients and the new C.E.O. should be looking carefully at the California, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York and any other successful state-run exchanges, and seeing which aspects can be adopted into the federal exchange, without reinventing it wholesale.

Next, the administration needs to be candid with the public. Given the disappointing rollout of the Web site, Americans are justifiably suspicious. Starting now, the administration needs to initiate a concerted effort to win back the public’s trust. There should be twice-weekly briefings that feature honest and complete descriptions of both the problems and solutions that the tech team is working on — in all the gory detail. We need to hear from those “best and brightest” experts whom President Obama has enlisted in the tech surge. Transparency is the only way to convince the American people that the situation is under control."
"http://www.latimes.com/health/la-me-doctors-20130210,0,1509396.story",2013-02-09 08:00:00,[],State lacks doctors to meet demand of national healthcare law,"SACRAMENTO — As the state moves to expand healthcare coverage to millions of Californians under President Obama’s healthcare law, it faces a major obstacle: There aren’t enough doctors to treat a crush of newly insured patients.

Some lawmakers want to fill the gap by redefining who can provide healthcare.

They are working on proposals that would allow physician assistants to treat more patients and nurse practitioners to set up independent practices. Pharmacists and optometrists could act as primary care providers, diagnosing and managing some chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and high-blood pressure.

“We’re going to be mandating that every single person in this state have insurance,” said state Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), chairman of the Senate Health Committee and leader of the effort to expand professional boundaries. “What good is it if they are going to have a health insurance card but no access to doctors?”

Hernandez’s proposed changes, which would dramatically shake up the medical establishment in California, have set off a turf war with physicians that could contribute to the success or failure of the federal Affordable Care Act in California.

Doctors say giving non-physicians more authority and autonomy could jeopardize patient safety. It could also drive up costs, because those workers, who have less medical education and training, tend to order more tests and prescribe more antibiotics, they said.

“Patient safety should always trump access concerns,” said Dr. Paul Phinney, president of the California Medical Assn.

Such “scope-of-practice” fights are flaring across the country as states brace for an influx of patients into already strained healthcare systems. About 350 laws altering what health professionals may do have been enacted nationwide in the last two years, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since Jan. 1, more than 50 additional proposals have been launched in 24 states.

As the nation’s earliest and most aggressive adopter of the healthcare overhaul, California faces more pressure than many states. Diana Dooley, secretary of the state Health and Human Services Agency, said in an interview that expanding some professionals’ roles was among the options policymakers should explore to help meet the expected demand.

At a meeting of healthcare advocates in December, she had offered a more blunt assessment.

“We’re going to have to provide care at lower levels,” she told the group. “I think a lot of people are trained to do work that our licenses don’t allow them to.”

Currently, just 16 of California’s 58 counties have the federal government’s recommended supply of primary care physicians, with the Inland Empire and the San Joaquin Valley facing the worst shortages. In addition, nearly 30% of the state’s doctors are nearing retirement age, the highest percentage in the nation, according to the Assn. of American Medical Colleges.

Physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists and optometrists agree that they have more training than they are allowed to use.

“We don’t have enough providers,” said Beth Haney, president of the California Assn. for Nurse Practitioners, ""...so we should increase access to the ones that we have.”

Hernandez, who said he would introduce his legislation and hold a hearing on the issue next month, said his own experience as an optometrist shows the need to empower more practitioners. He said he often sees Medicaid patients who come to his La Puente practice because they have failed their vision test at the DMV. Many complain of constant thirst and frequent urination.

“I know it’s diabetes,” he said. But he is not allowed to diagnose or treat it and must refer those patients elsewhere. Many of them may face a months-long wait to see a doctor.

The California Medical Assn. says healthcare professionals should not exceed their training. Phinney, a pediatrician, said physician assistants and other mid-level professionals are best deployed in doctor-led teams. They can perform routine exams and prescribe medications in consultation with physicians on the premises or by teleconference.

Allowing certain health workers to set up independent practices would create voids in the clinics, hospitals and offices where they now work, he said. “It’s more like moving the deck chairs around rather than solving the problem,” Phinney said.

His group proposes a different solution: It wants more funding to expand participation in a loan repayment program for recent medical school graduates. Doctors can now receive up to $105,000 in return for practicing in underserved communities for three years.

Still, it typically takes a decade to train a physician. Health experts say the pool of graduates cannot keep pace.

“We’re not going to produce thousands of additional doctors in any kind of short-term time frame,” said Assemblyman Roger Dickinson (D-Sacramento). “It makes sense to look at changes that could relieve the pressure that we’re going to undoubtedly encounter for access to care.”

Administrators of community clinics and public hospitals say nurse practitioners and other non-physician providers already play key roles in caring for patients, a trend they predict will grow as more Californians become insured and enter the healthcare system.

At Kern Medical Center in Kern County, two clinical pharmacists have run the hospital’s diabetes clinic, treating about 500 patients a year, since the specialist physician in charge retired. They are licensed to perform physicals, order lab tests, prescribe medicines and counsel patients on lifestyle changes.

“We’re going to have to get a whole lot more creative about how care is provided,” said Paul Hensler, Kern Medical Center’s chief executive.

Republicans are back on offense, and more quickly than many had expected, after seeing their approval ratings plunge during last month's partial shutdown and worrisome talk of a possible U.S. debt default.

They pillory administration officials at Capitol Hill hearings. They cite the millions of people getting dropped by insurers despite President Barack Obama's promise that it wouldn't happen. They harp on the program's flawed enrollment process.

Now they're relishing Obama's apology to those who are losing health insurance plans he had repeatedly said they could keep.

""If the president is truly sorry for breaking his promises to the American people, he'll do more than just issue a halfhearted apology on TV,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement.

Republicans once pinned their health care criticisms largely on computer glitches in the application and enrollment process. Today, they're accusing Obama and congressional Democrats of much worse, including deceit and incompetence.

Conservative groups are pouring money into ad campaigns reminding voters that many Democrats had promised Americans they could keep their current insurance policies if they wanted. In particular, Republicans hope these efforts will help them with women, who tend to vote Democratic and often make health care decisions for their families and in-laws.

In the 2014 elections, ""this is going to be a big issue, and it's not going away,"" said Daniel Scarpinato of the National Republican Congressional Committee. ""Democrats who voted for Obamacare,"" he said, ""are pretty desperately running around with their hair on fire, trying to distance themselves, which they're not going to be able to do.""

The White House says canceled policies can be replaced with better coverage, sometimes at lower prices. What the administration doesn't emphasize is that better coverage often costs more, and those looking for new policies may not qualify for the tax subsidies available under the new law.

Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the GOP's top Senate campaign group, acknowledged that Republicans took a hit last month when an angry public blamed them for the 16-day partial government shutdown.

But now, he said, ""there's a spring in the step"" of party activists.

Potential congressional candidates ""who might have been 50-50 about running for office might be a little more inclined"" to plunge in, he said. Best of all, Dayspring said, the most vulnerable Democratic lawmakers have echoed Obama's now-disproven promises about insurance cancellations and ""most of them are on film doing it.""

The conservative group American Crossroads already is using such film clips against Democratic Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Kay Hagan of North Carolina, who face re-election next year. The group is paying to place the videos on Facebook and other sites.

Another conservative group, Americans for Prosperity, says it will spend $2 million in a new ad campaign tying Obama's health care law to Hagan and Landrieu.

Begich, Landrieu and Hagan were among the 16 Democratic senators who met with Obama on Wednesday, a day after two gubernatorial elections highlighted the party's struggles with the health issue. Half of New Jersey voters and 53 percent of Virginia voters said they oppose the president's health law. The two Democratic gubernatorial nominees won 11 percent and 14 percent of those voters, respectively.

Democrat Terry McAuliffe was elected in Virginia, while Republican Gov. Chris Christie cruised to re-election in New Jersey.

Several of the Democratic senators cited the program's malfunction website when they urged Obama to extend the enrollment deadline for people to sign up for health insurance.

Republicans must pick up six Senate seats next year to gain control for the first time in eight years. If they prevent Democrats from gaining 17 net House seats, they will sustain the GOP House majority they won in 2010.

Dayspring said the law's problems will help his party combat Democrats' claim that Republicans are engaged in a ""war on women"" on matters such as access to contraceptives. His campaign committee is targeting Hagan, Landrieu and other female Democrats with messages saying ""Obamacare could hurt hundreds of thousands of women,"" yet these Democratic lawmakers stand by the law.

Landrieu was among the first Democrats to propose legislation to let people keep their current health insurance policies even if they don't cover newly required areas such as hospitalization, laboratory services and prenatal care.

Landrieu said Louisiana voters won't buy the GOP's new attack lines against her and other Democratic women.

""If the Republican Party does not stop talking about a bill that is already passed, signed into law"" and promising ""that middle-class Americans and small businesses can for the first time get private insurance that they can afford and that they can count on, they will rue the day,"" she said.

Republicans also are making the ""Obamacare""-hurts-women argument in New Hampshire, where Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen faces re-election next year. Shaheen calls the claims absurd.

The Republican Party's basic position on health care, Shaheen said, ""opposes contraceptives for women and is unwilling to provide access to abortion even in cases of rape and incest.""

Now, she said, Republicans want people to believe ""that the great new preventive coverage that women are going to get under the new health care law is somehow not going to be good for women and families.""

""It's like being called ugly by a frog,"" Shaheen said.

House Bill 845, sponsored by Rep. Charles Van Zant (R-Keystone Heights), would make it a third-degree felony in Florida to perform an abortion based on the race or gender of the fetus. In his closing statements on Thursday, Van Zant accused Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers of intentionally targeting black people. ""The fact is, 80 percent of abortion clinics nationwide are located in minority neighborhoods where 43 percent of all black babies are aborted,"" Van Zant said, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

""In America alone, without the Nazi Holocaust, without the Ku Klux Klan, Planned Parenthood and other abortionists have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973,"" he said. ""This is called discriminatory targeting.""

Several black lawmakers became insulted during the debate, and at least five women walked out. Rep. Barbara Watson (D-Miami), one of the members who left, told HuffPost in a phone interview that she felt as if Van Zant was manipulating information to reflect his personal beliefs about abortion.

""I don't appreciate anyone trying to explain what any other ethnic group's lifestyle is and what they do, when you really don't have any authority to interpret it,"" she said. ""I think the women and people of color in that chamber deserve an apology from him, but I don't know that it would actually change his point of view.""

Rep. Darryl Rouson (D-St. Petersburg) said he felt the bills' sponsors were disingenuous in their mission to save the black population from abortion. ""If these representatives truly care about even the subject matter of black genocide, I've got a few bills they could file,"" he said. ""That's what got me upset. They could have talked about the bill and its intent without trying to use black genocide and black babies to sway a vote.""

Van Zant was not immediately available for comment.

Anti-abortion activists have long accused Planned Parenthood of targeting African Americans, but a 2011 fact-check by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research organization, showed that only 9 percent of abortion clinics are located in predominantly black neighborhoods, while 63 percent of clinics are in non-Hispanic white neighborhoods. While black women have a disproportionately high abortion rate compared to other ethnic groups, Guttmacher research shows that could be attributed to higher rates of poverty among black women and the fact that 69 percent of pregnancies among black women are unintended, compared with 40 percent of pregnancies among whites.

Florida representatives passed the anti-abortion bill after a long, fiery debate on Thursday by a vote 71-44, sending it to the state Senate. Rouson said that bill cosponsor Rep. Keith Perry (R-Gainesville) wrote him a personal letter after the vote to apologize for offending him.

Rouson said he hopes the legislature can focus on something else now. ""I've been up here five sessions now, and every last one we're dealing with abortion bills,"" he said. ""You would think we could deal with some women's rights issues or things of great governmental concern, other than every year coming back and trying to do something with abortion.""

UPDATE: 6:10 p.m. -- Rep. Keith Perry acknowledged in a phone interview with HuffPost on Friday that he did send an apology letter to Rouson out of a concern that he had offended him. But Perry said he stands by the comments he made on the House floor.

""What I did was speak some facts about percentages of abortion that are performed, and the ratios [for black women] far exceed the norm of the population,"" he said. ""And I'm not saying the facts are wrong, because they weren't, but the way it was presented, it certainly offended [members of the black caucus].""

Perry added, ""The concern is whether or not there's a strategic marketing approach by people who provide abortions to target certain groups. I don't know if they do or not, but there's a concern that some people may share."""

In a statement obtained by Fox News, an NFL spokesman said the league has ""no plans to engage in this area and (has) had no substantive contact with the administration"" about the implementation.

Earlier in the week, Health and Human Services Department officials said they were talking to the NFL, NBA and others about possible advertising campaigns, in the run-up to the launch of a key part of the health care law.

But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, on Friday wrote to the heads of six professional sports organizations urging them not to take the bait.

""Given the divisiveness and persistent unpopularity of the (health care law), it is difficult to understand why an organization like yours would risk damaging its inclusive and apolitical brand by lending its name to its promotion,"" they wrote.

The senators suggested the administration was reaching out to them because the law is so ""unpopular.""

The NFL's statement late Friday was in response to lawmakers' concerns.

The letters were sent to the heads of the NFL, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, Professional Golf Association and NASCAR.

Republicans, who have been largely opposed to the law ever since they tried to kill the legislation back in 2009 and 2010, have in recent months tried to rein in the administration's promotional efforts.

Several GOP lawmakers want investigations into HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' effort to solicit support from private groups for a non-profit that is promoting the law.

Some of the biggest elements of the health care law are expected to take effect by early 2014. This fall, enrollment begins for a new marketplace -- called exchanges -- of government-regulated insurance plans. The requirement that nearly everyone buy health insurance kicks in at the beginning of 2014.

Despite the controversy over the possibility of the government partnering with sports leagues, this wouldn't be the first occasion the two have linked up.

The military has long engaged in sponsorships with NASCAR, though that relationship encountered hurdles in this age of fiscal austerity. The Army recently decided to drop its sponsorship, though the Air Force did not follow suit."

The move is aimed at saving the city money and comes as the Emanuel administration has been trying to wrangle significant pension cost concessions from employee unions.

The details are in a letter the city plans to send to retirees this week.

Still getting health insurance: Police officers and firefighters who retired between the ages of 55 and 64 and are not yet eligible for Medicare but whose coverage is guaranteed under union contracts, as well as workers who retired before August 1989 and are protected by a legal settlement.

Cut out as of Jan. 1 will be the rest. That's when the city will begin a three-year phaseout of the coverage, according to the letter signed by Comptroller Amer Ahmad. During that period, premiums, deductibles and benefits could change, the letter states.

Once the phaseout is complete, those retired workers would have to pay for their own health insurance or get subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. The city-subsidized coverage is particularly important to retired workers who aren't yet eligible for Medicare, as opposed to those 65 or older who use the subsidies for Medicare supplemental insurance.

The guaranteed city health coverage was good through June 30, but the administration will continue the full subsidy until Jan. 1 to protect workers who already have budgeted their health care for 2013, Ahmad wrote in the letter.

Last year, the city spent nearly $109 million on health care for nearly 37,000 retired workers and their spouses and children who are part of the legal settlement, according to a report issued earlier this year by an Emanuel-appointed panel. Enrollment was expected to grow to more than 47,000 in the next 10 years, which would balloon costs to $541 million, the report states.

""The retirement healthcare system as it stands today is fiscally unsustainable, and we have a responsibility to ensure a secure financial path for Chicago taxpayers,"" Emanuel spokeswoman Kathleen Strand said in a statement after being asked about Ahmad's letter. ""But the mayor also wants to ensure that our retirees who served this city honorably have access to healthcare and the critical information they need to make informed decisions.""

Emanuel's decision comes as the city continues to wrangle with unions over how best to alter the city's four pension systems to avoid major financial havoc as pension-funding bills come due in the next few years. Taking away health care could give Emanuel leverage in those talks.

The four pension systems have about $20 billion in unfunded liabilities. That tab does not include an $805 million shortage in retiree health care funds, which ends up putting the pension funds that also pay a portion of the insurance costs in an even more precarious financial position.

Chicago Fraternal Order of Police First Vice President Bill Dougherty said the city's projections for future cost of health care are too high.

Dougherty called the mayor's plan ""a poor decision"" and suggested that it should in no way be linked to negotiations over pension changes.

""The mayor has shown that he likes to play games on different levels, and we're not interested in doing that,"" Dougherty said.

It's not clear what the pension funds will do about their obligation for retiree health care, said Clint Krislov, the attorney who filed the lawsuit in 1987.

Krislov said he was pleased that the city will continue to protect those who retired before Aug. 23, 1989, but he continues to study the potential effect of the changes on other workers. ""We needn't jump precipitously,"" he said.

The settlements in that long-ago legal matter, called the Korshak case, never resolved whether the city is required to subsidize retiree health care, and if so, for how long. Retired city workers could return to court to argue that any health care cutback impairs or diminishes their pension benefits in violation of the state constitution.

Henry Bayer, executive director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31, said the uncertainties of the Affordable Care Act and the state insurance exchanges they would create make the city's plan hard to assess.

""This uncertainty will cause anxiety and fear for tens of thousands of seniors who gave their working lives to public service — men and women whose retirement savings are already under attack in the name of 'pension reform.'"" Bayer said. ""Our union will be working to get answers to our many questions, to ensure the City Council closely oversees the administration's proposals, and to protect access to affordable health care for city retirees now and in the future.""

Fraud.

“Will the senator from Texas for the record tell us now—and those who watched this debate—whether he is protected and his family’s protected?” Durbin asked Wednesday morning, repeating a question he'd been trying to get Cruz to answer. “I’m happy to tell you now I am eligible for it and I am not currently covered under it,” Cruz responded, diverting the conversation to an uninsured diabetic woman that Durbin had mentioned earlier.

According to a 2009 New York Times report, top executive officers and managing directors at the bank participate in a health care program that costs Goldman more than $40,000 in premiums for each particpant’s family annually.

Sen. Ted Cruz had a short exchange with Sen. Dick Durbin at the tail end of his blabathon Wednesday.Then the conversation moved on without Cruz explaining where he got his coverage. Huffington Post's Ryan Grim found out. He's covered on his wife's plan. His wife is a top Wall Street executive, a regional head of a Goldman Sachs division.Yep, a regular populist, Cruz is, telling all the people that freedom means not having health insurance from his perch ensconced in a gold-plated safety net.

Stand with Daily Kos and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in denouncing Republicans who would completely shut down the government just to destroy Obamacare.

She agrees that everyone should have access to healthcare and no one should be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions.

But here’s the problem:

She knows firsthand, as the new law of the land rolls clumsily into being, that it’s not working out to everyone’s advantage.

“I’m a 55-year-old woman in excellent health and have a catastrophic health plan,” she wrote recently to Obama and California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. “I am completely happy with my plan. I received notice that the plan is being canceled and that to stay with a “comparable” plan my premiums would increase 88%, or $200 extra per month. To add insult to injury, the plan is INFERIOR to my existing plan.”

If you guessed that she got no response from any of those elected officials, you win a box of cough drops.

But public officials didn’t throw a complete shutout at Davis. She wrote to U.S. Rep. Karen Bass (D-Los Angeles) when she didn’t hear from the others, and one of Bass’ staffers called Davis to say she’ll be looking into the specifics of her case.

“Any time you do a huge policy change like healthcare, there’s going to be all sorts of problems and glitches that need to be worked out,” Bass told me Tuesday from Washington, where she said there were new calls for allowing people to keep the policies they have, as President Obama had repeatedly promised they’d be able to do.

President Clinton has urged such a move, and Feinstein’s office backed the idea Tuesday. She noted in a statement that her office had received 30,832 contacts from Californians, “many of whom are very distressed by cancellations of their insurance policies and who are facing increased out-of-pocket expenses.”

“The Affordable Care Act is a good law, but it’s not perfect,” the Feinstein statement said.

No, not by a longshot, beginning with the federal website debacle and highlighted by Obama’s now-laughable promises of a smooth transition. But Bass worries that the problems will further embolden critics who were determined from the beginning to do a grave dance on healthcare reform.

Hundreds of people attended a town hall conference hosted by Bass on Sunday in West L.A. She said some attendees were in the same situation as Davis and not very happy about it; others were confused by their options. Bass said many were assisted as they enrolled in new plans through the state exchange, Covered California.

“But overall, people were like Margaret,” said Bass, who called Davis on Tuesday to discuss her case. “They really want this to work, and they’re just trying to figure it out.”

Which hasn’t been all that easy for Davis, an accountant and software consultant who couldn’t believe “how botched up” the healthcare.gov website was, among other problems.

And would anyone be shocked if insurance companies were trying to take advantage of all the confusion?

Davis lives with her husband and two teenage sons but chose not to be covered by her husband’s healthcare plan, which would have added $600 per month to the cost. All she wanted from her own plan was the peace of mind that came with knowing she wouldn’t go broke if she were seriously ill or injured.

She paid Kaiser $224 a month with a $5,000 deductible.

Under the new Kaiser plan, her premium would rise to $420.46 a month. The plan carries a lower deductible, of $4,500, after which she would then pay 40% of the cost of care up to a cap of $6,350.

Though Davis appreciates the goal that all policies must meet minimal standards of coverage, she doesn’t anticipate needing either the maternity or mental health care that would be part of her new plan.

“I had a feeling my cost would go up,” said Davis, who makes just enough money to be ineligible for a government subsidy, “but I was floored when I saw that it was an 87.7% increase.”

Davis checked the federal and state websites for a better option but couldn’t find one, so she called an insurance broker.

Steve Jakowchik found Davis a deal at Anthem Blue Cross that essentially splits the difference between her current Kaiser plan and the replacement plan. Davis told me she’s inclined to go with the Blue Cross deal unless there’s a reprieve and people are allowed to keep existing policies.

Jakowchik, meanwhile, told me that among the roughly 100 clients he’s assisting, about 30 are getting plans that are more comprehensive, cheaper or both. The other clients are paying anywhere from a little bit more to a lot more for plans that are inferior to what they had, better than what they had or about the same.

The most striking change he’s seeing, Jakowchik said, is among clients who can get pretty good deals, but only if they give up access to the doctors and hospitals they now use. Because his practice is on the Westside, he’s hearing from clients who aren’t happy about losing Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and UCLA Medical Center as hospital options.

“I just ran into one of these today,” said Jakowchik, who told me about a Marina del Rey family that has to decide between a big premium increase and access to Cedars, or much lower premiums but a choice between hospitals in Torrance or the San Fernando Valley.

In six months, a year, or maybe longer, it’s possible that the rocky transition will be behind us and the most well-intended goals of healthcare reform will be met.

But as the signature initiative of the Obama presidency, you’d think this would have been managed with a little more attention to detail.

These middle-class consumers are staring at hefty increases on their insurance bills as the overhaul remakes the healthcare market. Their rates are rising in large part to help offset the higher costs of covering sicker, poorer people who have been shut out of the system for years.

Although recent criticism of the healthcare law has focused on website glitches and early enrollment snags, experts say sharp price increases for individual policies have the greatest potential to erode public support for President Obama’s signature legislation.

“This is when the actual sticker shock comes into play for people,” said Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. “There are winners and losers under the Affordable Care Act.”

Fullerton resident Jennifer Harris thought she had a great deal, paying $98 a month for an individual plan through Health Net Inc. She got a rude surprise this month when the company said it would cancel her policy at the end of this year. Her current plan does not conform with the new federal rules, which require more generous levels of coverage.

Now Harris, a self-employed lawyer, must shop for replacement insurance. The cheapest plan she has found will cost her $238 a month. She and her husband don’t qualify for federal premium subsidies because they earn too much money, about $80,000 a year combined.

“It doesn’t seem right to make the middle class pay so much more in order to give health insurance to everybody else,” said Harris, who is three months pregnant. “This increase is simply not affordable.”

On balance, many Americans will benefit from the healthcare expansion. They are guaranteed coverage regardless of their medical history. And lower-income families will gain access to comprehensive coverage at little or no cost.

The federal government picks up much of the tab through an expansion of Medicaid and subsidies to people earning up to four times the federal poverty level. That’s up to $46,000 for an individual or $94,000 for a family of four.

But middle-income consumers face an estimated 30% rate increase, on average, in California due to several factors tied to the healthcare law.

Some may elect to go without coverage if they feel prices are too high. Penalties for opting out are very small initially. Defections could cause rates to skyrocket if a diverse mix of people don’t sign up for health insurance.

Pam Kehaly, president of Anthem Blue Cross in California, said she received a recent letter from a young woman complaining about a 50% rate hike related to the healthcare law.

“She said, ‘I was all for Obamacare until I found out I was paying for it,’” Kehaly said.

Nearly 2 million Californians have individual insurance, and several hundred thousand of them are losing their health plans in a matter of weeks.

Blue Shield of California sent termination letters to 119,000 customers last month whose plans don’t meet the new federal requirements. About two-thirds of those people will experience a rate increase from switching to a new health plan, according to the company.

HMO giant Kaiser Permanente is canceling coverage for about half of its individual customers, or 160,000 people, and offering to automatically enroll them in the most comparable health plan available.

The 16 million Californians who get health insurance through their employers aren’t affected. Neither are individuals who have “grandfathered” policies bought before March 2010, when the healthcare law was enacted. It’s estimated that about half of policyholders in the individual market have those older plans.

Obamacare: News and analysis

All these cancellations were prompted by a requirement from Covered California, the state’s new insurance exchange. The state didn’t want to give insurance companies the opportunity to hold on to the healthiest patients for up to a year, keeping them out of the larger risk pool that will influence future rates.

Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, said the state and insurers agreed that clearing the decks by Jan. 1 was best for consumers in the long run despite the initial disruption. Lee has heard the complaints — even from his sister-in-law, who recently groused about her 50% rate increase.

“People could have kept their cheaper, bad coverage, and those people wouldn’t have been part of the common risk pool,” Lee said. “We are better off all being in this together. We are transforming the individual market and making it better.”

Lee said consumers need to consider all their options. They don’t have to stick with their current company, and higher premiums are only part of the cost equation. Lee said some of these rate hikes will be partially offset by smaller deductibles and lower limits on out-of-pocket medical expenses in the new plans.

Still, many are frustrated at being forced to give up the plans they have now. They frequently cite assurances given by Obama that Americans could hold on to their health insurance despite the massive overhaul.

“All we’ve been hearing the last three years is if you like your policy you can keep it,” said Deborah Cavallaro, a real estate agent in Westchester. “I’m infuriated because I was lied to.”

Supporters of the healthcare law say Obama was referring to people who are insured through their employers or through government programs such as Medicare. Still, they acknowledge the confusion and anger from individual policyholders who are being forced to change.

Cavallaro received her cancellation notice from Anthem Blue Cross this month. The company said a comparable Bronze plan would cost her 65% more, or $484 a month. She doubts she’ll qualify for much in premium subsidies, if any. Regardless, she resents losing the ability to pick and choose the benefits she wants to pay for.

“I just won’t have health insurance because I can’t pay this increase,” she said.

Most Americans are required to have health coverage starting next year or pay a fine of $95 per adult or 1% of their income, whichever is greater. The fines increase over time.

A number of factors are driving up rates. In a report this year, consultants hired by the state said the influx of sicker patients as a result of guaranteed coverage was the biggest single reason for higher premiums. Bob Cosway, a principal and consulting actuary at Milliman Inc. in San Diego, estimated that the average individual premium in 2014 will rise 27% because of that difference alone.

Individual policies must also cover a higher percentage of overall medical costs and include 10 “essential health benefits,” such as prescription drugs and mental health services. The aim is to fill gaps in coverage and provide consumers more peace of mind. But those expanded benefits have to be paid for with higher premiums.

The federal law also adjusts how rates are set by age, a change that gives older consumers a break and shifts more costs to younger people. Rates by age can vary by only 3 to 1 starting next year as opposed to 6 to 1 in some cases now in California. People in their 20s just starting their careers may earn so little they qualify for subsidies. But that might not be the case for consumers who are slightly older and earning more.

“It has the effect of benefiting people in their 50s and 60s and shifting costs to people in their 20s and 30s,” said Patrick Johnston, president of the California Assn. of Health Plans. “Benefits are being increased for all, but it’s not government subsidies for all. Some will pay more.”

Rates would be going up regardless of changes from the healthcare expansion. The average individual premium will climb 9% next year because of rising healthcare costs and increases in medical provider reimbursement, according to Milliman’s estimates.

Some consumer groups have questioned whether insurers are inflating their rates under the guise of the healthcare law changes.

“We believe the prices are higher than they should be,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a Santa Monica advocacy group. “This is giving a bad name to the Affordable Care Act.”

State regulators checked the insurance companies’ math and underlying cost projections for next year, but they don’t have the authority to deny increases. Under federal rules, insurers can be ordered to issue rebates if they don’t spend a minimum amount of every premium dollar on customers’ medical care.

“The rates aren’t going up because insurance companies are pocketing more money,” Lee said. “That is what it takes to pay the claims and deliver the healthcare.”

Javier Lopez, 38 and a self-employed aerospace engineer in Huntington Beach, pays about $750 a month for an Anthem Blue Cross plan for his family of four. His premiums may rise nearly 20% next year for a new policy because his current plan is being phased out.

Lopez says he’s willing to absorb that one-year jump if it means the government can rein in future rate hikes.

“I’m hoping with this reform,” Lopez said, “we won’t see big increases year after year.”

Kaiser Health News

Only a handful of states have rules similar to New York%27s.

Starting Jan. 1%2C the federal health law will require nearly everyone to carry insurance.

President Obama mentioned New York%27s lower rates during a speech touting the benefits of the 2010 health law.

This story was originally published July 20, 2013.

New York's announcement this week that insurance premiums would drop 50% next year for individuals buying their own coverage in new online marketplaces made good talking points for proponents of the Affordable Care Act, but consumers in most states are unlikely to see similar savings.

That's because only a handful have New York's rules, which — like the federal law — bar insurers from rejecting people with health problems. Unlike the federal law, however, New York does not require consumers to purchase coverage, so over time, mainly older, sicker people, have purchased coverage. That drove up prices and discouraged younger, healthier people from buying policies, as did a requirement that insurers charge the same rates regardless of age or health status.

As a result, premium prices listed for individuals often top $1,000 a month for some New Yorkers buying their own coverage, making the state's rates among most expensive in the nation.

""New York with such extreme rules sets the stage for a larger drop in rates than you'd expect to see in many other states,"" said Paul Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a non-partisan think tank in Washington D.C. ""It's clearly in the minority.""

A handful of other states — including Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Vermont — have similar rules barring insurers from rejecting applicants with health conditions when selling coverage directly to individuals. Only Massachusetts currently requires the flip side of that equation: that consumers also purchase coverage or face a fine.

Starting Jan. 1, the federal health law will require nearly everyone to carry insurance, with the aim of expanding the markets to include the young and healthy, who can be charged less than older people. At the same time, subsidies become available to help people earning up to about $44,680, helping offset the costs of those premiums. Those changes could moderate costs not just in New York, but in those other states that currently require insurers to sell to all comers — if it works to bring more young and healthy people into the market, according to the Society of Actuaries and other experts.

In New Jersey, benefit firm Milliman projects up to a 25% reduction in premiums for some consumers who buy their own insurance as a result of the health law, for similar reasons. Individual coverage costs about 60% more in that state than the national average. New Jersey officials have not yet disclosed proposed or final premium prices for the new online market.

In Vermont, the actuary group predicted a more substantial drop, but when the state released its proposed premium rates for next year, the rates were largely unchanged.

Vermont, however, is a small, rural state with only two insurers offering to sell policies in the marketplace; only about 9% of the state's residents lack insurance, compared with a 16% average nationwide.

That contrasts with New York, where 17 insurers have been approved to sell coverage, and fewer than 26,500 people out of 2.6 million uninsured buy their own coverage currently, according to state data analyzed by the United Hospital Fund.

""Competition helps drive down health insurance costs for consumers and businesses,"" said Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.

Another factor contributing to lower-than-expected premiums in some places is how the policies are structured. Many insurers nationally are creating smaller networks of doctors and hospitals, or limiting the range of prescription drugs they will cover as a way to lower premiums, said Dan Mendelson, CEO of Avalere Health, a private research firm in Washington, which recently released a study showing that premium prices may be lower than expected in some states.

President Obama mentioned New York's lower rates during a speech touting the benefits of the 2010 health law on Thursday, saying ""the progress we're seeing in California and Washington and Oregon and now New York – that's progress that we want to see across the country.""

He was seeking to rebut Republican criticism of the health law, and the largely symbolic vote by the Republican-led House of Representatives to postpone the requirement that everyone buy insurance. The so-called individual mandate is at the heart of the law and without it, the exchanges could lose the business of the younger and healthier people needed to balance out the higher costs of older, sicker people.

The administration released its own analysis showing that individual premiums in the online marketplaces will be 10% to 18% less than projected next year, based on an average of rates in 10 states and the District of Columbia. While the rates insurers will charge in most states won't be known until closer to the time enrollment begins, Oct. 1, the administration was able to analyze proposed and final premium prices from California, Colorado, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington state and D.C.

Although the administration said the figures show the health law is working, the premiums cited may not reflect what individual consumers will actually pay next year, because the numbers are averaged within and across states. As a result, some consumers in those states are likely to pay more than they do now, while others will see savings.

""The impact of the ACA will vary considerably depending on a person's age, gender, health status, and where they live,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for the America's Health Insurance Plans. ""Simply looking at averages doesn't tell you what these reforms are going to mean for a particular person in a particular state.""

Many Democrats also want to see a more aggressive and visible president to push the law across the country. This week Mr. Obama is returning to the fray to an extent unseen since he signed the law in 2010, including a White House event on Friday to promote the law’s benefits for women, the first in a series of appearances for health care this year.

A number of health insurance changes have already taken place, but this fall, just as the 2014 election season heats up, is the deadline for introducing the law’s core feature: the insurance marketplaces, known as exchanges, where millions of uninsured Americans can buy coverage, with subsidies for many.

For the third time, Republicans are trying to make the law perhaps the biggest issue of the elections, and are preparing to exploit every problem that arises. After many unsuccessful efforts to repeal the law, the Republican-led House plans another vote soon. And Republican governors or legislatures in many states are balking at participating, leaving Washington responsible for the marketplaces."

http://news.yahoo.com/study-health-overhaul-raise-claims-cost-32-pct-173335479--politics.html,,[],Study: Health overhaul to raise claims cost 32 pct,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Insurance companies will have to pay out an average of 32 percent more for medical claims on individual health policies under President Barack Obama's overhaul, the nation's leading group of financial risk analysts has estimated.

That's likely to increase premiums for at least some Americans buying individual plans.

The report by the Society of Actuaries could turn into a big headache for the Obama administration at a time when many parts of the country remain skeptical about the Affordable Care Act.

While some states will see medical claims costs per person decline, the report concluded the overwhelming majority will see double-digit increases in their individual health insurance markets, where people purchase coverage directly from insurers.

The disparities are striking. By 2017, the estimated increase would be 62 percent for California, about 80 percent for Ohio, more than 20 percent for Florida and 67 percent for Maryland. Much of the reason for the higher claims costs is that sicker people are expected to join the pool, the report said.

The report did not make similar estimates for employer plans, the mainstay for workers and their families. That's because the primary impact of Obama's law is on people who don't have coverage through their jobs.

The administration questions the design of the study, saying it focused only on one piece of the puzzle and ignored cost relief strategies in the law such as tax credits to help people afford premiums and special payments to insurers who attract an outsize share of the sick. The study also doesn't take into account the potential price-cutting effect of competition in new state insurance markets that will go live on Oct. 1, administration officials said.

At a White House briefing on Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said some of what passes for health insurance today is so skimpy it can't be compared to the comprehensive coverage available under the law. ""Some of these folks have very high catastrophic plans that don't pay for anything unless you get hit by a bus,"" she said. ""They're really mortgage protection, not health insurance.""

Story continues

A prominent national expert, recently retired Medicare chief actuary Rick Foster, said the report does ""a credible job"" of estimating potential enrollment and costs under the law, ""without trying to tilt the answers in any particular direction.""

""Having said that,"" Foster added, ""actuaries tend to be financially conservative, so the various assumptions might be more inclined to consider what might go wrong than to anticipate that everything will work beautifully."" Actuaries use statistics and economic theory to make long-range cost projections for insurance and pension programs sponsored by businesses and government. The society is headquartered near Chicago.

Kristi Bohn, an actuary who worked on the study, acknowledged it did not attempt to estimate the effect of subsidies, insurer competition and other factors that could mitigate cost increases. She said the goal was to look at the underlying cost of medical care.

""Claims cost is the most important driver of health care premiums,"" she said.

""We don't see ourselves as a political organization,"" Bohn added. ""We are trying to figure out what the situation at hand is.""

On the plus side, the report found the law will cover more than 32 million currently uninsured Americans when fully phased in. And some states — including New York and Massachusetts — will see double-digit declines in costs for claims in the individual market.

Uncertainty over costs has been a major issue since the law passed three years ago, and remains so just months before a big push to cover the uninsured gets rolling Oct. 1. Middle-class households will be able to purchase subsidized private insurance in new marketplaces, while low-income people will be steered to Medicaid and other safety net programs. States are free to accept or reject a Medicaid expansion also offered under the law.

Obama has promised that the new law will bring costs down. That seems a stretch now. While the nation has been enjoying a lull in health care inflation the past few years, even some former administration advisers say a new round of cost-curbing legislation will be needed.

Bohn said the study overall presents a mixed picture.

Millions of now-uninsured people will be covered as the market for directly purchased insurance more than doubles with the help of government subsidies. The study found that market will grow to more than 25 million people. But costs will rise because spending on sicker people and other high-cost groups will overwhelm an influx of younger, healthier people into the program.

Some of the higher-cost cases will come from existing state high-risk insurance pools. Those people will now be able to get coverage in the individual insurance market, since insurance companies will no longer be able to turn them down. Other people will end up buying their own plans because their employers cancel coverage. While some of these individuals might save money for themselves, they will end up raising costs for others.

Part the reason for the wide disparities in the study is that states have different populations and insurance rules. In the relatively small number of states where insurers were already restricted from charging higher rates to older, sicker people, the cost impact is less.

""States are starting from different starting points, and they are all getting closer to one another,"" said Bohn.

The study also did not model the likely patchwork results from some states accepting the law's Medicaid expansion while others reject it. It presented estimates for two hypothetical scenarios in which all states either accept or reject the expansion.

Larry Levitt, an insurance expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, reviewed the report and said the actuaries need to answer more questions.

""I'd generally characterize it as providing useful background information, but I don't think it's complete enough to be treated as a projection,"" Levitt said. The conclusion that employers with sicker workers would drop coverage is ""speculative,"" he said.

Another caveat: The Society of Actuaries contracted Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, to do the number-crunching that drives the report. United also owns the nation's largest health insurance company. Bohn said the study reflects the professional conclusions of the society, not Optum or its parent company.

When asked whether the nonpartisan GAI report shows a deficiency in Obama’s “leadership skills” during his White House press briefing, Carney alleged that “cabinet secretaries don’t regularly get entered into the visitor’s logs” and alleged that Obama meets “frequently” and “regularly” with Sebelius.

As Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer noted on Fox News’s Hannity on Wednesday, though, GAI examined the White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House, it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” He noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meetings off the books, Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.

The Government Accountability Institute report found that since Obamacare was signed on March 23, 2010, Obama met with “various Cabinet secretaries a total of 277 times,” but his presidential schedule did not “document a single one-on-one meeting” with Sebelius. There was, though, “one instance of Secretary Sebelius meeting jointly with the President and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner.”

According to the White House schedule, Obama “met with secretaries from the Departments of Defense, State, and Treasury for 263 (95%) out of his 277 face-to-face meetings.” Obama also had meetings with “secretaries from the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security, Interior, Labor, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs… [including] two meetings with the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus (not an official Cabinet level post).”

As Breitbart News has reported, GAI “recorded listings as they were contained on the White House and Politico presidential calendars; other forms of communications, such as private emails or phone calls, are not able to be quantified.” They also examined public records on Politico’s White House schedule

Schweizer had previously said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare

“In the case of President Obama, if you look at his calendar, there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all,” Schweizer said on Hannity on Wednesday.

In a piece he wrote for Politico on Thursday, Schweizer mentioned that “perhaps the insular White House team wanted to distance the president from the bureaucratic process in the hopes of granting him a halo of deniability if the launch failed.” He also noted “the lack of meetings reinforces the severity of what the New York Times describes as the ‘deeply dysfunctional relationship between the Department of Health and Human Services and its technology contractors, and tensions between the White House chief of staff and senior health department officials.'”

On Fox & Friends on Friday, Schweizer emphasized that ignorance should never be an excuse for a leader.

“If you’re an executive you need to know for sure–for darn sure–that the rollout is going to work and it’s going to go well,” Schweizer said. “And it’s really incumbent upon a president to contact the people that are involved in this initiative.”

That is not the case with Obama, Schweizer noted, particularly because Obama’s top advisers like Valerie Jarrett “don’t challenge” Obama’s weaknesses and “reinforce this notion that he is so brilliant.”

Schweizer said presidents consult their top advisers in times of war and peace and that “there’s just simply no excuse for him to be this detached on this important piece of legislation which is reorienting one-sixth of the national economy.”"

An estimated 246%2C000 people over 50 are behind bars%2C report says

Some states creating special units to care for older prisoners

Cost of housing inmates over 50 reportedly twice as much as younger prisoners

ASBURY PARK, N.J. -- Convicted of three counts of robbery when he was still a young man, Steven Thomas has been in prison since December 1982. Now 62, frail and suffering from a relapse of Hepatitis C, he's one of an increasing number of inmates in New Jersey's correctional institutions who have grown old behind bars.

""I did a robbery when I was 27, 26 years old, and I've been locked up ever since,"" said Thomas, sitting at the edge of his hospital bed in a hospice unit at South Woods State Prison in Bridgeton. ""I wouldn't want to die here.""

Since 2000, the number of prisoners over age 50 in New Jersey's state prisons has jumped nearly 90 percent. There are now nearly 3,000 older prisoners in the state's eight adult correctional institutions.

The older prisoner population has continued to soar even as the number of adult offenders incarcerated in New Jersey state prisons has declined by 7 percent since 2009, to about 17,000 last year, according to state Department of Corrections figures.

Older prisoners are also the fastest growing segment of the U.S. prison population. There were an estimated 246,000 people over 50 behind bars last year, according to a 2012 American Civil Liberties Union report.

The growing number of older prisoners like Thomas represents a potential fiscal time bomb for the state and nation: Elderly prisoners cost more because almost all expenses related to their health care must be borne by state tax dollars.

If it costs New Jersey an average of $71,000 to care for each elderly inmate, as one study suggests, that would cost taxpayers $21.3 million -- about double the cost for the same number of younger, healthy inmates.

Some states, including Louisiana, have moved to make it easier for older, non-violent offenders to be released early, while others have created separate housing accommodations.

As of 2008, at least 13 states had units set aside solely for elderly prisoners, according to a 2010 Vera Institute of Justice report.

In New Jersey, Department of Corrections spokesman Matt Schuman said there are no ""special or unusual arrangements for the aging inmate population."" Older inmates are mixed in with general inmates.

""Is it morally and financially the right thing to keep them in prison?"" said Tina Maschi, a Fordham University professor who is conducting a study on New Jersey's older inmate population in an effort to develop programs aimed at improving the mental and physical health of elderly prisoners. ""In prison, are we turning a blind eye to the fact that we need to take a look at these older people differently?""

Schuman said the DOC is concerned about the growth in the older inmate population, but plans no changes ""in the immediate future."" Down the road, there may be rising medical costs and ""possibly a requirement for specialized housing,"" he said.

Dispute about who is 'old'

There is some disagreement among researchers and corrections experts as to the age at which an inmate becomes elderly.

The National Institute of Corrections considers prisoners over 50 to be ""elderly"" or ""aging."" That's because those who wind up behind bars have more frequently engaged in unhealthy behaviors -- like using narcotics or drinking -- than the general population. And they've also been less likely to receive regular medical care. Once they're locked up, the stress of prison life tends to prematurely age people, corrections experts say.

Since 1981, the number of prisoners over 55 has grown from about 9,000 nationwide to 124,900 last year. It's estimated to reach more than 400,000 by 2030, according to the ACLU report. Researchers in the study used the 55 and up age group to show the dramatic growth in the number of inmates since there is not enough data tracking 50 and up inmates over time.

Starting in the mid-1970s, a nationwide push to get tough on crime included enactment of mandatory minimum sentences and laws that sends offenders to prison for life if convicted of three serious offenses.

The result: The U.S. prison population soared, growing at 11 times the rate of the general population from 1980 to 2010. There are about 2.3 million people behind bars in the U.S., and with more inmates serving longer sentences, the number of elderly prisoners has also jumped.

In 2012, more than 70 percent of the inmates in New Jersey's state prisons were serving sentences that included mandatory minimum terms before parole, according to the corrections department.

""We have created this situation where people are destined to do long terms in a criminal justice system that was not designed to be a long-term care facility,"" Maschi said.

Elderly more expensive

A 2012 ACLU study estimated that it costs nearly $70,000 a year to house a prisoner over 50, compared with an average of $34,135 for a younger inmate. The increase is primarily driven by much higher health care costs for the older population.

Prisoners over 50 in New Jersey's state correctional facilities have the same health issues common in senior citizens anywhere. Some struggle with high blood pressure or failing eyesight. Some need canes or walkers to get around. Others may need heart bypass surgery or suffer from cancer or dementia.

But unlike those on the outside, prisoners don't qualify for Social Security payments and aren't eligible for Medicaid or Medicare. New Jersey has made prisoners give a $5 co-payment for their medical costs since the mid-1990s, if they are the ones who request medical care, Schuman said.

The co-pays can come from money prisoners earn while working, or from contributions from their families.

Most of the inmates' health care costs are paid for by the corrections department. Maschi said her survey of 667 inmates 50 or older showed 20 percent had vision problems, 17 percent suffered from arthritis, 15 percent had high blood pressure and 11 percent said they had difficulty walking. Nearly one-third had some type of mental illness.

In addition to more medical problems, older inmates, who often are more feeble than their younger counterparts, have a greater chance of being preyed upon by younger inmates looking for easy targets, experts say.

Special prisons, medical parole

Some states have responded to the growing number of elderly inmates by establishing separate prisons to house them, or unique programs to address their distinct needs. In Nevada, the ""True Grit"" program has helped reduce infirmary visits for about 200 prisoners by offering music and art therapy and physical exercise, including wheelchair basketball.

California is building a 1,700-bed prison to house medically infirm prisoners. In 2006, New York opened a special prison unit for the cognitively impaired at its Fishkill facility. Most of the prisoners in the unit suffer from dementia. Washington has an assisted living unit at one of its prisons.

Other states, like Louisiana, have passed laws making it easier for some elderly prisoners to be released after a parole hearing at which their risk for committing future crimes is assessed. Releasing some older prisoners early could shift the cost of their care from states to their family members, and make them eligible for federal programs like Medicaid, experts say.

New Jersey is one of 39 states that have medical parole laws, which allow for the release of seriously or terminally ill prisoners, according to the 2010 Vera Institute of Justice Report.

Sick inmates in New Jersey prisons may apply for medical parole, corrections spokesman Matt Schuman said. The Parole Board makes the final decision. But approval of such requests is ""very rare,"" he said.

The Vera Institute found that even states that have specific geriatric release policies rarely release older inmates. From 2001 to 2008, Colorado released three older offenders. Virginia released four from 2001 to 2007.

The ACLU report urges states to adopt a program similar to Louisiana's, allowing low-risk older offenders to leave prison. The report points to decades of research that shows crime rates decrease steadily after age 24. Almost no crimes are committed by those over 65. Research also shows that older offenders are much less likely to return to prison after they are released.

'I hope I don't die here'

Steven Thomas spends his days at South Woods State Prison in a small room that's part of an 80-bed extended care unit at the medium security facility. Sick inmates in the unit come from facilities all over the state, where they are treated by doctors and nurses in a unit that's similar to a small hospital, according to social work supervisor Rosalind Williams.

The majority are there only temporarily, while they convalesce. Those who are believed to have terminal illnesses, like Thomas, are put in the hospice unit, where some of their care is delivered by trained inmate volunteers.

Thomas dreams of someday leaving South Woods and seeing his three children. He said he regrets his criminal past and would like to go home before he dies. He was denied parole at a hearing in August 2012. His next parole hearing will not be until 2017.

""I did what I did and I take responsibility,"" he said. ""I am totally remorseful for what I did. I have expressed that.""

Thomas' chances of being released, though, are slim in New Jersey.

""I hope I don't die here, but it depends on when they decide to let me go,"" Thomas said. ""How likely am I to go out and do something, the way I am now?"""
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/19/obamacare-enrollment-_n_3779676.html,2013-08-19 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Editor'],New Obamacare Enrollment Campaign Unveiled By Kathleen Sebelius,"WASHINGTON -- With precious time remaining before the health care exchanges established by the president's health care law are up and running, the Obama administration is rolling out new initiatives to encourage enrollment.

The latest of these is set to be unveiled on Monday, when the Department of Health and Human Services will debut a video contest -- complete with cash prizes -- designed to persuade younger consumers to get insurance.

The administration will partner with Young Invincibles, a non-profit youth issues organization, to run the contest, with the goal of reaching those younger Americans who are skeptical of the need for health coverage.

Participants will be encouraged to submit three different types of videos advertising the benefits of the exchanges: a song, an animated short, or a video designed to convince viewers that they aren't invincible. Using funds from the Affordable Care Act's education and outreach budget, HHS will award $3,000 each to the creators of the three most popular and persuasive videos, while second and third place winners will get $2,500 each.

“Educating young people about new coverage options requires an all-hands-on-deck approach,"" Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will say Monday during a speech at a Young Invincibles conference in Houston, according to advanced remarks provided to The Huffington Post. ""For millions of young people, health insurance hasn’t been an option because it’s always been out of reach—because it costs too much, or isn’t offered through a job.""

The contest is designed to dispel the notion that even young and healthy individuals would be better off simply not purchasing health insurance. It may seem like an odd choice of battlegrounds. But attracting the young demographic is key to the effectiveness of the exchanges, providing insurers with the type of low-risk customers that will help lower premiums across the board. It's no coincidence that many conservative opponents of the Affordable Care Act are actively urging young people to skip the exchanges altogether, even though doing so would mean incurring the tax penalty for not having insurance coverage.

The agency's PR budget for the health care law is $75 million (though the $30,000 being spent by the video project comes from a different pool of funds). That may seem like a lot, but HHS will likely be outspent by opponents of the health care law. The department has searched for ways to spread the word about the exchanges at a lower cost, and has turned to allies like Planned Parenthood for help.

People who wish to enter the video submission contest must do so by Sept. 23. On Oct. 1, the day the exchanges go online, the videos will debut on a website created by Young Invincibles and the public will be allowed to vote on them. The winners will be announced on Oct. 21.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Basically, Obamacare isn’t complicated because government social insurance programs have to be complicated: neither Social Security nor Medicare are complex in structure. It’s complicated because political constraints made a straightforward single-payer system unachievable.

It’s been clear all along that the Affordable Care Act sets up a sort of Rube Goldberg device, a complicated system that in the end is supposed to more or less simulate the results of single-payer, but keeping private insurance companies in the mix and holding down the headline amount of government outlays through means-testing. This doesn’t make it unworkable: state exchanges are working, and healthcare.gov will probably get fixed before the whole thing kicks in. But it did make a botched rollout much more likely.

So Konczal is right to say that the implementation problems aren’t revealing problems with the idea of social insurance; they’re revealing the price we pay for insisting on keeping insurance companies in the mix, when they serve little useful purpose.

So does this mean that liberals should have insisted on single-payer or nothing? No. Single-payer wasn’t going to happen — partly because of the insurance lobby’s power, partly because voters wouldn’t have gone for a system that took away their existing coverage and replaced it with the unknown. Yes, Obamacare is a somewhat awkward kludge, but if that’s what it took to cover the uninsured, so be it.

And although the botched rollout is infuriating — count me among those who believe that liberals best serve their own cause by admitting that, not trying to cover for the botch — the odds remain high that this will work, and make America a much better place."

Affordable Care Act requires insurers to treat mental health as they would any other ailment

One study showed 18%25 of young patients were diagnosed with mental illness

Average cost of treating mental illness was %247%2C000 a year per patient

WASHINGTON — High mental health costs for young adults threaten to undermine a key assumption of the Affordable Care Act: that insuring more young people will lower costs because they are healthier and require less expensive care.

The Obama administration estimates that 2.7 million people between the ages of 18 and 30 need to buy health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces to offset the health care needs of older Americans buying insurance as required by the Affordable Care Act. But while those younger Americans may not have physical ailments, they are more likely to have mental health issues that will now be treated the same as physical problems because of the law.

An analysis of insurance records of 6.8 million people 18 to 35 years old by data analysis firm BeyondCore showed that 18% had been diagnosed with a mental health condition, such as depression or an eating disorder, said Arijit Sengupta, the company's CEO.

Treating a young person for depression costs about $7,000, the BeyondCore study showed, about the same as the cost for treating an older person for high blood pressure. But doctors diagnose twice as many people with depression as for high blood pressure, Sengupta said.

""The bad news is there has been a mental health epidemic,"" Sengupta said. ""The good news is, if, for no reason other than we get mental health out the shadows, it will be worth it."" He added that catching mental health issues early could save a lot of money in the long run.

The administration's hypothesis about younger insurance customers may be false, Sengupta said. ""Healthy older people may be more important.""

""There's a lot of conventional wisdom about young, healthy people, but I think that's been a little bit overplayed,"" said Jon Kingsdale, who headed up the Massachusetts health exchange. ""The most important thing is to get people enrolled, whether they're young or not. That's the point of the law.""

""We have been encouraged by the significant public interest in coverage available on the marketplace so far; we are focused on reaching, educating and enrolling as many people as possible; and we are confident we will have a balanced risk pool at the end of open enrollment,"" HHS spokeswoman Erin Shields Britt said.

As more people become insured, either by staying on their parents' insurance until age 26 as now allowed under the new law, or because of the requirement to buy insurance beginning in January, more people will be diagnosed with mental health issues, Sengupta said.

The Affordable Care Act requires health insurers to treat mental illnesses as they would other ailments, such as cancer. In the past, insurance companies offered little or no coverage for mental health disorders or offered limited treatment. For example, a person with depression might be covered for six sessions with a therapist, rather than enough sessions to bring the disorder under control.

While the potential for higher mental health treatment costs may reduce the benefit of adding more young people to the insurance pool, Sengupta and others say middle-aged people who exercise, have healthy diets and have preventive exams may be the ones who help the insurance pool the most.

Several people have predicted a ""death spiral,"" or that so many sick people would sign up for the exchanges that they would force premiums up and make them unaffordable for everyone. The law provides some protection against that, including a tax on non-exchange insurance products that will be used to offset rising costs, if necessary. There are also risk-adjustment provisions for the insurers, as well as $10 billion worth of re-insurance in 2014 for those who sign on higher levels of people with chronic conditions.

Also, Kingsdale said, many young insurance customers may receive federal subsidies to help buy insurance, so they could cost the system more than older customers who have more money to buy insurance without subsidies.

""The tax subsidy pays in, so if you're supposed to pay $100 based on your salary, you're going to,"" Kingsdale said. ""There are higher premiums, but not higher prices for individuals — their price is pretty much fixed based on their income.""

That means younger people are more expensive, he said.

Some analysts have predicted the insurance market could go into a ""death spiral"" without enough young insurance customers buying into the market and driving down rates for everyone. If older and less healthy people dominate the insurance pool, they will end up costing more in benefits and insurers will have to raise premiums to compensate for the higher costs.

So far, however, that hasn't been the case, said Jen Mishory, deputy director of the Young Invincibles, a non-profit group dedicated to persuading young people to buy insurance.

""With all the competition that we've seen in the marketplaces, insurers are putting out a price, and then they're putting out a lower price,"" Mishory said. ""So that's going to drive down costs as much as anything.""

""Having young people as part of the pool is important, but the more people you bring in, the less it matters,"" she said."

Scott Walker signed a law on Friday banning doctors from performing abortions if they don't have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 minutes of their practice.

Story highlights Law says doctors can't perform abortions without admitting privileges in nearby hospitals Planned Parenthood files suit The judge sides with the group The restraining order will stay in place until another hearing next week

(CNN) —

A Wisconsin federal judge has granted a temporary restraining order preventing the state from enforcing a new and restrictive abortion law.

The law, signed by Gov. Scott Walker on Friday, bans doctors from performing abortions if they don’t have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 minutes of their practice.

U.S. District Judge William Conley granted the hold Monday after the Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed suit.

The group alleges the admitting privilege requirement is unconstitutional and treats doctors who perform abortions differently from doctors who perform other types of medical procedures.

Conley agreed.

“There is a troubling lack of justification for the hospital admitting privileges requirement,” he wrote in his 19-page ruling.

He added that the U.S. Supreme Court precedent places the burden upon states to show such laws are “reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health.”

To that end, “the record to date strongly supports a finding that no medical purpose is served by this requirement,” he said.

The restraining order will stay in place pending a fuller hearing on July 17.

The law, which took effect Monday, also requires women to have an ultrasound before getting an abortion, but that portion of the law was not challenged in the Planned Parenthood suit.

Opponents of the Wisconsin legislation allege that restrictions in the law would force the closing of several abortion clinics, and that the law is simply a way to make access to abortions more difficult.

Supporters insist that it would guarantee a safer environment for a woman suffering from abortion-related complications.

Judge Conley questioned that contention, saying, “The current system already handles efficiently the very low percentage of women seeking abortions with serious complications.”

CNN reached out to Walker’s office for response and is awaiting a response.

http://news.yahoo.com/senate-gop-tells-obama-tone-down-attacks-214227808--finance.html,,[],Senate GOP tells Obama to tone down the attacks,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Polite yet firm, Senate Republicans told President Barack Obama on Thursday to tone down his political attacks and prod Democratic allies to support controversial changes in Medicare if he wants a compromise reducing deficits and providing stability to federal benefit programs.

Participants at a 90-minute closed-door meeting said Obama acknowledged the point without yielding ground — and noted that Republicans criticize him freely. ""To quote an old Chicago politician, 'Politics ain't beanbag,'"" the president said.

The discussion came as Obama wrapped up a highly publicized round of meetings with rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties and both houses of Congress in hopes of building support for a second-term agenda of deficit reduction, immigration overhaul and gun control.

Obama met separately with Senate Republicans and House Democrats as legislation to lock in $85 billion in spending cuts and avert a government shutdown on March 27 made plodding progress. Separately the two parties advanced rival longer-term budgets in both houses.

No breakthroughs had been anticipated and none was reported in the closed-door sessions, although Obama told reporters before returning to the White House, ""We're making progress.""

In the Senate, several Republicans told the president his rhetoric was not conducive to compromise.

Sen. John Thune of South Dakota referred to a recent interview in which Obama said some Republicans want to eviscerate Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. ""Nobody here believes those programs ought to be gutted,"" Thune told Obama, the senator later recalled.

""It's better if the president is here fully engaged with us than traveling around the country saying Congress isn't doing its job,"" Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming later told reporters, summarizing comments he and others had made. ""The president needs to be here working side by side with Congress.""

Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said the message to Obama had been: ""Step one is to work with us, not just heckle and taunt us on the campaign trail, and step two is to lead."" The Tennessee lawmaker said Obama must also ""go against the grain in his own party,"" much as Lyndon Johnson did in winning civil rights legislation from Congress in the 1960s or Richard Nixon did in forging an opening with China in the 1970s.

Story continues

Obama has repeatedly told Republicans in recent days he supports curtailing the growth of cost-of-living benefits for Social Security and other benefit programs as part of a compromise, as well as raising costs for wealthier Medicare beneficiaries.

He has also told them they must agree to raise revenue — although not tax rates — as part of any deal.

So far, at least, Republicans have noted that proposals to overhaul Medicare include higher premiums or copays on wealthier seniors. Some also have said they could accept higher revenues as part of tax reform that stimulates economic growth.

Neither approach is likely to guarantee enough revenue to satisfy Obama or congressional Democrats. The president said as much later in the day. According to one lawmaker, he told House Democrats in a separate meeting they need not worry about slowing the rise in cost of living benefits because Republicans so far show no willingness to raise revenues.

If nothing else, the reviews of Obama's meeting with Senate Republicans were uniformly positive.

""We'll see where we go from here, but it was a great meeting,"" said GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who normally is one of the president's sharpest critics in Congress.

Senators emerging from meetings with Obama said the discussions had ranged over the fate of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, regulatory concerns, fracking, deficit reduction and more.

The president declined to be pinned down on the fate of the Keystone Pipeline, which supporters hope to build to ship Canadian oil to the United States. Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota said Obama pledged only to make a decision before the end of the year on the project, which is opposed by environmentalists but supported by some labor unions.

Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., mentioned the Navajo Generating Station, a power plant in Page, Ariz., where the Environmental Protection Agency is requiring the facility's owner to spend $1.1 billion to upgrade emissions controls. Flake recently wrote that a separate federal agency recently said that even with the change, it couldn't guarantee there would be ""any perceptible improvement in visibility at the Grand Canyon and other national parks and wilderness areas.""

While Obama completed his closed-door round of meetings, the Senate slowly worked its way through a bill that locks in $85 billion in spending cuts through the end of the budget year while guaranteeing there won't be a government shutdown.

In a show of bipartisanship, leading senators in both parties agreed to provide flexibility for the departments of Commerce, State, Justice and Homeland Security in apportioning the spending cuts, just as the House did with the Pentagon in its version of the bill.

But there were limits to cooperation — most evidently as Republicans attacked a budget by Senate Democrats that relies on $1 trillion in higher taxes over a decade, makes relatively modest changes to Medicare and envisions deficits indefinitely into the future.

Because Democrats want to restore $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts over the same period — cuts imposed by Washington's failure to strike a broader budget pact — the blueprint authored by Sen. Patty Murray of Washington increases spending slightly when compared with current policies.

McConnell labeled the plan a ""left-wing manifesto masquerading as a budget.""

Democrats on Thursday evening pushed Murray's budget through the Budget Committee on a 12-10 party-line vote, setting up a clash on the Senate floor next week.

A rival plan is expected to come to the Republican-controlled House next week after its approval in committee Wednesday evening. Democrats were as harsh in criticizing it as Republicans were in condemning theirs. The GOP plan cuts $4.6 trillion and eliminates deficits over a decade without any tax increase.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The change, announced Thursday night in a letter that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sent to a group of senators, marks the first exception the administration has allowed to the law’s so-called individual mandate.

Under the new policy, people who have received notices that their health plans are being canceled would qualify for hardship exemptions allowed by the law. Under those exemptions, they could buy low-cost catastrophic health plans or skip buying health coverage altogether.

The low-cost plans, which provide bare-bones coverage, are otherwise available only to some people younger than 30.

The number of people directly affected by the change may be relatively small. Administration officials said earlier Thursday that they believed about 500,000 people nationwide had received notices canceling existing policies and had not yet bought new coverage.

Since those people already had purchased coverage at a time when no law required it, a large percentage of them presumably will buy coverage next year rather than take advantage of the new exemption.

But even if that turns out to be the case and the number of people claiming exemptions is small relative to the size of the insurance market, the political impact of the change could be large. The exemption policy constitutes the first crack in the wall for the requirement to buy coverage.

Republicans, who have campaigned fiercely against the requirement that people buy insurance, probably will now seize on the new exemption as a precedent.

Health insurers have insisted the mandate that everyone buy insurance is necessary to keep coverage affordable and were quick to criticize the new policy.

The change, coming less than two weeks before new health plans take effect on Jan. 1, “could cause significant instability in the marketplace and lead to further confusion and disruption for consumers,” Karen Ignagni, the head of America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, said in a statement.

The new policy stems from one of the biggest political problems Obama has faced with the troubled rollout of the healthcare law -- his promise that the people who liked their existing health plans could keep them. When several million people nationwide began receiving notices that their plans would be canceled because the plans fell short of the new law’s requirements, Obama suffered a sharp drop in public trust.

Democrats in Congress, especially senators facing tough reelection challenges next year, were bitterly upset at the predicament in which Obama’s words had placed them. They have pressured the administration to respond to angry constituents.

Sebelius made the latest concession in a letter to six senators: Democrats Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine of Virginia, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and independent Angus King of Maine. Landrieu and Shaheen are up for reelection in 2014, and the Louisiana race already promises to be close.

In a statement, the six said the change would “help those consumers who have had their plans canceled this year transition more smoothly into the marketplace.”

(CNN) —

White House officials have pressured insurance industry executives to keep quiet amid mounting criticism over Obamacare’s rollout, insurance industry sources told CNN.

Sebelius: ‘I apologize, I’m accountable’ for Obamacare website flaws

After insurance officials publicly criticized the implementation, White House staffers contacted insurers to express their displeasure, industry insiders said.

Multiple sources declined to speak publicly about the push back because they fear retribution.

But Bob Laszewski, who heads a consulting firm for big insurance companies, did talk on the record.

“The White House is exerting massive pressure on the industry, including the trade associations, to keep quiet,” he said.

Laszewski, who’s been a vocal critic of Obamacare, said he’s been asked by insurance executives to speak out because they feel defenseless against an administration that is regulating their business – and a big customer.

Government-backed plans accounted for about half of health care policies last year, a number that is expected to grow over the years.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the idea that administration officials are trying to silence insurance industry insiders is “preposterous and inaccurate.” He added that Laszewski has been a vocal critic of health care reform for two decades.

“Plus, it ignores the fact that every day insurance companies are out talking about the law – in large part because they are trying to reach millions of new customers who will now have new affordable insurance options available from providers through the new Market Places,” Carney said.

Obama and his top advisers have acknowledged problems with the health care website.

On Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was the latest administration official to apologize for the bungled rollout.

Yet she and other officials continue to argue that once they are fully up and running, the insurance exchanges will benefit Americans.

But Obama also has been accused of breaking his promise that people who like their current plans can keep them. Insurers have begun discontinuing policies that don’t meet Obamacare’s beefed up coverage requirements.

Laszewski said insurance company officials are embarrassed that they have to cancel plans and force people into more robust, and possibly more expensive, coverage.

Keep your plan? Maybe not

Insurers, he said, warned the White House that the regulations would lead to discontinued policies.

“One of the things I think is clear here is the Obama administration has no trust in anything the health insurance industry is telling them about how to run a health plan,” Laszewski said.

The federal government has been pushing for electronic medical records for a decade, arguing that they will improve health care and bring down costs. That is still a matter of debate. Critics charge that the system is hobbled by poorly designed software and that some hospitals are using electronic medical records to bill more for the same services.

But a new study suggests that electronic medical records may have another, entirely different use: as a Rosetta Stone for our DNA. Researchers are using them to trace links between genes and disease.

It has been 13 years since scientists first published the rough draft of the human genome and yet they are still just beginning to work out how our DNA influences our health. Most insights in recent years have come from so-called genome-wide association studies."

Police say investigating as attempted murder and suicide

Investigators say %22altercation%22 at family home in western Virginia

Deeds in fair condition%3B Democrat had run for governor%2C attorney general

Virginia state police are investigating a stabbing attack on a prominent state senator as an attempted murder and suicide by his son, who died at the scene, an official said Tuesday.

Creigh Deeds, 55, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for governor of Virginia in 2009, was reported in fair condition after being hospitalized with stab wounds Tuesday.

His son Gus, 24, was dead of a gunshot wound at their home west of Charlottesville, state police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said.

Gus Deeds had undergone a mental health evaluation under an emergency custody order on Monday, according to a Richmond Times-Dispatch interview with Dennis Cropper, executive director of the Rockbridge County Community Services Board.

The younger Deeds was released from Bath County Community Hospital because no psychiatric beds were available across a wide area of western Virginia, Cropper said.

""We're still piecing together the exact circumstances that led to the altercation,'' Geller said at an afternoon news conference in Charlottesville. ""Based on the evidence we have now, we are looking at this as an attempted murder and suicide.''

Geller declined to comment on the mental health aspects of the case, citing legal restrictions on disclosure of personal health matters and the investigation.

She said Deeds was stabbed numerous times in the head and torso but was alert and had given statements to authorities. She said police were not looking for other suspects.

Austin ""Gus'' Deeds was valedictorian of his 2007 class at Bath County High School and had been a student at College of William & Mary since 2007, though not continuously, and had recently withdrawn as a student, the college said in a statement.

""He withdrew from the college last month and was not currently enrolled at the time of his death. Our hearts go out to the entire Deeds family,'' the school's statement said said.

The Treatment Advocacy Center, a Virginia-based non-profit organization that seeks timely treatment of people with severe mental illness, said the Deeds case points to the need for more mental health treatment capacity. It said Virginia has only 15% of the mental illness treatment beds that it needs, based on population size.

""The elimination of hospital beds for people who are psychotic or otherwise need help in a crisis is a driving force behind a long list of terrible consequences, including preventable violent acts,"" said Doris A. Fuller, the center's executive director.

""If there had been a hospital bed available for Gus Deeds, he may be alive today, and his father would not be grievously wounded,'' she said.

Ron Manderscheid, executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors, told USA TODAY earlier this year that spending on public mental health has declined markedly in recent years, and in-patient hospital care is very hard to come by.

Few people, even with insurance, can afford to pay for residential psychiatric care on their own, Manderscheid said. Most families rely on publicly funded hospital care.

""It is virtually impossible to get mental health care for many people who desperately need it,"" Manderscheid said. He noted that one in three people with ""severe"" mental illness never receive any treatment at all. Two in three of those with ""moderate"" illness remain untreated, according to the National Institutes of Health.

Geller said troopers responded to an early-morning 911 call from Deeds' home in Millsboro, where they found his son alive but with a gunshot wound. He died at the scene, she said.

Authorities said Deeds left the home on foot after being stabbed and walked down the hill to Route 42, where he was spotted by his cousin, who was passing by. They went to the cousin's house to call 911. Deeds was then taken to the hospital by helicopter from a nearby farm.

Deeds had four children with his first wife, whom he divorced in 2010. He remarried in 2012.

The longtime state legislator ran unsuccessfully for attorney general in 2005.

In 2009, he defeated Terry McAuliffe for the Democratic nomination for governor in a three-way race, but lost to Bob McDonnell, the current Republican governor. McAuliffe recently won the race for governor as McDonnell's successor.

McDonnell issued a statement saying Virginians were united in prayer for the Deeds family ""in this tough and sad time.""

""The news from this morning is utterly heartbreaking,"" the governor said in his statement. ""Creigh Deeds is an exceptional and committed public servant who has always done what he believes is best for Virginia and who gives his all to public service. He cares deeply about Virginia, and the people of Virginia care deeply for him.""

McAuliffe, the governor-elect, tweeted: ""Dorothy and I are praying for the Deeds family at this difficult time.""

""Stunning news from Bath County,"" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said in a tweet. ""I am praying for @CreighDeeds and his family at this very, very difficult time.""

U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said in a tweet: ""Praying for Creigh Deeds and his family.""

A new report details just how much states are losing because they don’t want to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, and it’s not chump change.



Red states may be sticking to their Republican beliefs in small government, but the Commonwealth Fund finds they are passing up billions in federal funding by saying no to the Medicaid expansion.

“By choosing not to participate, Texas, for example, will forgo an estimated $9.58 billion in federal funding in 2022. Taking into account federal taxes paid by Texas resi­dents, the net cost to taxpayers in the state in 2022 will be more than $9.2 billion,” the report by Sherry Glied and Stephanie Ma of New York University says.

“We find that the Medicaid expansion will be a relatively large source of federal revenue to state enter­prises,"" the report adds. States expanding Medicaid will get, on average, more than twice as much in federal funding than they get in federal highway funds, they said.

It’s the latest report on what Medicaid expansion would mean on a fiscal level to states, and the timing couldn’t be better for the administration of President Barack Obama. The White House has launched a three-week drive to highlight what it says are the benefits of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and Obama has been urging states to expand Medicaid.

The ACA was designed to transform health care in the United States, which most experts agree currently costs too much and leaves far too many people without health insurance. One way to do that is through the health insurance exchanges, where people can buy private insurance and which are dominating the headlines now.

The other way was by requiring states to extend Medicaid to people earning up to about 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $14,800 for single people and $31,000 for a family of four.

Medicaid is usually a cost-sharing program – the federal government pays on average about 57 percent of costs and states pay the rest. But under the expansion, the federal government will pay 100 percent of the additional costs for the first three years. States will have to kick in a very small percentage more each year after that. By 2020, the federal government will pay 90 percent of the costs.

But after a series of challenges to the law, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the Medicaid expansion requirement went too far. States can’t be forced to add more people to Medicaid, the court ruled.

Many Republican-led states immediately said they would not be expanding Medicaid.

“As of November 2013, 20 states have decided to opt out of the Medicaid expansion,” the report said.

Glied and Ma calculated how much this would cost by 2022, and took into account states’ arguments about the so-called woodwork effect – the argument that people who were already eligible for Medicaid but had not applied would do so if they heard about the expansion. These people would still cost states the 43 percent or so of state contributions to Medicaid.

But they also calculated savings. States would not only get the direct federal money, but would save the money that taxpayers end up spending on so-called uncompensated care – when sick or injured uninsured people show up in emergency rooms seeking treatment.

Their calculations show that by 2022, Florida would lose more than $5 billion and Georgia would forgo $4.9 billion. They also looked at what Medicaid brings to states in comparison to two other giant federal programs – federal highway funds and defense funds.

The report projects that Alabama would bring in $2.1 billion in federal funds from expanding Medicaid; $975 million in federal highway funds and $10.4 billion in defense procurement contracts. North Carolina would get $5.7 billion in Medicaid money; $1.3 billion in federal highway funds and $4.6 billion in defense contracts.

Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire and Tennessee are undecided about the expansion. Indiana would bring in nearly $2.6 billion in Medicaid money in 2022; $1.2 billion in highway funds and nearly $5.6 billion in defense contracts.

Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming are not expanding Medicaid.

The Urban Institute, Lewin Group and Rand Corp. have also issued reports showing states will lose billions by not expanding Medicaid.

The decision not to expand Medicaid has more than financial effects. It leaves a lot of people without any inexpensive options for health insurance, because the law assumed states would expand Medicaid and doesn’t provide insurance subsidies for the very poor.



“If adopted by all states, the Medicaid expansion is expected to provide health insurance to as many as 21.3 million Americans by 2022,” the report says.



“No state would experience a positive flow of funds by choosing to reject the Medicaid expansion. Because the federal share of the Medicaid expansion is so much greater than the state share, taxpayers in non-­participating states will nonetheless bear a significant share of the overall cost of the expansion through federal tax payments—and not enjoy any of the benefits,” the report concludes.

UnitedHealth, the nation’s largest private insurer, Aetna Inc. and Cigna Corp. are sitting out the first year of Covered California, the state’s insurance exchange and a key testing ground nationally for a massive coverage expansion under the federal healthcare law.

Meanwhile, the biggest insurers in the state — Kaiser Permanente, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of California — are all expected to participate in the state-run market for individual health coverage.

Covered California, the state agency implementing the federal Affordable Care Act, is announcing the winning bidders and proposed rates Thursday for its insurance exchange, where as many as 5 million residents are expected to shop for coverage next year.

The state has picked a group of health plans for each of 19 regions across California. The insurers will be selling policies with uniform benefits packaged in four broad categories of coverage. For the first time in the individual market, consumers will be able to make easier price comparisons among companies.

But the threat of higher premiums in next year’s revamped market has been a major concern for policymakers who can’t risk alienating too many middle-income, healthier customers who are needed to offset the increased costs of covering sicker, poorer people who have been shut out of the healthcare system for years.

UnitedHealth, Aetna and Cigna are small players now in California’s individual health insurance market. More of their business is focused on large employers, where most Californians receive their health coverage. But the companies signaled a wait-and-see approach on these new government-run marketplaces.

Together, in 2011, those three big insurers had 7% of California’s individual health insurance market, according to Citigroup research. In contrast, Kaiser, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield had nearly 87%, collectively. Anthem Blue Cross is a unit of WellPoint Inc., the nation’s second-largest health insurer.

Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, declined to comment on specific companies ahead of Thursday’s announcement. But he rejected any criticism that diminished competition could lead to higher premiums and fewer choices.

“There will be plenty of price competition for California consumers,” Lee said in an interview Wednesday. “They will be benefiting from robust competition.”

A spokesman for Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealth said, “We are simply taking the time to carefully evaluate and better understand how the exchanges will work to ensure we are best prepared to participate meaningfully in their development.”

Joseph Mondy, a spokesman for Bloomfield, Conn.-based Cigna, said the company chose to participate in exchanges in only half of the 10 states where it sells individual health policies. Those states include Arizona, Colorado and Florida. “We will continue to offer individual plans going forward, but we’ve decided not to participate in Covered California in 2014,” Mondy said.

Aetna, the nation’s third-largest health insurer, based in Hartford, Conn., referred questions to Covered California.

Glenn Melnick, a health policy professor at USC, said there could be advantages and disadvantages if the state’s three largest insurers — Kaiser, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield — grab even more business through the exchange. Their increased market power could give them even better bargaining leverage with hospitals and doctors, helping them to drive down healthcare costs.

But Melnick said it remained to be seen whether “the market is competitive enough that those companies will pass along those savings.”

Melnick said UnitedHealth, Aetna and Cigna may be making a mistake by sitting on the sidelines given California’s size and importance in the healthcare overhaul nationwide. “California is going to be a trendsetter,” he said.

Other health policy experts said the lack of these national health plans in the California exchange isn’t a major problem because the exchange probably will announce some new regional competitors.

“We will see a lot of interesting competition by region,” said Micah Weinberg, a senior policy advisor at the Bay Area Council, an employer-backed nonprofit group in San Francisco.

In March, state officials issued a report estimating that, compared with what individual policies cost now, premiums may rise an average of 30% for many middle-income residents who don’t get their insurance through their employers.

At the same time, lower-income consumers will reap the biggest savings and are projected to save as much as 84% off their coverage thanks to federal subsidies.

In California, individuals earning less than about $16,000 will qualify for an expansion of Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program for the poor. Above that threshold, individuals making less than $46,000 and families earning below $94,000 annually will qualify for federal subsidies.

Starting in January, most Americans will be required to have health insurance or face a penalty.

Updated 1:20 a.m. ET, 11/19/2013 – This is updated from an earlier version, adding more details.

(CNN)- Washington state resident Jessica Sanford was bursting with pride when President Obama mentioned her story during a Rose Garden event on health care reform last month at the White House.

""Who wouldn't?"" Sanford asks. ""I'm a nobody really to have him mention my story.""



Back in October, Sanford had written a letter to the White House to share her good news. The 48-year-old single mother of a teenage son diagnosed with ADHD had just purchased what she considered to be affordable insurance on the Washington state exchange.

""I was ecstatic. I couldn't wait to call the doctor for an appointment on January 2nd,"" Sanford told CNN about the feeling she had when she first enrolled.

Her heartfelt letter made it to the President's hands and then into his October 21 speech.

""'I was crying the other day when I signed up. So much stress lifted.'"" Obama said, reading from Sanford's letter.

The president said Sanford's story was proof, despite the technical problems with the healthcare.gov website, that the Affordable Care Act was working.

""That's what the Affordable Care Act is all about. The point is, the essence of the law - the health insurance that's available to people - is working just fine,"" Obama said.

But then, after Obama mentioned her story, Sanford started having problems. Sanford said she received another letter informing her the Washington state health exchange had miscalculated her eligibility for a tax credit.

In other words, her monthly insurance bill had shot up from $198 a month (she had initially said $169 a month to the White House but she switched plans) to $280 a month for the same ""gold"" plan offered by the state exchange.

Sanford said she was frustrated with the state's error. But she decided to purchase the new plan and thought everything was fine.

It wasn't fine. Last week, Sanford received another letter from the Washington state exchange, stating there had been another problem, a ""system error"" that resulted in some ""applicants to qualify for higher than allowed health insurance premium tax credits.""

The letter said the state exchange was ""disappointed to have discovered this issue"" and apologized.

The result was a higher quote, which Sanford said was for $390 per month for a ""silver"" plan with a higher deductible. Still too expensive

A cheaper ""bronze"" plan, Sanford said, came in at $324 per month, but also with a high deductible - also not in her budget.

Then another letter from the state exchange with even worse news.

""Your household has been determined eligible for a Federal Tax Credit of $0.00 to help cover the cost of your monthly health insurance premium payments,"" the latest letter said.

""I had a good cry,"" Sanford said about her reaction to the latest news from the state.

As a self-employed court reporter, the new quote was simply out of her range.

""This is it. I'm not getting insurance,"" Sanford told CNN. ""That's where it stands right now unless they fix it.""

Sanford, an Obama supporter who voted for the president twice, is careful to say she blames the state of Washington's online marketplace for the mixed signals and not the White House.

She is sorry Obama mentioned her during the October 21 speech.

""I feel awful about it. I support (the Affordable Care Act),"" Sanford said.

But the messy rollout in the other Washington, the nation's capital, was not far from her mind.

""What the hell? Why is it the same story as the federal government?"" Sanford says in disgust with the Washington state exchange. ""They didn't have it ready.""

""They screwed up,"" she added.

Sanford reiterated her frustration in a post to the Washington HealthPlanFinder's Facebook page last Friday.

""Wow. You guys really screwed me over,"" Sanford wrote. ""Now I have been priced out and will not be able to afford the plans you offer. But, I get to pay $95 and up for not having health insurance. I am so incredibly disappointed and saddened. You majorly screwed up.""

In response, a HealthplanFinder posting tried to direct Sanford to a broker for help.

""Jessica, we are very sad and disappointed that the tax credit miscalculation affected you so heavily,"" the comment read, suggesting she try to find a new plan on the site. Sanford responded on Facebook the issue was affordability.

Bethany Frey, a spokeswoman for Washington HealthPlanFinder told CNN on Monday night, ""I'm already looking into this with our client specialist team. I'll let you know what I hear."""

Senate Republicans are pushing renegade Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to wrap up his filibuster-like obstruction of the government funding bill sooner rather than later. Top Republicans want to get the legislation back to the House in time to give Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) an opportunity to attach new healthcare repeal amendments that might have a better chance at achieving GOP policy goals.

But time is not on their side. Money to keep routine government services open runs out Oct. 1, and Cruz has vowed to slow-walk the legislation, using every parliamentary tool at his disposal, in the right flank’s quest to undo the Affordable Care Act.

Wednesday is the first of several procedural votes, a process that could stretch through the weekend as Cruz tries to block Senate Democrats, who have the majority, from stripping the provisions defunding the healthcare law. Boehner would have just hours before facing a government shutdown.

Highlights from Cruz’s speech

“My own view is it would be to the advantage of our colleagues in the House, who are in the majority, to shorten the process,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has distanced himself from Cruz’s strategy. “If the House doesn’t get what we send over there until Monday, they’re in a pretty tough spot.”

After Republican senators convened for back-to-back closed-door strategy sessions Tuesday, many, if not most, embraced the emerging plan.

“It’d be a good place for us to let House Republicans weigh in on this again,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who said the senators had a “good-hearted” discussion. “Delaying the opportunity for the House to send something back, it seems, plays right into the hands of Senate Democrats.”

Republicans in both the House and Senate believe a do-over in the House could have better results, especially if they attach a healthcare provision that would be difficult for Democrats to oppose.

Among the items Republicans are considering are a repeal of the medical device excise tax, which is a part of the healthcare law some Democrats have opposed, or a delay of the individual mandate that all Americans carry health insurance in 2014.

“It seems to some of us the sooner you get it over to the House, the sooner they can address it,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said.

Cruz, though, has shown few signs of pivoting to the new course, especially as tea party groups urge him to stand firm.

Even as Plan B emerged, it remained a work in progress.

“This is merely a disagreement over tactics, and I think you’re beginning to see how the decisions made on tactics are starting to play out,” said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, who has also distanced himself from Cruz’s approach. “Sometimes they have unintended consequences.”

She Also Writes A Weekly Column.']",Ruth Marcus: The real hurdles in Obamacare,"Maybe it was the too-cute-by-half way the administration let slip the news about delaying the requirement that employers provide health care — policymaking by early evening blog post. Any announcement so deliberately low-key had to signal bad news.

Maybe it was wishful thinking on the part of the health-care law’s legions of enemies. “This announcement means even the Obama administration knows the ‘train wreck’ will only get worse,” chirped House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), declaring “a clear acknowledgment that the law is unworkable.”

Whatever the reason, reports of the impending death of Obamacare have been greatly exaggerated. Indeed, reports that postponing the mandate demonstrate that the law is too unwieldy to work have been greatly exaggerated.

Put another way, if you are a fan of the Affordable Care Act and worry about its implementation, or an enemy salivating at the prospect of its implosion, you should focus on other potential problem areas. Among them:

●Whether the insurance exchanges will be up and running by Oct. 1 in a way that’s accessible and comprehensible to consumers.

●Whether there will be enough sign-ups by the “young invincibles” who may believe they are impervious to the need for health insurance but whose premium dollars are essential to keeping overall costs low.

●Whether — and this is perhaps most fundamental — it is possible to implement a change this sweeping and complex in the face of massive political resistance by states whose Republican governors decline to participate and by Republicans in Congress unwilling to consider legislative tweaks or to provide adequate funding for implementation.

In other words, of all the headaches facing Obamacare, the employer mandate isn’t close to the most throbbing.

The essential mandate is the requirement that individuals obtain insurance. The parallel mandate that employers with more than 50 workers offer insurance was something of an add-on, a belt on top of suspenders. Without it, the law still works.

The reason is that most employers covered by the requirement — more than 94 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation — already offer insurance. Their incentives to do so — to attract and retain workers, to take advantage of the tax-free nature of compensation in the form of health-care benefits rather than salary — will remain, regardless of the mandate. Most employers will continue to play, whether or not they have to pay.

Some critics have argued that the employer penalties, $2,000 to $3,000 per worker, perversely incentivize employers to drop coverage because paying the fine would be less costly than providing insurance and because their employees would be able to purchase coverage on exchanges. Yet in Massachusetts, where the employer penalties were far lower than those in federal law, the share of employers offering insurance rose after the mandate took effect.

At the same time, the precise structure of the federal employer mandate is ungainly — or, less charitably, dumb. It kicks in for employees working more than 30 hours a week. Employers may be tempted to game the system — and hurt workers — simply by reducing hours, converting full-time employees to part-timers.

The better approach, as my colleague Ezra Klein has argued, was in the House version of health-care reform, which calculated employer compliance based on the percentage of payroll spent on health care.

So what will be the impact of the delay? There is, granted, a certain irony in the administration freeing employers from the responsibility to provide coverage while individuals continue to face a penalty if they do not obtain it.

Still, as noted earlier, employers that offer coverage now aren’t about to drop it because of this change. As for the relatively small number of employers that would have added coverage in response to the mandate, their workers aren’t out in the cold. They will be able to buy insurance on the exchanges and, because most are low- to moderate-income, will be eligible for federal subsidies to pay the cost.

Similarly, workers whose employer-sponsored coverage is unaffordable (because it exceeds 9.5 percent of incomes) or fails to meet minimum standards are also eligible for subsidized insurance on the exchanges.

In short, the federal government loses income from the expected penalty payments — $10 billion, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. The complications that induced the administration to postpone the employer mandate (how to count workers’ hours or implement reporting requirements) are just that — complications, not insurmountable obstacles.

Expanded access to insurance — the fundamental goal of health-care reform — remains intact.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/26/5-Political-Surprises-in-2013,2013-12-26 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],Top 5 Political Surprises in 2013,"At the beginning of 2013, Obama and his Democrat party were in firm control of the nation’s political terrain. Obama had won a convincing reelection by again boosting turnout of his young and minority voter base. Contrary to expectations, the Democrats gained two seats in the Senate, extending their control of the chamber, and made modest gains in the House. The Republicans, after squandered an almost unprecedented opportunity, were have something of an existential crisis. What a difference a year makes.

Not only did 2013 see a resurgence of the Republican party, it provided a number of political surprises throughout the year. The following were the biggest surprises of the year.

5. The Collapse of Marco Rubio

At the beginning of the year, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) seemed the frontrunner for the GOP nomination in 2016. A poll of Iowa Republicans in January showed him with a commanding lead with a crowded field, running ahead of his closest competitor, Rep. Paul Ryan, by over eight points. In December, however, Rubio polled 8th in Iowa, garnering support from just 6% of Republicans in the state. In national polls, he polls around 6th place. It is a breathtaking political collapse.

Rubio’s political fortunes were reversed by a fundamental misreading of the electorate on immigration reform. There is a robust case to be made for reforming our nation’s immigration system. The approach adopted by the Senate and promoted by Rubio, however, is arguably worse than the current system. It provides immediate legalization for 11 million illegal immigrants and effectively does almost nothing to secure the border. Even the modest security provisions in the bill would likely be ignored by the Obama Administration, which has ignored existing Congressional directives related to the border.

Like amnesty legislation in 1986, it provides legalization with a promise of security that will likely never materialize. Also like the deal in 1986, it will likely provide an incentive for even greater illegal immigration in the future. The GOP establishment and its business allies may still approve immigration reform in 2014, but Rubio’s political standing is unlikely to return.

4. The ObamaCare Rollout Disaster

I always expected ObamaCare to ultimately be a failure. I did not anticipate, however, the smoldering wreckage that was its rollout. The government simply had to build a website with no more complexity than Amazon or any other e-commerce site. It also had hundreds of millions of dollars and three years to build it. Even the government didn’t seem incompetent enough to screw that up.

Oh, but it did.

Even more surprising was the very slow response of the Obama Administration to the obvious disaster. Subsequent reports have detailed several warnings to government officials that the website wasn’t ready to launch, wasn’t secure, and wasn’t even accessible. Did no one take these remotely seriously? Did they think unicorns and pixie dust would mask these failures?

In October, in the aftermath of the government shutdown, Democrats led the generic congressional ballot by eight points. In the wake of the ObamaCare rollout disaster, Republicans have gained an unprecedented 13 points and now lead Democrats by 5.

3. The GOP’s War on Its Base

Inexplicably, the Republican party establishment reacted to its defeats in 2012 by declaring war on its base, conservative voters. Party officials and strategists blamed their defeat on the “tea party” and conservatives, who presumably turned off more “moderate” voters. The problem with this narrative is that the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, won Independents by five points. Republicans lost because the Democrats did a better job turning out their base voters. For the past two elections, the GOP has given its nomination to the most “moderate” candidate running. It is clearly not a recipe for success.

In the past few years, there have been some candidates with strong tea party backing who in the end were flawed. There have been far more “establishment” candidates who also lost. Todd Aiken won the GOP primary in Missouri because the tea party was divided between two other candidates. Richard Lugar had the edge over eventual nominee Richard Mourdock, until it was revealed that Lugar didn’t have an actual residence in his state. At least make a pretense of representing a state. At least six “establishment” and “electable” Senate candidates, enough to secure a majority, went down to defeat in 2012.

The party and its business allies, however, have vowed to challenge conservatives in primaries next year. The GOP establishment will no doubt be able to raise millions to wage this pyrrhic war, but it is hard to see how it will have the “boots on the ground” to win elections. It may very well spark its own destruction as a national political force.

2. Obama’s Irrelevance

Congress ended its year passing the first budget agreement in five years. Most surprising, though, is that it accomplished this because Obama wasn’t part of the negotiations. The Democrats’ lead negotiator, Sen. Patty Murray, intentionally kept the White House out of the talks.

It was a dramatic turn around for a President who won a solid reelection just a year ago. At the start of 2013, Obama’s approval rating was nearly 60%. By a combination of political miscalculation and detachment, Obama has squandered all the political capital he won through his reelection.

He has made high-profile pushes for gun control, immigration reform, climate change and a higher minimum wage. Progress on these issues is arguably harder now than it was before Obama made them priorities.

In foreign policy, an area where second term presidents generally focus, Obama has led a withdrawal of the US from the world stage. America was a passive observer to the dramatic events in Egypt. Our absence allowed Russia to reassert its influence in the region for the first time in decades. China is expanding its influence throughout the world. Obama drew a line in the sand on Syria and then quickly retreated. His outreach to Iran has angered almost all of our allies. They don’t trust us and our enemies don’t fear us.

1. Obama’s Political Resilience

With his approval ratings at the lowest of his Presidency, it may seem counterintuitive to talk about Obama’s political resilience. Consider, however, what he has withstood this year.

We have learned that the government is engaged in comprehensive surveillance of Americans. The NSA tracks our web activity and even keeps records on every phone call we make. Worse, the Administration has lied about its activities repeatedly. The government even targeted reporters it suspected of working with government whistleblowers.

We also learned that the government was using the IRS to target its political opponents. This targeting went beyond supervision of tax-exempt groups and included audits of major Republican donors. When a cancer patient went public with the news that he was losing his health insurance as a result of ObamaCare, he quickly learned he was being audited by the IRS.

PoliticFact names Obama’s oft repeated promise that people can keep their health insurance the “lie of the year.” Millions of Americans have lost their health insurance as a result of his signature legislative achievement. The cancellation of these policies and problems with the law’s implementation raise the real possibility that fewer Americans will have insurance when ObamaCare takes full effect on January 1st.

I could literally run through a half-dozen more issues, any one of which would cripple most presidencies. That’s even before considering the anemic economic “recovery.” Obama does currently have the lowest approval rating of any 2-term President, at this point, since Richard Nixon. Still, between 40-42% of the public approves of the job he is doing. How is this even possible?

The most surprising thing about 2013 is that Obama has absorbed more negative shocks than almost all modern-day presidents combined and yet is still supported by only a little less than half the public. Even his currently low approval ratings defy gravity.

Something’s got to give next year."

(CNN) - The hits to President Obama's popularity, prompted by the botched HealthCare.gov rollout, are simply a natural fluctuation every commander-in-chief faces, Obama told interviewer Barbara Walters in an interview aired Friday.

""If you remember, I've gone up and down pretty consistently throughout,"" Obama said in the ABC interview on Friday. ""But the good thing about when you're down is that usually you've got nowhere to go but up.""



""I got re-elected in part because people did think I was trustworthy and they knew I was working on their behalf,"" Obama said in the network's exclusive.

A CNN Poll of Polls complied Thursday showed the president's approval rating at 41%, near a low of his five years in office. The numbers have dipped as Obama's signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, faces problems with its website and the number of Americans whose health plans are being canceled.

Obama has taken responsibility for the website's flaws, saying he should have been told earlier about the serious issues with HealthCare.gov's digital infrastructure. He's also apologized for his vow that people who liked their plans could keep them.

In Friday's interview, Obama said he was looking for answers soon on why the rollout failed so spectacularly.

""Obviously my most recent concern has been that my website's not working,"" Obama said. ""We're evaluating why it is exactly that I didn't know soon enough that it wasn't going to work the way it needed to. But my priority now has been to just make sure that it works.""

The glitches aside, Obama remained confident the Affordable Care Act, passed along party lines in 2010, would form a large part of his presidential legacy.

""I continue to believe and I'm absolutely convinced that, at the end of the day, people are going to look back at the work we've done to make sure that in this country, you don't go bankrupt when you get sick, that families have that security,"" Obama told Walters. ""That is going be a legacy I am extraordinarily proud of.""

That legacy - and what can be done while he's still in office to bolster it - does weigh on the president's mind, he admitted.

""Every president in their second term is mindful that you've only got a limited amount of time left,"" Obama said. ""You want to make sure that you are squeezing every last ounce of energy that you have to try to deliver on the commitments you made to the American people."""

Laborers’ International Union of North America (LIUNA) President Terry O’Sullivan said, “if the Affordable Care Act is not fixed, and it destroys the health and welfare funds that we have all fought for and stand for, then I believe it needs to be repealed. We don’t want it repealed. We want it fixed, fixed, fixed.”

O’Sullivan added: “We can’t have the unintended consequences for the proud men and women that we represent to be collateral damage in the healthcare fight in this country.”

Big Labor strongly backed Obamacare before its passage. Now unions say the law threatens to destroy union workers’ health insurance plans if changes are not made soon.

Last week, the AFL-CIO passed a strongly-worded resolution blasting Obamacare despite the Obama Administration’s attempts to quell union opposition to aspects of the government healthcare overhaul.

O’Sullivan, borrowing from Vice President Joe Biden’s vulgar words whispered to President Barack Obama upon signing the bill, told the audience, “It’s going to be a big frickin’ deal if our members lose our health insurance!”

Republicans say union members should not be granted special breaks for the Obamacare law they fought to see pass. Sen. John Thune (R-SD) introduced a bill Monday called the Union Bailout Prevention Act to stop the White House from granting unions Obamacare waivers or special taxpayer-funded premium tax subsidies.

“Despite championing ObamaCare’s passage in 2010, union leaders are now awaking to the ugly reality of ObamaCare that most Americans have predicted all along, including higher health care costs,” said Thune. “Now that the full consequences of the Democrats’ law are nearing, these same union leaders are seeking a special backroom deal from the White House.”

Now the battle goes to the Senate, and we’ll find out if Harry Reid is so committed to the horrendous “Un-affordable Care Act” that he’ll be the one to shut down the government to fund the unworkable Obamacare.

Let’s be clear. Republicans in Congress aren’t advocating a government shutdown. That’s why they voted in the House to fully fund our bureaucracy while defunding Obamacare. The conservatives in Congress are listening to the majority of Americans who do not want Obamacare.

Following the will of the people is apparently a novel idea in D.C. these days. Just ask Senator Ted Cruz and his liberty-loving posse on Capitol Hill who have led the charge to defund Obama’s train wreck.

Those of us who hang in there supporting a major political party with our energy, time, and contributions would like to believe that that party would praise principled conservatives like Ted Cruz and Mike Lee for following through on campaign promises. We’d like to believe that the GOP establishment would applaud the way these bold leaders have rallied the grassroots to their cause. But, no, such praise would require a commensurate level of guts and leadership, and the permanent political class in D.C. is nothing if not gutless and rudderless.

We’re now, once again, subjected to the “anonymous sources” backstabbing game. The Capitol Hill cowards are rushing to anonymously denounce Senator Cruz to any reporter with a pad and pen.

Welcome to our world, Ted. The same people have been denouncing conservatives like me for years (right after they ask for help fundraising for themselves or endorsing the latest candidate they’ve suckered into paying their exorbitant consulting fees). We can compare shiv marks next time we meet, my friend.

If the Senate doesn’t get behind Ted Cruz’s efforts to defund Obamacare, it won’t be because of any failure on Ted’s part. It’ll be because there weren’t enough principled leaders to stand with him, and that would be a tragic loss, not for Ted, but for America.

More and more Americans are waking up to the nightmare of Obamacare as its rollout continues. Hardworking families are losing their employer-provided health care coverage. Businesses are cutting back their employees’ hours to skirt Obamacare’s mandates. Americans barely scrapping by are discovering that Obamacare has made health care completely unaffordable. Those who aren’t part of a protected special interest group have been left in the cold.

When you’re living on a fixed income, having to pay hundreds of dollars more each month for health care will cut into your ability to pay for basic necessities like food, electricity, or gas (which has increased 90% under Obama). Open your eyes, America. When the full reality of Obamacare strikes home, we’ll thank God that principled leaders like Ted Cruz and Mike Lee took a stand to stop it in its tracks.

But the permanent political class is handwringing and howling that if there’s a government shutdown the media will blame Republicans for it. Here’s a little newsflash, GOP establishment: Whenever anything bad happens, the media blames Republicans for it. That’s not an excuse to roll over and play dead. It’s a call to follow the advice I give my daughters: Woman up, stand your ground, and fight like a girl!

I want no pity. I need no empathy. But use me as a barometer. Over the years, the leftwing media has falsely and irrationally accused me of everything from faking a pregnancy to abetting murder. They lie. Deal with it.

Republicans in Congress support funding the government. If the Democrats block these funding measures, a government shutdown is on them. In the meantime, stop the ridiculous hysterics. Heck, about the most significant thing that happened during the last government shutdown was Clinton hooked up with Monica.

As I said in my speech at CPAC this year, it’s time for the Senate to put itself on Cruz Control.

Ignore the peanut gallery pundits. They’ve written my political obituary so many times, I’m practically Lazarus. Now they’re trying to destroy Ted Cruz. Good luck with that, you weasels. Texans are just as tough as Alaskans. Smaller, but just as tough.

But here’s the important thing that none of these establishment backstabbers understand. It’s not the messenger that matters. It’s the message. You can try to take out someone like Ted Cruz, but that won’t stop the message from catching fire. The message is liberty, and it’s been resounding ever since a band of patriots dumped tea in Boston harbor.

The message only grows stronger. The grassroots is bigger than any one person. We the People will rise up, and we will make our voices heard. Right now, Ted Cruz is speaking for us in this Obamacare fight. God bless him for it.

Hang in there, Ted and Mike. You have millions of supporters among ordinary hardworking Americans. We support you because you don’t shy away from the fray. May your colleagues in the Senate gain the wisdom to support your excellent efforts so that you can see that the view is better from inside the bus than under it.

Oh, and a little reminder to Republican senators up for re-election in 2014: Moose season ends soon, allowing more time on one’s hands. So, we’ll be watching your votes very carefully this week."

Americans are getting slammed by Obamacare right now. Workforces are decimated as health care prices rise. Public opinion is on our side. If now was not the time to unite and fight it, when was? Those who are attacking Cruz and Lee’s efforts have forgotten how negotiations are won.

Use as an example the negotiations a governor of energy-rich Alaska must engage in with powerful multinational oil tycoons. In my experience, I found that the key to achieving success for the people you’re elected to serve is to take a firm position, stand solid, and negotiate from there when the other guy is ready to take you seriously. You fight as hard as you can with whatever small edge you’ve got until the other guy respects you enough to wise up, sit down, and come to a mutually acceptable agreement. You get nothing at all if you preemptively surrender before the battle even commences.

Imagine how much stronger the GOP’s hand would have been if every Republican (and those Democrats who’ve finally admitted Obamacare’s devastating flaws) stood together against cloture in order to prevent Harry Reid from cutting off debate and stripping Obamacare defunding from the bill?

Not only would there have been pressure on red state Democrats up for re-election to join the right cause, there would have been pressure on Reid and the White House to negotiate agreements. Even if the GOP couldn’t have defunded all of Obamacare, they could have negotiated some relief for average Americans who now feel they can do nothing but brace for the coming train wreck. We average Americans know we’ll never get the exemptions and favors Obama gave his political cronies and Congress, but any relief for the middle class would have been welcomed.

But Republicans got nothing from squabbling with each other and denouncing (on and off the record) the brave men who tried to do something.

Ted Cruz and Mike Lee fought to fulfill the campaign promises every Republican made, and their actions have been revelatory for all of us.

Hunters know what flushing dogs do. Cruz and Lee were acting as the grassroots’ flushing dogs. Their actions showed us who was willing to stand up for hard working Americans and who wasn’t. We thank Senators Vitter, Paul, Crapo, Enzi, Fischer, Roberts, Scott, Heller, Grassley, Toomey, Moran, Rubio, Shelby, Risch, Inhofe, Portman, and Sessions for standing with Cruz and Lee.

In 2010, a galvanized grassroots rallied against Obamacare to carry Republicans to victory. But in 2012, many in the grassroots stayed home, and we saw how that turned out for the GOP.

Unfortunately, the message of some politicians today seems to be: “Whoopsie, seems I can’t fulfill my election promises, but vote for me again and I promise to do what I promised last time.”

Sorry, that doesn’t cut it. America, you deserve better. If they can’t do anything with the power you gave them through their elected office, then you deserve someone else to give it a try.

2014 is just around the corner, and we’re ready for it. Support those who do us a favor by flushing out politicians wanting to hide. Retrieving liberty must be the point in all this."

""Buy Health Insurance,"" it touted with premiums as low as $25 a month. I was tempted.

Health insurance, for me and for most Americans, is a necessary part of life, similar to home rent or mortgage, grocery bills and gasoline. Insurance is essential because a hospitalization for a few days costs $10,000 and medical bills for a major illness can lead to hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments. So it is no wonder that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), aka Obamacare, has created anxiety among many Americans.

And, without doubt, the ACA has caused the health insurance market to go into upheaval, with a nonfunctional healthcare.gov website, with unexpected insurance cancellation notices, and now with a proposed ""fix"" by President Obama.

So let me try to put things in perspective.

The ACA is really a ""Health Insurance Reform Act"" -- its greatest impact is to increase the number of insured individuals, to guarantee essential benefits, and to regulate health insurance companies. Perhaps most importantly, it promises health insurance no matter what your preexisting conditions are.

I have patients who stop coming to the clinic after the few initial visits and then become so ill they have to be admitted to the hospital. When I ask them why they stopped taking their lifesaving medicine and making clinic visits, their response is simple: ""My insurance ran out.""

We know such substandard insurance plans abound. Of all the bankruptcies in America, 60 percent are due to medical bills, and 78 percent of these, are among patients who had health insurance and paid their monthly premiums. Imagine, going bankrupt from medical bills when you have health insurance. This defeats the purpose of having insurance. The ACA helps individuals by standardizing insurance benefits into 10 essential categories which include coverage for hospitalization, maternity, chronic disease and mental health, among others.

Some say the ACA standardization is an upgrade of the insurance coverage. But I don't believe it's an upgrade from ""economy to the business class"" -- it's more like having all the basic safety features. It's like going from a single engine Cessna to a commercial plane.

That insurance coverage offered on the telephone pole for $25 a month and those policies being cancelled fall into this category.

The transition from substandard policy to standardized coverage will be difficult. A 30-year-old man is upset because he now has to pay a higher premium than a 30-year-old woman has to pay. But honestly, discriminating against a young woman by having her pay higher health insurance premiums because she might bear children one day is morally unacceptable.

To ease the transitions, the ACA had a ""grandfather clause"" -- which is where the phrase ""If you like your coverage you could keep it"" originated. However it was only if no changes where made to it after March 2010 when the law was passed. The ""fix"" President Obama has proposed is to extend the grandfather clause.



Another major impact of ACA on health insurance is stricter regulation. Now, insurance companies are required to spend 80 to 85 percent of the premium money towards clinical care services (not administration) -- and any additional money has to be refunded. In 2012, under the ACA, $1.1 billion dollars were returned to policyholders through refunds. Such regulations ensure that insurance companies don't make a killing off of policyholders.

The biggest question looming on the mind of most Americans is probably this: How will all these changes impact premiums? It's hard to tell. But it will not be a repeat of the decade before the ACA, where premiums doubled and many were dropped from their insurance just when they needed it most. Yet, the transition will be a bumpy ride.

The delay in functionality for the so-called SHOP exchanges represents the latest setback in the Obama administration's efforts to implement the three-year-old Affordable Care Act. The development also comes just days before HealthCare.gov, the online portal for individual and family health coverage in more than 30 states, is supposed to be working better after its troubled first two months.

Small businesses that want to utilize the federally run SHOP exchanges, and the tax credits worth up to half the cost of insurance that are available to some firms, will have to sign up through an insurance agent or broker or directly with a health insurance company, an administration official explained via email. In an attempt to mitigate the failure of the online application and enrollment process that was supposed to be in place, small businesses can submit their applications for tax credits whenever they file their taxes rather than in advance, the official wrote.

“This new delay announcement is a disappointment but not a surprise. Small businesses continue to be low on the priority list during the Obamacare implementation process,"" Kevin Kuhlman, manager of legislative affairs at the National Federation of Independent Business, said in a written statement. ""The continued delays add to uncertainty and contribute to the decision of many owners to take early renewals of their small-group plans.” The National Federation of Independent Business opposed the Affordable Care Act and was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit challenging its constitutionality, which the Supreme Court ultimately upheld.

The administration previously said online enrollment on the SHOP exchanges would be available by the end of this month, following earlier delays. Prior to Wednesday's announcement that the administration would facilitate enrollment via insurers, agents and brokers, paper applications were the only means small companies could employ to utilize the SHOP exchanges. Maryland also delayed its state-run SHOP exchange, though other states' exchanges are operational. The federal government is operating SHOP exchanges in more than 30 states, and the remainder are being run by states.

""Small businesses will able to enroll directly into a SHOP plan through an insurer, agent or broker, and get can certified for a tax credit after they enroll. We will also offer an improved comparison shopping feature online so small businesses can choose a plan before enrolling in one,"" Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said during a conference call with reporters Wednesday.

Unlike the federal- and state-run health insurance exchanges for individuals and families that limit sign-up to a certain period during the year, the SHOP exchanges are supposed to allow companies to enroll workers at any time. Still, companies with current benefits that expire at the end of the year have until just Dec. 23 to choose a health plan that will be in effect on Jan. 1, the official wrote.

The delay of the SHOP exchanges is partly a byproduct of the administration's scramble to get HealthCare.gov reliably working for individual consumers, Bataille indicated. ""It was important for us to prioritize the functionality that would enable consumers, individually, to shop and enroll online in coverage,"" she said.

Online enrollment won't be possible on the SHOP exchanges until next year for benefits that will be available in 2015, the administration said.

Earlier this year, the administration delayed another key component of the SHOP exchanges. Under health care reform, small business employees were supposed to be able to choose among any of the plans available on the exchanges. For 2014, employers will select the coverage for all workers instead.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) ended his symbolic filibuster Wednesday as Senate rules forced him to stop talking. Senators then voted to push ahead with the bill to fund the government that the Texan and his allies had tried to stall all night long.

Cruz quit at noon to a smattering of Republican applause, ceding the floor at the technical start of a new legislative day after holding forth for more than 21 hours. He could have spoken longer, but had to stop for good at 1 p.m. for a vote to proceed with debate on the spending bill.

The Senate voted unanimously to do so, including Cruz.

Cruz is trying to block the spending bill, already passed by the House last week, even though it contains the provisions he requested to defund President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Money to keep the government open runs out Sept. 30, and Cruz is seeking to block the bill because he doesn't want Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to have the opportunity to amend the measure.

The Texas senator has pointed to the next procedural vote in the process on Friday or Saturday -- to end debate -- as the key one in the fight. After that, Reid would be able to amend the bill with just 51 votes.

But killing the legislation in the Senate would guarantee a government shutdown, and senators on both sides of the aisle would prefer to move the spending portion quickly, in hopes of leaving enough time to work out some sort of deal with the House.

Still, Cruz, aided by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and several other senators, talked through the night, hoping to stall the process.

Cruz spoke at seemingly infinite length, comparing his desire to defund Obamacare to the battle against the Nazis, the American Revolution, and other moments that he said were similar in that people said some fight couldn't be won.

He resorted to many well-worn talking points against the health care law, and also sprinkled in the sorts of odd references that can crop up when someone talks for so long, reading Green Eggs and Ham to his daughters via C-Span, claiming that his dad invented that dish, and even channeling Darth Vader in response to a line from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).

""I will confess that that phrase, a 'rebellion against oppression,' conjured up to me the rebel alliance fighting against the empire, the empire being the Washington, D.C., establishment,"" Cruz said on Wednesday morning. ""I wondered if at some point we were going to see a tall gentleman in a mechanical breathing apparatus come forth and say in a deep voice, 'Mike Lee, I am your father.'""

""This is a fight to restore freedom to the people,"" he added, completing the analogy. ""This is a fight to get the Washington establishment -- the empire -- to listen to the people.""

Cruz's talkathon would have constituted the fourth longest filibuster in modern history, but Democrats have been calling it a ""faux filibuster"" because it had no chance to stop the vote, which was already determined under the chamber's rules.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) emerged shortly after Cruz yielded the floor to commend the Texas senator for holding the floor ""for nearly a day, speaking passionately about an issue that unites every single Republican.""

But McConnell had been noticeably absent from Cruz's talkathon after stating Tuesday that he disagreed with his colleague's approach, which he said would put House Republicans in a ""tough spot.""

The biggest opposition to Cruz's tactics came from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has butted heads with the junior senator all year. In a lengthy floor speech ahead of the vote, McCain dubbed Cruz's marathon a case of ""extended oratory.""

""I can't call it a filibuster because filibusters delay passage of legislation,"" McCain said.

He added that Obamacare was ""a major issue in the [2012] campaign.""

""I campaigned all over America for two months everywhere I could, and in every single campaign rally I said, 'And we have to repeal and replace Obamacare,'"" McCain said. ""Well, the people spoke. They spoke, much to my dismay, but they spoke and they reelected the president of the United States.""

""Now, that doesn't mean that we give up our efforts to try to repeal and replace Obamacare, but it does mean that elections have consequences,"" he added."

Millions of Americans have already been forced out of their existing health care policies, a number that may skyrocket in the new year.

Russell Simmons sees it differently.

The hip-hop mogul says ObamaCare is already so successful it’s saved thousands, if not millions of lives.

Yes, we initially wanted single payer, and we had to compromise back in 2009 for the Affordable Care Act. But, it is a damn good piece of legislation that has already saved hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lives. So, let us not give up now.

Simmons blasted the 39 house Democrats who voted in favor of tweaking ObamaCare, but he saved his harshest words for the GOP in toto.

I know where Republicans stand. They have voted 47 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, so their stance is clear. If you get sick, you’re on your own. If you can’t pay for your medical expenses, declare bankruptcy. If you have a pre-existing condition, they’ll send you a get well card when you’re on your death-bed. Whatever President Obama stands for, they stand for the opposite. Even if it goes against every principle they have advocated for in the past, they would rather destroy our country, than see President Obama pass policy that is good for ALL Americans.

As for the millions who already lost their health care plan thanks to ObamaCare’s arrival, Simmons says they should simply say, “good riddance.” He simply knows better than you. Period."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The change, announced Thursday night in a letter that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sent to a group of senators, marks the first exception the administration has allowed to the law’s so-called individual mandate.

Under the new policy, people who have received notices that their health plans are being canceled would qualify for hardship exemptions allowed by the law. Under those exemptions, they could buy low-cost catastrophic health plans or skip buying health coverage altogether.

The low-cost plans, which provide bare-bones coverage, are otherwise available only to some people younger than 30.

The number of people directly affected by the change may be relatively small. Administration officials said earlier Thursday that they believed about 500,000 people nationwide had received notices canceling existing policies and had not yet bought new coverage.

Since those people already had purchased coverage at a time when no law required it, a large percentage of them presumably will buy coverage next year rather than take advantage of the new exemption.

But even if that turns out to be the case and the number of people claiming exemptions is small relative to the size of the insurance market, the political impact of the change could be large. The exemption policy constitutes the first crack in the wall for the requirement to buy coverage.

Republicans, who have campaigned fiercely against the requirement that people buy insurance, probably will now seize on the new exemption as a precedent.

Health insurers have insisted the mandate that everyone buy insurance is necessary to keep coverage affordable and were quick to criticize the new policy.

The change, coming less than two weeks before new health plans take effect on Jan. 1, “could cause significant instability in the marketplace and lead to further confusion and disruption for consumers,” Karen Ignagni, the head of America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, said in a statement.

The new policy stems from one of the biggest political problems Obama has faced with the troubled rollout of the healthcare law -- his promise that the people who liked their existing health plans could keep them. When several million people nationwide began receiving notices that their plans would be canceled because the plans fell short of the new law’s requirements, Obama suffered a sharp drop in public trust.

Democrats in Congress, especially senators facing tough reelection challenges next year, were bitterly upset at the predicament in which Obama’s words had placed them. They have pressured the administration to respond to angry constituents.

Sebelius made the latest concession in a letter to six senators: Democrats Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine of Virginia, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and independent Angus King of Maine. Landrieu and Shaheen are up for reelection in 2014, and the Louisiana race already promises to be close.

In a statement, the six said the change would “help those consumers who have had their plans canceled this year transition more smoothly into the marketplace.”

USA TODAY

Enrollment functions of site will be unavailable during off-peak hours this weekend

The website will remain open for general information

Federal and state health insurance websites experienced problems this week

The government website launched this week to sell health insurance was overwhelmed by up to five times as many users as it was designed to handle, President Obama's top technology adviser said Saturday in an exclusive interview with USA TODAY.

U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park said the government expected HealthCare.gov to draw 50,000 to 60,000 simultaneous users, but instead it has drawn as many as 250,000 at a time since it launched Oct. 1.

Park's comments are the administration's most detailed explanation for the glitches that have frustrated millions of consumers who have tried to enter the site or complete applications for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.

""These bugs were functions of volume,'' Park said. ""Take away the volume and it works.''

The administration built the site's capacity based partly on the all-time high of 30,000 simultaneous users for Medicare.gov, an existing site where senior citizens can buy or renew prescription-drug plans under Medicare Part D, Park said. Its theoretical maximum capacity hasn't been disclosed.

More than 8.1 million consumers visited the site from Tuesday through Friday, according to the White House. The administration hopes that as many as 7 million consumers eventually will sign up for health insurance through the government marketplace.

HealthCare.gov's enrollment functions are shut down at off-peak hours this weekend so technicians can make repairs to the site.

``We're obviously not satisfied with the performance,'' Park said. ``We're working 24-7.''

The site will be running better by early next week, he said, though he declined to make specific guarantees. The administration isn't yet prepared to say how many simultaneous users the upgraded site will be able to handle, he added.

The administration's explanation didn't impress a Bush administration official who helped launch Part D in 2006.

""Whoever thought it would draw 60,000 people wasn't reading the administration's press releases,'' said David Brailer, former national coordinator of health care information technology. ""The Medicare Part D site was supposed to have 20,000 simultaneous users and was (built for) 150,000, and that was back when computing was done on an abacus. It isn't that hard.''

The volume since Tuesday overwhelmed a specific component of software on the HealthCare.gov site that lets people create accounts, enabling them to shop for insurance plans available in their state, Park said.

The part of the site that explains generally how the new law will work, and gives broad information about the kinds of plans available, has worked throughout the troubled launch, he said.

The Affordable Care Act called for the Department of Health and Human Services to build an online exchange, or Internet store, to let uninsured consumers compare and buy plans offered by private insurance companies. The government will subsidize coverage for many working-class and middle-class families, while poorer citizens may be covered by the law's expansion of the existing Medicaid program for low-income families.

The exchange misfired almost immediately upon its launch.

Engineers quickly deployed software that referred visitors to an online waiting room, hoping that controlling the number of people trying to create accounts would ease pressure on the software, Park said. But serious performance issues have plagued the site all week, he said.

Park disputed a Reuters report that quoted non-government technology experts who theorized that the site's architecture inadvertently made it mimic a common method by which hackers attack websites to shut them down, forcing the software to misfire.

""That is not the driver of the bottleneck,'' he said.

The site is managed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Park said. It is hosted at a secure, privately owned cloud computing facility in Virginia. Outside experts this week had questioned whether the site was being run on cloud-based technology, whose flexibility usually lets website owners adjust quickly to spikes in traffic.

But the problem proved to be more complex than just adding more computer servers to manage the extra demand, he said.

A team working on the site is taking two other steps to fix the problem, Park said.

It is upgrading software that lets people create accounts to apply for insurance. One symptom of this has been malfunctioning pull-down menus that have worked only intermittently all week. And HealthCare.gov is moving one part of the site that processes applications from so-called virtual machine technology, which uses software to let a website securely share computer servers with other sites, to using servers dedicated exclusively to that process, he said.

That change will add extra computing power, complementing the software upgrade to make the registration process work more smoothly, he said.

The explanation is ""a little geekalicious,'' he said."

Pollak'],Ryan: We Demanded Individual Mandate Delay on Obamacare,"Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), chair of the House Budget Committee, told conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes Monday morning that House Republicans had demanded a one-year delay in Obamacare’s individual mandate, along with an end to congressional exemptions, while offering a six-week debt ceiling hike to allow room for negotiations on broader budget issues. The offer was made to President Barack Obama last Thursday.

President Obama, said Ryan, listened but declined to respond. In the meantime, Ryan said, it became clear the president was negotiating separately to obtain more favorable terms from Senate Republicans, trying to “jam” the House Republicans in the process. Ryan told Sykes that Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had “overplayed their hand” in attempting to prolong the crisis to maximize political damage to Republicans.

Ryan described the delay to the individual mandate as an “obvious” step to take, given that technical issues with the Obamacare exchanges might prevent the mandate from being enforced at all. “We could have spent the weekend putting an agreement together that says we’re gonna deal with the debt, we’re gonna deal with this economy, and we’re gonna fix these big flaws in Obamacare, or at least give people delays in these penalties.”

Instead, he said, the President and his party had declined, believing that they had a “partisan advantage.” In response to new demands from Democrats to cancel the sequester cuts in the Budget Control Act of 2011, Ryan declared: “We are not going to give on these spending numbers.” He said that there were some areas of agreement on changes to entitlements, but that Democrats wanted to spend more money and preserve Obamacare.

Ryan said that he believed the strategy of attempting to defund Obamacare had been a mistake, because the government shutdown would not have prevented Obamacare from being implemented. “It’s an autopilot spending program,” he said, saying that the idea Obamacare could be defunded was a “false impression.” He added, however, that the focus needed to shift to the damage Obamacare was causing to consumers and the economy.

“I do believe that we can still get some changes made to Obamacare that help provide some relief to working Americans,” Ryan said. He was optimistic that the House would craft a workable plan for avoiding default following a meeting of the GOP caucus on Monday evening. “I didn’t go to Congress to kick the can,” he said, noting that his biggest fear was that “a handful of Republicans” in the Senate would join Democrats to “jam” the House."

USA TODAY

Up to 25%2C000 people can use the federal site at the same time

Only 27%2C000 people picked insurance on the site in its first month of operation

The site will be ready for the vast majority of users by Nov. 30%2C Zients says

WASHINGTON — The HealthCare.gov website, the federal exchange where Americans can shop for health insurance, went through its first week without outages and provided users with faster response times, President Obama's appointee to lead the fixes to the site said Friday.

""We had no problems this week,"" said Jeffrey Zients, whom Obama named to the fix the problems that have plagued the site since it opened Oct. 1. Along with the lack of outages, response time for more users dropped to less than one second, Zients said.

""This week, we've driven the error rate down to 1 percent,"" Zients said.

Volume at the site ""increased significantly,"" Zients said, but the site can only handle 20,000 to 25,000 people ""comfortably"" at the same time.

The website must be able to handle tens of thousands prospective insurance customers at the same time if they are to meet the Dec. 15 deadline to buy health insurance that starts on Jan. 1 or by March 31 to meet the deadline to avoid paying a penalty for not having health insurance.

On Wednesday, the Obama administration reported that slightly less than 27,000 people selected private insurance on the site between Oct. 1 and Nov. 2.

Repair technicians will spend the weekend increasing the site's capacity to enable more people to use it simultaneously, Zients said.

""The site has gotten better each week,"" Zients said. ""A lot of people are on the site and using the site and should continue to do so.""

Problems with the site have slowed the ability of many Americans who received notices that their individual market policies had been canceled to shop for alternatives. On Thursday, Obama said the Health and Human Services Department would allow people to keep those policies for another year if insurance companies and state insurance commissioners approved. The House voted Friday for a bill that would allow people to keep those policies, but Obama has threatened to veto it because it would undermine parts of the Affordable Care Act.

Zients said technicians this week completed 60 fixes on the software ""punch list"" of problems and there are another 50 more on the priority list for the weekend.

""In total, we have now crossed more than 200 bug fixes off our punch list,"" he said. He repeated a promise made by Obama and other White House officials that the site will be ""working smoothly for the vast majority of users"" by Nov. 30.

Julie Bataille, communications director for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said they have also begun contacting states with Medicaid eligibility information for people who have come through the federal site.

Bataille also said people who choose to buy an old insurance plan that does not meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act would qualify for the requirement to buy health insurance and would not have to pay a penalty."

Obamacare) may well promise uninsured Americans a lot more than cheap, reliable medical care. It can also open the door to the democratic empowerment of millions of poor people, who are often alienated from much of the nation’s civic life, by strengthening the organizations that give them a voice.

This year more than 30 million uninsured Americans are to begin signing up for Obamacare, but the vast majority of those eligible for either the expanded Medicaid program, or for subsidized private health insurance through state health exchanges, have no idea how to enroll. Surveys and focus groups have found that up to three-quarters of Americans who might directly benefit from the program are skeptical that the law can provide high-quality insurance coverage at a price they can afford.

This is dangerous, not only for their health but for the viability of the law. Many people think that with the Supreme Court ruling upholding the law and President Obama’s reelection, the Affordable Care Act finally made it out of the political and judicial woods. After all, the last few weeks have seen half a dozen Republican governors sign up their states for its expanded Medicaid coverage.

But confusion, fear and ignorance among millions of potential beneficiaries can still doom the reform. In California, nearly 7.2 million people — more than 20% of the population — lack access to health insurance. Most of these people are poor, and for many, English is their second language.

Obamacare’s success depends on maximum possible participation. If too few healthy people purchase insurance through the state exchanges, not only will the flow of premiums and subsidies to hospitals, doctors and clinics prove inadequate, but insurance companies, which will be prohibited from turning anyone away, will be providing coverage for too many of the old, the ill and the desperate. Insurance rates will skyrocket. Then the young and relatively healthy may drop out of the system, only to face a penalty — $695 a year for an individual by 2016 — a politically toxic burden.

The Affordable Care Act would implode.

The law’s stakeholders are well aware of this danger. Enroll America — a Washington nonprofit funded by hospitals, insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry — will launch a media blitz this summer designed to explain how the new law works and what subsidies are available for working families.

In California, Covered California, the state health exchange, has geared up its outreach and publicity campaign, including an initial $43 million in grants to health clinics, community groups, trade unions and other nonprofits that have “trusted relationships with the uninsured markets that represent the cultural and linguistic diversity of the state.”

Covered California expects that by Oct. 1, when enrollment in health exchanges begins, they will have trained as many as 21,000 “assisters,” volunteers and employees of such groups. These people will knock on doors and sit around kitchen tables to guide the uninsured through the process.

Such hand-holding is essential because signing up for Obamacare will be complicated. Covered California and the other states’ health exchanges are creating streamlined Web portals, but the process of completing the template will be like filling out a tax return. And just as H&R; Block has hundreds of offices and thousands of employees who guide clients through the tax preparation process, so too will the state exchanges need organizations and knowledgeable and trusted people who can make the process understandable and reassuring.

And here is where Obamacare’s peril turns into a promise of enormous social and political benefit. As the poor, alienated and fearful realize that tangible benefits can be won through their neighborhood clinic, civic group or local trade union, and are drawn into civic life and grass-roots action, these organizations that are essential to the health reform’s implementation will be strengthened as agents of civic engagement and citizen mobilization.

This is not a case of creating more voters who will support Obama because of Obamacare. This is a 21st century example of Alexis de Tocqueville’s 19th century observation that the health of American democracy depends on the vibrancy of numerous voluntary organizations.

Advertisement

In recent history, we’ve seen the way such groups feed activism and are fed by it.

This was the case during the Depression when national labor organizations and their local chapters pushed for new labor laws and then gave them a tangible reality as the locals burgeoned in workplaces across America, and in the years after passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, when African American churches, the NAACP and other civil rights organizations reached out to millions and brought them to the registrar’s office and the polls.

Likewise, activists from the women’s movement and the environmental community were indispensable when the laws they had helped push through Congress were put to the test in thousands of communities.

In California, Obamacare civic activism has the political and administrative wind at its back. But in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia and other Southern states, where the political establishment still stands in opposition to the healthcare reform law, the enrollment of the uninsured in federally run health exchanges will require some of the courage and dedication last seen in those precincts when civil rights workers sought to end segregation half a century ago.

The task will be difficult, but the payoff will transform far more than the American health insurance system.

Now they're busy flouting it.

The mandate that employers provide insurance next year or pay a penalty, as the law requires? Delayed for at least a year.

The law's dictate that people applying for federal subsidies to buy insurance provide proof that they're eligible for the government aid? Scaled back.

Sharp limits on Americans' out-of-pocket costs for health care? Suspended for a year.

Providing members of Congress and more than 10,000 staff members with federal health care subsidies that the law does not allow? Done, via a deal brokered by President Barack Obama.

And on and on.

The Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, is a hugely complex law that sets up online health insurance marketplaces, requires people to have coverage or pay penalties, and doles out subsidies and incentives to nearly everyone in health care. Doctors, hospitals and insurers have spent large sums to gear up for its requirements. Employers are mulling: Hire? Fire? Cut workers' hours?

Millions of Americans, that is, stand to gain or lose from how this law is enforced — with the Obama administration bending that enforcement in ways that test, and arguably exceed, the boundaries of lawful conduct.

Every time the White House undercuts one provision of Obamacare, there is a massive ripple effect on other provisions. It's generally a zero-sum game: When someone gains, someone else loses. Example: When employers are relieved of their mandate to provide insurance, taxpayers risk having to subsidize more of those companies' employees.

The administration asserts that it can make these changes under the president's broad executive authority. Yet critics make a compelling argument that the president is stretching the limits. Former federal appellate Judge Michael McConnell, director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, writes in The Wall Street Journal about a different sort of mandate: the mandate in Article II of the Constitution that the president ""'shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' This is a duty, not a discretionary power. ... As the Supreme Court wrote long ago (Kendall v. United States, 1838), allowing the president to refuse to enforce statutes 'would be clothing the president with a power to control the legislation of Congress, and paralyze the administration of justice.'""

Like most issues of presidential authority, this isn't cut and dried. Presidents do have broad discretion on how laws are enforced. But they're on shaky ground when they decide whether to enforce a law. It's not hard to understand why: Imagine the outcry if President Mitt Romney refused to enforce, say, Obamacare.

Granted, any president may decline to enforce statutes he believes are unconstitutional. But Obama is making no such claim here. Basically, he is admitting that parts of law are impossible to enforce on the deadlines imposed by Congress — deadlines he signed into law. He's also admitting he doesn't want to have Congress make these changes, for fear that if lawmakers get their mitts on this unpopular program, they would at least debate far more extensive changes than he'd like.

Congressional Democrats, and some Republicans, may agree with the numerous delays, changes and special favors. But the president invites chaos when he picks which parts of Obamacare to enforce, and which, in retrospect, he has decided are unworkable or unwise.

In a recent news conference, Obama acknowledged that congressional modification of the law is preferable to these White House fiats: ""In a normal political environment, it would have been easier for me to simply call up (House Speaker John Boehner) and say, 'You know what? This is a tweak that doesn't go to the essence of the law. ... Let's make a technical change of the law.' That would be the normal thing that I would prefer to do, but we're not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to, quote-unquote, 'Obamacare.'''

Tweaks? Obama isn't making tweaks. He's trying to circumvent major flaws that began flaring when the law was enacted. Hence the many carve-outs, delays and special deals that have been piling up since he added his signature to Obamacare on March 23, 2010.

The president crusaded for this law and has embraced its nickname. But he did not write the law. Congress did. Major changes are necessary — he has stipulated by his actions that this law as constituted cannot work — and Congress should legislate them for his review.

Bottom line: Let's delay and rewrite this ill-conceived law. Congress need not start from scratch. Lawmakers can build on what all of us have learned from three years of painful trial and error. Three years of attempting, but failing, to make this clumsy monstrosity work for the American people."

His remarks came as a bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate to delay the implementation of the individual mandate of ObamaCare by one year, meaning Americans would avoid a $95 penalty for not having health insurance that is scheduled to kick in next year.

Referring to those who are losing their health insurance plans, Obama told NBC News, ""I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me. We've got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and we are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this.”

The White House, while defending the health care law and vowing to fix the problems with the website, has not explicitly ruled out the possibility of delaying the individual mandate.

House Speaker John Boehner responded to Obama's apology late Thursday, saying ""an apology is certainly in order, but what Americans want to hear is that the president is going to keep his promise.""

More On This...

Thursday's bill was introduced by Senators Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Mark Kirk, R-Ill., who said since the Affordable Care Act was passed, there have been “many identifiable problems exposed in the law that need to be addressed.”

“We need to start working together to fix this law and make it work so that all Americans have access to affordable and reliable health care coverage,” Manchin said in a statement. “We can start with a one-year delay of the individual mandate to eliminate penalty fees if individuals choose to not enroll for a health care plan in 2014.

""This common sense proposal simply allows Americans to take more time to browse and explore their options, making 2014 a true transition year.”

The legislation acknowledges there are many positive components of the Affordable Care Act that will lead to health care becoming more affordable for all Americans, and these reforms must “continue to be implemented.”

“Nevertheless, it is important to recognize when a new program is not meeting the high standards that the American people expect,” the bill reads. “So far, the federal healthcare exchanges have failed, and we must deliver a better product.”

The bill also says that delaying the entire implementation of ObamaCare would not be “responsible,” but Congress should take action to make “commonsense reforms” to the law.

“Healthcare should not be a burden on consumers, which is why we must delay the penalty for individuals,” Kirk said in a statement. “Last July, American businesses were given more time to provide employees health coverage. If a delay is good enough for businesses, it should be good enough for all Americans.”"

Accidents -- in cars, on ski slopes, walking down the street -- happen even to the affluent. And Obamacare is intentionally structured to prevent people who go without insurance from acquiring it only after they need it. You can only sign up for health insurance during an annual open-enrollment period. So if you get hit by a car two months after you ignored the open enrollment, you’re not going to want to wait for the next enrollment period before you get health care. It’s going to cost you."

But unlike the Republicans who uniformly voted no to the ACA in 2010 because they feared what its success would mean for the GOP's political prospects, Democrats opposed Bush's Medicare Rx plan because it was unnecessarily complex and needlessly expensive for taxpayers. After all, the Medicare Modernization didn't just prohibit the federal government from directly negotiating with pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices, but forced beneficiaries to purchase coverage from private insurers rather than expand the lower cost Medicare program to include the new benefit.

For those reasons and more, Medicare Part D was far more unpopular before it launched than Obamacare is now. But that changed over time. Now, 9 out of 10 seniors are happy with the program they once despised. In part, Democratic cooperation explains why.

After all, when the Bush administration spent millions of dollars on television ads beginning in 2004 to promote the new Medicare drug discount cards, Democrats didn't object. (They just asked that the Bush Department of Health and Human Services tell the truth.) Despite that history and the fact that HHS funds advertising for Medicare enrollment every fall, grandstanding GOP Senator Marco Rubio called for a halt to the current ACA TV spots, accusing HHS of ""blatant misuse of federal dollars.""

The same contrast applies to the so-called ""navigators,"" the dozens of community groups, charitable organization, hospitals and non-profits that will Americans find health insurance now just as they helped the elderly find prescription drug plans. Now, Republicans on Ohio, Georgia, Texas, West Virginia and Florida are boasting about the efforts to block the work of the navigators in their states. As Georgia Insurance Commission Ralph Hudgens crowed:



""Let me tell you what we're doing [about Obamacare.] Everything in our power to be an obstructionist."" ""We have passed a law that says that a navigator, which is a position in that exchange, has to be licensed by our Department of Insurance. The ObamaCare law says that we cannot require them to be an insurance agent, so we said fine, we'll just require them to be a licensed navigator. So we're going to make up the test, and basically you take the insurance agent test, you erase the name, you write 'navigator test' on it.""

Before the program was implemented, only 21 percent of seniors had a favorable opinion of it, and 66 percent didn't understand what the reform would mean for them. So we spent 18 months devising and implementing a campaign to explain the prescription drug benefit, prepare seniors as well as partners -- such as community groups, churches, pharmacies, insurance plans and state and local governments -- and then sign people up. A national bus tour supported each phase. The summer before enrollment (the same period that the ACA is in now) we logged more than 600,000 miles and visited 48 states. As secretary, I made 119 stops in 98 cities. I learned that with a program like the ACA, you can't count on Washington to sell it. You have to reach people where they live, work, pray and play.

As President Bush's former Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt explained in July, the ""navigators"" were critical to the outreach campaign for Medicare Part D: Many of the same navigators then (like the AARP) are Obamacare navigators now. Ironically, President Bush and his Republican allies also counted on organization that doesn't exist anymore: ACORN.

Nevertheless, the Bush administration rollout of the Medicare drug benefit for 43 million elderly Americans was a disaster. Ohio Congressman John Boehner admitted as much to Fox News in February 2006:



""The implementation of the Medicare plan has been horrendous,""

In 2006, the bill went into effect. It was a disaster. Computer systems didn't communicate with one another. Seniors were confused. Some of the poorest and sickest enrollees -- ""dual eligibles"" who qualify for aid under both Medicare and Medicaid -- weren't able to get their drugs. It was so bad that in his 2006 State of the Union address, Bush ""said nothing about the new Medicare prescription drug program, an initiative Republicans once hoped to trumpet but has angered many seniors in its implementation,"" reported the Washington Post.

""I voted against it, but once it passed I certainly determined that I would try to do everything I could to make sure that New Yorkers understood it, could access it, and make the best of it.""

As Ezra Klein recently recounted, in a rare moment of candor the future Speaker was right:Unlike Republicans like Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) and Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) who have announced they will not answer constituents' calls for help with Obamacare, Democrats took a different approach. As then Senator Hillary Clinton reasoned in 2006:When Wisconsin Senator Kohl, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Aging asked his colleagues ""to put aside any partisan thoughts to work together to get this program running,"" Democratic governors were already spending billions of dollars to help out.

As the Washington Post reported in January 2006, ""Two weeks into the new Medicare prescription drug program, many of the nation's sickest and poorest elderly and disabled people are being turned away or overcharged at pharmacies, prompting more than a dozen states to declare health emergencies and pay for their life-saving medicines."" Roughly 6.4 million seniors who just days earlier had gotten their prescriptions for free faced the prospect of going without because of untrained pharmacists and computer glitches. By January 16th, 2006, the New York Times reported, many states (most of them led by Democrats) came to their rescue. ""About 20 states, including California, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and all of New England, have announced that they will help low-income people by paying drug claims that should have been paid by the federal Medicare program."" Among the governors taking action were future Obamacare foes Tim Pawlenty and Mike Huckabee, who declared a health emergency in his state of Arkansas. The fiasco prompted the Bush administration to take drastic measures:



With tens of thousands of people unable to get medicines promised by Medicare, the Bush administration has told insurers that they must provide a 30-day supply of any drug that a beneficiary was previously taking, and it said that poor people must not be charged more than $5 for a covered drug.

It's no wonder why Paul Krugman summed up the whole catastrophe as "" D for Debacle .""

The blame for that debacle has to be placed squarely at the feet of President Bush and his Republican allies who structured the Medicare Part D bill. But once the ill-conceived legislation was the law of the land, Democrats didn't stand in their way. They helped make it work. Democrats didn't go the Supreme Court, or refuse to accept coverage for millions in their states, or say no to enforcing new insurance rules or try to prevent the work of the navigators receiving federal grants to provide information and customer service to Americans.

As Chuck Todd explained in a rare act of journalism, only Republicans do that."

CGI official%27s testimony says high demand caused problems

House Republicans have cited problems with site as signs of law%27s flaws

White House held meeting Wednesday with top insurance company executives

WASHINGTON — High demand for health insurance coupled with confusion between contractors led to many of the problems that have plagued the HealthCare.gov website meant to allow uninsured Americans to buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act, an official with the top contractor will say in prepared testimony to a House panel Thursday.

Cheryl Campbell, senior vice president of CGI Federal, said in advance testimony for her scheduled Thursday appearance before the House Energy and Commerce Committee that another contractor was responsible for the technology that allowed users to create new accounts and which caused the initial bottleneck issues on the site.

Still, Campbell said, CGI is responsible for some of the problems, too.

""Now, as more and more users have been able to proceed to the (exchange) over the past several days, more individuals have enrolled in qualified insurance plans,"" Campbell's prepared testimony says. ""However, the increased number of transactions in the (exchange) have caused system performance issues (such as slow response times or data assurance issues) that now need to be addressed through tuning, optimization, and application improvements.""

Members of the Republican-led House and committee said they want to know why, after the Government Accountability Office issued a report saying the exchange was behind schedule, federal officials launched it anyway.

""Despite such issues, HHS officials repeatedly assured the public that implementation was progressing on time and as intended,"" according to a committee memo about the hearing.

Along with Campbell, other witnesses include officials from contractors associated with the launch, including Optum/QSSI, Equifax Workforce Solutions and Serco.

John Lau, contract representative for Serco, plans to testify that his company has processed about 8,000 paper applications since Oct. 2.

Andrew Slavitt of Optum will testify that while the Data Services Hub that they built is working properly, and that it has handled hundreds of thousands of operations a day, the tool that allows people to register is made up of several pieces from many different contractors.

""Many of the critical components developed by these multiple vendors were overwhelmed — the virtual data center environment, the software, the database system, and the hardware, as well as our (registration) tool,"" Slavitt's advance testimony says. ""It appears that one of the reasons for the high concurrent volume at the registration system was a late decision requiring consumers to register for an account before they could browse for insurance products.""

The Obama administration Wednesday created a series of ""alpha teams"" with insurance companies after a meeting between Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, industry executives and White House officials.

The teams, Sebelius said in a statement after the meeting, consist of ""insurers' technology experts and CMS technology experts, to iron out kinks in the both the (enrollment) forms and in direct enrollment."" They are part of ""the 'tech surge' that is incrementally improving performance at HealthCare.Gov.""

CGI's contract

CGI has caught the brunt of the blame, as analysts have begun to question how their initial $93.7 million contract was awarded, as well as the flood of new money they received in April.

The company's contract to create HealthCare.gov spun from an existing 2007 contract, federal contract records show.

Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, said it was a multiple-vendor contract, or delivery order. Usually, the government issues a call for proposals publicly and allows any company to bid. But in cases where they use the same goods over and over again — such as office equipment or paint — they have several vendors who are preapproved to supply what the government needs, such as information technology.

It's something the government has done for many years, Amey said.

The government often benefits from the arrangement because contractors make lower bids because they know they will receive more work in the future, Amey said.

CGI has received more than $2.5 billion in federal contracts, he said.

""Time was of the essence to get this thing up and running,"" Amey said. ""This is the exact reason you would use this kind of contracting vehicle.""

Republican committee members said they plan to ask if the problems are long-term, how many people have been able to sign up for the new health exchange, why the exchange was allowed to roll out if the administration knew there were problems and what, exactly, are the problems with the website.

Along with the preparation for the hearing, there was some movement in Congress to extend the March 31 deadline by which uninsured Americans have to buy insurance through the exchanges.

Legislators seek extension

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., sent a letter Tuesday asking that the deadline to enroll be extended past March 31. Those who do not enroll by that day may be required to pay a fine through their 2014 taxes. Republican Marco Rubio of Florida has also asked that the requirement to buy insurance be delayed, and Sen Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said Wednesday he was researching a similar proposal.

Despite the website's problems in its first three weeks of operation, many potential insurance customers often wait until closer to the deadline, said Jonathan Gruber, an economist at MIT who worked with both former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney's and President Obama's health care laws.

Massachusetts launched its health insurance program ""at the beginning of 2007,"" Gruber said, ""but enrollment didn't fully flesh out for a year."" In fact, it was less than 6% of the year's total by the end of the second month. ""But the mandate didn't come into place until the end of the year, and you could sign up any time.""

That differs from the federal and state exchanges; people must sign up by Dec. 15 to receive insurance by Jan. 1, and by March 31 to avoid a fine for violating the individual mandate portion of the law. The March 31 date is a concession to insurers, who feared that allowing open enrollment would mean people would sign up for insurance as they were diagnosed with an illness.

But Gruber, a proponent of the individual mandate, doesn't see any reason to panic about the federal exchange problems — yet. Now, he described the situation as ""DEFCON 1,"" a political problem, but probably not a problem yet for the marketplace.

""If it's not running by Thanksgiving, that's DEFCON 2,"" he said. ""It's a real problem because people want to get insurance by January, but it's not a crisis.

""The real crisis comes if people can't get insurance until March,"" he said, adding that people can enroll over the phone or by paper now.

In Massachusetts, Gruber said officials weren't focused on how well enrollment went on a day-to-day basis. They looked at the long-term potential, and expected that people would sign up in time to avoid the penalty.

""I'm pretty confident they'll have it up and going by Thanksgiving,"" he said."

The Texas megachurch is linked to at least 21 cases of measles and has been trying to contain the outbreak by hosting vaccination clinics, officials said. LM Otero / AP

An outbreak of measles among unimmunized members of a Texas megachurch is fueling new health worries about pockets of vaccine-wary parents -- just as more than 50 million public school kids head back to class across the nation.

More possible measles cases are being reviewed in Tarrant County, Texas, where at least 21 people have been sickened this month at the Eagle Mountain International Church, whose ministers have been critical of vaccination. Local officials say several more cases of infections with fever and rash have been reported, but not confirmed.

“It’s concerning. It’s something we jump on,” said Russell Jones, a Texas state epidemiologist who’s been tracking the situation. “It could get into the schools.”

Public health officials say that the northeast Texas outbreak is just the latest in a small but growing number of places -- think San Diego, Calif., Boone and Hamilton counties, Ind., and, most recently, Brooklyn, N.Y. -- where vaccine resistance has sickened children and put the wider community at risk for potentially deadly infectious diseases.

“The rate of change has sort of accelerated,” said Dr. Saad Omer, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Emory University in Atlanta who studies clusters of vaccine exemptions in public schools.

“Tarrant County was not on my radar,” he added.

He’s more familiar with places such as Marin County, Calif., where rates of new kindergarteners excused from mandatory shots nearly doubled from 4.2 percent in 2005 to 7.8 percent at the start of last year, county figures show. There, at the small New Village School in Sausalito, 74 percent of entering kindergarteners said no to vaccinations.

“Like-minded people end up creating pockets of non-vaccinated or under-vaccinated communities,” explained Dr. Ari Brown, an Austin, Texas, pediatrician and spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “They kind of seek each other out because they have similar philosophies.”

But vaccine critics say that distrust of the drugs -- and of the public health community that pushes them -- is behind rising rates of vaccine rejection across the country.

“These are pharmaceutical products that carry a risk of death or injury that can vary according to the individuals,” said Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center in Vienna, Va.

Critics object to vaccines because of fears about safety, worries about the effects of injecting young children with dozens of doses of vaccines by age 6 and worries about possible links with other diseases, including autism, a theory that has been repeatedly debunked.

Public health officials, however, say there’s no question that the risk of vaccination is far outweighed by the benefit of immunization. Risks of vaccine side effects or failure are possible but rare, and they’re much lower than the risks associated with disease, said Omer.

In the decade before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, between 3 million and 4 million people in the U.S. were infected each year, 48,000 were hospitalized and 400 to 500 died. Another 1,000 developed chronic disabilities, CDC says.

Domestic cases of the disease were considered eradicated in 2000, but outbreaks continue because of imported infections brought back by travelers from areas where measles remains common.

The Texas megachurch outbreak was sparked by a non-vaccinated visitor who was infected in Indonesia and then returned to expose unvaccinated church members, staffers -- and children in a day care center. In the wider community, more than 98 percent of kids are immunized and less than 1 percent are exempt, county officials say. But the congregation of unvaccinated people allowed the disease to catch hold.

“When you hang out with other people who don’t vaccinate, you’re hanging out in the wrong herd,” said Brown, a reference to herd immunity, the necessary level of protection that keeps a disease from spreading within a community.

Church leaders, including Kenneth Copeland and his daughter, Terri Pearsons, senior pastor at Eagle Mountain, have advocated faith-healing and questioned vaccines in the past. After the outbreak began in mid-August, Pearsons has urged church members to get vaccinated and held immunization clinics.

When more than 10 percent of a certain community opts out of vaccinations, it leaves others at risk, particularly those too vulnerable for immunization, or those for whom a vaccine doesn’t work or wears off.

For some diseases, such as mumps, herd immunity can drop to as low as about 75 percent and still offer wider protection. But other diseases, such as the highly contagious measles or pertussis, known as whooping cough, require collective immunity of up to 94 percent to keep everyone safe, according to the CDC.

To be clear, the vast majority of U.S. parents do vaccinate their kids, latest federal health statistics show. Nationwide, only about 1.8 percent of the more than 4.2 million kindergarteners who entered public school last fall were exempted from laws that require that they get shots to protect against what once were the deadliest diseases of childhood: measles, mumps, rubella, polio. (Homeschooled children aren’t included in the count.)

But exemption rates also vary widely among states, from 0.6 percent in Alabama to 4 percent in Alaska and Colorado and 6.4 percent in Oregon, which leads the nation, CDC figures show.

Rates are highest in the 20 states that allow for exemptions based not only on medical and religious grounds, but also on “personal beliefs.” And within those states they can vary even more. In Oregon, at least four counties have double-digit exemption rates ranging from 12.6 percent in Curry County to 15.2 percent in Wallowa County.

In states where it has been easy to obtain exemptions -- with a simple signature, for instance -- rates of exemption have risen sharply, according to a 2012 study by Omer and colleagues. Between 2005 and 2011, the non-medical exemption rate in 13 “easy” states rose to 3.3 percent, an average annual increase of 13 percent, he found.

Some states are trying to change that trend, making it more difficult to obtain exemptions. In Washington state, where kindergarten exemption rates peaked at 7.6 percent in 2008, public health officials changed the school paperwork two years ago, separating the vaccine record from the exemption form, said Dr. Ed Marcuse, a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the University of Washington.

“At the same time we did that, we changed the law. In order to be exempt, you had to be counseled about vaccine-preventable diseases,” he said. The child's physician has to sign a form proving that the counseling took place.

The point was not to ""simply put in hassles,” Marcuse said, pointing out that some states require notarization of exemption forms. “We wanted very much to be certain that parents made as thoughtful and well-informed a decision as possible.""

The effort appears to be paying off. Kindergarten exemption rates fell from 6.2 percent in 2010 to 4.6 percent in 2012 after the initiative, state records show. Now, Oregon and California have passed similar laws bolstering requirements for exemption.

The goal, Marcuse said, is to enact policies that balance the inherent conflict in the vaccine debate between private choice and public good.

“It’s not so simple as ‘Let’s wipe out these pockets of resistance,'” said Marcuse. “Let’s help people make decisions that are both in their personal interest and in the interest of the community.”

By David Morgan and Lewis Krauskopf

Dec 2 (Reuters) - A surge of visitors clogged the U.S. government's revamped healthcare insurance shopping website on Monday, signaling that President Barack Obama's administration has a way to go in fixing the portal that showcases his signature domestic policy.

Facing its first big test since officials proclaimed over the weekend that they had met their deadline to make HealthCare.gov run smoothly for the ""vast majority"" of users, the site performed markedly better than it did during its disastrous launch two months ago - but was still short of the crisply running insurance marketplace Obama once touted.

By 12 p.m. ET (1700 GMT), the website had logged 375,000 visitors, the White House said, nearly half the 800,000 daily users the refurbished site is supposed to be able to handle.

In states such as New jersey, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Texas and North Carolina, the rush of traffic led to the deployment of a new feature on the site - a waiting page that said there were ""a lot of visitors right now,"" and put people in line to be serviced, usually within minutes or even seconds.

That was viewed as significant progress for a website that has become the face of perhaps one of the biggest crises of Obama's administration, one that has undermined the Democratic president's promotion of an activist government and threatened to become a drag on Democrats in next year's elections, when control of Congress will be at stake.

But HealthCare.gov's hiccups on Monday fueled questions about whether it will be able to enroll several million uninsured and under-insured Americans in private insurance programs by the end of March - a major goal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

More immediately, the website will be pushed further by waves of visitors seeking to sign up for insurance by Dec. 23, the deadline to get coverage that begins Jan. 1.

For all of the efforts by tech specialists to improve the site, officials still are scrambling to repair and install functions on the ""back end"" of the Obamacare system that are needed to finalize enrollments with insurers. That could create another headache for the administration starting in January, if the enrollments for some who sign up for coverage via the website are not finalized before their coverage is supposed to begin.

""The real challenges remain, and that's downstream,"" said Rick Howard, research director for the technology consultant Gartner. ""The real error rate will be in the billing transactions and how accurate the billing information is and how accurate the premium calculation is.""

The administration said that in meetings with insurers and healthcare officials this week, it will refocus attention efforts to nail down functions for handling insurance payments, including federal subsidies for low-income consumers buying coverage under Obamacare.

Without those functions working properly, HealthCare.gov and websites for 14 state-run marketplaces could have difficulty operating in 2014.

At the White House on Monday, Obama spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged that ""the work is not done"" on the website.

Carney added that the waiting page that some visitors saw was created in part because officials knew that Monday would put a strain on the system.

""We absolutely anticipated that on this day in particular, because it is the first workday after the deadline we set ... to make sure that the website was functioning effectively for the vast majority of users, we would see a surge in visitors,"" Carney said.

ENCOURAGING NUMBERS

For the White House and supporters of Obamacare, the encouraging news on Monday was that the pace of enrollments in healthcare programs has increased dramatically since Oct. 1, when the administration's enthusiastic launch of HealthCare.gov was quickly tempered by problems with the website that allowed few people to enroll.

Preliminary government data indicated that about 100,000 people chose a health plan through HealthCare.gov during November, as officials and tech specialists scrambled to improve the site's capacity, according to a source familiar with the issue. In October, only about 27,000 had enrolled via the site.

The federally run HealthCare.gov site handles enrollments for 36 states. The 14 other states and Washington, D.C., have their own exchanges under Obamacare. The state-run exchanges have had fewer technical problems and generally are in states that are most enthusiastic about Obamacare, so their enrollments figures have been relatively high, including 80,000 in California and 50,000 in New York.

Official November data will be released in two weeks. But if the November estimate for HealthCare.gov enrollments is correct, it means at least 290,000 people have signed up for private insurance through the Obamacare exchanges.

That is still far short of the administration's projection in September that nearly 500,000 people would sign up through the insurance marketplaces in the first month, according to documents obtained by congressional investigators.

Ultimately, 7 million Americans were expected to sign up for private health insurance offered through the online marketplaces for 2014, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

The website's issues have put that goal in doubt, and administration officials have begun playing down the importance of getting 7 million enrollees in Obamacare for 2014. On Monday, Carney emphasized that the CBO, not the White House, that produced that estimate for total enrollment.

The New York Times reports that “many in New York’s professional and cultural elite” who supported Obama and ObamaCare, and carved themselves out a sweet little health insurance pool “to avoid the sky-high rates in New York’s individual insurance market,” are now out in the cold with the rest of us:

[U]nder the Affordable Care Act, they will be treated as individuals, responsible for their own insurance policies. For many of them, that is likely to mean they will no longer have access to a wide network of doctors and a range of plans tailored to their needs. And many of them are finding that if they want to keep their premiums from rising, they will have to accept higher deductible and co-pay costs or inferior coverage.

The anguish these elite Obama supporters are going through is no different than those 5.9 million in the real world victimized by insurance cancelations: Stress, sleepless nights, financial burden, and the loss of familiar doctors and hospitals. “We are Obama’s people,” said one author. Today her insurance has been canceled and her doctors are not available through the exchanges. And she is not alone. Take Barbara Meinwald, a solo practitioner lawyer in Manhattan. “I couldn’t sleep because of it,” she said.

Ms. Meinwald, 61, has been paying $10,000 a year for her insurance through the New York City Bar. A broker told her that a new temporary plan with fewer doctors would cost $5,000 more, after factoring in the cost of her medications.

Ms. Meinwald also looked on the state’s health insurance exchange. But she said she found that those plans did not have a good choice of doctors, and that it was hard to even find out who the doctors were, and which hospitals were covered. “It’s like you’re blindfolded and you’re told that you have to buy something,” she said. …

Meinwald now says that had she known this would happen, she would have voted for Mitt Romney.

[M]any professionals make too much money to qualify for the subsidies, and even if they are able to find comparably priced insurance, the new policies do not have the coverage they are accustomed to.

According to the Kaiser Foundation, these people were intentionally screwed. Although their policies did meet the minimum ObamaCare coverage standards, The Times reports, the policies were still canceled as a way “to prevent associations from selling insurance to healthy members who are needed to keep the new health exchanges financially viable.”

If only the same thing would happen to the elite media, we might actually get somewhere in repealing a boondoggle that is victimizing millions in the working and middle class only to benefit a few thousand.

According to insurers and the White house, delaying the deadline could undermine efforts to lure a broad, young and healthy mix of consumers to the market. That would end up costing insurers, and possibly taxpayers, money.

The case against delay was outlined in a memo circulated to lawmakers by the insurance lobby last week. The document from America’s Health Insurance Plans warned that delay could have a “destabilizing effect on insurance markets, resulting in higher premiums and coverage disruptions for individuals and families.”

For now, the administration is sticking with the insurers. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Wednesday called delaying the tax penalties for those who miss the deadline premature. Testifying before a House committee, Sebelius said she was confident the site would be running smoothly by the end of November, giving consumers four months to enroll easily online before the deadline of March 31.

President Obama made the case in Boston, where he argued that the model for his healthcare law — the 2006 Massachusetts law that then-Gov. Mitt Romney pushed through — experienced a similarly slow rollout and went on to success.

There is more than policy keeping the administration from pursuing what some contend is a simple fix. House Republicans have long pushed to delay the mandate. Any concession on the point would hand another “I told you so” moment to the GOP only weeks after the White House and Democrats watched the government shut down rather than agree to Republicans’ demands to suspend the mandate for a year.

Still, the politics of the issue could change quickly as Democrats face pressure to show they are responding to public frustration with the website. Ten Democratic senators have signed a letter asking the White House to extend the date beyond March 31 — six of those are up for reelection in 2014.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said an extended enrollment was merely a fair way to make up for a website rollout she labeled a “disaster.” Millions of people have been shut out of the site intended to link consumers with private health plans. “That is unacceptable; consumers should not pay a penalty because a website did not work,” Shaheen wrote in an op-ed published Wednesday in USA Today.

Advocates for the extension note that the administration has already pushed back the date by six weeks in an attempt to align mismatched deadlines outlined during the rule-making process. Another limited extension is unlikely to change consumer behavior much, some experts opposed to a delay concede.

“To change sends a message: Don’t worry about signing up quickly. So there is an impact, but it depends a lot on how long an extension it is,” said Linda Blumberg, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute.

Blumberg said it was too soon to know whether an extension was necessary. Any decision should come only after insurers know who is signing up and whether they are seeing too many sick customers to deliver on the premiums they’ve promised. There are two major provisions already built into the law to help insurers adjust for risk pools, she said.

Obama advisors made similar arguments. Extending the enrollment period by a few months or a year increases the possibility that people won’t sign up until they’re too sick, increasing the costs for everyone else, said Chris Jennings, a former advisor to President Clinton now working on Obamacare implementation.

Enforcing the requirements for insurers without enforcing those for individuals would compound the destabilizing effect, Jennings said.

“No one will sell you house insurance when your house is on fire,” he said. “If you want to ban discrimination against people with preexisting conditions, then you have to have everyone in the pool. That’s why you need the individual responsibility requirement.”

Critics of the president’s law are reviving the push to undo the mandate. Romney issued a statement Wednesday suggesting a number of changes, including “carefully phasing it in to avoid the type of disruptions we are seeing nationally.”

In support of the Obama plan, some former Romney advisors have stepped forward to counsel patience through what they suggest is just a rocky beginning.

The law ramped up slowly in Massachusetts, said Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist who has advised Romney and Obama on healthcare reform.

In the first month of enrollment in 2006, he said, only 123 enrollees from the premium-paying population — comparable to the group using the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act — signed up. That represented fewer than 1% of those who eventually signed up within the enrollment period.

“The fact that people aren’t signed up now for a policy they can’t even get until January, and which they’re not mandated to have until March, is not at all interesting or important,” Gruber said on a White House conference call held as Obama prepared to travel to Boston. “What matters is the fact that it will ramp up, and it will ramp up over time.”

The arc of enrollment in Massachusetts suggests that the deadline itself plays an important role, he said.

As the program neared the deadline, he said, “you saw an enormous increase in healthy people signing up.”

In their push on Capitol Hill, insurers are arguing that the March 31 date is crucial to the assumptions they used in developing the premiums they are offering at healthcare.gov.

According to America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry group, changing these “vital enrollment incentives” would mean the premiums that health plans filed for next year would have to increase to account for fewer young and healthy people signing up for coverage. Insurers must determine the premiums for 2015 in April, a deadline that would be hard to meet without knowing who had signed up in 2014.

“Extending the open enrollment period would also drive up the 2015 premium rates,” the group’s document says, “as health plans would have to start submitting premiums to regulators before knowing who is enrolled in their insurance plans.”

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active.

http://www.nbcnews.com/health/quitting-obamacare-trapped-workers-may-seek-relief-new-health-exchanges-8C11277058,2013-09-29 08:28:00+00:00,['Jonel Aleccia'],Quitting for Obamacare: Trapped workers may seek relief in new health exchanges,"As millions of Americans wait to see how the federal health exchanges shake out, some who’ve been hanging onto their jobs just for the insurance say Obamacare gives them a new reason to bid their old employers goodbye.



One Arizona couple, Claudia and Joseph Schulz, just quit their jobs, in fact, and launched a husband-and-wife real estate team, largely because they can sign up this week for health insurance not tethered to any position.

“That was the fear before. We felt too much on our own,” says Claudia Schulz, 33, of Phoenix. “Now, if we’re able to make our dream come true of owning our own business, or at least giving it a shot, it’s worth it.”

Starting a business or retiring early will suddenly become an option under the new exchanges, experts say, especially for the many employees who have felt trapped by so-called “job lock” -- being stuck in a position because of the benefits, usually health insurance, it provides.

“The Affordable Care Act completely changes the playing field,” says Paul Fronstin, director of the health research programs at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. “You don’t need your employer any more for health benefits.”

It may be particularly attractive for older workers -- those in their late 50s and early 60s still too young for Medicare -- who will find they can get affordable insurance despite health problems. That will free them from the trap of needing to work, but being too sick to stay on the job, experts say.

Entrepreneurs of all ages will be able to choose careers “based on the job where they’re going to be most productive,” says Laurel Lucia, a policy analyst at the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California, Berkeley.

But experts also caution there are many unknowns lurking in the launch of the exchanges. They’re a cornerstone of the ACA, widely known as Obamacare -- the 2010 law aimed at boosting access to coverage so that more Americans will take care of their health.

Despite years of discussion, many Americans aren’t aware that the ACA may apply to them, including the 27 million it aims to cover by 2017. In late August, a month before the launch, four in 10 Americans were still unsure about whether the ACA remained law, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll.

“There’s very little knowledge out there at this point,” says Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C. “We don’t know exactly what these plans will look like.”

Costs, provider choices and which benefits will be available on the range of basic “bronze” to cover-everything “platinum” plans have been estimated and modeled, but they won’t be certain until the exchanges go live as expected on Tuesday. Even then there will be changes and glitches, experts say. The federal government will run or help run the plan in 36 states; the rest plan to run their own.

About 7 million people are expected to sign up on the insurance exchanges, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That could include up to 1.5 million newly self-employed people as a result of ACA, according to a joint study by the Urban Institute’s Health Policy Center and Georgetown University.

“The idea is that when people have employer-sponsored insurance, even if they would like to start their own business, they might be reluctant to leave that job that provides them insurance coverage if they’re not confident they would be able to access affordable health coverage some other way,” Carole Gresenz, a health economist at Georgetown, told NBC News.

That was certainly the case for Claudia and Joseph Schulz, the Phoenix couple who campaigned for health care reform in red-state Arizona, never knowing they’d need it themselves.

“We both worked for national builders. We both made a six-figure income,” Claudia Schulz says.

Then, in 2008, when the recession hit the construction industry hard, they both lost their jobs. At the same time, Claudia discovered a lump in her breast and Joseph developed a swollen lymph node in his groin, a possible sign of testicular cancer.

“I was going to lose my health insurance a week before my surgery,” she says. “I remember thinking, if it does turn out I have cancer, how am I going to keep my insurance? I remember thinking, oh my god, health insurance is a trap.”

Neither turned out to be sick, but the effects of the scare lingered. Joseph Schulz, a mortgage broker, took a job at an online university temporarily just to have insurance to cover the family, which includes three children ages 10, 7 and 2. Claudia went back to school for a master’s degree.

They were both hired back into corporate real estate jobs, but the Schulzes always wanted to work on their own. That’s when they remembered Obamacare.

“We thought, that law is actually going to be real now,” Claudia Schulz says. “Hey, we could get that insurance. We never thought of that for us.”

In September, Joseph Schulz quit his job as a mortgage broker and Claudia Schulz arranged to work as a consultant for her former firm. They have employer-sponsored insurance through Monday.

On Tuesday, they plan to sign up for the new exchanges in Arizona, where five insurers have filed to offer care. Based on their projected $150,000 income, plus family size, the Schulzes may pay about $1,250 a month in premiums for a silver plan, or more for the top-tier platinum plan they favor, according to a calculator offered by the Berkeley labor center. At 544 percent of the federal poverty level, that’s well out of range for any government subsidies.

The care will start Jan. 1. Until then, the Schulzes figure they’ll pay about $1,600 a month for COBRA benefits to extend their insurance. That’s all a big bite out of the family’s budget, far more than the $420 a month they’ve been paying.

The extra cash -- and talk in Congress of defunding Obamacare -- raises some questions about their decision, they admit.

“To be honest, we have that fear, that they might cancel it and it may not happen. We’d have to go back to employer-based insurance,” Claudia Schulz says. “But we’re still going through with it.”

In fact, a family emergency this week reinforced their support for affordable, independent insurance. Joseph Schulz’s 57-year-old stepfather suffered a sudden stroke on Tuesday that may leave him permanently disabled. The lifelong construction worker was recently laid off from his job and has no insurance. He may qualify for Social Security disability, but he’ll also be able to get health care through the new exchange.

Still, others considering quitting their jobs for Obamacare remain cautious. Jay Narey, a 49-year-old flight attendant in Dallas, says he plans to leave the skies and start a commercial real estate business -- but not until late next year, after any glitches are addressed.

“I’m definitely interested,” says Narey. “Having access to health insurance is absolutely critical to self-employed individuals like me who no longer wish to be chained to a specific employer.”

And one 35-year-old Austin, Texas, man tells NBC News he plans use Obamacare to leave his “not exactly fulfilling” corporate job to become an independent consultant for a favorite food product. But he doesn’t want to share his name because he hasn’t told his boss – and he still needs insurance to cover his wife’s rheumatoid arthritis, a pre-existing health condition.

“I don’t know that we want to be the ones to lead out on the experiment,” the man says. “We’re probably going to wait and see how it all shakes out.”

Against a backdrop of closer-than-expected election results in Virginia that some attributed to opposition to the health law, Mr. Obama again expressed regret for the troubles at the federal website that have prevented many people from enrolling for insurance. But he said the Texas government — by refusing to take federal funds and expand Medicaid eligibility — had left more than a million people uninsured. He promised to get problems with the health program fixed.

“As challenging as this may seem sometimes, as frustrating as HealthCare.gov may be sometimes, we are going to get this done,” Mr. Obama told about 150 volunteers and paid navigators helping in enrollment who had gathered to meet him at Temple Emanu-El here. “We’re on the right side of history.”

The president made his remarks as leaders of both parties carefully examined the results of Tuesday’s elections, searching for indications of what went wrong and how they could perform better next year."

The administration announced early last week that it was delaying by one year a requirement that large employers offer access to health insurance. Officials described the delay as a common-sense concession to businesses who complained the rules were too onerous, and maintained the Treasury Department was within its right.

A Treasury official told FoxNews.com that the move was ""an exercise of the administrative authority"" under the IRS code. The official said the department has ""longstanding"" authority to ""grant transition relief when implementing new legislation"" like the health care law.

A number of Republicans pointed to the sudden change as a sign of problems to come with the massive health care law. But, as lawmakers return on Monday from the holiday break, they're also challenging whether the tweak was an abuse of power.

""This action raises a lot of questions about whether the Obama administration can simply ignore the law when it's convenient for them,"" Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., said in a statement.

He said he's asked the Congressional Research Service to ""investigate"" that issue -- ""because I don't think any president has the authority to pick and choose what parts of law to follow.""

The matter will get an airing on Capitol Hill later this week. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of a House Ways and Means subcommittee, has set a hearing for July 10 which, in part, will examine the issue of the administration's authority to change the law.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, went a step further, describing the move as ""another in a string of extra legal actions taken"" by the Obama administration.

The complaint about the administration's authority is just one of several Republicans have regarding the move to delay the mandate. They question whether more delays and changes are in store in the run-up to the Jan. 1 launch of many of the law's major provisions. They question why the so-called individual mandate -- the requirement on individuals to buy health insurance -- wasn't also delayed.

But the Treasury Department and White House, in announcing the delay last week, explained that they did so after businesses complained about the reporting requirements. As the administration moves to simplify the rules, they said, they would in turn give businesses more time to comply.

""We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively. We recognize that the vast majority of businesses that will need to do this reporting already provide health insurance to their workers, and we want to make sure it is easy for others to do so,"" Mark J. Mazur, the assistant secretary for Tax Policy at the Department of the Treasury, said last week on the Treasury blog."

The president got on the phone Monday night with supporters from Organizing for Action, his de facto campaign arm, urging them to help Americans sign up for health coverage through means other than the glitch-ridden website.

The president did misspeak when he claimed that ""more than 100 million Americans"" had enrolled in new insurance plans, a reference to the 106,000 Americans who actually did sign up for coverage through the ObamaCare exchanges.

Obama said people should be encouraged to sign up for ObamaCare in person, on the phone or through the mail, saying the HealthCare.gov website can't be the only way for people to purchase insurance through new exchanges.

He said it turns out that purchasing insurance is complicated and not everyone will use the website, but he's still confident the website will work for most Americans by Nov. 30.

More On This...

""Effectively, in a month, you've already got half a million Americans who will likely have the security of health care for the first time, in some cases in their lives, as soon as January 1st,"" Obama said. ""And that is life-changing.""

Obama also urged his supporters to continue to fight to promote the law in the midst of criticism surrounding it, saying the law's foes are spreading misinformation.

The call on Monday night represented one of the few remaining environments he can control; unlike last week's press conference in the White House briefing room where he faced tough, at times aggressive, questions from reporters. Though Obama is no longer campaigning for office, he's still pushing several major pieces of legislation in his remaining three years -- and trying to convince his base to keep the faith on ObamaCare.

The president apologized last week for the problem-plagued rollout, and specifically for the millions of cancellation notices that have gone out from insurance companies due to ObamaCare rules, despite his own promise that people could keep their plans if they wanted. Obama, in a sudden about-face, announced that his administration would allow insurance companies to continue offering out-of-compliance plans for another year.

That decision, coupled with the ongoing problems with the ObamaCare website, has stirred concern about the future health of the program. Many insurance companies and commissioners are loath to try and claw back the cancellation notices they've sent out. And while moderate Democrats had pressed the administration to make the change, others suggested the move was unnecessary.

On the president's left flank, the concern is that Obama went too far in caving to the pressure from cancellation notices.

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the president is being ""gracious"" but ""that doesn't mean that there was anything in the law that said if you like what you had before 2010 you couldn't keep it.""

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., on ABC's ""This Week,"" also suggested lawmakers knew all along that people could lose their plans -- because they wouldn't meet the minimum standards under the law.

""[Obama] should have just been specific,"" Gillibrand said. ""No, we all knew, the whole point of the plan is to cover things people need, like preventive care, birth control, pregnancy.""

In an email to supporters on Friday, Obama said: ""I want to cut through the noise and talk with you directly about where we're headed in the fight for change.""

Strategist David Axelrod, in another message on Sunday, urged backers to reserve their spot on the call, saying ""OFA has a big role to play here.""

But even some of the president's most trusted hands are starting to raise questions about the administration. Former Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, speaking Monday on NBC's ""Today,"" reiterated his call for firings over the botched rollout of the website.

He said the president is likely frustrated that nobody told him of the problems.

Former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card Jr., who served under George W. Bush, though, told Fox News that it's ""not credible"" to think the White House didn't know what was going on.

""I suspect the president even knew,"" Card said. ""I think it's time for strong new leadership to come in.""

As another recent Politico news item reported, “Fix the Debt is ramping back up its lobbying efforts as government funding fights become the topic du jour on Capitol Hill.” Politico listed a group of Republican and Democratic politicians who “met Monday with Maya MacGuineas, head of the campaign, and members of the group’s CEO council and small business members.” [...] But can they really come to a deal? Tea Party Republicans are demanding Obamacare’s repeal in return for a budget deal. The President says he’ll refuse to negotiate. Things look hopelessly gridlocked. Look again. Boehner will want to give his party’s Tea Party wing something in return for dropping their futile Obamacare attacks, and entitlements would be the perfect prize. As for the president, in a terse conversation with Boehner on Friday he merely said “he wouldn’t negotiate with him on the debt limit,” according to Boehner’s office. The president and White House officials have consistently echoed the line taken last Sunday by presidential economic advisor Gene Sperling on a reporters’ call. “The President is not going to negotiate over the debt limit,” said Sperling. (emphasis ours) [...] And Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said this: “If we found $700 billion in savings from entitlements—Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security—it would relieve pressure on the Pentagon and on non-mandatory spending. All the cuts they need are there to avoid a possible shutdown.”

While the nation is being diverted by the antics of Sen. Ted ""Calgary"" Cruz , the deficit fetishists smell blood in the water. Budget fight? That means they have a chance to get those entitlement cuts that they've devoted their lives to, because while President Obama said he wouldn't negotiate on the debt limit, he said no such thing about resolving the budget crisis. The cuts to Social Security and Medicare he offered up in his budget are still on the table, and the catfood crowd sees their opportunity, Richard Eskow explains.So tempting for would-be compromisers among the Democrats, and so unnecessary. Republicans are well aware who is going to get the blame if the government shuts down, andare the ones over a barrel. Furthermore, a willingness to allow the Republicans to see this out would go some distance to convince the GOP that, yeah, there's no negotiating the debt ceiling.

Something else Democrats should think about: cuts to Social Security and Medicare are even more unpopular than a government shutdown would be. There's no need to go there. At all.

Join Daily Kos and CREDO in telling the Senate now is not the time to think about cuts to Social Security. Now is the time to support the Harkin and Begich plans to strengthen Social Security."

USA TODAY

With the government reopened and the debt ceiling dispute deferred, President Obama and his team now face another big story this month: The error-ridden rollout Oct. 1 of the new health care law.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew went on NBC's Meet The Press on Sunday to say that officials are working around the clock on website problems that are preventing people from signing up for health care exchanges.

""I think that there's no one more frustrated than the president at the difficulty in the website,"" Lew said.

Obama himself plans to discuss the challenges Monday at what the White House is billing as a ""health care event.""

USA TODAY reported that ""the federal health care exchange was built using 10-year-old technology that may require constant fixes and updates for the next six months and the eventual overhaul of the entire system.""

On Meet The Press, Lew said that ""the huge outpouring of interest shows how important it is that we get this right. There are millions of Americans who want health insurance. It's important for our economy for them to have health insurance.""

The ""real test,"" the Treasury secretary said, comes in January, when officials learn how many people are enrolled in health care exchanges, and the quality of care that they're receiving.

Said Lew: ""If we get that right, everyone will regret that the early weeks were choppy on the website — but the test is, are people getting coverage and are they getting the care that they need? And we're confident we're going to be on track to do that.""

In the meantime, congressional Republicans who opposed the 2010 law known as Obamacare are spotlighting its early problems.

The office of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., sent out an e-mail Sunday featuring a June 7 quote from Obama: ""I think it's important for us to recognize and acknowledge this is working the way it's supposed to.""

Appearing on CBS' Face The Nation, McConnell said Obamacare is ""the worst piece of legislation passed in the last half century ... we need to get rid of it."""

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Shear']","With Enrollment Slow, Some Democrats Back Change in Health Law","WASHINGTON — Anxious congressional Democrats are threatening to abandon President Obama on a central element of his signature health care law, voicing increasing support for proposals that would allow Americans who are losing their health insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act to retain it.

The dissent comes as the Obama administration released enrollment figures on Wednesday that fell far short of expectations, and as House Republicans continued their sharp criticism of administration officials at congressional hearings examining the performance of the health care website and possible security risks of the online insurance exchanges.

In addition, a vote is scheduled Friday in the Republican-controlled House on a bill that would allow Americans to keep their existing health coverage through 2014 without penalties. The measure, drafted by Representative Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, is opposed by the White House, which argues that it would severely undermine the Affordable Care Act by allowing insurance companies to continue to sell health coverage that does not meet the higher standard of Mr. Obama’s health care law.

But a growing number of House Democrats, reflecting a strong political backlash to the rollout of the law, are warning the White House that they may support the measure if the administration does not provide a strong alternative argument. The approaching House vote is shaping up as an important test for both the health measure and the unity that Democratic leaders have so far been able to maintain around it despite a fierce Republican attack."

No. I refuse to engage you, crazy Fox News person.

It's not that I don't have a strong stomach for these things, either, which is why it's no particular stretch to listen to Fox News blowhard not-Steve-Doocy opine that women should be charged more because they live longer, or to Gretchen Carlson observing that women should get a discount because men tend to wait longer to see the doctor and end up having more expensive problems, or we could even go with the old bit about how duh, women are the ones having the babies so they naturally use more healthcare—but what's that, the good doc here isn't going to go with even that one, he's so wedded to the womens has parts argument?



Carlson pointed out that women were blamed for maternity costs, ""but men and women have babies together."" ""I agree with you that it's a shared responsibility,"" [Fox News Medical A-Team contributor Dr. David Samadi] said. ""But just the way the system are -- in my field, we only have the prostate.

I am not going to even list off the reasons why this statement made by an actual as-seen-on-teevee-medical-doctor-hi-doctor-nick-expert-guy is stupid, because it does not deserve even that much.

ObamaCare architect claims 'big PR campaign' needed,"The federal health care overhaul was central to President Obama's two campaigns for the White House, and has been the defining achievement -- for better or worse -- of his presidency.

But one of the architects of ObamaCare, in a heated interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" argued that the reason young people are not signing up in droves for coverage under the law is the administration hasn't promoted it.

Ezekiel Emanuel, a former health adviser to the president (and the brother of former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel), argued the administration has been too caught up with fixing HealthCare.gov to give the law the proper promotional push.

""No one has launched a big PR campaign to get these people signed up because of the problems with the federal website,"" he told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""We are about to launch a big PR campaign, and that, I think, is going to persuade a lot of people to sign up.""

He noted the administration still has ""four more months to go until the end of March,"" when penalties kick in for those who haven't gotten coverage.

More On This...

Obama, though, recently kicked off his latest effort to promote the benefits of the law in response to mounting criticism about its rollout. States have been promoting their health care exchanges for months, in advance of the Oct. 1 launch. And Obama spent much of the 2012 campaign touting the upsides of the law.

Whether a new promotional effort will convince young people to come onboard is unclear. Speaking earlier on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said: ""I don't see any way ObamaCare can work.""

Emanuel was responding to a recent poll that showed that vital age group was shying away from coverage.

The Harvard ""Millennials"" poll, released last week, found only 22 percent of young Americans -- defined in the survey as between 18 and 29 years old -- plan to sign up for ObamaCare. ""Actuarially, the [Affordable Care Act] depends upon these young Americans signing up,"" Trey Greyson, director of Harvard's Institute of Politics, said last week. ""Our survey shows that the administration has a lot of work to do to get them onboard.""

The Affordable Care Act relies on young, healthy people to sign up. If this doesn't happen, it could create what some have referred to as a ""death spiral,"" where insurance companies are taking on older and sicker Americans, causing premiums to skyrocket and risking the health of the whole system.

Emanuel, though, disputed the Harvard poll as ""not a very useful piece of information,"" and claimed that in states like California, the percentage of young Americans signing up is consistent with the population itself. He said he doesn't think the ""death spiral"" is a ""real possibility.""

He said he thinks young people will be incentivized to sign up, and noted that the looming penalty will convince more to sign up by March 31.

Emanuel also tried to rebut complaints that despite the president's promises, people are losing their current doctors. ""If you want to pay more for an insurance company that covers your doctor, you can do that,"" he said.

As for the problems with the website, Emanuel said the administration is ""working diligently"" to fix them.

He continued to compare the rollout to that of major tech products like the iPhone.

""I know that when I got my iPhone, there were lots of glitches. They send updates for that,"" he said. ""This happens with large-scale enrollment of millions of people.""

Asked whether someone like Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius should be fired over the botched launch, he would not say. ""He'll make a decision,"" Emanuel said of the president, adding that the decision not to appoint a ""CEO"" to oversee the launch was clearly a ""mistake."""

In one of the August emails, HealthCare.gov project manager Henry Chao responded to a proposal to delay the launch by writing: ""Can we sign this with blood?""

The details were included in a handful of emails released Friday by Republican lawmakers probing the troubled launch. The lawmakers charged that the communications offer more evidence that the administration kept quiet for months about urgent problems with the website.

""As the paper trail broadens, we see more and more evidence that the administration was fully aware its signature health care law was not ready for prime time,"" House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., said. ""The documents we are now reviewing tell a much, much different story than what officials testified to Congress.""

The emails pertained to the online SHOP Marketplace, which is meant for small businesses and has suffered a series of setbacks. The administration announced in late September that it was pushing off the launch until mid-November. But then one day before the Thanksgiving holiday, the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would push off online enrollment by another year.

A statement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services claimed the email excerpts released Friday ""are between a small group of individuals involved in a broader decision-making process, and they reflect one piece of many conversations about managing deliverables and communicating expectations.""

The statement said the emails ""do not reflect final decisions made by more senior CMS officials.""

CMS claimed the final decision to delay enrollment was not made until mid-September.

Chao, a top official at CMS, testified last month before the House Energy and Commerce Committee that he tends to ""err on the side of caution"" and can get ""a little passionate in my emails.""

Chao, in the emails, made the ""blood"" comment after an exchange among officials with his department and contractor CGI Federal.

Initially, a CMS official said he is ""not recommending a delay.""

But on Aug. 6, Monique Outerbridge, director of the CMS Office of Information Services, wrote:

""Guys, this is absolutely urgent and I need an answer on this today. If this is late we have to public announce we are late with a deliverable which means [CMS Administrator] Marilyn Tavenner and the Secretary will have to announce.""

CGI official Mark Calem then pitched a tentative schedule that would push off the full launch until Nov. 15.

That's when Chao apparently asked if they could ""sign this with blood"" -- according to committee Republicans, CGI agreed to the dates.

Republicans indicated they plan to grill Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius about this and other issues when she testifies next week.

On Friday, CMS officials began to provide details about another problematic issue for the rollout -- flawed data being sent from HealthCare.gov to insurance companies through what's known as 834 forms.

Officials said as many as one in four of the forms may have had problems in October and November, but the error rate is now down to roughly one in 10.

Officials said CMS is working with insurance companies to resolve the issue, and suggested people who think they have enrolled contact the insurer and pay the first month's premium to make sure.

The better the access to health care for her constituents, the poorer the odds for South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's Republican Party.

Medicaid rolls in South Carolina will grow by about 162,000 people by the middle of 2015. Had the state expanded Medicaid, another 340,000 people would get coverage. As it is, at least many more children will be covered, and their parents will probably find out in the process that if their governor hadn't been such an asshole, they would have coverage, too.

From Joan's earlier piece on South Carolina's expanding Medicaid rolls Even in South Carolina, a state hostile to Obamacare expansion, hundreds of thousands of people are benefiting just from greater awareness of existing government programs for which theyqualify. And while most of those beneficiaries are children, those children have families who would appreciate access to similar services, if only Republicans would get out of the way.

But South Carolina is solidly Red, right? Romney won the state by 11 points, right? So it doesn't matter! Except that in raw totals, Romney won by around 204,000 votes. And Republicans assume (perhaps rightly) that every Obamacare beneficiary will become much more favorable toward the government. And if you start thinking government can help you, Republicans don't stand a chance.

So for the them, it's bad enough that nearly 200,000 South Carolina residents (mostly children) will soon be part of their so-called ""culture of dependency"". That alone has potentially negative electoral ramifications. But had South Carolina taken federal dollars to give another 340,000 of its residents access to low-cost health services, their entire GOP's existence would be imperiled.

That's why Republicans continue to fight tooth and nail against Obamacare, from seeking its repeal to sabotaging its rollout. It's an existential crisis. The more people benefit, the harder it will be for them to argue that government is irreparably broken and must be drowned in Grover Norquist's bathtub.

http://www.nbcnews.com/health/slip-sliding-away-6-ways-obamacare-aint-what-it-used-2D11783910,2013-12-20 20:43:00+00:00,['Maggie Fox'],Slip-sliding away: 6 ways Obamacare isn't what it used to be,"President Barack Obama says the disastrous rollout of the HealthCare.gov exchanges were the worst moment of 2013 for him at a White House news conference Friday. LARRY DOWNING / Reuters

The health insurance exchanges were supposed to be the crowning glory of Obamacare -- an easy way to help the 45 million people who don't have health insurance get some. Turns out, it hasn't been so easy. The White House has rolled out so many last-minute fixes that critics and supporters alike are asking how anyone can understand what the rules are now.

First, it was a year’s reprieve for businesses that were supposed to be providing health insurance for workers. Then came a batch of delays, exemptions and other exceptions, coming to a head late Thursday night as the White House scrambled to announce -- and then clarify -- a break for people who are the most furious about losing their insurance coverage.



Republicans piled on Friday, saying the White House has now made meaningless the individual mandate – the requirement that everyone have health insurance or pay a tax .

Here’s a run-down of what's changed so far:



1. The exemption. Thursday night, the Obama administration offered a special “hardship exemption” to people whose individual plans were canceled and who have yet to arrange other coverage. They can get either extremely cheap, bare-bones plans known as catastrophic coverage, or skip health insurance without paying the tax.

These catastrophic plans had only been available to people under 30 or those who could not find health insurance plans with premiums costing less than 8 percent of their income. An updated list of exemptions includes those who recently filed for bankruptcy or had medical expenses they couldn't pay, among other hardships.

2. The slip. Late in November, the administration gave people an extra week to get signed up, slipping the deadline from Dec. 15 to Dec. 23 for people who wanted to enroll and get health insurance starting the first day possible, Jan. 14. This came with a clear admission that the federal online insurance exchange was badly flawed.



The site went down again for repairs for several hours on Friday, just days before one major deadline for people to use it. ""We screwed it up,"" President Obama said in his last news conference of the year.



3. The slide. Last week, officials gave people another week to pay their first premiums and still get coverage. This was forced on insurers: the industry later said it would let people pay as late as Jan. 10 and still get credit for coverage starting Jan. 1, so long as they had already signed up. It's a big concession — insurers usually like a lot more lead time and they want everything buttoned up, including payment, before they hand out insurance cards.

4. The fix. After an onslaught of attacks about his promise that “if you like you insurance plan, you can keep it”, Obama formally apologized and said that people could, in fact, keep their policies – even if they were policies his administration said were rotten and provided lousy coverage. The catch: insurance companies may have already discontinued the plans and state insurance commissioners would have to agree, and not all did.

5. The redefinition. There was October’s redefinition of what the March 31 deadline meant, made after it looked as if people needed to actually sign up by Feb. 15 to make the March 31 deadline to have coverage or pay a tax.

6. The delay. Back in July, the administration delayed for one year the requirement that large employers provide health insurance for their employees. The 2010 health reform law requires anyone with 50 or more workers to provide health insurance – something small businesses have been complaining about, loudly, for years. On Tuesday, the government said they could have more time to get it done.

But Obama says despite the tweaks, the law is working.

""The basic structure of the law is working, despite all the problems,"" Obama said.

He said at least 500,000 people, and maybe more, have managed to sign up using the federal and state web sites. ""Since that time, I now have a couple of million people, maybe more, who are going to have health care on Jan. 1 and that is a big deal. That's why I ran for this office,"" Obama added. California says it got more than 53,000 people signed up in just the first three days of this week.

None of the delays appear to have helped Obama’s approval rating – the latest NBC/WSJ poll gave Obama a job approval rating of just 43 percent. Half of those surveyed said they are dissatisfied or disappointed with Obama’s presidency and 58 percent say their discontent comes from his handling of health reform.

And the delays appear to have rewarded people who want to defy the law’s requirements, rather than those who did what the administration asked and signed up early.

“This is a slap in the face to the thousands of Americans who have already purchased expensive insurance through the Obamacare exchanges,” said Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who has been an outspoken critic of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

Administration officials called the latest changes “common sense."" ""This is essentially an additional safety net in case folks might have slipped through the cracks,"" Obama said. But the insurance industry and critics said they just made things even more bewildering.

“One thing is certain: The Administration’s latest initiative is not going to simplify anything,” Robert Moffit and Alyene Senger, health policy experts at the right-leaning Heritage Foundation, wrote in a blog post. “Rest assured it is going to create even greater confusion for health insurers trying to sell these products. Also, don’t expect the unhappy consumers who’ve just lost their previous coverage to understand clearly which plan they can pick and be legally qualified to pick it.”

Health policy expert Doug Holtz-Eakin, who leads the center-right American Action Forum, says this week’s changes are “a big deal”. “Substantively, it opens the door to deferring the mandate entirely and by acknowledging that catastrophic plans would be suitable coverage it makes a lie of all the rhetoric about how existing insurance (“underinsurance”) is ‘subpar’ and ‘poor,’” he wrote in a blog post.



“It is an invitation to those who have chosen policies through HealthCare.gov to cancel them and waive the mandate.”

Boodman Created The Washington Post'S Medical Mysteries Column"", 'Is A Regular Contributor To Kaiser Health News', 'An Editorially Independent Project Of The Nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.']",Depression and possible dementia masked the real problem,"Bebe Bahnsen remembers the night, alone in her small cottage on the Alabama coast, that she felt a strong urge to drink a can of drain cleaner.

For years, antidepressants combined with talk therapy had enabled Bahnsen, whose first name is Beatrice, to function well, establishing a thriving public relations business in Washington followed by a career as a newspaper reporter. But those days had been supplanted by a prolonged suicidal depression that had proved impervious to electroshock treatments, periodic hospitalizations and a raft of psychiatric drugs. The phone call in which Bahnsen confided her desire to drink poison seemed to confirm the worst fears of one of her closest friends.

“I figured, well, she was one of those people who just was not ever going to get better,” said Paddy Bowman, a folklore specialist who lives in Alexandria.

Bahnsen, now 73, traces the beginning of her psychological slide to the mid-1990s, when she decided that, after two decades, she’d had enough of Washington. She moved back to her home state of Georgia and her life slowly began to unravel. She felt estranged from her large and devoted circle of friends, began having problems at work, and grew restless and increasingly depressed.

“I felt as though I was on a large island and everyone was slowly moving away and I was there by myself,” Bahnsen recalled. For the first time in her life, she said, she was intermittently psychotic. Periodic suicide attempts, some involving overdoses of prescribed sleeping pills, landed her in a series of mental hospitals.

In November 2006 she was hospitalized in Las Vegas, where she was then living with one of her sons. Doctors, baffled by her longstanding failure to improve, decided to take a closer look at her case. What they found resulted in an entirely different treatment, one that had a rapid and dramatic effect on her mental state.

Neurologist Dariusz Gawronski, who treated Bahnsen, said her case remains one of the most memorable of his 20-year career.

“It’s very rare in this country to see this,” said Gawronski, who attended medical school in his native Poland before finishing his training in the United States. “It does make you wonder why there was [such] inattention prior to her deterioration.”

Better after Prozac — at first

Bahnsen, who had endured a difficult childhood, was open with her friends about her struggle with depression. Until her move to Atlanta when she was in her mid-50s, she had never been hospitalized: Psychotherapy and antidepressants, especially Prozac, had been effective.

“Bebe had this really rich, interesting life,” said Bowman, her close friend since the 1970s. When she moved to Atlanta, Bahnsen quickly found work as a reporter at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a job she liked.

Restless and increasingly dissatisfied after a few years, Bahnsen moved to Sarasota, Fla., then to Pensacola and after that to Alabama, propelled by forces she did not understand. Each time, she remembers thinking that a move might be therapeutic — a fresh start.

“But I found it harder and harder to talk to people, and I was more depressed and more distant,” she recalled.

Bowman said she and other friends watched helplessly, unsure about what was fueling Bahnsen’s peripatetic existence and alarmed by her rambling, sometimes incoherent conversations. “She started being kind of paranoid about people at work, fixating on one woman to whom she ascribed ‘evil intent,’ ” Bowman said. “At times she seemed psychotic.”

“Friends started dropping her, saying, ‘She’s too crazy, I can’t deal with it,’ ” Bowman recalled. “She wore everybody out.”

In March 2002, while hospitalized in Mobile because of suicidal thoughts including her desire to drink drain cleaner, a doctor ordered an MRI scan of her brain. Bahnsen said she is not sure why the test was ordered, but she believes it was because the psychiatrist could not figure out why more than a dozen drugs she had taken in various combinations over the years had not alleviated her psychotic depression.

The MRI showed a small meningioma. One of the most common brain tumors — it is diagnosed in 6,500 Americans annually — meningiomas are typically benign. Depending on their location, they may cause no symptoms; many are discovered incidentally during a brain scan performed for another reason. Such tumors, which have been linked to exposure to radiation including from dental X-rays, often grow slowly.

Bahnsen remembers feeling terrified by the news she had a brain tumor. She said she asked the neurologist whether the mass might have something to do with her depression.

“I vividly remember he told me emphatically that had nothing to do with it,” she recalled. “He said, ‘It’s small, benign and don’t worry about it.’ So I didn’t.”

Bowman remembers Bahnsen calling her about the diagnosis and feeling disappointed it wasn’t the reason for her friend’s worsening mental illness. “I had never heard of a meningioma,” she said, “but the doctor said nothing needed to be done.”

Soon afterward, Bahnsen moved to Arizona to live with one of her sons, an arrangement that lasted only a few months. She moved back to Georgia, sometimes staying with friends or renting a short-term apartment.

“I struggled to eke out a living,” she said. Too disabled to work as a reporter, she cobbled together freelance writing jobs. In 2005 she underwent a series of eight electroshock treatments at an Atlanta psychiatric hospital, hoping they would jolt her out of her depression. The sessions, which resulted in memory loss, did little to relieve the blackness that had engulfed her.

The following year, she moved to Las Vegas to live with her other son.

“It’s just extremely difficult to express how horrible my depression had become,” Bahnsen said, adding that she was aware of becoming “more and more batty. I had never experienced anything like it.”

She was also terrified that her cognitive ability was slipping. She was having trouble expressing herself and feared she was developing dementia, even though she was barely 66.

Around Thanksgiving 2006, a serious suicide attempt landed her in a Las Vegas hospital. By now, she said, she also was falling, although doctors weren’t sure why.

While hospitalized, doctors took her off all medication, a technique known as a washout, to see if some of her symptoms might be drug-related. Seeing no improvement, Gawronski was called in as a neurological consultant to assess her for dementia.

Just in time

Gawronski, who now practices in Baton Rouge, remembers that Bahnsen was confused and not very alert; she spoke but could not formulate questions.

He ordered a brain MRI and quickly discovered the probable reason for her dementia: the meningioma, roughly the size of a peanut when it was discovered four years earlier, had grown to the size of a lime. The tumor was pressing on her left frontal lobe, the portion of the brain responsible for speech, movement, emotional regulation and reasoning.

Most alarming was the evidence of “mass effect”: The tumor appeared to be exacerbating her previously manageable depression, causing personality and mood changes. Doctors were most worried about herniation, an often fatal condition that occurs when the brain is squeezed and shifts out of position.

“She was deteriorating,” Gawronski recalled, “and if the downward pressure from the tumor increased, she could have lapsed into a coma.” Gawronski estimated that Bahnsen was “possibly days away from that.”

On Dec. 4, 2006, Bahnsen underwent an emergency operation to remove the benign meningioma. Days after surgery, she began feeling like herself again, although her memory of the preceding year remains hazy.

“I felt like I had my mind back,” she recalled. “It was the most amazing feeling.”

Bowman, who had learned about the surgery from Bahnsen’s son, was astonished by how transformed her friend sounded when Bahnsen called her a few weeks later.

“I thought, ‘Oh, my God, it’s you,’ ” Bowman remembers thinking. “It was like the old Bebe was back. I wish I had done some research after she told me about the meningioma the first time, but I believed that doctor, which is something I’ll always regret.”

Bahnsen said she does not remember that the neurologist who discovered the tumor in 2002 told her it needed to be monitored regularly, which is standard medical advice. And because he insisted that it was unrelated to her worsening depression, she did not think to mention it to doctors she saw subsequently.

After several weeks in the hospital, Bahnsen spent about a month in a rehab facility. On Feb. 27, 2007, the neurosurgeon who operated on her wrote that “she has made a remarkable recovery. She went from being completely unresponsive to a walking, talking normal human being again.”

Gawronksi said that even a meningioma that doesn’t cause problems should be tracked with regular brain scans. If it becomes too large or its location is problematic, surgery to remove it is often recommended.

Gawronski said he suspects that Bahnsen’s frequent moves may have led to “the continuity of care being fractured.”

Tumor redux

In 2007, Bahnsen returned to Georgia and has lived there since.

Last year, she underwent a second operation to remove a new meningioma. Smaller than the first, it was classified as atypical, meaning it is more likely to be cancerous if it recurs.

This second surgery involved a harrowing complication: Bahnsen developed a serious postoperative infection that required two additional operations, which left part of her face collapsed.

Bahnsen said she tries not to worry about what might happen in the future; most days she feels fine physically and cherishes her close relationships. She has begun writing again, and doesn’t like to dwell on the what-ifs — such as what if her tumor had been discovered sooner, sparing her years of misery and disability?

“When I think about that, I get extremely angry,” she said. “Luckily, it was so wonderful that Dr. Gawronski knew what to do.”

One of them involved the case of John Connelly, a Rutgers student who found himself in debt, without a permanent job, and forced to sleep on his friend's couch. His story was one that was all too common in the age of Obama, Cruz concluded.

Well, it turns out that Connelly isn't the biggest fan of Cruz. What's more, he is actually a beneficiary of the very health care law that Cruz was protesting during his speech. And in an appearance on MSNBC Friday morning, Connelly explained just how ironic it was that the senator would use his story to bludgeon the president and the Affordable Care Act.

""A friend of mine called me the next morning as I was on the way to an optometrist appointment .... [and said], 'While Ted Cruz was talking about why the ACA's bad, he mentioned your name.' And I said, 'Well, that's funny. I'm heading to an appointment I can only go to because of Obamacare.'""

The agency, Covered California, unveiled its portfolio of policy options for smaller businesses Thursday. They include both health maintenance organizations and preferred provider networks and will be available in all parts of the state as of Jan. 1.

Rates in most of the state’s populous counties are expected to be significantly below premiums now charged by insurers for similar plans. Average premiums for a 40-year-old employee are slated to fall 17% in southern Los Angeles County and 13% in the northern part. Rates for younger and older workers are expected to drop proportionally, Covered California said.

An important element of President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, these small-business exchange policies will take effect Jan. 1. Insurance companies will continue to offer small-business policies apart from the exchange.

Giving small-business owners new options to help their employees is crucial in California, healthcare advocates argue. According to the California Healthcare Foundation, the state has more than 7 million people under the age of 65 who don’t have health insurance. Statewide, 25% of workers are not insured. That rises to 40% at companies with fewer than 10 people.

“This adds competition to the marketplace,” said Scott Hauge, a San Francisco insurance broker and president of Small Business California, which advocates for half a million employers around the state. “The exchange clearly will be a major competitor.”

Businesses with fewer than 50 employees can take advantage of the buying power of the exchange’s new Small Business Health Options Program. However, they are not required to do so under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Small businesses with fewer than 25 full-time workers that purchase the state-backed coverage could further lower their costs by qualifying for a federal tax credit of as much as 50% of total employer-paid premiums.

Individuals not covered by employer or government programs will be subject to financial penalties if they don’t get insurance.

Participating insurance companies include Blue Shield of California, Chinese Community Health Plan, Health Net, Kaiser Permanente, Sharp Health Plan and Western Health Advantage. Each provider will offer four tiers of benefits dubbed Platinum for the most comprehensive, followed by Gold, Silver and Bronze.

Employers will pick the level of coverage they want. Employees would still be free to choose among all the locally available products within that category, even if they are from different insurance companies. Prices and benefits can vary from insurer to insurer, even if they are in the same category.

Not participating in the small-business exchange is Anthem Blue Cross, the largest for-profit health insurer in the state.

California has aggressively prepared to put into place Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act — informally known as Obamacare — since he signed it into law in 2010. Earlier this year, the administration of Gov. Jerry Brown made public its programs for covering individuals.

The latest offering should be a boost for small businesses because it will put them “on par with larger employers in terms of benefits,” said Peter V. Lee, executive director of Covered California.

“Employer-sponsored health coverage,” he said, “has historically played an important role in insuring Californians. Our launch of a full-choice, small-group market is a testament to the state’s commitment to build on the critical role of employer-based coverage.”

Although Covered California gives small employers a range of options to attract and keep employees, it might not be the best deal for all companies, especially those that operate on slim profit margins, said John Arensmeyer, founder and chief executive of Small Business Majority, a national lobbying group based in San Francisco Bay Area.

“They may sit down and do calculations and there may be situations where it’s better for the employees to go to the individual exchange and get subsidies,” Arensmeyer said. But, what’s important, he stressed, is that either way the workers will have health insurance that they couldn’t previously get.

“Ultimately, Secretary Sebelius will testify,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the chamber’s No. 2 Democrat, told “Fox News Sunday.”

Sebelius and the entire Obama administration has declined requests to testify on Capitol Hill about the site, which has been plagued by crashes, slow responses and other glitches since it went online Oct. 1.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a letter directly to Sebelius last week asking her to testify Thursday on the matter.

Sebelius has yet to respond publicly, but reportedly plans to attend a gala the night before in Boston, which has fueled calls for resignation.

Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said he’s “reluctant” to call for an immediate dismissal in such situations, but was critical of Sebelius for so far not agreeing to testify.

“Her refusal to testify and be transparent has undermined her credibility,” he told Fox News, adding her not testifying could lead to her resignation.

House investigators say they want to know whether officials involved in the website “didn’t know or didn’t disclose” problems, after repeatedly saying the site was “on track” to launch.

Though the White House said this weekend that 476,000 people have applied online for health insurance, officials have yet to say how many people have bought a policy.

Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt told Fox News that Sebelius’ position appears “unsustainable.”

“She cannot sustain it,” he said. “She’ll have to testify.”

Commerce committee Chairman Fred Upton began focusing on Secretary Sebelius after she went to Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart” last week to talk about the website.

“Secretary Sebelius had time for Jon Stewart, and we expect her to have time for Congress,” the Michigan Republican has repeatedly said."

In an undated memo to employees, UPS (UPS) said it will discontinue coverage for all working spouses who are eligible for insurance with their own employer. That applies to about 15,000 spouses covered by UPS today.

The internal document was obtained by Kaiser Health News. UPS told the nonprofit news agency that the policy applies only to non-union U.S. workers. It hasn't responded to questions from CNNMoney.

In the memo, UPS said it's willing to take care of its own, but it won't bear a burden that other companies can take on.

""We believe your spouse should be covered by their own employer -- just as UPS has a responsibility to offer coverage to you, our employee,"" the memo states.

Spouses of UPS employees who don't work -- or who are not offered coverage by their own employer -- will get to stay on the UPS plan.

Most of the company's workers, such as delivery workers and truck drivers, are unionized through the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and receive insurance under a different plan.

UPS blamed the move on several aspects of Obamacare, including mandatory coverage for dependent children up to age 26 and new government fees.

""We are making these changes to offset cost increases due to the [Affordable Care Act],"" the memo states.

In the memo, UPS said its health care costs usually increase about 7% a year, but that it expects those costs to climb by 11.25% in 2014 due to Obamacare.

The company also said that 35% of companies intend to make the same changes to their plans, but didn't cite specific market data.

A recent survey by consulting firm Towers Watson found that next year, 18% of employers will require that workers' spouses buy insurance from their own employer before turning to the surveyed company for insurance.

Related: The overblown Obamacare myth about small business

UPS's move is the latest example of the corporate response to Obamacare, although the law won't begin to kick in until Jan. 1.

Employers are worried that premiums will rise. And they'll also be required to pay a fee for every person on their plans, starting at $63 a head next year.

The federal Department of Health and Human Services has said the fee would help with the transition as the American health care system accepts many new sick, previously uninsured people."

McWain lives alone and is semi-paralyzed from the waist down. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)

After a spinal condition paralyzed her legs six years ago, Joyce McWain-Gray crawled to her second-floor bedroom in a LeDroit Park rowhouse and holed up for nearly a year.

For her weekly medical appointments, the 56-year-old relied on District firefighters to carry her down the 12 steps from her room.

McWain-Gray grew hopeless, she said, until a social worker told her about the District’s Elderly and Persons with Physical Disabilities Waiver Program.

The Medicaid program sent an aide to her house for 16 hours a day to help her bathe, dress, cook and clean. She got a motorized wheelchair and learned to ride the bus.

Then one day her freedom ended.

The District would no longer pay for her care during evening hours, she learned in a letter from her home health agency. Then, three days later, the aide left a stack of adult diapers and a cooler of food next to McWain-Gray’s bed and left.

“They helped me with everything, and then all of a sudden it was gone,” said McWain-Gray, who lives on $710 a month in Social Security benefits. “I can’t even go to the bathroom by myself.”

McWain-Gray was illegally dropped from the program, her attorneys say, along with hundreds of other elderly or disabled people in the District — a move that attorneys who work for the city concede might have been improper.

The Washington Post found that the District cut 366 people from all or some of the services they may have been eligible to receive in the nine months ended March 2012, according to records on file at the D.C. Attorney General’s Office. About a third of those people died, the office said. The District doesn’t know how they died because the program doesn’t get copies of death certificates, officials said.

“These are absolutely critical services. The safety net falls and we look at dire consequences,” said Rebekah Mason, a staff attorney for the AARP’s Legal Counsel for the Elderly, which has represented about a dozen people facing termination from the District’s Medicaid waiver program.

Reinstatement possible

Officials with the District’s Department of Health Care Finance, which runs the waiver program, deny wrongfully cutting anyone from home health services. They said many participants lose their spots when contract case managers submit incomplete or late annual paperwork required by federal law. They said people can request an administrative hearing to fight the terminations and get back into the program if they are eligible. In the past two years, the District reinstated about 600 people, said Yvonne Iscandari, program director for the department’s Division of Long Term Care.

“You are not going to have a perfect system,” said Iscandari, who oversees the waiver program. “You are going to have instances where somewhere in the process somebody’s eligibility was not updated.”

But even home health agencies that contract with the District — and take some of the blame — worry that the District’s bureaucracy puts vulnerable people in peril.

“We’re not totally innocent in this, but some of the processes they’ve implemented have put some of the patients at risk and the agencies at risk,” said Linda Davis, owner of Premium Select Home Care, which serves about 100 Medicaid recipients in the District.

About two dozen licensed home health-care agencies contract with the District to serve about 3,000 people in the program. The District created the program in 1999, six years after Congress allowed Medicaid money to cover basic home help that doesn’t require a nurse. People must make less than $2,130 a month to qualify. The District funds 30 percent of the program and the federal government covers the rest.

The popular program reached its cap in 2011, creating a waiting list of more than 1,000 people. That triggered a paperwork backlog for contract case managers, who must get doctors to approve the level of care for each client every year. If they file it late or at the last minute, the District might not have time to authorize the continued care before the federal deadline, District officials said. That’s when the system ends the aid.

Legal guidance

Many of those people cut from the program got help from a handful of organizations that provide free legal services to seniors and people with disabilities. Attorneys for University Legal Services said they have taken up 30 to 40 termination cases in the past year and half. In some of those cases, people returned home from a brief hospital stay to discover that their aide and spot in the program were gone.

McWain-Gray is one of the people that University Legal Services helped.

She was still wearing a neck brace from a recent spinal surgery when she called for help in January 2012.

McWain-Gray said she remembers trying to change her diaper in bed in the evenings. She could not sit up. Widowed with no children, she says she had no one to turn to.

McWain-Gray’s attorney requested a hearing in front of an administrative judge, arguing that the District broke the law by not giving the woman enough notice of the pending termination.

Ending the Medicaid benefits of people who are eligible for them is illegal, said her attorney, Marjorie Rifkin. Within a few days of ending services, the District placed McWain-Gray back in the program and restored the 16 hours of daily home care.

Some clients receive vague notices that they will soon lose their home care. Others never get a notice. The practice is forcing people into nursing homes or leaving them to fend for themselves, Rifkin said. That led her and four other attorneys to write a complaint to D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) in February 2012, threatening to sue the city if it didn’t make changes.

“We urge you to intervene to stop this practice and remediate the harm to those who need EPD Waiver services and supports to remain in their homes and the community,” read the complaint from the National Senior Citizens Law Center and University Legal Services.

Various outcomes

Attorneys who work for the city responded a few months later, saying that more than 300 people might have been improperly terminated from the program. Staff from Health Care Finance tracked down those people and found that 133 had died and 37 had entered nursing homes or other long-term care facilities, according to the letter. An additional 95 placed on the basic state Medicaid plan said they were satisfied with it. The District also took 69 people back into the waiver program at their request, the letter said.

The bureaucratic mess almost left one Northeast Washington man without anyone to care for his 89-year-old mother, who has dementia. Dwayne Hughes, 52, said he reached out for legal help after the woman’s home health-care agency kept calling to say that the District wasn’t paying. In November, Legal Counsel for the Elderly got Hughes’s mother back into the program.

“I made a commitment that I would take care of my mom. I’m going to keep her in the home as long as possible,” said Hughes, who arranged for 12 hours of daily care for his mother while he works evenings at a telecommunications company in McLean. “This is a good program, but there needs to be more oversight.”

Health Care Finance officials point to steps the District has taken to prevent people from losing the waiver benefits. District staff held mandatory training sessions for all case managers last year, focusing on the need to complete annual recertification on time, Iscandari said. Health Care Finance also began mailing notices to participants 90 days and 30 days ahead of their yearly recertification deadline. And all 1,397 people on the waiting list have received notice of available slots, she said.

The 30-day termination notices, which tell participants that they can request a hearing, help ensure that everyone who is eligible for home aid will continue to get it, Iscandari said. The program does not track how many people are terminated, when or why.

More to be done

Attorneys and advocates for Medicaid recipients say the District hasn’t done enough. People who don’t request a hearing can still lose their services because of the District’s administrative errors, Rifkin said.

“We don’t think the problem has been solved,” she said. “They’ve failed to manage the process.”"

It may be either (or both). But the idea of closing down the government, and even threatening to precipitate a global credit crisis, over the healthcare law has been widely written off as myopia on the part of the live-free-or-die crowd.

We’re not so sure. Focusing on Obamacare in general, and mandatory coverage in particular, could prove a plausible strategy for broadening the anti-Obama coalition to include voters in their 20s and 30s by bringing attention to what economists call the “cross-subsidy” inherent in any insurance system based on mandatory coverage. And, with hindsight, it may yet be seen as the opening salvo in a generational war, one fed by the reality that older Americans are a rapidly growing burden on younger workers, who can ill afford it.

As everybody with a pulse must know by now, if the only folks who buy Obamacare coverage are the sick and those in late middle age, the system will be self-supporting only at very high premiums, hardly a recipe for cementing popular support. That’s why candidate Obama reluctantly accepted the individual mandate as part of his health insurance plan, adding a spoonful of sugar for those who are poorly paid (but Medicaid ineligible) in the form of need-based subsidies. Indeed, as pundit Matt Miller has pointed out, such generational transfers are the keystone to virtually all health insurance: Employer-based group insurance works only because younger workers help carry older ones.

There are powerful economic arguments in favor of universal coverage. For one thing, it solves the “free-riding” problem. Because we collectively assume responsibility for the uninsured when they end up in the hospital anyway, why not ask them to take some responsibility before the fact? Equally to the point, mandatory coverage would probably cut the country’s total medical bill, reducing the financial incentive for an individual to delay treatment until a garden-variety illness morphs into a case for the ICU.

That said, it is still foolish to ignore the leverage that the individual mandate gives opponents of Obamacare. America’s healthcare system for the elderly (Medicare, plus Medicaid for nursing-home care) is already edging the country toward generational war because Washington will sooner or later be forced to choose between drastic limitations on coverage in those programs or drastic increases in taxes on the decreasing portion of working Americans. Now we’re adding a parallel obligation on younger workers to subsidize healthcare for fiftysomethings.

What to do? The path of least political resistance is to tough it out, hoping younger households will be unable to figure out what’s happening, or simply unwilling to throw in their lot with opponents of gay marriage, marijuana reform and the like. Alternatively, we could start paying attention to the building crisis as younger households scramble ever harder for a middle-class living standard.

And none too soon, because the signs of generational conflict are already appearing. Think, for example, of the flare in anger over the burden of college loans. Or the popular resentment of government employees who (at least until recently) could count on job stability, adequate health insurance and even pensions.

Those of us who are doing very well in a system that isn’t working very well for the majority would be wise to do something about it before the doo-doo hits the fan. Then again, in light of what’s been happening in Washington lately, maybe it’s already too late.

Boehner on Thursday promised a “big victory” when the chamber votes to defund President Obama’s healthcare law as part of a must-pass bill to keep the government running. But it may be short-lived: The White House has promised a veto.

Republicans in Congress believe the American people are on their side as they head toward Friday’s vote, using the threat of a government shutdown on Oct. 1 to force the president to undo his signature healthcare law. They insist opposition to the Affordable Care Act will force Obama to change course.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a potential presidential candidate, vowed Thursday to use “any procedural means necessary,” including a filibuster, to stop the healthcare law in the Senate.

But the White House made it clear Thursday that the president would veto such a bill, and Senate Democrats appear to have the votes to strip the provision to defund the healthcare law, often called Obamacare, and send the funding bill back to the House for another vote.

“I want to be absolutely crystal clear: Any bill that defunds Obamacare is dead, dead,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Thursday. “It’s a waste of time.”

Even though Boehner joined with his right flank to pursue the strategy, many top Republicans are wary the party will be blamed if the government shuts down once the money runs out Sept. 30.

The last time the government shut down, during the Clinton administration, it was Republicans led by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia who suffered much of the blame.

Boehner’s conservative majority insist they will not back down. They see the launch of the new health insurance online marketplaces, which begin Oct. 1, as one of their best chances to stop the law.

“This is the reason I came to Congress,” said Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.).

If the Senate sends the funding bill back to the House late next week, as is expected, Boehner may be forced to rely on Democrats to pass it, as many Republicans promise their opposition.

The speaker declined Thursday to say whether he would violate the so-called Hastert Rule, which requires “a majority of the majority” to be on board before a bill is brought up for a vote.

“We’ll have plenty of time next weekend to discuss that,” Boehner said, implying that Congress may need to hold a weekend session to avert the shutdown.

The shutdown fight is the first in a series of budget battles House Republicans are promising this fall, with another one coming in a matter of weeks: If Republicans fail to stop the Affordable Care Act now, Boehner will seek a one-year delay of the health law in exchange for the White House’s request to raise the debt limit to continue paying the nation’s bills. That vote is expected in mid-October.

Using the debt limit as leverage is a risky endeavor for the fragile U.S. economy, and the last time congressional Republicans and the White House fought over the debt limit, in 2011, it led to a rare lowering of the U.S. credit rating.

In the days ahead, the options for Cruz and his conservative Senate allies to push the defunding of the healthcare law may be limited.

Cruz came under fire from House Republicans for not vowing a sufficient fight in the upper chamber – one that would require the senators to seize the floor in a round-the-clock filibuster.

“I expect my Senate colleagues to be up for the battle,” Boehner said Thursday.

But under Senate procedures, the GOP may not be able to prevent Democrats from stripping out the healthcare provision unless Republicans tank the entire bill, which they do not appear ready to do.

The Texas senator said the administration should give ordinary Americans the same one-year delay of the mandate to carry health insurance, which begins Jan. 1, 2014, as it has given to businesses.

“This is about the American people,” Cruz said. “Why is President Obama threatening to shut down the federal government to deny those same waivers to hard-working Americans?”

Democrats, though, argued that they will not undo the healthcare law, which has been upheld by the Supreme Court, and the Republican strategy risks shuttering the government.

“Republican leadership has been dragged kicking and screaming into a fight that they know is bad for their party and bad for their country, and they should know it’s a fight they will not win,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “And the whole country has been dragged closer to a government shutdown.”

The funding bill, if approved, would keep the government running until Dec. 15.

http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/06/news/economy/obamacare-premiums/index.html,2013-08-06 00:00:00,['Tami Luhby'],Where Obamacare premiums will soar,"Get ready to shell out more money for individual health insurance under Obamacare ... in some states, that is.

While many residents in New York and California may see sizable decreases in their premiums, Americans in many places could face significant increases if they buy insurance through state-based exchanges next year.

That's because these people live in states where insurers were allowed to sell bare-bones plans and exclude the sick, which has kept costs down. Under Obamacare, insurers must offer a package of essential benefits -- including maternity, mental health and medications -- and must cover all who apply. But more comprehensive coverage may lead to more expensive insurance plans.

Under Obamacare, all Americans must have insurance coverage starting in 2014 or face penalties of $95 or 1% of family income, whichever is greater. Enrollment in the exchanges begins October 1, with coverage kicking in in January. Plans will come in four tiers, ranging from bronze to platinum.

Some lightly regulated states, including Indiana, Ohio, Florida and South Carolina, have recently released preliminary rate information highlighting steep price increases. Unlike the blue states of California and New York, these are Republican-led states that have strongly opposed the Affordable Care Act, as Obamacare is officially known.

Related: I'm signing up for Obamacare

Comparing this year's and next year's plans isn't easy because the structure of the plans is so different. Each state comes up with its own method.

Behind the numbers in 3 key states. In Florida, for instance, officials constructed a hypothetical silver-level plan based on the offerings available today. Then they looked at how the cost of that plan compares to the average silver plan that will be available on the exchange. Florida found premiums will rise between 7.6% and 58.8%, depending on the insurer. The average increase would be 35%.

The main driver of the premium increases is the Obamacare mandate that coverage be offered to everyone, said Kevin McCarty, Florida's insurance commissioner. There are just short of a million enrollees in the individual market in Florida, while 3.8 million are uninsured. The state does not allow new entrants into a ""high-risk pool,"" which provides coverage to the sick.

""People who are in their 50s with high blood pressure have no coverage options,"" he said.

Ohio, meanwhile, said there would be an average increase of 41% by comparing a trade association's report of premiums for all plans available today with the average premium expected on the exchange.

Indiana officials said prices would rise an average of 72%. But they were looking at the cost of providing care, not actual premiums.

All of these rate hikes must still be reviewed by the federal government and do not take into account the fact that Americans with incomes up to $45,960 for an individual and $94,200 for a family of four will be eligible for federal subsidies.

So why aren't there such big premium increases in other states? New York, for example, already required that insurers provide comprehensive coverage to all who apply. Rates there could fall by half since the pool will expand to include many younger, healthier residents under Obamacare. But New York is more the exception than the rule, experts said.

Rate hikes depend on age and gender. To give consumers a better idea of how premiums will change, CNNMoney took a look at the plans provided by one insurer: Physicians Health Plan of Northern Indiana.

Our analysis found that 21-year-old men will pay a lot more for an exchange plan, but 42-year-old women and 62-year-old men will shell out less for a silver-level plan that comes with a $2,500 deductible and a roughly $25 co-pay for office visits.

Under this scenario, a young man's monthly rate will rise to $214 on the exchange next year, up 63% from today. The woman, however, will pay $284, a drop of more than 7%, while the older man will be charged $615, a nearly 6% decrease. This is because Obamacare requires that women pay the same amount as men and does not allow insurers to charge older participants more than three times the young.

Physicians Health expects most enrollees to sign up for bronze or silver plans, which have lower monthly premiums but carry higher deductibles and co-pays, according to Jim Brunnemer, the insurer's chief financial officer. Today, its members typically buy high deductible plans.

To be sure, there are some states where premiums will fall or come in lower than expected. The Obama administration pointed to a recent Department of Health and Human Services study of 11 states with publicly available premium data that showed rates are below Congressional Budget Office projections.

""When the marketplaces open on Oct. 1, plans will have to compete side by side, and consumers will be able to choose the one that best fits their budget and needs,"" said Joanne Peters, a department spokeswoman.

While premiums may go up in other states, Obamacare advocates say people will receive more comprehensive coverage. Also, the law limits the amount people have to pay out-of-pocket for deductibles and co-pays to $6,350 in 2014.

""A lot of people will get more for their money,"" said Sarah Lueck, senior policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""Even people paying a higher rate will benefit. It will be a big change in most states."""
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/10/obama-wades-back-into-health-care-debate/,2013-05-10 00:00:00,[],Obama declares health care law 'is here to stay' as he steps up defense,"Caught between nervous Democrats and emboldened Republicans, President Obama on Friday stepped up the sales pitch on his health care overhaul as the final elements of his top domestic achievement go into effect. With his legacy and the law's success at stake, Obama said: ""The law is here to stay.""

Behind the scenes, the White House readied a campaign-style effort to get healthy young people to sign up for the insurance ""exchanges"" in order to keep premium costs from skyrocketing. On Capitol Hill, House Republicans are planning yet another vote to try to try to repeal the law.

The insurance exchanges are the centerpiece of the landmark overhaul of the nation's health insurance system and the White House mobilization is crucial to the success of the health care law and, by extension, to Obama's place in history as the first president in decades to expand health care coverage.

""There's a lot that this law is already doing for Americans with insurance,"" Obama said during a Mother's Day-themed event at the White House. ""There's a lot more that's going to happen for folks who don't have insurance.""

But he cautioned: ""We still have a lot of work to do in the coming months to make sure more Americans can buy affordable health coverage.""

And he urged the public not to be swayed by what he said were scare tactics from critics of the law who might blame it for rising premiums.

""Don't be bamboozled,"" he said.

Underscoring the policy and political consequences, the White House plans to employ both the resources of government as well as those of his reconfigured political operation as it aimed to enroll 7 million people in health insurance exchanges between Oct. 1 and the end of March. The goal is to get 30 million people to sign up within five years.

However, the composition of those signing up for the new exchanges matters just as much as the overall totals. In order to keep premium costs down, officials say they must register 2.7 million healthy people between the ages of 18 and 35 in order to counteract the costs of ensuring seniors and people with health problems.

The effort comes as the public remains divided over the health care law. As a result, the White House is planning an election-like campaign to target those uninsured or individually insured young people, an effort reminiscent of the sophisticated voter outreach that helped Obama win twice win the White House. The administration has identified where many of the healthy and uninsured young live and will be working with health clinics, hospitals, churches and other groups to sign them up for the exchanges.

Organizing for Action, an outside political group supporting Obama, will also be involved in the effort to promote the exchanges.

Administration officials say one-third of the young people they need to sign up for the exchanges live in California, Texas and Florida. Just over 50 percent are minorities and 57 percent are men.

The administration's challenge is to overcome both confusion and lack of awareness about the law. A new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation showed more than 4 in 10 Americans didn't know the Affordable Health Care Act was still law or was being implemented, and about half feel they don't have enough information about the law to know how it will affect them.

However, the officials said they expect some of those views to shift after the exchanges are fully operational, in part because many Americans will realize their health didn't change and those that are uninsured will see the benefits of the law.

Besides enrolling needed participants, the White House effort is designed to rally the public around the health care law to stave off yet another challenge from Republicans. Three years after it became law, the health care overhaul remains a target of GOP lawmakers determined to overturn it.

""Women and families don't need Obamacare's higher costs, 20,000 pages of red tape and regulations, or to be forced off plans they currently have and like, in order to get cancer screenings or other preventive care,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement ahead of Obama's remarks. ""As implementation draws closer, the president owes it to these women and all Americans to be straight about those consequences. Rather than another campaign-style event, the President has an obligation to warn all Americans about the train wreck that's headed our way."""

(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)

Adam Peterson’s life is about to change. For the first time in years, he is planning to do things he could not have imagined. He intends to have surgery to remove his gallbladder, an operation he needs to avoid another trip to the emergency room. And he’s looking forward to running a marathon in mid-January along the California coast without constant anxiety about what might happen if he gets injured.

These plans are possible, says Peterson, who turned 50 this year and co-manages a financial services firm in Champaign, Ill., because of a piece of plastic the size of a credit card that arrived in the mail the other day: a health insurance card.

Peterson is among the millions of uninsured Americans who are benefiting from the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 law that launched far-reaching changes to the U.S. health-care system and is President Obama’s premier domestic achievement.

These beneficiaries have not been oblivious to the problems of the new insurance exchanges, including a rollout so botched that Obama called it his biggest mistake of the year. Many, including Peterson, had firsthand encounters with the error-prone federal Web site, HealthCare.gov, that tested their patience and resolve. Some called help lines that couldn’t help them. Others drove long distances to meet with trained enrollment workers who couldn’t get them enrolled. Yet they persisted.

And as New Year’s Day approaches, and with it, health insurance, their frustration is trumped by gratitude. “I get these messages from acquaintances on Facebook saying, ‘Let me keep my doctor,’ ’’ Peterson said. “Well, what about those of us who didn’t have health insurance before? . . . I have been walking a tightrope and have had some twists and falls off of it. To not have to worry about this anymore is a tremendous relief.”

Getting Americans health insurance is at the heart of the health law, the most significant change in health-care policy since the 1965 creation of Medicare, the federal program for the elderly, and Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor and disabled. Such a dramatic expansion in coverage had eluded presidents, including Republican Richard Nixon and Democrat Bill Clinton, for decades.

This core mission has sometimes been obscured by the political and legal disputes that have dogged and, in important ways, altered the law. Strong research links having health insurance and being healthy. Having a health plan does not guarantee that a good doctor is within reach when a patient needs one. But insurance matters.

Dan Munstock knows this. A 62-year-old retiree in Greenville, Tenn., he hasn’t had insurance since he left his job as a crisis counselor in Miami six years ago. He lives on Social Security income of less than $15,000 a year. Although he does not know of any major ailments, he would like a checkup because, he said, “you can seem fine until the day you drop over with something.”

Like thousands of other Americans, Munstock ran into technical problems with the federal Web site before managing to pick a health plan Dec. 1. He qualified for a federal subsidy to help him afford the insurance, so he has to pay just $87.57 a month toward his premium. After his welcome packet from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee arrived in the mail, Munstock was so eager to finish the process of enrolling and getting an insurance card that he picked up the phone to pay the first premium instead of using the mail.

“It felt really good,” he said. Paying toward his own insurance, he said, gives him “a certain dignity,” a feeling that he is not “one of the takers.” The next day, he called the doctor’s office. His appointment for a physical is Jan. 2.

“I’m feeling surprisingly moved by all of this,” Munstock said. “This finally seems real. And I’m thinking that maybe all the talk and the promises and the messy politics can actually lead to something good after all.”

‘Desperate’ for insurance

Various studies have found that children without insurance are less likely to get immunized or treated for a sore throat or even a ruptured appendix. Adults without coverage are less likely to get mammograms or prostate exams. If they have high blood pressure or diabetes, it is more likely to be out of control. If they have a stroke, it is more likely to leave lasting damage. The Institute of Medicine has said there’s “a chasm” between the health needs of uninsured people and their access to effective care — a gap that “results in needless illness, suffering and even death.”

In health-care economics, it is considered rational to provide coverage, so that people can readily get small medical problems taken care of before they become big, expensive, pent-up medical problems. But the gallbladder surgery Peterson is about to have and the unforeseen ailments that Munstock’s physical on Thursday could unearth also illustrate a risk for the health plans that have been signing up new patients under the law: Unless those plans also attract new customers who are young, healthy and inexpensive to insure, the rush of people like Peterson and Munstock is going to freight the new system with costs that are too heavy. Insurance rates could go up. Plans could drop out. Will it happen? No one knows.

That is the macro view. The micro view, for people who have been waiting for insurance for years, is financial protection. Hospitals frequently charge uninsured people two to four times what health insurers and government programs pay for hospital services, according to a 2007 Health Affairs study.

In the years since Medicare and Medicaid were created, there have been smaller expansions in government health-care coverage — public insurance for children of the working class, the addition of drug benefits to Medicare.

Still, nearly 48 million Americans were uninsured as of 2012, according to the most recent official figures — 11 million more than at the turn of the century, or almost one in every six people. More than 6.5 million children are uninsured.

The law wasn’t designed to help everyone who is uninsured. But it is likely to cover a big chunk — 32 million people, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office about the time Obama signed the 2,000-page legislation into law.

How many people will take up the offer remains to be seen. The CBO has estimated that 7 million will sign up for private plans by the end of the first annual open enrollment period on March 31, while another 9 million will enroll in an expanded Medicaid program or in the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

But with insurers canceling health plans that fail to meet new benefit standards for millions of individuals, and many Americans finding it difficult this past fall to use HealthCare.gov, it will be hard to know if the ranks of the uninsured will go up or down right away, health experts say. Starting next year, the law requires that most Americans have health insurance or risk a fine.

The creators of the law envisioned that about half the people who gain insurance would enroll in private health plans, the other half in Medicaid. The Supreme Court sliced into the second goal, ruling that states could opt out of the expansion, something that has occurred in many states led by Republicans.

Maryland expanded Medicaid, which means that 55-year-old Nancy Beigel of Beltsville will be getting insurance for the first time in about a decade. With an income of $11,000 a year from her small cleaning service, she hasn’t been able to afford insurance but didn’t qualify until now for Medicaid.

An emergency appendectomy in 2009 ended up requiring two operations — the first one failed to properly remove the appendix. Beigel was left not only with $91,000 in medical debt but also a lump in her abdomen that she believes is a hernia. She hasn’t been to a doctor to get a diagnosis and, in the meantime, she avoids “really heavy lifting” because she’s worried that doing so could cause a potentially fatal complication.

Medicaid, she said, “is not exactly glamorous.” But she is glad to have coverage beginning in January. “I’m so desperate to have insurance,” she said. “For me, it’s fabulous.”

Amy Torregrossa is 27, lives in San Francisco and creates Web tools for political candidates. She has been without insurance only since July, when coverage through her boyfriend’s company ended because he changed jobs. In the months since then, Torregrossa has found that “it’s really scary to not be covered.” She has a congenital heart defect and a history of high blood pressure. She no longer runs, she said, because “if I twist my ankle or get hit by a car . . . any doctor visit is so expensive.”

When California’s insurance exchange opened Oct. 1, she was among the first to sign up, picking a $310 silver plan. She made sure her cardiologist was in the insurer’s network and plans to schedule a checkup for early next year.

As Torregrossa has been worrying about her heart, Emily Wright has been worrying about the mole on her back. The suspicious mole is on a mental list of “little things” that Wright, 28, of Johnson City, Tenn., said she wants to get checked out. Recurring joint pain in a foot and knee are also on the list. So are her frequently swollen glands.

Wright also needs surgery for endometriosis, a painful gynecological condition that has already required her to have two operations. Constant pain makes it difficult for her to work delivering pizzas and attend East Tennessee State University, where she hopes to get a history degree in May.

Enrolling through the federal exchange, she qualified for a federal subsidy and picked a top-tier plan that will cost her $125 a month. The soonest appointment she could get with an obstetrics-gynecology practice, the first step before surgery, is Jan. 17.

“I am excited. I am ready,” she said. “It feels like the light at the end of the long dark tunnel.”

‘A normal life’

For Adam Peterson, awaiting gallbladder surgery in Illinois, the dark tunnel without insurance began about six years ago, when he decided to forgo health coverage because he needed the cash to set up his financial services business. The cost of that decision hit home in March, when the emergency surgery to remove a gallstone cost him $27,000.

When he went to HealthCare.gov this fall, the online system at first balked at verifying his identity — an essential step. It took a few calls to a help line before anyone called back. But just before Thanksgiving, he managed to enroll in a top-tier plan with a monthly premium of $475.

“I do not feel that it gives me the freedom to do reckless things,” Peterson said, contemplating his insurance coverage, which begins on New Year’s Day. “More, it just allows me to live a normal life with one less worry.”"

GOP plans to hold Democrats accountable for health care promises

With midterm elections a year away%2C Democrats say GOP message won%27t resonate

Barrage provides Republicans a chance to coalesce after recent govt shutdown

Republicans are launching a new wave of attacks on congressional Democrats after President Obama pointed out that he's not the only one who promised Americans they could keep their insurance under Obamacare.

""And, by the way, I think it's very important for me to note that there are a whole bunch of folks up in Congress and others who made this statement,"" he said Thursday, adding that they shouldn't be blamed. ""It's not on them. It's on us.""

Within 48 hours, Republicans had scoured public releases, news articles and town hall transcripts to unearth pledges made by 60 Democratic House members and 27 Democratic senators, including Majority Leader Harry Reid (""If you like the health care you have, you can keep it"") and Health Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (""If you like a plan, you get to keep it"").

The GOP plans to hold them accountable for those promises, driving the message through November with the hope of gaining an edge in the midterm elections.

""The law is called Obamacare, but every House and Senate Democrat over the last four years has voted over and over again to ensure that the law would operate this way,"" Rory Cooper, communications director for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said Saturday. ""And while the president shoulders a lot of the blame, so do his Democratic counterparts in Congress.""

For their part, Democrats say the elections are still a year away and as long as the website is fixed and people have insurance they like by then, the GOP message just won't resonate.

""There's a great amount of hypocrisy here,"" Democratic National Committee spokesman Michael Czin said Saturday. ""Republicans were for a fix until the president was for a fix and now they're going right back to repeal the law, which poll after poll shows the American people want to work.""

In any case, the barrage provides Republicans with a chance to coalesce around something they all agree on — criticizing Obamacare — after being divided and taking a beating in the polls over the recent government shutdown.

In a blog post titled, ""What I meant to say was …,"" House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy cataloged statements from Democratic House members dating back to April 2009, including from DNC chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schlutz.

""Let me be clear: If you like your current plan, you'll be able to keep it,"" she said in July 2009, when opposition to reform was gathering steam in town halls across the country.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's staff, meanwhile, compiled quotes from Democratic senators.

Over at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Deputy Executive Director Matt Canter brushed aside the attacks, saying that Senate Democrats are working to fix the law while Republicans simply want to go back to the pre-Obamacare system, when insurers were allowed to refuse coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.

""While Democrats are working to make fixes to the law, every single Republican Senate candidate in the country wants to let insurance companies abuse consumers,"" he said. ""We're confident that the Republican proposals to discriminate against patients is going to be more of a political problem for them in an election."""

A North Carolina woman featured prominently in a graphic government ad campaign to get people to stop smoking died Monday of cancer.



Terrie Hall died at a hospital in Winston-Salem, N.C., federal officials said. She was 53.

""She was a public health hero,"" said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which conducted the campaign. ""She may well have saved more lives than most doctors do.""

A former smoker whose voice box was removed years ago, Hall took a leading role in the campaign that showed how smoking-related cancer ravages the body. Officials believe the ""Tips from Former Smokers"" campaign led as many as 100,000 Americans smokers to quit.

Hall's first ad showed her putting on a wig, putting in false teeth and covering a hole in her throat with a scarf. It was the campaign's most popular spot by far, receiving more than 2.8 million views on YouTube.

It was the federal public health agency's largest and starkest anti-smoking push, and its first national advertising effort.

In another ad, the Lexington resident addressed the camera in the buzzing sound of her artificial voice box. She advised smokers to make a video of themselves reading a children's book or singing a lullaby. ""I wish I had. The only voice my grandson's ever heard is this one,"" her electric voice growled.

Hall's oral and throat cancer was caused by the cigarette smoking she began in high school, CDC officials said. This summer, the cancer spread to her brain.

Confusion persisted Wednesday around the long-awaited opportunity for Americans to sign up for coverage through new health-insurance marketplaces, with the federal Web site for more than half the states remaining balky and health plans uncertain whether they had any new customers.

The federal site, Healthcare.gov, was sluggish and flashed error messages much of the day. The Obama administration said the delays were simply the result of an initial rush of people flocking to the site — 4.7 million unique visitors in the first 24 hours — while some in the health-care industry suggested that the problem was more serious.

Officials at the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services insisted that some people were able to get far enough into the site to peruse their insurance options, find out whether they qualify for financial help and ultimately enroll in a health plan. But administration officials, for a second day, declined to disclose how many people actually had enrolled and where in the country they live.

Meanwhile, interviews with health insurers, industry consultants, nonprofit groups and people trying to sign up for coverage suggested that the number was very low. Some companies that are offering plans on the federal site said Wednesday that no one had signed up with them.

“Very, very few people that we’re aware of have enrolled in the federal exchange,” said one insurance industry official, who like many in the industry, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for possibly offending the Obama administration. “We are talking single digits.”

A spokesman for one major Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in a southern state said that, as of Wednesday afternoon, it had not received word from federal health officials of any customers who had completed enrollment in the plan — even though a local news outlet had reported about a man who thought he had signed up. So, plan officials didn’t know whether the man’s enrollment was incomplete or whether the federal reporting of enrollment was running behind.

Whether the snags of the opening days — and the apparently small number of people enrolling right away — present a long-term problem is a matter of intense debate, given that consumers may sign up for the new coverage for the next six months.

Some insurers and policy specialists speculated that the small trickle of early enrollments reflects prudent decisions by consumers to shop carefully, exploring the price and coverage under the various health plans newly available to them. “I wonder if, besides the glitches, people aren’t going on to the system and being smart consumers. If they can get on, looking and comparing . . . but let’s not make a decision immediately,” said William Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former top official at the insurer Cigna.

On the other hand, others said that the early kinks, especially if they persist, could undermine consumer confidence in a law that already has sparked fevered political opposition and widespread public confusion. “Everybody will give you a few days,” said Peter Beilenson, the chief executive of Evergreen Health, an insurer that is selling policies on the Maryland exchange. “But by next week, it’s got to be up and running.”

Experiences varied in the states, plus the District, that are operating their own insurance marketplaces.

In the District, access to the online marketplace, D.C. Health Link, remained relatively smooth, although city officials declined to provide figures to show the volume of second-day interest.

Maryland consumers continued to encounter “a significant bottleneck” in creating accounts that are the first step toward shopping on the state’s exchange, according to Joshua Sharfstein, Maryland’s health secretary. He said a central impediment is that Maryland’s system requires online verification of each person’s identity.

Sharfstein said technicians are developing workarounds, such as having consumers provide identity verification to the customer call center. That has led to times when the function to create accounts is not available.

Sharfstein said the exchange has had enrollment in the “double digits.” But, he added, “We know there’s a lot of interest.” On Tuesday, more than 1,000 people showed up at local health and social service departments around the state eager to sign up.

“We’ve been trying incessantly to get online all morning and we can’t get on, we can’t log in,” Linda Cornelius, a worker at the Montgomery County nonprofit Interfaith Works, said Wednesday. She is one of more than 300 specially trained consumer guides in Maryland helping people sign up for Obamacare coverage.

Virginia is relying on the federal exchange, for which no enrollment figures were yet available.

Kentucky, running its own exchange, provided especially detailed enrollment information, saying that it had signed up 2,989 individuals or families, divided roughly evenly between Medicaid and private insurance, according to spokeswoman Gwenda Bond.

Obama administration officials running the federal Web site urged patience. For example, people logging onto the site may run into a “holding page” for a few minutes before they are able to begin their applications. They should not refresh their browsers or leave the page, as they will lose their places in line.

Many people encountering problems have taken them in stride, willing to give officials the benefit of the doubt. For others, frustration has already started creeping in.

Beltsville resident Nancy Jean Beigel, 55, was among about a dozen people selected to stand with President Obama during a brief appearance Tuesday at the White House to tout the law. But after two unsuccessful attempts at signing up for coverage, once Tuesday and once Wednesday, she gave up for the moment.

“It’s a little confusing,” said Beigel, who earns $8,000 a year running a small cleaning service and likely will qualify for free care under expanded Medicaid. “It’s not so great.”

State officials, under pressure from families like the Bruenings, said they had little choice but to take drastic action when the extent of the abuse accusations became evident.

Just call him Bo the Easter pooch.

First lady Michelle Obama took her best friend, first dog Bo Obama, on a pre-Easter visit today to military families staying at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in the Maryland suburbs of Washington.

As part of her ongoing effort to support military families, Mrs. O dropped in at the Fisher House, where families stay while their family members are being treated, and also visited some of the wounded warriors being cared for at the giant medical center.

She came bearing cookies, tickets to the 135th White House Easter Egg Roll (this year it's on April 1, April Fool's Day), and words of praise for the Fisher Houses at military medical centers around the country.

""As you all know, they are just so important to families who are recuperating,"" she said, according to the White House transcript. ""They're doing some great stuff... And all around the country, they are as beautiful and as welcoming and as comforting as you guys are experiencing here.""

Her surprise guest was Bo, the first family's 4-year-old Portuguese water dog, who, as usual, was a big hit. Still, Obama had to reassure some of the little ones nervous about big, bouncy dogs.

""Bo is a sweetheart, but he's big; he's bigger than some kids realize,"" said Mrs. O, dressed in a violent sweater set and a long, pleated skirt. ""But that's all he is, is big. He's really a big baby. He's a big baby. He can do tricks if he's paying attention.""

Bo had other ideas. ""No, no, he's staying down,"" she said to laughter. ""He can do some tricks, trust me."""

President Obama says he is mad about health care website problems

Obama says healthcare.gov has problem%2C but the law overall is working

Tech experts are being tapped to help solve the website issues

WASHINGTON — A defiant President Obama said Monday he is mad about problems with a new health care website, but argued that the Affordable Care Act as a whole is working as planned.

While Healthcare.gov ""hasn't worked as smoothly as it was supposed to work,"" Obama said during a White House speech that uninsured Americans have been able to sign up for coverage.

""The product -- the health insurance -- is good,"" Obama said. ""The prices are good. It is a good deal.""

Facing attacks from Republicans and other critics of Obamacare, the president said his health care team is reaching out to tech experts to help fix massive website problems that have hampered the rollout of his landmark piece of legislation.

""There's no excuse for the problems"" on the website, he said.

""Nobody's madder than me about the fact that the website isn't working as well as it should,"" Obama said, ""which means it's going to get fixed.""

Aside from the website, Obama said the 2010 health care law is providing consumer protections and benefits for millions of Americans, including mammograms and birth control services. He told stories of now-covered Americans who had once been denied insurance because of pre-existing conditions.

""The essence of the law, the health insurance that's available to people, is working just fine,"" Obama said.

Congressional Republicans who opposed the health care law — a key factor in this month's partial government shutdown — said the initial problems call the entire program into question.

Citing reports that few people have signed up for health care exchanges, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said that ""another campaign-style event won't solve the myriad problems facing consumers under Obamacare.""

McConnell said that ""for months, the American people have been learning about the impact Obamacare will have on individuals and families in the form of higher premiums, disrupted insurance and lost jobs -- more broken promises from the administration.""

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., a prominent critic of the health law, said the president designed his speech to ""draw the media's attention to a handful of persons who have applied for Obamacare -- while ignoring the untold number of Americans who are losing the plans they liked because of Obamacare.""

Cruz and a number of House Republicans opposed a new budget plan unless it defunded the health care law, leading to the 16-day shutdown that ended just last week. Some Republicans also objected to increasing the debt ceiling unless some provisions of the law were delayed.

In his White House speech, Obama charged Republicans are playing ""politics"" with the health care law, saying that ""they were willing to shut down the government and potentially harm the global economy to try to get it repealed.""

Obama said the website isn't the only way people can sign for health care coverage. He said call centers have expanded, and people can also apply in person at federal offices across the country.

The president twice provided the number of 24-hour call centers -- 1-800-318-2596 -- where he said people would be available to answer questions in 150 languages. He also said that volunteers in community health centers and hospitals can help people apply for coverage, and he suggested that people looking for information also could log onto a website called LocalHelp.HealthCare.gov.

In a blog post, the Department of Health and Human Services said some users of HealthCare.gov ""have had trouble creating accounts and logging in to the site, while others have received confusing error messages, or had to wait for slow page loads or forms that failed to respond in a timely fashion.""

As a result, HHS said it is ""bringing in some of the best and brightest from both inside and outside government to scrub in with the team and help improve HealthCare.gov.""

The administration did not provide specific names of experts, nor have they reported exactly how many people have signed up for new insurance exchanges.

For his speech in the Rose Garden, the president was joined by consumers, small-business owners and pharmacists who, the White House said, ""have either benefited from the health care law already or are helping consumers learn about what the law means for them and how they can get covered.""

Obama's guests also included ""individuals who have already applied for and enrolled in quality, affordable coverage through the marketplaces and those who are planning to after exploring and comparing their new health care options,"" the White House said.

On a sunny day, one of the White House guests nearly fainted during Obama's remarks.

Said the president: ""That's what happens when I talk too long."""

USATODAY

My physicians talked about three key areas. One%2C more government control of our lives.

Another was higher costs for well off to pay for the less-well off.

And the orchestrated rationing of health care.

I've been biting my tongue on the subject for months, but since President Obama has invited all kinds of people, from bartenders to radio talk-show hosts, to spread the word about Obamacare, I'd like to join the chorus.

He was speaking at a ""youth summit,"" so maybe I'm presumptuous. I don't have a radio audience and can't host a bar-room happy hour — and I will definitely sound a little off-key. But while the president, in a disingenuous attempt at ""rebranding"" Obamacare, wants people to put lipstick on a pig, I'd prefer to talk about how Americans are coming to terms with the unadorned pig.

More to the point, I'd like to ask some questions:

Why are we being flooded with stories of people expressing surprise about the costs associated with Obamacare enrollment or purchasing individual plans that conform to the law's requirements? Don't tell me it's because you believed Obama when he made all those promises about blah, blah, blah. If you believed anything he said, shame on you.

I didn't believe him because at least four years ago I started asking my doctors — primary care and specialists — what they thought Obama's vision of health care reform would lead to. (This was more helpful than asking the American Medical Association, which endorsed Obamacare.) My docs talked mostly about three issues: the orchestrated rationing of health care, much more intervention by the government in health care decisions and higher costs for people like me. A couple of them predicted a coming doctor shortage, but that seemed self-serving.

Next questions:

Am I the only person in America who ever discussed with his doctors what was coming down the road? Why the shock and awe now that it's being rolled out? Why the fury over such short-term distractions as faulty websites and extended enrollment deadlines? Those are spear carriers at the opera. The headliners here are the transforming elements of Obamacare that my doctors suggested, and which will tell you all you need to know:

More government control of our lives. This is always a bad idea, and especially when it dictates your choices on something as personal as your relationship with your doctor and other health care professionals. The fact is, when Obamacare was being debated in Congress in late 2009, polls showed that as many as 86% of Americans were satisfied with their own health care plans, even as a majority supported helping those who didn't have access to health insurance.

Redistribution of income. It's defensible in theory for the well-off to pay more to prop up the less-well-off, but it would have been cheaper, I'd bet, for taxpayers to just buy basic health care for those who have none. But that, of course, would deny Obama his goal of having the government control everyone's health care with a ridiculous list of mandates.

But that, of course, would deny Obama his goal of having the government control everyone's health care with a ridiculous list of mandates. Rationing. This is where many critics of Obamacare and I will probably part company. The truth is, rationing is inevitable under any scheme. It's also a reasonable option when it involves medical professionals and families — not the government — making decisions about end-of-life care. The further truth is that retired Baby Boomers are going to bankrupt Medicare if some form of rationing isn't employed in treating the terminally ill and the extreme elderly in the last six months or so of their lives.

If you accept these arguments, you might also agree with me that the news media could have done a better job of covering this drama. They should have been on red alert when then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi famously said in 2010 that ""we have to pass the (Obamacare) bill so you can find out what's in it."" That was an invitation to scrutinize every single word of the law and the thousands of pages of regulations it has spawned, and to seek out expert opinion on what their impact would be.

Alas, that didn't happen. Even so, there's no excuse for anyone with a doctor and an ounce of curiosity being shocked at what's unfolding before our eyes.

By mid-November, the 14 state-based marketplaces reported data showing enrollment has nearly doubled from last month, jumping to about 150,000 from 79,000, according to state and federal statistics. The nonprofit Commonwealth Fund, which has been tracking the data, called the most recent numbers “a November enrollment surge.”

The latest figures from the state-run exchanges, combined with totals on the federal exchange, bring the national number to at least 176,000. While the pace of enrollments increased this month, sign-ups are still well below early projections.

On Friday, the Obama administration announced that it is giving consumers an extra week in December to sign up for coverage that begins Jan. 1, in light of troubles with federal enrollment. Insurers worried that the change would not give them enough time to process applications.

Health policy experts said the momentum from state exchanges is encouraging.

California, which has had about 80,000 sign-ups, is now reporting about 2,000 enrollments per day. New York and Washington state reported enrollment numbers in the tens of thousands as of this week.

A total of 27,000 enrollments were reported in October for the federal marketplace in which 36 states are relying on HealthCare.gov; the number has not been updated in November.

“It’s not all doom and gloom,” Kaiser Family Foundation President Drew Altman said. “What this says is that the problems are system problems, not problems with demand or interest.”

Health policy experts have always expected that enrollment would be slower in October because coverage doesn’t begin until January. What they did not expect was the array of technical issues that would make it difficult for even the most eager shoppers to purchase coverage.

The state exchanges that have performed well “were just better equipped and ready to handle high capacity” of users, said Sara Collins, a vice president at the Commonwealth Fund, a health policy nonprofit group. They worked out some of their technical issues, testing early on in the summer, she said.

Those states have also conducted stronger outreach, aggressively targeting young people, who generally have fewer health problems and are considered critical to the success of the exchanges.

Some of the state exchanges are seeing the pace of enrollment pick up daily. California has been out in front; the state’s enrollments have grown steadily in November and now account for nearly half of all health law sign-ups. The state has had its strongest two weeks of enrollment this month.

“We’re seeing much larger numbers than we expected,” Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee told reporters this week.

Connecticut officials say they have seen about 14 percent of their expected enrollees sign up through mid-November. The state has had about 8,000 people enroll in private coverage.

And in Washington state, health law enrollment in private plans has jumped from 7,341 at the end of October to 11,742 through Nov. 14.

“We’re definitely seeing interest continuing to build,” exchange spokesman Michael Marchand said. “I fully suspect we may have half our enrollment coming in in December.”

Meanwhile, the federal government is giving consumers even more time, allowing them an extra week in December to sign up for coverage to begin Jan. 1. The previous Dec. 15 deadline has been pushed back to Dec. 23, said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency overseeing HealthCare.gov. She said that the date was changed in consultation with insurers and that the administration was confident carriers would have enough time to process applications.

But industry officials raised concerns that the shortened period would not be enough time to complete the many tasks required after someone hits “submit” on an application and before a benefit card arrives in the mail.

“It makes it more challenging to process enrollments in time for coverage to begin on January 1,” said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans.

Insurers are worried that a flood of new applications at the last minute, combined with the inaccurate enrollment data they are receiving from HealthCare.gov, will leave them scrambling to verify information and receive payment.

Health and Human Services officials also announced Friday that insurers in Florida, Texas and Ohio will launch a pilot program to allow consumers to directly enroll in coverage, bypassing HealthCare.gov. This type of enrollment was always supposed to be an option for consumers, but the online system has not worked properly.

The administration also confirmed Friday that it is pushing back next year’s open enrollment by one month, so that it begins Nov. 15 instead of Oct. 15 and ends in early January instead of December.

Republicans accused the administration of a blatantly political effort to shift the sign-up period until after the Nov. 4 election and delay bad news that might result from the next round of open enrollment.

But from a policy perspective, the deadline change also gives insurers an extra month to set rates for 2015. Insurance companies would have until May 2014, instead of April, to file their rates. With the current open enrollment ending March 31, insurers have long complained that it would be difficult to know, for example, how sick a particular group of people are and how to factor in that information in setting premium rates for the following year.

Also Friday, Jeffrey Zients, who was appointed by Obama in October to fix HealthCare.gov’s problems, said he was “very confident” that the federal site would be able to handle 50,000 simultaneous users by the end of this month. “The site was originally intended to handle this load, and improvements will bring it up to this level,” Zients said. “We will have the capacity that was intended.”"

The governor released a press release yesterday indicating he has privacy concerns surrounding the Obama Administrations use of taxpayer-funded organizers called 'Navigators' to sign up Floridians on federal health exchanges. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

State leaders in Florida ""should hang their heads in shame,"" according to a scathing missive from the New York Times' editorial board.

That's because Florida has the second-highest number of residents without health insurance, according to new census data, yet the Republican-controlled government remains opposed to expanding Medicaid coverage to the poor under the Affordable Care Act.

Only Texas beats the uninsured population of the Sunshine State, where 24.8 percent of residents under 65 were uninsured in 2011, the most recent year figures were available from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Associated Press reports.

Of those 3.8 million uninsured Floridians, more than 500,000 are younger than 19, according to the Miami Herald.

Despite the alarming rates, Florida has moved to thwart the expansion of Medicaid, a key component of the ACA. The state refused to enlarge the program using federal funds and also declined to set up a state-run exchange. While Governor Rick Scott (R) led an unsuccessful push to overturn the ACA in court, Florida's House republicans turned their backs on the Senate's bipartisan expansion plan, choosing to use $300 million in state funds to purchase coverage for 130,000 Floridians instead of federal grants that would cover an estimated 1.1 million residents.

By insisting on an alternative to the ACA, Florida turned away an estimated total of $50 billion in federal funding spread over the next decade to a number of crucial programs -- including a federally funded, voluntary home visitation program proven to prevent child abuse, infant drug dependency, and unemployment.

State Rep. Matt Hudson (R-Naples), then chair of the state's Health Care Appropriations Subcommittee, told the Times in 2011 that the state was not required to accept federal grants.

“I do not believe that act is the right thing for the country or the right thing for Florida,” he said, ""and I am not going to start implementing things that I don’t believe in.""

Florida voters rejected a symbolic amendment against the ACA last fall -- and Scott eventually endorsed expansion -- but the legislature didn't stop there. Scott and others approved a law last month requiring a disclosure form that will tell policyholders how the Affordable Care Act will impact their premiums. An ""incredible waste of money,"" Florida Consumer Action Network's Bill Newton called the move, while others criticized the state for knowingly using inaccurate numbers to describe the cost of expansion.

Scott even raised privacy concerns over data that will collected by ""navigators"" hired to help low-income Floridians negotiate the new national insurance exchanges.

""In states like Florida that seem determined to sabotage reform,"" wrote the Times editorial board, ""the uninsured may have a very hard time getting the coverage they need and deserve."""
http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/business/24menu.html,2010-03-24 00:00:00,['Stephanie Rosenbloom'],Health Law Requires Chains to Post Calorie Counts,"Buried deep in the health care legislation that President Obama signed on Tuesday is a new requirement that will affect any American who walks into a McDonald’s, Starbucks or Burger King. Every big restaurant chain in the nation will now be required to put calorie information on their menus and drive-through signs.

In other words, as soon as 2011 it will be impossible to chomp down on a Big Mac without knowing that it contains over 500 calories, more than a quarter of the Agriculture Department’s 2,000-calorie daily guideline.

The legislation also requires labels on food items in vending machines, meaning that anybody tempted by a king-size Snickers bar will know up front that it packs 440 calories.

The measure is intended to create a national policy modeled on a requirement that has already taken effect in New York City and was to go into effect in 2011 in places like California and Oregon. The new federal law requires restaurant chains with 20 or more outlets to disclose calorie counts on their food items and supply information on how many calories a healthy person should eat in a day."

Ted Cruz vowed Sunday he would seek to stop legislation to keep the government running unless President Obama agrees to defund the nation’s new healthcare law.

The potential presidential contender from Texas has taken the lead in the Senate in a politically risky effort that has sparked divisions within the GOP. Although conservative and tea party groups have rallied to his cause, Cruz acknowledged Sunday he did not yet have enough GOP senators willing to launch a filibuster that could shut down the government. But he’s working on it.

“I believe we should stand our ground,” Cruz said on “Fox News Sunday.” “This has been a fast-moving target. You know, just a few weeks ago we didn’t have anywhere near the votes we needed in the House or in the Senate,” he said. “It’s now our turn to unify, to stand together with House Republicans.”

House Republicans have made stopping the Affordable Care Act their top priority before the healthcare law’s new online marketplaces open for business Oct. 1, the start of the new federal fiscal year.

Late last week, the House GOP approved legislation that would defund the healthcare law as part of a bill to keep the government running past Sept. 30.

Senate Republicans now find themselves in a bind. Because Democrats have the majority in the upper chamber, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is expected to easily have the 51 votes needed to strip the healthcare provision from the bill, keeping Obama’s signature domestic achievement intact.

Cruz is pushing his fellow GOP senators not to let the bill advance to that stage. In a move that has drawn criticism from within his party, Cruz argued that Republicans’ only hope is to mount a filibuster to stop the entire bill, refusing to give their support to cross the required 60-vote threshold to proceed to the legislation.

That creates a complicated procedural argument, as was seen over the weekend as the conservative Heritage Action supported the bill in the House but on Saturday urged senators to block it. When the debate starts this week the Senate will have just a few days to act before government funding for routine services, including keeping national parks open and providing pay for soldiers, would run out by Oct. 1.

“This fix won’t solve every problem for every person,” Obama said, saying he would consider legislative action to go further. But he appeared to rule out the sort of legislation that House Republicans are pushing, which would allow insurance companies to continue selling new policies, indefinitely, that would not comply with the law’s new consumer standards.

“I will not accept” legislation that would “drag us back to a broken system,” Obama said.

The move comes amid rising outrage over the cancellation notices, which insurers have sent out to customers nationwide who do not have health plans through an employer. Many of these plans do not comply with the Affordable Care Act, which was supposed to require health plans sold next year to offer consumers a new basic set of benefits.

Obama conceded that the problems with the rollout of Obamacare have hurt his standing with Americans, saying he has to “win back some credibility” on the issue.

“We fumbled the rollout on this healthcare law,” he said.

But he said that he was unaware that the federal online marketplace -- healthcare.gov -- was riddled with technological flaws before it went live on Oct. 1. “I was not informed directly that the website was not working the way it was supposed to,” he said.

The president said the website would be working better by Nov. 30, the administration’s self-imposed deadline to fix it, but added, “It is not possible for me to guarantee that 100% of the people 100% of the time will have a perfectly seamless and smooth experience.”

Obama said he understood why consumers who received cancellation notices from insurers were upset. “It’s scary,” he said. But he also noted that the existing market for individual insurance was flawed. “If you received one of the letters, I encourage you to take a look at the marketplace,” he said.

The president also took a far more sober tone than he had in the past about the difficulties involved in buying insurance. “Buying health insurance is never going to be like buying a song on iTunes,” he said, noting the complexities of comparing insurance plans. In the months preceding the rollout of the new law, Obama repeatedly compared the process to using websites such as Amazon or Kayak.

White House officials said Thursday that new plans sold next year would still have to offer the new benefits, which include hospitalizations, mental health services and maternity coverage.

But the officials said insurers would be free to offer their customers the option to remain on their current plans rather than switching to the new plans, which in some cases are more expensive.

If insurers offer this option, however, they would be required to notify consumers which benefits their current plans are missing. Insurers would also have to alert their customers that other options might be avaliable on the new marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act.

It is unclear how many insurers would opt to extend current plans. Industry officials have said that doing that would be burdensome.

The White House move, which officials characterized as a “transition,” would not allow health insurers to sell current plans to new customers next year. House Republicans have been pushing for this, which most health experts believe would effectively destroy the new marketplaces created by the health law.

The proposal from Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) would allow health insurers to continue offering health plans next year that do not include new consumer protections and basic benefits required by the health law.

Most people who have these plans now are very healthy, because insurers have been able to deny coverage to consumers who are sick or have been ill in the past. That means that only sicker consumers, who have not been able to get coverage in the past, would likely select health plans offered on the marketplaces created by the health law.

Insurance premiums in turn would spike, making coverage increasingly unaffordable for the sickest people, while healthy people would be able to hold onto their existing health plans.

The president was under intense pressure from Democrats on Capitol Hill to find a fix. Democratic unity crumbled as lawmakers were pounded by their constituents over the rocky rollout of Obamacare, especially as many of them begin tough re-election battles.

House Democrats have increasingly threatened to support a Republican plan due for a vote Friday that would allow insurers to continue to offer plans that don’t meet new standards in the healthcare law. Democratic senators have offered their own legislation.

One day after House Democrats aired their grievances to White House staff behind closed doors, administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, will return to Capitol Hill to brief both House and Senate Democrats on the president’s plan.

Meanwhile, Republicans, whose earlier efforts to undercut the law failed to advance in the Senate, are again aggressively pressing the issue. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said the administration’s proposed fix won’t work. “I’m highly skeptical they can do this administratively,” he said. “The only way to fully protect the American people is to scrap this plan once and for all.”

Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) praised the president for “coming forward with a fix.” She said the vote on Upton’s bill would be the 46th attempt by the Republican leadership “repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act and to put insurance companies back in charge of America’s healthcare.”

“This Republican initiative would undermine healthcare reform laws by causing premiums in the marketplace to spike,” she said.

The president’s announcement got a cool reception from the insurance industry.“Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,” said Karen Ignagni, head of America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry’s Washington-based lobbying arm. “Premiums have already been set for next year based on an assumption of when consumers will be transitioning to the new marketplace .… Additional steps must be taken to stabilize the marketplace.”

And the site's not expected to be perfect by the end of November, the top Obama administration technology officer said.

The Obama administration was expected to release long-awaited figures later on Wednesday showing just how many people managed to sign up in October.

""I believe that CMS (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) will have an announcement later today,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told a briefing.

""The functionality and shortcomings of Healthcare.gov are the result of bad management decisions made by policy officials within the Administration; they did this to themselves,"" said Karen Evans, former administrator for information technology at the Office of Management and Budget.

""And if they are now surprised, it is because their own policy officials failed to inform them of the decisions they had made and the consequences associated with those decisions,"" Evans said in written testimony prepared for the committee. Evans is now a consultant for KE&T Partners, LLC.

""I am going to give it a grade. This was an F,"" committee chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican, told the federal technology officers called in for the hearing. ""Every one of you should have been close enough to know something was wrong.""

The administration has agreed over and over that the site is unacceptably flawed. Asked whether it would be working as promised on November 30, White House Chief Technology Officer Todd Park said not to expect a flawless performance. ""The goal that has been laid out is not for the site to be perfect by Nov. 30,"" Park told the committee. It should, however, work smoothly for the ""vast majority"" of users.

""That's the goal and we are working very hard to get there,"" Park said. He said the site can now handle 20,000 to 25,000 users at any one time.

The committee grilled top government technology officers but also posted testimony critical of the government.

Richard Spires, former chief information officer at the Department of Homeland Security, called the troubled rollout an embarrassment. ""The troubled launch of HealthCare.gov pains me – as someone who has great passion for wanting to make government IT more effective, this public spectacle once again casts federal IT in a very negative light,"" said Spires, who left the federal government in July and who is now a private consultant.



""As a federal IT community we appear unempowered, and worse, incompetent,"" Spires said in testimony prepared for the hearing.

After a tussle with the White House over whether he had time to come, the committee subpoenaed Park. ""I recognize that Mr. Park is busy trying to get this site operational. But it is time for Congress to look over shoulder of admin to ask what went wrong,"" Issa said at the hearing.



But Steve VanRoekel, a former Microsoft executive who is chief information officer at the Office of Management and Budget, noted that even private companies struggle to get technology right.

""Microsoft is still patching Windows XP, 12 years after I helped launch it in 2001 – continuous improvement is the nature of these efforts,"" VanRoekel said.

""As you can imagine, connecting multiple, legacy IT systems across multiple agencies of the Federal Government is a complex task, however, this in no way excuses the problems encountered in launching HealthCare.gov. We are taking this unacceptable situation seriously and working hard to correct course.""

Henry Chao, deputy chief information officer at CMS, which runs the site; Health and Human Services deputy assistant secretary Frank Baitman; and David Powner of the Government Accountability Office, were all testifying.

The Obama administration also pushed back on Wednesday against a report in the Washington Post quoting an unnamed official as saying the website is unlikely to be working smoothly for “the vast majority of users” by the end of November, as promised by the Health and Human Services Department.



“The insurance exchange is balking when more than 20,000 to 30,000 people attempt to use it at the same time - about half its intended capacity, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose internal information,” the Post reported.

""The challenges we are addressing today are a snapshot of November 12, not November 30,” HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement. “We are making progress, including fixes to reduce error rates and get the site moving faster.""



People who don't have health insurance have until March 31 to enroll.

HHS has started sending out emails to invite 275,000 people who failed to enroll at the new health insurance website to try again.



The HealthCare.gov website is now working well enough so that people who started to create accounts and then gave up should be able to finish, says CMS spokesperson Julie Bataille.



“While working to improve our system, we have been conducting an analysis to identify people who tried and failed to create accounts,” Bataille told reporters in a telephone briefing Tuesday. “We have been messaging them to let them know they can now try again.”



HealthCare.gov, the centerpiece of health reform efforts under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, fell apart as soon as it went live on Oct. 1. It was supposed to be a seamless, online system to allow people to comparison shop for health insurance policies, contrasting prices, and checking right away to see if they qualified for a generous federal government subsidy to buy a plan.

It has to take in details of a person’s income and employment, connect with state insurance regulators and various insurance companies, as well as the Internal Revenue Service to check income, the Department of Homeland Security to check for legal residency, and various other government departments.



Several different approved government contractors put together parts of the system and when it went online, the parts didn’t work together. The result: Hardly anyone managed to sign up, critics said “I told you so” and Congress launched several investigations.



President Barack Obama has promised to fix it and appointed his new chief economic adviser, a management expert named Jeff Zients, to lead the repair effort.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/27/Cns-open-revolt-house,2013-09-27 00:00:00,['Breitbart News'],CNS News: House Members in Open Revolt,"CNS News is reporting that a group of 21 House members have sent a letter to all GOP Senators, warning them against a cloture vote on the Continuing Resolution. A vote on cloture would give Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) the ability to remove the defunding Obamacare provision included in the CR. The House conservatives who signed the letter stated that they consider a cloture vote the same as a vote in support of Obamacare.

“it is highly likely that Majority Leader Harry Reid will move to amend the House-passed CR and remove the language from the bill that defunds Obamacare before sending it back to the House. “As you are also aware,” the conservatives wrote, “such a motion can only proceed if three-fifths of the Senate invokes cloture and allows this amendment process to begin. Simply put, the only chance that Senator Reid has to pursue this course of action is if six or more Republican Senators join the Democrats in voting to invoke cloture. “Therefore,” the House conservatives said to every Republican senator, “it shall be our policy to regard any cloture vote that gives Senator Reid a green light to reinstate Obamacare into this CR the same as a vote for Obamacare itself.”

The cloture vote will come today and requires 60 votes. It will allow debate to end on the Continuing Resolution and proceed to toward a final vote. Reid controls 54 votes, while the GOP has 46 so should the Senate GOP stand together the cloture vote would be stalled. According to Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-OK), who authored the letter, “until Harry Reid guarantees a 60-vote threshold on any amendment including his amendment to add back Obamacare” the Senate GOP should vote against cloture. Otherwise a simple majority of the Senate could vote to continue Obamacare funding.

It is unlikely Reid would use the Senate rule requiring 60 votes on amendments to the CR.

Signers of the letter include: Dave Schweikert (R.-AZ), Charles Boustany, M.D. (R.-LA ), John Culberson (R.-TX ), Steve King (R.-IA), Ted Yoho DVM (R.-FL ), Thomas Massie (R.-KY), Lynn Westmoreland (R.- GA), Jack Kingston (R.-GA), Jeff Duncan (R.-SC), Paul Broun M.D. (R.-GA ), Ron DeSantis (R.-FL), Michele Bachmann (R.-MN), Matt Salmon (R.-AZ), Steve Stockman (R.-TX), Louie Gohmert (R.-TX), Walter Jones (R.-NC), Scott Garrett (R.-NJ), Scott Perry (R.-PA), Mark Meadows (R.-NC), Tim Huelskamp (R.-KS).

Peters']",U.S. Shutdown Nears as House Votes to Delay Health Law,"WASHINGTON — The federal government on Sunday morning barreled toward its first shutdown in 17 years after the Republican-run House, choosing a hard line, voted to attach a one-year delay of President Obama’s health care law and a repeal of a tax to pay for it to legislation to keep the government running.

The votes, just past midnight, followed an often-angry debate, with members shouting one another down on the House floor. Democrats insisted that Republicans refused to accept their losses in 2012, were putting contempt for the president over the good of the country and would bear responsibility for a shutdown. Republicans said they had the public on their side and were acting to protect Americans from a harmful and unpopular law that had already proved a failure.

The House first voted 248-174 to repeal a tax on medical devices, then voted 231-192 to delay the law’s implementation by a year — just days before the uninsured begin enrolling in the law’s insurance exchanges. The delay included a provision favored by social conservatives that would allow employers and health care providers to opt out of mandatory contraception coverage.

But before the House had even voted, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, declared the House bill dead. Senate Democrats are planning to table the Republican measures when they convene on Monday, leaving the House just hours to pass a stand-alone spending bill free of any measures that undermine the health care law."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-no-excuse-health-care-signup-problems-155553975--politics.html,,[],Obama: 'No excuse' for health care signup problems,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama on Monday offered ""no excuses"" — and little explanation — for the computer bugs still frustrating Americans who are trying to enroll online for insurance plans at the center of his health care law. But software developers tasked with building the site said they saw signs a year ago that the debut could fail.

One source of the troubles appears to be the testing procedures employed before the rollout three weeks ago. Several developers of the HealthCare.gov website told The Associated Press they were worried for months about the system's readiness and whether the software meant to link key computer systems was being properly put through its paces.

In addition, congressional investigators raised concerns recently that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had taken on the job of testing the computer systems for the new markets during the final weeks before the sign-ups opened Oct. 1. That job is often handled by specialized software companies.

Obama, who emphasized the website's simplicity in the week's leading up to the insurance sign-ups, acknowledged there could now be ""no sugarcoating"" the problems even as he talked up the benefits of the law at a Rose Garden event that had the feel of a pep rally.

""The website that's supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance is not working the way it should for everybody,"" he said.

He insisted that the problems would be fixed and all Americans seeking insurance would be able to sign up. But it was not clear how quickly that would happen. The administration is beefing up call centers and encouraging more people to enroll over the phone while the website problems persist.

The flood of computer problems since the website went online has been deeply embarrassing for the White House. The glitches have called into question whether the administration is capable of implementing the complex policy and why senior White House officials — including the president — appear to have been unaware of the scope of the problems when the health insurance markets, known as exchanges, opened.

Story continues

Obama stopped short of apologizing for the failures, saying instead that ""nobody is more frustrated than me.""

Even as he spoke, more problems came to light. The administration acknowledged that a planned upgrade to the website had been postponed indefinitely and that online Spanish-language signups would remain unavailable, despite a promise to Hispanic groups that the capability would start this week.

The White House says additional technology experts from both inside and outside the government are being brought in to work on the failures.

Administration officials initially blamed heavy website traffic for the frozen computer screens that many people encountered when they first logged on. Since then, they have also acknowledged shortcomings with software and some elements of the system's design, although the administration has yet to fully detail exactly what went wrong with the online system and who was responsible for the problems.

It appears the problems were well-known to some of those designing the system. One developer said that in the weeks leading up to the Oct. 1 launch, he and his colleagues huddled in conference rooms trying to patch deficiencies in computer code.

""It was an extremely tight deadline,"" said the developer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was told not to talk to the news media about his work.

A review of internal structural diagrams obtained by the AP also revealed the complexity of the system. Insurance applicants have a host of personal information verified, including income and immigration status. The system does that by connecting to other federal computer networks, including ones at the Social Security Administration, IRS, Veterans Administration, Office of Personnel Management and the Peace Corps.

The schematics from late 2012 show how officials preferred a ""data services hub"" — a traffic cop of sorts for managing information — instead of a setup that would have allowed state exchanges to connect directly to government servers when verifying an applicant's information.

On Sunday, the Department of Health and Human Services said the data hub was working, but the initial consumer experience had not lived up to the public's expectations. ""We are committed to doing better.""

Administration officials have so far refused to say how many people have actually managed to enroll in insurance during the three weeks since the new marketplaces became available. Without enrollment numbers, it's impossible to know whether the program is on track to reach the projections from the Congressional Budget Office, which estimated 7 million people would gain coverage during the first year the exchanges were available.

Officials have instead pointed selectively to figures putting the insurance exchanges in a positive light. They say more than 19 million people have logged on to the federal website and nearly 500,000 have filled out applications for insurance through both the federal and state-run sites. The applications must be completed before people can enroll in insurance policies.

An internal memo obtained by the AP showed that the administration had projected nearly a half million people would actually enroll for the insurance markets during the first month.

Uninsured Americans have until about mid-February to sign up for coverage if they are to meet the law's requirement that they be insured by the end of March. If they don't, they will face a penalty.

Officials say that at this point they are not considering extending the enrollment window beyond that time. They also say they are not considering taking the website down for an extended time to address the problems, but instead will do that maintenance during low-traffic overnight hours.

But the White House appeared to open the door to not penalizing those whose efforts to sign up were confounded by the system's problems.

""The law is clear that if you do not have access to affordable health insurance, then you will not be asked to pay a penalty because you haven't purchased affordable health insurance,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said.

So far, no one within the administration is known to have been fired for the problematic rollout. Some Republicans have focused their ire on Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, though the White House says she continues to have the confidence of the president.

Sebelius is scheduled to testify about the botched rollout before the House Energy and Commerce Committee next week. Representatives from some of the contractors working on the websites were also scheduled to testify before the committee on Thursday.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/us/allure-of-self-insurance-draws-concern-over-costs.html,2013-02-18 00:00:00,['Robert Pear'],Allure of Self-Insurance Draws Concern Over Costs,"WASHINGTON — Federal and state officials and consumer advocates have grown worried that companies with relatively young, healthy employees may opt out of the regular health insurance market to avoid the minimum coverage standards in President Obama’s sweeping law, a move that could drive up costs for workers at other companies.

Companies can avoid many standards in the new law by insuring their own employees, rather than signing up with commercial insurers, because Congress did not want to disrupt self-insurance arrangements that were seen as working well for many large employers.

“The new health care law created powerful incentives for smaller employers to self-insure,” said Deborah J. Chollet, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research who has been studying the insurance industry for more than 25 years. “This trend could destabilize small-group insurance markets and erode protections provided by the Affordable Care Act.”

It is not clear how many companies have already self-insured in response to the law or are planning to do so. Federal and state officials do not keep comprehensive statistics on the practice."

Born In San Francisco', 'He S A Graduate Of Stanford University.']",The unsettled healthcare law,"Ever since Obamacare’s stormy passage in early 2010, Democrats have been waiting anxiously for the program to go into effect and hoping that a dose of reality would calm the partisan battles over the health insurance plan. Once everything was up and running, they hoped, skeptical Americans would see that Obamacare was a good idea all along — and reward the party that brought it to them.

FOR THE RECORD:

A previous version of this article incorrectly said Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2011. The bill was passed in 2010.

That’s looking unlikely, at least in the short run. Last week’s glitch-filled rollout of Obamacare’s health exchange websites, combined with Republicans’ furious refusal to accept the program as what President Obama calls “settled law,” confirmed something political strategists in both parties had already predicted: The war over Obamacare is far from over.

“It’s unlikely that the Affordable Care Act will be widely popular until people have real experience with it — until it becomes the new normal,” a leading Democratic strategist told me. “We’re talking about years, not weeks or months.”

Nobody expected the launch of a fleet of balky websites to make an immediate difference to perceptions of the health insurance plan, not even with endorsements from icons like Lady Gaga, who managed to get the main website address wrong in her promotional tweet.

Still, the opening-day problems and the slow pace of applications for health insurance were not encouraging signs.

More important, in the long run, was the Republican Party’s reaffirmation — spurred by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other tea party legislators — that repealing, defunding or dismantling the program remains one of its top goals.

The tea party caucus has succeeded in making resistance to Obamacare a litmus test for Republicans, and as a result, it’s likely that next year’s congressional election will be fought in large part over the health insurance program. The fate of Obamacare may hang in the balance.

“The 2014 election will be the Gettysburg of this struggle — the deciding battle, one way or the other,” predicted Robert J. Blendon of Harvard’s School of Public Health.

In the current Congress, the Senate’s Democratic majority has stopped the Republican-led House of Representatives from defunding or delaying Obamacare’s implementation. But if Republicans take control of the Senate next year — a prospect currently rated as a tossup — only Obama’s veto will stand in their way.

And even by election day in 2016, Obamacare may still be a work in progress.

“If you give it three, four, five years, every experience we have is that public support will be there,” Blendon said. “But you have to give it that much time.” Meanwhile, Republicans will have every incentive to attack the program’s shortcomings.

“The real problem here is not managerial; many programs take years to roll out,” he said. “The real issue is political. Programs don’t do well if one party doesn’t support it and public opinion isn’t for it.”

As for Obamacare, public opinion has settled into skepticism. A Fox News poll released last week, after the websites’ rollout, found that 54% of voters favor repealing all or part of the law, while 41% want to preserve or expand it — not much different from earlier findings.

The poll found that only 30% of voters want to repeal the entire law — but among Republicans, that number swells to 53%, and among tea party supporters, 71%. That helps explain GOP legislators’ opposition.

What could change public attitudes? “There could be movement either way, depending on whether people think the program turns out better or worse than they expected,” Blendon said. If more employers drop retirees and spouses from insurance coverage because Obamacare is available, for example, “you could see a huge backlash,” he said.

Republicans may have a built-in advantage in that debate: They can blame any bad news about healthcare on Obamacare, whether the program is at fault or not.

“If rates are going up, Republicans will say that’s because of Obamacare, even though it’s not true,” said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. “If companies are cutting back, Republicans will say that’s because of Obamacare.”

But it will also matter what remedy Republicans propose. In last week’s Fox News poll, most voters said they opposed defunding Obamacare — although two-thirds of GOP voters said they supported the idea.

A one-year delay in implementing Obamacare, on the other hand, is a broadly popular idea, supported by 57% of all voters, including 80% of Republicans.

So don’t expect the war over Obamacare to be over any time soon. Instead, expect Republicans of every stripe to continue their guerrilla campaign against the program through the 2014 congressional election, and perhaps the 2016 presidential election as well.

Expect more furious, partisan debate over every step of implementation, with dueling experts from each side.

Expect smart Republicans to focus on demands to delay or cancel the penalties on individuals for failing to sign up, the law’s least popular provision. That might sound like a minor change, but it could undermine the program fatally.

The president will continue to insist that Obamacare is “settled law.” But a law is only fully settled once both parties accept its permanence, and Obamacare is a long way from there.

What they are getting in the mail isn’t what they ordered.

Those responsible for saddling the country with this law, including the law’s chief salesman, President Obama, are scrambling to dodge the hammer of growing public resentment over the bill of goods that they have sold the American people. They are coming up with “fixes”, but I caution the buyer, beware.

The president, along with members of his party who are facing elections soon, are busy campaigning for proposals they say do what these architects of the law promised in the first place. But folks should think carefully about relying on the same people who repeatedly promised one thing and delivered something far different. Consumers who liked their health care plans are being forced to give them up. People who were told they would pay less for health care will be paying more. Even fans of Obamacare are upset with an archaic, ready-fire-aim website that took years and millions of dollars to develop, but, to put it mildly, is failing miserably. Will Americans again put their faith in the leaders who said the law had to be passed before it was understood? They shouldn’t.

In 2010 on the Senate floor, I warned that rules published in the Federal Register would guarantee that people who liked their health care would lose it. I warned that health care costs would go up. I warned that employers would be forced to cut back worker hours and jobs. I did more than warn this would happen, I offered senators a chance to prevent these calamities. Proponents of Obamacare rejected and ridiculed my legislation.

These same folks now, fighting for their political lives, are offering patches for their program and excuses for why it isn’t working. However, these folks are the same people who created the problems in the first place. They simply don’t want you to be able to choose the health insurance you want unless it’s health insurance they think you should have. They never did. Their plan was and is for policy makers in Washington to make what the experts believe are the best choices for you.

The Washington Post reported recently that the president said his administration could not in good faith allow people with inferior insurance plans to keep them. That’s not what he said dozens of times before the law passed and it doesn’t sound like a person ready to fix a problem. This isn’t about a fumbled roll-out or a computer glitch. This law’s problems are inherent within it. The way to get our country out of this bad situation is with the earnest help of people who recognize the benefit of individuals being able to make their own choices.

I’m a cosponsor of Senator Ron Johnson’s (R-Wis.) “If You Like Your Health Plan, You Can Keep it Act”. The House passed a bill that would allow insurers to continue offering policies that don’t meet the expensive Obamacare mandates. So far we haven’t received much positive feedback from the president or majority in the Senate. Instead, the president announced another exception to a law that is already riddled with them, while the Senate majority proposes more federal mandates to “fix” the mandates they already have imposed on America. But as the Wall Street Journal has pointed out, there is a real difference between letting people keep their plans by unshackling them from federal rules and working with state frameworks versus forcing insurers to comply with more new requirements.

My dad used to say that if you keep on doing what you’ve been doing you are going to end up with what you’ve got. I’ve heard the Senate majority leader say the definition of insanity is continuing to do the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Unless people demand a new approach to health care — bona-fide inclusion of ideas from those who want a new approach — then we’re going to end up with what we have now: broken promises. We can do better."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/25/California-s-November-surge-Not-Enough-to-Overcome-the-October-Purge,2013-11-25 00:00:00,['John Sexton'],California's 'November Surge' Not Enough to Overcome the October Purge,"Health care wonks are crowing about a “November surge” in enrollment. Will the November surge will be able to make up for the October purge, i.e. the millions who were dropped from existing plans because of Obamacare’s new minimum standards for coverage? In California, there is reason to think it may not.

In a piece posted at Wonkblog Friday, author Sarah Kliff introduced the term “November surge” into the discussion of enrollment figures. According to Kliff, the uptick in enrollment, especially in California, is reason for optimism:

Some state-based marketplaces had a pretty smooth launch, and are seeing the pace of enrollment speed up daily. California has lead [led] the bunch; the state’s enrollments have grownsteadily in November and now account for nearly a full third of allhealth law sign-ups. The state has had its strongest two weeks ofenrollment this month.

The enrollment surge in California, and the idea that it was part of a broader pattern, was first reported by LA Times health writer Noam Levey a week ago. Levey’s piece was widely quoted, including by Sarah Kliff, but his claims did not stand up to much scrutiny. For instance, Levey claimed that Kentucky was “outpacing” its enrollment estimates. A spokesperson for the state says no such estimates exist.

Both Levey and Kliff fail to ask the most important question. How soon will current enrollment trends balance out the number of people who have been dropped from their insurance as a result of Obamacare grandfathering regulations? In other words, can a November surge make up for the October purge?

Health insurance expert Bob Laszewski suggests California has a long way to go before the net enrollment shows a gain. He lays out the figures in a post published Monday:

California has 5.3 million uninsured eligible to buy in the exchange with half estimated to be subsidy eligible.

California is cancelling another 1.1 million people of which Covered California has estimated 510,000 qualify for a subsidy they can only get if they go to Covered California. At least 80% need to act by December 23 to avoid losing their coverage.

The state is spending $250 million in federal money to get people signed up–dramatically more than any other state.

The Covered California goal is to sign-up 500,000 to 700,000 subsidy eligible people by March 31.

Laszewski concludes “Looking at these numbers, if they don’t have well more than 500,000people signed up by December 31, I would have to think the number ofuninsured in California would have grown.”

Any fair accounting of the enrollment figures needs to keep in mind the number of people who–contrary to the President’s oft-repeated promise–have been kicked off plans they had. In California the enrollment figures for November have improved but they are still a long way from bringing the state back to where it was before the cancellation notices went out."

But this begs some big questions: Can he pull it off? And, what does it mean for you?

Here’s what you need to know about the roll-back of private insurance cancellations and the new state of Obamacare:

First off, can President Obama really do this?

It seems he can. It’s not that he’s changed anything in the law. It’s more a case of saying his government won’t enforce it, kind of like what his administration did when it gave employers an extra year to provide health insurance for workers last July.

What Obama's decision does do is kick the cancellation decision back to state insurance commissioners and the insurance companies themselves. “It was a blame-shifting exercise,” says Dr. Scott Gottleib, a health policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute.



Can I get my policy back if it was canceled?

That’s complicated. It’s not so easy for an insurance company to reinstate policies it was planning to discontinue, because the firm must plan premiums and budget for expenses far in advance. Florida Blue said it would reinstate canceled plans, and Florida’s insurance commissioner, Kevin McCarty, said he’s working with any companies that wanted to go that route. A lot is up to state insurance commissioners — something that gives cover to both the White House and to the insurance companies.

Obama said most people won’t want to, anyway, and he urged anyone who’s had an individual policy canceled to look at what’s available at HealthCare.gov before looking to reinstate the old policy.

What if everyone who got canceled decides to ask for their old policies back? Will this mess everything up?

Insurers and actuaries — the people who calculate insurance risk — think it could. “The NAIC (National Association of Insurance Commissioners) has been clear from the beginning that allowing insurers to have different rules for different policies would be detrimental to the overall market and result in higher premiums,” says Louisiana's insurance commissioner, Jim Donelon, president of the NAIC.

“This decision continues different rules for different policies and threatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond.”

And the American Academy of Actuaries said in a letter sent to Congress that the decision could mess up what are called risk pools — basically, the idea that you need healthy people in any group of insurance policies to pay premiums and offset the costs of sick people.

They said people who have lower medical costs would want to stay in bare-bones plans that are being canceled by insurance companies, because they have lower premiums than the new plans that are required to cover more.



But Gottlieb says this isn’t necessarily true. He thinks some sick people who use a lot of different providers and therefore want to be able to choose from extensive networks of doctors will be the ones most likely to want to keep their old plans. “The Obamacare plans, they constrain the network,” he says. “Most Americans are willing to give up benefits for a wider network.”

If there's a mix of sick and well people choosing to reinstate plans, the effects might be negligible.

Will my premiums go up?

Not this year for policies already issued. Rates have already been set for 2014. They could go up in 2015.

So will this decision mess up the whole Affordable Care Act?

Almost certainly not.



Ceci Connolly, managing director of PwC's Health Research Institute, says it’s all very confusing but notes that Obama’s decision really doesn’t affect a large majority of Americans. “We are talking about a small universe of people,” she says. Only about 11 million people have policies on the individual market, she says, adding: “They typically turn over. They are not the same 11 million from year to year.""

It does mean there will be a few unpleasant weeks for the health-care industry and for government. “Between now and December 15, an awful lot has to happen,“ she says. “Not only fixing a website but now many more people trying to decipher complicated decisions and insurance companies having to make a decision that is going to impact their business in a very short period of time. I don’t know that it’s going to be a very happy Thanksgiving for people working on health care.”

Oh, yeah, what about that website? Am I ever going to be able to get on?

Remember, if you already have insurance — and 85 percent of Americans do — you don’t have to worry about any of this. The HealthCare.Gov website was set up to help people who don’t have insurance, either through an employer, Medicare or Medicaid or federal government benefits.

But if you have been waiting to get on, the Health and Human Services Department says keep trying.

And you may have to try more than once, even now, after six weeks of repair work.

“I think it is not possible for me to guarantee that 100 percent of the people 100 percent of the time going on this website will have a perfectly seamless, smooth experience,” Obama said this week. “We’re going to have to continue to improve it even after November 30th, December 1st. But the majority of people who use it will be able to see it operate the way it was supposed to.”

Can't I just call one of the call centers or file a paper application with one of those trained experts?

You can, but your application still has to go through the website at some point, even if you're not the one sitting there pushing the buttons.

USA TODAY

Site had a calamitous rollout in October

Team that was brought in to make repairs says site will now serve most users flawlessly

Both Republicans and Democrats turn focus to the underlying law

The White House announced Sunday it has met its goal to make its troubled Healthcare.gov website operate smoothly for most users, fueling hope among Democrats that attention can now turn to successes of the underlying health care law.

""The bottom line is health care.gov on December first is night and day from where it was October first,"" said Jeffrey Zients, the president's appointee to fix the website's problems. ""The site is now stable and operating at its intended capacity at greatly improved performance.""

When the site — which allows people to compare private plan benefits and costs before buying an insurance policy — launched Oct. 1, millions of people were disappointed by slow or frozen pages, an inability to log in, and incorrect or missing information. The White House tapped Zients to lead a team to fix the site.

At the beginning of November, Zients said the site had an ""up time"" of just 43%. As of Nov. 30, the site's up time was 95%.

""We have a much more stable system that's reliably open for business,"" he said in a Sunday conference call with reporters.

The news was met optimistically by Democrats and with trepidation from Republicans Sunday.

Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said on CBS's Face The Nation that the updates were good news, and compared the exchange's previous performance to a store advertising a sale but forgetting to unlock the doors.

""It sounds like the front door has been opened successfully now,"" Menendez said.

But Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said the health care law still puts ""downward pressure on employment"" and ""upward pressure on the deficit.""

""I don't know how you fix the many fundamental problems of this program,"" he said.

The Republican governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker, said the GOP needs an alternative, market-driven plan for health care.

""We just have to have the courage to stand up and do it, and we're doing it in the states,"" he said.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the backlash is to be expected, but that he's relieved to hear the website is now operating smoothly.

""Clearly by any metric, the website is much better than it was,"" he said on MSNBC. ""Let's hope that this is now the end of the botched website — we can move into a new phase where people are enrolling, where people are seeing the benefits of expanded coverage.""

After hardware updates and bug fixes that continued through the weekend, the federal health exchange site now has the capacity to serve 50,000 people at a time, for a total of 800,000 people a day, according to a report issued Sunday by the Department of Health and Human Services.

That figure is ""conservative,"" Zients said, because it was calculated using an eight-hour day, rather than a 24-hour day.

""We needed to get the team working with the speed and urgency of a high-tech company,"" Zients said. Just as a high-tech company accountable to shareholders would, the team has focused in the past month on daily progress reports to ensure people know what's being done to fix the site. At least 50 bug fixes were made just last night, bringing the number of fixes up to more than 400.

According to the administration, Zients' repair team has so far:

• Made hundreds of software fixes, upgraded hardware and monitored the system to make improvements;

• Stabilized the site at its original intended capacity; and

• Improved overall metrics, which means the site is working well for most users.

A new hardware upgrade made Friday quadrupled the registration capacity, Zients said, and response times are under one second with an error rate below 1%.

Over the holiday weekend, ""Traffic has been significantly higher than a typical weekend,"" Zients said, but the website has handled the workload smoothly.

Julie Bataille, director of the office of communications for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the team continued to work over the weekend on the back-end of the site, to make sure that insurers receive subsidy payments after people buy plans, as well as to make sure the plans receive correct information.

""As we said about five weeks ago, we were seeing only about 30% of users being able to enroll,"" Bataille said. That percentage is now up to 80%.

However, Bataille explained that there will always be a significant percentage of people who will need additional help navigating the site, but not necessarily because of technological problems. Some people have complex family situations, and others aren't comfortable using the Internet for purchases in general.

""It's important to remember that there are and will remain a significant number of people for whom online is not their preferred method of enrollment,"" she said. Those people can still enroll with paper applications and over the phone.

Zients explained a new feature of the site: If someone comes to HealthCare.gov and the site is at maximum capacity, the person will be able to leave an e-mail address. When traffic clears and there is space for another visitor, that person will receive an e-mail telling them they can log back in without a wait."

For both sides in the protracted battle over what has come to be called Obamacare, it is a moment of political peril.

The president has staked his legacy on tens of millions of Americans who don’t get health benefits at work being able to start signing up for insurance coverage, even if they have a preexisting medical problem.

A meltdown in this new system would be politically damaging for Obama and his Democratic allies, who have said since the law passed in 2010 that Americans would embrace the Affordable Care Act once they realized its benefits.

For Republicans, the stakes also are high. Warning of an impending catastrophe, the GOP has waged an unprecedented campaign to stop the law from taking effect — including the current threat to shut down much of the federal government if Obama does not yield. A relatively drama-free rollout of the law this fall could shatter what has been a key pillar of the Republican agenda.

More worrisome still to some Republican strategists: The law’s new benefits may prove popular with millions of Americans who have been unable to get health insurance.

“We are replacing years of fighting with a reality, and that reality will shape public attitudes from here forward,” said Bill McInturff, a veteran Republican pollster. “If it works, attitudes about the law could change. But this country will have limited patience and tolerance if it doesn’t.”

Enrollment is scheduled to begin Tuesday in new state-based insurance marketplaces authorized by the law. Consumers who don’t get health benefits at work will be able to shop on the marketplaces for health plans, which must provide a new basic set of protections. The coverage will take effect Jan. 1.

Few on either side think opinions will change overnight, as a relatively small number of consumers will initially use these markets. Only about 7 million people are expected to enroll in 2014, rising to 25 million by 2018, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. An additional 12 million low-income Americans ultimately will sign up for government Medicaid programs under the law, the budget office says.

By contrast, more than 160 million people will continue to get health benefits through the decades-old system of employer-sponsored coverage, according to the projections.

Obama and his allies, however, are counting on a gradual transformation in public opinion. As millions of Americans get guaranteed health insurance and begin sharing personal stories with friends and neighbors, what has largely been a political debate will start transforming into a discussion about consumer experiences, they believe.

Supporting this effort, a vast network of grass-roots groups, some linked directly to Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign, have fanned out across the country to enroll consumers in health coverage.

The president himself appealed directly to Americans in a fiery speech last week touting the healthcare law.

“You don’t need to listen to the politicians. You don’t need to listen to me. Just go check it out for yourself,” he told an audience of supporters in suburban Washington.

“I promise you, if you go on the website and it turns out you’re going to save $100, $200, $300 a month on your insurance, or you’ll be able to buy insurance for the first time, even if you didn’t vote for me, I’ll bet you’ll sign up.”

Even some Republicans believe that once consumers get assistance from the law, those benefits will become popular, making repeal all but impossible.

“The reality is that once people actually get health insurance, we are going to see stories of how it improved people’s health, even saved lives,” said William Pierce, a former George W. Bush administration official who worked on implementation of the Medicare Part D program a decade ago.

Part D, which enables seniors to get a private prescription drug plan through Medicare, was viewed unfavorably by more than half of seniors after Republicans enacted it in 2003 over the objections of most Democrats. Initial reports of confusion and technical problems when the program rolled out in 2005 further depressed public support.

Today, the prescription drug benefit is widely seen as a runaway success, with 9 in 10 seniors reporting they are satisfied with their coverage, according to a recent poll by the Healthcare Leadership Council, a coalition of leading healthcare companies.

One provision of Obama’s health law expands the Part D program by gradually closing a gap in coverage known as the doughnut hole.

Tevi Troy, another former Bush administration official and senior healthcare advisor to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, said the possibility of a similar change in views of the Affordable Care Act drove Romney to develop meticulous plans for stopping the law if he was elected.

“We knew … a Rubicon would be crossed” if the law took effect, Troy said. Like many Republicans, Troy believes the law, even if it proves popular, will drive up costs, pushing the federal government deeper into debt.

The law continues to engender fierce partisan opposition, with just 1 in 10 Republicans holding a favorable view, according to a September tracking poll from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

Republican leaders have already begun using Obamacare attacks to target Democratic lawmakers up for reelection in red states in 2014, including senators from Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina. That playbook helped Republicans capture the House in the 2010 midterm election, when shell-shocked Democrats largely tried to avoid talking about the law.

Even a relatively successful rollout probably will include enough glitches to sustain partisan opposition, public opinion experts say.

Indeed, the portions of the law that already have taken effect don’t appear to have changed many minds.

Several million young people have been able to remain on their parents’ health plans until they turn 26. Seniors have gotten relief on their prescription bills as the Part D drug coverage gap closes.

And millions of consumers qualified for rebates from their insurance companies under a provision that limits how much insurers can spend on nonmedical expenses, such as profits or executive salaries.

Yet public views of the law have barely budged in 3 1/2 years.

Nor are Americans optimistic that they will realize any benefits. Just 12% of respondents in a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll said the health law would have a positive effect on them or their family.

“It’s a bit of a mystery,” said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster, who still believes that public views will change once the new insurance guarantee takes effect next year.

Looming as an even greater threat to Obama and other Democrats may be other changes that could be blamed on the law, such as rising costs or moves by more employers to stop offering health coverage to their employees.

“That could be very, very difficult for Democrats,” said McInturff, the Republican pollster. Those sorts of changes, if they occur on a widespread basis, could provide one of the most potent lines of attack for Republicans in next year’s congressional elections, he said.

Unfortunately, these qualities are far too prevalent in our political culture today, and are prime reasons why Washington and the politicians that work there are held in such low regard.

Nowhere is this more evident than in the implementation and implosion of ObamaCare.

During the debate over the deeply flawed bill in 2009 and 2010, voters were repeatedly assured by President Obama and his congressional allies that everyone who liked their current health care plan would be able to keep it. “Period.”

[pullquote]

Now, as the new law implodes before our eyes, millions of Americans have received letters of cancellation. With approximately five million people across the country expected to lose their current plan and millions more to follow, when all the smoke clears, it’s clear that the Democrats broke their promise to the American people.

Many other Americans are experiencing fewer medical options as insurers restrict their choice of doctors and hospitals in order to keep costs low.

Some of the country’s top medical facilities are being excluded from the new exchange system, meaning patients who have been getting treatment from doctors they like all of a sudden find themselves out of luck.

For example, in New Hampshire, only 16 of the state’s 26 hospitals are available on the federal exchange, meaning patients must either pay more to keep their current doctor or seek inferior care elsewhere.

Neither is a good option.

New Hampshire is not alone. Across the country, some of the best hospitals are not available on plans on the exchange, leaving patients with difficult choices and unwanted sometimes, life threatening decisions.

Rather than join with Republicans and immediately repeal this catastrophe before it gets any worse, Democrats are stubbornly digging in their heels.

They know that backing away from President Obama’s signature achievement would be a huge embarrassment for the White House, and they’re unwilling to buck their party leadership.

Instead, they’re hiding behind meaningless show votes in Congress, offering half-hearted and meaningless attempts to reinstate cancelled plans or delay implementation of some of the particularly onerous new federal regulations.

All these false efforts will do is add to the increased costs and put things off until after the 2014 elections.

No one is mistaking these transparent moves as profiles in courage.

ObamaCare became the law of the land because every single Democratic Senator fell in line with their party bosses and voted for it. For any sitting member of the Senate to somehow now suggest that they are fighting to protect their constituents from this “trainwreck” is completely hypocritical.

If they were really interested in sparing their constituents from ObamaCare’s harmful impact, they should have stood up when they could have stopped the whole thing from becoming law.

They could have also voted to allow for the protection or “grandfathering” of the older policies.

They did neither.

Adding insult to injury is the fact that politicians in Washington have access to many special perks and privileges unavailable to the general public when attempting to navigate ObamaCare.

Beyond having more top-flight plans to choose from, senators have access to what the New York Times recently described as “concierge-type services” and “in-person support sessions” available only to members of Congress.

Democrats who voted for ObamaCare are therefore not exposed to the same frustrations of a broken website and complicated red tape that millions of everyday people are being forced to work through.

The hypocrisy is stunning. Saddling the rest of the country with complicated rules they didn’t want and don’t need in pursuit of a health care takeover that will hurt patient care, limit options and devastate our economy is no way to run a country.

Not only is President Obama to blame here, so too are every single one of the Democratic senators who forced this fiasco on the American people.

The president is not going to face voters again, but his congressional enablers and supporters will in less than a year. When they do, it’s going to be an unpleasant experience for any incumbent having to explain their deciding vote and continued support for the ongoing disaster of ObamaCare."

She says she’s angry at President Obama for having promised that people who like their health plans could keep them, when hers is getting canceled for not meeting Obamacare’s standards.

“Please explain to me,” she told Maria Bartiromo on CNBC Wednesday, “how my plan is a ‘substandard’ plan when ... I’d be paying more for the exchange plans than I am currently paying by a wide margin.”

Bartiromo didn’t take her up on her request. So I will.

The bottom line is that Cavallaro’s assertion that “there’s nothing affordable about the Affordable Care Act,” as she put it Tuesday on NBC Channel 4, is the product of her own misunderstandings, abetted by a passel of uninformed and incurious news reporters.

I talked with Cavallaro, 60, after her CNBC appearance. Let’s walk through what she told me.

Her current plan, from Anthem Blue Cross, is a catastrophic coverage plan for which she pays $293 a month as an individual policyholder. It requires her to pay a deductible of $5,000 a year and limits her out-of-pocket costs to $8,500 a year. Her plan also limits her to two doctor visits a year, for which she shoulders a copay of $40 each. After that, she pays the whole cost of subsequent visits.

This fits the very definition of a nonconforming plan under Obamacare. The deductible and out-of-pocket maximums are too high, the provisions for doctor visits too skimpy.

As for a replacement plan, she says she was quoted $478 a month by her insurance broker, but that’s a lot more than she’ll really be paying. Cavallaro told me she hasn’t checked the website of Covered California, the state’s health plan exchange, herself. I did so while we talked.

Here’s what I found. I won’t divulge her current income, which is personal, but this year it qualifies her for a hefty federal premium subsidy.

At her age, she’s eligible for a good “silver” plan for $333 a month after the subsidy -- $40 a month more than she’s paying now. But the plan is much better than her current plan -- the deductible is $2,000, not $5,000. The maximum out-of-pocket expense is $6,350, not $8,500. Her co-pays would be $45 for a primary care visit and $65 for a specialty visit -- but all visits would be covered, not just two.

Advertisement

Is that better than her current plan? Yes, by a mile.

If she wanted to pay less, Cavallaro could opt for lesser coverage in a “bronze” plan. She could buy one from the California exchange for as little as $194 a month. From Anthem, it’s $256, or $444 a year less than she’s paying now. That buys her a $5,000 deductible (the same as she’s paying today) but the out-of-pocket limit is lower, $6,350. Office visits would be $60 for primary care and $70 for specialties, but again with no limit on the number of visits. Factor in the premium savings, and it’s hard to deny that she’s still ahead.

Cavallaro told me a couple of things that are worth considering. First, what she likes about her current plan is that she can go to any doctor of her choice and any hospital. That’s not entirely true, because her current plan with Anthem does favor a network. Plainly, however, it’s broad enough to serve her purposes. She’s concerned that the new plans will offer smaller networks, which is probably true, though it’s not necessarily true that the new networks will exclude her favorite doctors, hospitals or prescription formularies.

She also mentioned that her annual income fluctuates. It can be substantially lower, or substantially higher, than it is this year. What if next year she earns too much to qualify for the subsidy? Also a fair point -- at her current income, the subsidy is worth more than $200 a month to her. But that’s not the same as saying that “there’s nothing affordable about the Affordable Care Act,” because at her current income, the act is vastly more affordable to her than what she’s paying now.

When she told Channel 4 that “for the first time in my whole life, I will be without insurance,” it’s hard to understand what she was talking about. (Channel 4 didn’t ask.) Better plans than she has now are available for her to purchase today, some of them for less money.

The sad truth is that Cavallaro has been very poorly served by the health insurance industry and the news media. It seems that Anthem didn’t adequately explain her options for 2014 when it disclosed that her current plan is being canceled. If her insurance brokers told her what she says they did, they failed her. And the reporters who interviewed her without getting all the facts produced inexcusably shoddy work -- from Maria Bartiromo on down. They not only did her a disservice, but failed the rest of us too."

Oct 7 (Reuters) - The Obama administration said on Monday it was fixing software and capacity problems at the main website designed to enroll millions of Americans into new health plans.

The HealthCare.gov website has been beset by glitches since Oct. 1, the first day people were allowed to enroll in the new coverage provided by the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.

The website, which serves insurance exchanges in 36 states, received 8.6 million unique visitors last week, according to the federal government.

""Our top issue when it comes to the glitches has been the extraordinary number of people coming to check out plans and find out more about Obamacare. The number has obviously exceeded expectations,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said at a news briefing.

""To make further improvements, we are doing several things at once, including adding server capacity and making software changes to make the system more efficient to handle higher volume.""

IT experts told Reuters last week they believed flaws in the system's architecture, not traffic alone, contributed to the problems of the first week.

One expert told Reuters the site's design triggered too many requests to the server simultaneously, which created a situation similar to when hackers attack a site, known as a distributed denial of service attack.

Carney said a particular component of the system within the account registration function was not able to handle the high volume, causing problems for consumers at the registration process.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, ""has put up a gate at the front end of the system that places visitors into a waiting room and lets them in at a particular pace, so that the surge in volume does not cause the problems that it caused in the past,"" Carney said.

""Thus far, we've reduced waiting room times by a third and are increasingly moving more users through the system, but we're not satisfied with the performance.""

In response to the early glitches, supporters of the law have pointed to the fact that enrollment in the online healthcare exchanges is set to run through the end of March, allowing for several months to work out the kinks.

Including separate websites run by individual states alone, the exchanges are expected to enroll 7 million Americans next year, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. (Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton in Washington. Editing by Andre Grenon)"
"http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-leak-from-issa-20131220,0,4513971.story",2013-12-20 17:49:00,['Los Angeles Times Columnist Michael Hiltzik Writes'],"Another day, another leak from Issa, another credulous news report","The sun has risen in the East, so there must be a news report somewhere quoting a partial transcript leaked by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista) purporting to show the shortcomings of Obamacare.

Bingo! We have not one but two “investigative” news reports, from CBS and ABC, based on the same partial transcript. And both, consequently, have the same level of credibility: none. CBS News even offers a dividend -- a thoroughly dishonest and discreditable interview with Issa himself. We’ll get to that in a moment.

The topic of the latest leak is the purported security flaws in healthcare.gov, the federal health enrollment website. The raw meat is a partial transcript of an interview conducted by the staff of Issa’s House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform with Teresa Fryer, chief information security officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is handling the healthcare.gov rollout.

Cue Sharyl Attkisson of CBS: “A top HealthCare.gov security officer told Congress there have been two, serious high-risk findings since the website’s launch, including one on Monday of this week.”

Advertisement

Well, yes. But not exactly. Fryer said more, which you’d know if you read the parts of the transcript left out of the Issa leak but distributed by the committee’s Democratic minority. There you discover that Fryer also said that the system’s security measures exceed industry standards, that there haven’t been any security breaches of the website, and the parts of the system affected by the high-risk findings were promptly shut down and quarantined.

That brings us to Issa, who went before the CBS cameras to charge that Fryer’s recommendation that the website launch be delayed was overruled by mysterious “individuals” who, he said, “were looking at a broader array of risk.” His tone of voice put air quotes around that “broader.” He continued, “I took that to mean the risks such as risk to the president of embarrassment, the risk to people who were counting on being able to sign up for these plans.”

See what he did there? He suggested that CMS was pressured by the White House to launch a website with security holes.

But there’s absolutely no basis in Fryer’s transcript -- zero -- to support that. What she said was that it’s standard operating procedure to place security assessments like hers in a broader context. In fact, the process is set forth by NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is the government’s technology assessment agency. And of course that makes sense: You weigh the security aspects of a technical system against numerous other factors, including the importance of the program, and decide from the totality whether to launch.

There’s nothing in Fryer’s words even remotely hinting at an effort to spare the president “embarrassment.” Issa appears to have made that up out of whole cloth.

But he didn’t stop there. He suggested to CBS that the healthcare.gov website exposed virtually the entire government to hacking. “Remember, Sharyl, this is not about your application being compromised. This is a system, exchange and portal, that lets me go into the Department of Homeland Security, lets me go into the IRS ... Social Security. Think about what’s at Social Security, what’s at IRS, what’s at Department of Homeland Security. That’s the vulnerability.”

Is that so? A flaw in a healthcare enrollment website that could let hackers in on our most precious government secrets? Let’s agree that if this were true, it would be huge. But once again, Issa has absolutely no evidence that it’s remotely true. If he had it, he would shout it from the rooftops, and he’d be right to do so. He wouldn’t slink around in the dark to a news show and slip it into the conversation with a credulous reporter.

CBS plainly knows Issa was blowing smoke. If his assertion was at all credible, Attkisson would have made it her lead, instead of going with some threadbare assertion by a middle-level bureaucrat about “findings” that there were flaws in the website and that were dealt with promptly.

Advertisement

Of course, it’s possible that healthcare.gov has such flaws. But most of the concern about the site up to now has involved the possibility that hackers could obtain the information that applicants type in, not that hackers could jump from the website directly into the government’s internal systems. Curiously, Issa specifically disavowed concerns about the first possibility.

In the words of Kevin Drum, who has been collecting Issa’s selective leaks as tenaciously as my kids once collected beanie babies, “When will reporters learn not to trust Issa? Judging by current practice, never.”

But you don’t have to be so gullible."

Insurers say Obama%27s %27fix%27 has put them in a bind

Some people hope to keep old policies%3B others say they%27re better off%2C won%27t go back

Battle over whether consumers can keep canceled policies will be fought in the states

Cathy Pedersen is in what amounts to health insurance limbo.

When President Obama announced a rule change last week to his Affordable Care Act that potentially would allow hundreds of thousands of Americans to keep their old insurance plans, Pedersen saw a glimmer of hope that the inexpensive, high-deductible plan she's been purchasing for nearly 20 years wouldn't be canceled after all.

Soon after Obama announced the rule change, Pederson of Gilbert, Ariz., made a quick call to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona to see if she could get back her old plan, which did not meet ACA minimum requirements.

She was told by a customer service representative that the insurer was still consulting with Arizona's insurance commission on whether it will make her 2013 plan available again after it expires Dec. 31.

""I cannot afford to pay $200 more per month,"" said Pedersen, 54, who added that the cheapest alternative policy she's found with the newly established federal government exchange would more than double the $186 monthly premium she paid in 2013. ""We're more than halfway into November, and my insurance broker is telling me it takes up to 45 days to get on a plan. I just feel like this situation did not have to happen.""

In addition to Obama's proposed administrative fix, the GOP-led House approved legislation Friday — which has little chance of becoming law — that would allow insurers to continue offering health care plans to new and existing customers through next year, even if the plans do not meet the minimum benefit requirements.

The true battle of whether Americans such as Pedersen will be able keep their policies next year will largely be fought on the state level in the days ahead. Many who received cancellation notices and have shopped for new coverage must calculate whether they are better off sticking with what they have or trying to get back on their old plans.

The health insurance market is regulated by states, and insurance commissioners who have spoken out on Obama's proposed fix have been split on whether they will make any changes to accommodate the president's rule change.

Obama met with executives from 15 leading insurance companies Friday and encouraged them to support his administrative fix, which is meant to address the problem of mass cancellations of policies despite his oft-repeated promise that Americans would be able to keep their insurance policies if they liked them.

Industry analysts say Obama is putting insurers in a bind and it may not be practical for insurers to rescind cancellations. Under the law, to have coverage take effect by Jan. 1, the consumers must make their coverage elections by Dec. 15.

Insurers are essentially being given a month to reprogram their computer systems for policies, rates and eligibility; mail notices to the policyholders that describe just what the differences are between the grandfathered policies and the ACA compliant plans; request and receive the consumers' decisions; then enter those decisions back into their systems, said Robert Laszewski, an analyst with Health Policy and Strategy Associates

""They (the White House) appear to be throwing this hot potato into the hands of the insurance industry, who will now be on the hot seat to agree to do the impossible or take the heat for failing to do so,"" Laszewski said

Kathleen Forster, 64, a retired interior designer in Grosse Point, Mich., who received a cancellation notice in the mail several weeks ago, said she holds no hope that her provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, will rescind the cancellation notice it sent her and her husband several weeks ago.

""Why would they?"" Forster said. ""They jumped through all these hoops to come up with something new. Now they are going to rescind that? To make President Obama look good?""

The Forsters ended up buying a new policy from Blue Cross that meets the ACA requirements. Their premium ticked up from $762 per month to $820; their deductible shot up from $1,000 to $12,000.

Others who received cancellation notices say they won't go back to the individual insurance market.

Ginger Culbertson, 61, a self-employed marriage and family therapist in Greenville, S.C., said it took her nearly a month and a half — with the help of a private insurance broker — to navigate her way through HealthCare.Gov.

As frustrating as the process was, she made the switch. Under her current policy, she pays a $783 monthly premium and has a $5,000 deductible. She cut her premium by more than half, and her deductible will be $3,500. She also qualified for a tax credit.

""I'll be way better off than I am right now,"" she said.

Rocco Racano of Marlboro, N.J., said the option to keep his former policy wasn't appealing.

He previously had a policy from Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey for adults ages 60-65 that covered him and his wife. It cost $1,020 a month. It had a $40 co-pay and a $2,500 family deductible. And it had an out-of-pocket maximum of $6,500.

The Newark-based insurance company canceled the policy, set to expire next June.

Racano said a gold plan offered by Horizon in the health exchange had a $908-a-month premium and a $3,000 deductible. His household income is low enough that he could receive a subsidy of about $500 a month.

Still, Racano said he isn't sure how it will play out. He couldn't get on the government's health care website and had to apply by mail instead. He hasn't received a response.

Jason Cannon, 33, a writer from Birmingham, Ala., said he and his family lost the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama plan that cost him $307 per month and had a $1,200 premium. His plan did not meet the ACA minimum benefit requirement.

He has since found a similar plan with UnitedHealthCare that will cost him $330 per month. Cannon took particular umbrage with the ACA requirement that plans cover maternity care — something his old plan did not include.

""If I choose to bet on myself (on a plan with a lower premium/higher deductible), I should be allowed,"" Cannon wrote in an e-mail. ""I know my medical history, my income level and have assigned a risk value based on that. The government essentially took none of that into account, forced me to bet on getting or being sick (and possibly becoming pregnant). That inflated my premium for a newer policy with a higher level of coverage I don't necessarily need.""

Cannon said his wife called Blue Cross Blue Shield on Thursday after Obama announced his fix to see if their 2013 policy would be available. But ultimately, Cannon said he didn't think his family will go back to the old plan.

""I would argue this is no fix at all,"" Cannon said. ""If I were an insurer, why would I go back to all the customers whom I have notified were losing their policy and tell them, 'No, you can stay. But we'll send you another letter in a year.'""

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/02/administration-delays-key-obamacare-insurance-mandate/,2013-07-02 00:00:00,[],Administration delays key ObamaCare insurance mandate,"The Obama administration announced Tuesday that it is delaying a major provision in the health care overhaul, putting off until 2015 a requirement that many employers offer health insurance.

The announcement was made late Tuesday by the Treasury Department, at the beginning of the holiday week while Congress was on recess. It comes amid reports that the administration is running into roadblocks as it prepares to implement ObamaCare.

The change in the employer mandate is arguably the most significant concession the administration has made to date.

Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., a critic of the law, seized on the delay as a ""clear admission"" that the law is ""unaffordable, unworkable and unpopular.""

""It's also a cynical political ploy to delay the coming train wreck associated with ObamaCare until after the 2014 elections,"" he said.

The law requires companies that employ 50 or more workers to offer coverage or face fines. The Treasury Department and the White House said that, based on complaints by employers that the system for reporting the coverage was too onerous, they would simplify that system and give employers an additional year to comply.

""We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively,"" Mark J. Mazur, the assistant secretary for tax policy at the Treasury Department, said in a statement posted online. ""We have listened to your feedback. And we are taking action.""

The mandate was originally set to kick in for 2014, but will now start in 2015.

The decision effectively means that penalties that would have been assessed against non-compliant businesses will be delayed until 2015. The administration encouraged employers to provide insurance anyway.

While the employer mandate is being delayed, the so-called individual mandate -- the requirement that individuals obtain health insurance -- presumably remains on schedule for 2014.

The administration also still plans to open up a new marketplace for government-regulated insurance plans on Oct. 1, to take effect on Jan. 1. And a sprawling set of subsidies would also remain in place.

The delay of the employer mandate, though, raises questions about whether more elements of the law might be delayed in the coming months.

White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett explained that, on the employer mandate issue, the administration was making two changes.

""First, we are cutting red tape and simplifying the reporting process,"" she wrote on the White House blog. She cited concerns that the law would have required companies to set up new data collection systems on employee access to health care. She said: ""Some of this detailed reporting may be unnecessary for businesses that more than meet the minimum standards in the law."" So, she said, the administration plans to figure out a ""smarter system.""

Second, she said, the administration would delay the roll-out and penalties since they were overhauling the reporting system.

""This allows employers the time to test the new reporting systems and make any necessary adaptations to their health benefits while staying the course toward making health coverage more affordable and accessible for their workers,"" she said.

Randy Johnson, senior vice president of Labor, Immigration, and Employee Benefits at the Chamber of Commerce, told Fox News that with its decision, the administration has ""finally recognized the obvious.""

""Employers need more time and clarification of the rules of the road before implementing the employer mandate,"" he said. ""We will continue to work to alleviate this and other problems with ObamaCare.""

Negotiators emerged upbeat from a closed-door meeting in the Capitol and said they remained on track to produce a bill by June. That, in itself, was significant, after the group of eight was on the verge of breakup.

“We were all positive that we can move forward,” said Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho, a top Republican leading the bipartisan effort.

House Republican leaders are increasingly concerned that momentum in the Senate, where a bipartisan immigration bill cleared a committee this week, will leave them on defense without their own proposal.

Trying to avoid that outcome, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) publicly drew a line Thursday by saying his chamber would not accept the Senate legislation.

“The House remains committed to fixing our broken immigration system, but we will not simply take up and accept the bill that is emerging in the Senate if it passes,” Boehner and his GOP leadership team said in a joint statement as the private meeting was ending. “The House will work its will and produce its own legislation.”

House Democrats have their own internal divisions as they determine whether it is best to put their weight behind the Senate bill, which hews more to their political priorities, or push the House group to finish its bipartisan proposal that is certain to be more conservative than the Senate effort.

How exactly the House will proceed remained an open question as lawmakers left town for the weeklong Memorial Day recess without firm agreement on the healthcare issue.

Federal law already guarantees emergency care for anyone who shows up at an emergency room, and under the emerging House plan, that would not change.

The House group has already agreed that as an estimated 11 million immigrants lacking proper papers begin the decade-long transition to legal status, they would not have access to key healthcare benefits that are available to Americans.

Chief among those would be exclusion from receiving the tax subsidies that will be available to help Americans cover the costs of mandatory insurance coverage required by the new healthcare law. That is also the case in the Senate legislation.

The House and Senate will, however, allow immigrants who are gaining legal status to use their own money to buy health coverage on the new healthcare exchanges. The health exchanges will be available next year to sell policies to Americans who are not offered healthcare coverage through their employers.

Republicans in the House group have tried to mandate that immigrants purchase health coverage or risk deportation – a provision Democrats argue is too harsh.

Many immigrants would be unable to afford privately purchased coverage, as is the case now for many working Americans for whom private policies are too expensive.

Immigrant advocates argue that the threat of deportation may prevent immigrants from seeking basic healthcare, including vaccinations or treatment for communicable diseases.

The House group agreed to keep working on the issue, perhaps only to require that immigrants make a good faith effort to pay their routine healthcare bills, and perhaps excluding costs from emergency room visits.

“Constitutionally, you can’t deny people emergency care, so you just have to comply with the Constitution,” Labrador said.

“The key is -- skip out on their bills,” he explained. “They can do like any other American that has to make payments on their bills. There just has to be personal responsibility.”

The details still need to be worked out. But for many lawmakers in the group, staying together to keep working on the bill was itself a battle won.

“I’m very pleased,” said Rep. Luis Gutierrez (R-Ill.) “We’re going to continue.”

Washington (CNN) - Only a minority of Americans are giving a thumbs up to the rollout of the Obamacare health care exchanges, according to a trio of new national polls.

Just 12% of people questioned in a CBS News poll released Tuesday say they think the process is going well, with nearly half saying it's not going well and nearly four in 10 saying they can't evaluate the signup process at HealthCare.gov.

The state level online exchanges, which opened for business on October 1, are intended to allow those without insurance to sign up for health care, and are a crucial part of the Affordable Care Act.

Less than three-in-10 surveyed in a Pew Research Center poll released on Monday say the online exchanges are working very well, with 46% saying they are not.

Besides the expected partisan divide, the poll also indicates a racial gap. Just 24% of white respondents, but 51% of black respondents say the exchanges are working well.

And the survey points to generational and income divides.

""Young people and those with annual household incomes of less than $30,000 are divided in their evaluations of the exchanges, while the assessments of older and more affluent Americans are more negative,"" says a release from Pew Research.

An ABC News/Washington Post poll suggests that major problems with the health care law's website may just be an appetizer.

Fifty-six percent of those questioned in the survey, which was released Monday, say the website failures are a sign of broader problems to come, with four in 10 saying they are an isolated incident.

More than eight in 10 Republicans see the website failures as part of a larger problem with the measure, while most Democrats describe it as an isolated incident.

President angry with rollout

The health care law, passed along party lines in 2010 when the Democrats controlled the Senate and the House, is considered President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement.

And the President vented Monday about the website rollout.

""Nobody's madder than me about the website not working as well as it should, which means it's going to get fixed,"" Obama said during an appearance the White House Rose Garden.

But he didn't specify exactly what went wrong or who was to blame for the problems, which include long waits to log onto the federally administered website and maddeningly long wait times once online.

There's ""no excuse for the problems,"" Obama added.

But he said tech industry experts were being brought in to help workers trying to fix the site.

The technical fiasco is fueling the GOP push to dismantle or defund Obamacare, and some Republicans are calling for the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.

In early September, barely half (51%) knew that exchanges were going to be available in their state; that has risen to nearly two-thirds (65%) today.

Website failures not affecting support for Obamacare

According to the ABC News/Washington Post poll, 46% of Americans support the law, edging up four points from last month. Forty-nine percent say they oppose the measure, down three points from September.

Forty-three percent of those questioned in the CBS News survey give Obamacare a thumbs up, a four point increase since September, with 51% saying they oppose the law, unchanged from last month.

The 42%-53% approval/disapproval rating for the measure in the Pew poll is basically unchanged from September.

A CNN/ORC International poll released Monday indicates that 41% say they favor the law, with 56% opposed to it. The 41% approval was up three points from last month, with the disapproval basically unchanged.

The CNN survey also indicates that 38% say they are against the law because they think it's too liberal, while 12% say it's not liberal enough. That means 53% either support Obamacare, or say it's not liberal enough.

The Pew survey suggests more Americans are becoming familiar with the exchanges. The percentage of people who know that the exchanges are available in their state rose from 51% early last month to nearly two thirds now."

At least eight others states -- California, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington -- have rejected the president’s Nov. 14 proposal that insurance companies offer plans that don’t comply with ObamaCare requirements for at least a year. Connecticut decided Friday.

Though ObamaCare is federal law, governors and insurance commissioners must allow providers to make the exceptions because insurance is regulated differently in each state.

Obama in touting his sweeping health-care reform law before signing it in 2010 told Americans they could keep their existing insurance plans if they liked them.

However, many of those plans do not meet the law's new standards, which has resulted in millions of cancellation notices being mailed out over the past few months and the president announcing his proposed solution.

""We are not going to gut this law,"" Obama said during a speech in Cleveland. ""We will fix what needs to be fixed, but we're going to make the Affordable Care Act work.""

This is not the first so-called fix the president has proposed, starting with him putting a one-year delay on the ObamaCare mandate that small businesses provide insurance to employees, to allow owners to sort through the complex paperwork.

And the White House this week extended the enrollment deadline after the disastrous Oct. 1 rollout of the healthcare.gov website.

Officials said Friday they would extend the Dec. 15 deadline to Dec. 23 for insurance coverage that kicks in Jan 1. Those who fail to enroll by March 15 face a tax penalty.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, last week rejected the offer, saying his state exchange is working well and the state-run website has not had the technical glitches like the federal site.

One of the biggest concerns among state officials is that allowing residents to wait a year will make the overall ObamaCare situation worse because the young, healthy people needed to enroll and cover the cost of the elderly and other more costly customers will indeed wait.

Minnesota Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton and other governors reportedly said no to the Obama offer over concerns it would destabilize their states insurance markets and result in higher premiums for too many residents.

On Thursday, California’s health insurance exchange voted unanimously against the proposal.

The Covered California Board of Directors decided instead to stick with its approach of phasing out the non-compliant policies by year’s end, saying Obama’s request that insurers let Americans keep those plans through 2014 will not help consumers in the end.

“The board cited that extending the deadline offers no benefit to the consumer and may create confusion about accessing affordable health care coverage through Covered California,” it said in a press release.

However, at least a dozen states have agreed to the proposal or were already allowing insurers to let customers renew existing plans.

Among them are Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon and Texas. Roughly another 20 states have yet to decide.

The other major factor is whether insurance companies will comply.

North Carolina Blue Cross Blue Shield and Florida Blue have agreed but Blue Cross Blue Shield Alabama did not.

The Alabama group said Wednesday that temporarily reinstating out-of-compliance policies would “destabilize” the state’s insurance market and that “the ultimate impact would be higher healthcare costs for all of our customers, now and in the near future.”"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/30/Thousands-Scramble-To-Get-Medical-Procedures-Before-Obamacare-Begins,2013-12-30 00:00:00,['Frances Martel'],Thousands Scramble to Get Medical Procedures Before Obamacare Begins,"With Obamacare coverage beginning in earnest on Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reports that thousands of people for which Obamacare plans will block some health care access are rushing to get medical tests and procedures done before their pre-ACA coverage is eliminated.

Those who were receiving medical care before being forced to sign up to a new plan on HealthCare.gov will, in many cases, be locked out of hospitals and prevented from seeing doctors who they had typically used. The WSJ contends that about 70% of new plans are more restrictive in the range of doctors and hospitals available to patients than their predecessors.

Fearing that the will be unable to use the doctors and hospitals they want with their new plans, doctors are reporting a massive uptick in the number of patients calling for preventative procedures or moving up their planned surgeries to prevent a disaster once Obamacare measures strike.

The paper explains that while supporters of the Affordable Care Act may argue that procedures will continue to be available, the plans severely curb access to certain doctors and hospitals, preventing patients from getting the level of care they are used to at their usual price. In particular, insurers now using the Obamacare system have begun to exclude major academic institutions from their coverage, as these compete with cheaper community hospitals ostensibly providing the same service.

To prevent patients from spending more of their money on better care, the insurance plans simply eliminate the competition from coverage plans to the benefit of community hospitals. Many plans also require referrals to visit specialists, which would require someone already familiar with a long-time specialist to find a general practitioner to direct them to the doctor they wanted to see in the first place.

These changes will affect the roughly 2 million people that used HealthCare.gov or their state affiliates to buy new insurance. This number is about one million short of the goal the White House set for itself, the result of HealthCare.gov failing to work properly for months and many plans being simply unaffordable to most Americans once they managed to get on the website at all. The White House made an exception to the December deadline to sign up for insurance for those currently insured who have to go through the system, a “hardship” exception in which Obamacare itself is the hardship.

According to a recent report by the New York Times, the hardest hit Americans are squarely in the middle class.

One professional interviewed by the Journal warned ominously not of the Americans rushing to have procedures done, but those that have no reason to need preventative care and will need it as they grow older. Those without this ability to rush due to their current good health will have a “rude awakening,” said James Conroy, chief health care officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges. He warned that these people will likely be surprised at their limited new insurance when they finally need to rely on Obamacare for medical help."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/opinion/krugman-the-big-deal.html,2013-01-21 00:00:00,['Paul Krugman'],Obama’s Big Deal - The New York Times,"On the day President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, an exuberant Vice President Biden famously pronounced the reform a “big something deal” — except that he didn’t use the word “something.” And he was right.

In fact, I’d suggest using this phrase to describe the Obama administration as a whole. F.D.R. had his New Deal; well, Mr. Obama has his Big Deal. He hasn’t delivered everything his supporters wanted, and at times the survival of his achievements seemed very much in doubt. But if progressives look at where we are as the second term begins, they’ll find grounds for a lot of (qualified) satisfaction.

Consider, in particular, three areas: health care, inequality and financial reform.

Health reform is, as Mr. Biden suggested, the centerpiece of the Big Deal. Progressives have been trying to get some form of universal health insurance since the days of Harry Truman; they’ve finally succeeded.

True, this wasn’t the health reform many were looking for. Rather than simply providing health insurance to everyone by extending Medicare to cover the whole population, we’ve constructed a Rube Goldberg device of regulations and subsidies that will cost more than single-payer and have many more cracks for people to fall through."

(CNN) —

The Supreme Court’s decision Thursday to uphold the Affordable Care Act means that the predictions about how it will affect Americans remain in place.

Obama: Supreme Court ruling on health care a victory for all Americans

The court did rule that a part of the law involving Medicaid must change. The law calls for an expansion of eligibility for Medicaid, which involves spending by the federal government and the states. The law threatens to remove existing Medicaid funding from states that don’t participate in the expansion. The high court said the government must remove that threat.

Several groups that follow the health care law closely said they were concerned about the high court’s ruling on the Medicaid portion of the law.

Read the court ruling (.PDF)

Here are some highlights:

The uninsured

The decision leaves in place the so-called individual mandate – the requirement on Americans to have or buy health insurance beginning in 2014 or face a penalty – although many are exempt from that provision.

In 2014, the penalty will be $285 per family or 1% of income, whichever is greater. By 2016, it goes up to $2,085 per family or 2.5% of income.

Health care exchanges, which are designed to offer cheaper health care plans, remain in place as well.

American Cancer Society CEO John Seffrin said his organization was looking at the ruling on Medicaid, and is “concerned that the decision may limit the expansion of quality coverage to some of our nation’s most vulnerable citizens.”

The group Health Care for America Now, which spent tens of millions of dollars on ads supporting the health care plan, said it was “disappointed” and will work to make sure no states “choose to exclude the lowest-income uninsured adults from their Medicaid programs.”

Medicaid Health Plans of America, the trade group representing Medicaid health plans, praised the court “for keeping in place key elements of this historic legislation” and said it remains “committed to a strong partnership with the states and CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) to find a way to cover this population in need.”

Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Georgia, a physician who staunchly opposed the health care law, told CNN he believes many who would have received Medicaid will now enter the health care exchanges, which offer subsidized plans. That, he argued, could cost taxpayers billions of dollars across the country.

Breaking down the court’s decision

The insured

Because the requirement remains for people to have or buy insurance, the revenue stream designed to help pay for the law remains in place. So insured Americans may be avoiding a spike in premiums that could have resulted if the high court had tossed out the individual mandate but left other requirements on insurers in place.

Young adults

Millions of young adults up to age 26 who have gained health insurance due to the law will be able to keep it. The law requires insurers to cover the children of those they insure up to age 26. About 2.5 million young adults from age 19 to 25 obtained health coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Two of the nation’s largest insurers, United Healthcare and Humana, recently announced they would voluntarily maintain some aspects of health care reform, including coverage of adult dependents up to age 26, even if the law was scrapped.

People with pre-existing conditions

Since the law remains in place, the requirement that insurers cover people with pre-existing medical conditions remains active.

The law also established that children under the age of 19 could no longer have limited benefits or be denied benefits because they had a pre-existing condition.

Starting in 2014, the law makes it illegal for any health insurance plan to use pre-existing conditions to exclude, limit or set unrealistic rates on coverage.

It also established national high-risk pools that people with such conditions could join sooner to get health insurance. As of April, a total of only about 67,000 people were enrolled in federally-funded pools established by the health care law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

More than 13 million American non-elderly adults have been denied insurance specifically because of their medical conditions, according to the Commonwealth Fund. The Kaiser Family Foundation says 21% of people who apply for health insurance on their own get turned down, are charged a higher price, or offered a plan that excludes coverage for their pre-existing condition.

All taxpayers

No matter what the Supreme Court had decided, it would have been a mixed bag for all Americans when it comes to federal spending. There is heated dispute over what impact the health care law will have on the country over the long term.

The federal government is set to spend more than $1 trillion over the next decade to subsidize coverage and expand eligibility for Medicaid.

It is not immediately clear how the high court’s ruling on the part of the law dealing with the expansion of Medicaid eligibility could affect spending.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the law could reduce deficits modestly in the first 10 years and then much more significantly in the second decade.

The CBO said a repeal of the mandate could reduce deficits by $282 billion over 10 years, because the government would be subsidizing insurance for fewer people. But the nation faces costs in various ways for having people who are uninsured. The Urban Institute’s Health Policy Center estimated that without a mandate, 40 million Americans would remain uninsured.

Meanwhile, the Flexible Spending Accounts that millions of Americans use to save money tax-free for medical expenses will be sliced under the law. FSAs often allow people to put aside up to $5,000 pre-tax; as of 2013, they were to face an annual limit of $2,500.

Opinion: Are voters ready to move on?

Small business owners

The rules and benefits small business owners face as a result of the health care law remain in place.

As CNN has chronicled, the law brought a mix of both. The director of the National Federation of Independent Business is one of the plaintiffs who pushed the court to strike down the law. Meanwhile, a group called Small Business Majority fought to protect the law, saying its loss could be a nightmare.

As of 2014, under the law, small firms with more than 50 full-time employees would have to provide coverage or face expensive fines.

All Americans, in lesser known ways

The massive health care law requires doctors to report goodies they get from medical supply companies; demands more breastfeeding rooms; requires all chain restaurants to list calories under every menu item, and includes numerous other provisions, which now remain in place.

Doctors and other health care providers

Health care providers have already begun making changes based on the 2010 law, and in preparation for what will go into effect in 2014. Those plans continue.

In the short term, doctors avoid “chaos” that may have resulted from the law suddenly being dropped or changed, according to Bob Doherty, senior vice president of governmental affairs at the American College of Physicians, who wrote a blog post on the website kevinmd.com this spring.

Medical groups have disagreed over the law.

No. I refuse to engage you, crazy Fox News person.

I am not going to even list off the reasons why this statement made by an actual as-seen-on-teevee-medical-doctor-hi-doctor-nick-expert-guy is stupid, because it does not deserve even that much. I am instead going to simply observe that it is something that somebody actually said, and again use the occasion as proof that the show Fox & Friends is a secret, long-running plot to make America paste-eatingly stupid via osmosis."

This rebate came about because of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) that specifically forces health insurance companies to spend no more than 20 percent on expenses not attributable to health care. No longer are they allowed to take your premiums and convert it to profits for shareholders, salaries for executives, and the purchase of politicians.

The Republican Party has been successful in misinforming and lying about Obamacare. This is likely one of the most immoral actions giving that slowing implementation and in the case of many Republican governors not accepting full implementation, is tantamount to the murder of American citizens with the weapon of knowing neglect.

Yesterday morning MSNBC Chuck Todd assessed that the Obama Presidency using the Republican moniker of Obamacare for the Affordable Care Act, while cute, was stupid. Todd vastly underestimates the success of the Republicans in promoting that name so much so that most Americans immediately identify with the Obamacare as opposed to the Affordable Care Act.

Just before the elections in 2012 I interviewed two intelligent upwardly mobile middle-class women in Austin, Texas. When asked about the Affordable Care Act they were completely oblivious to it. When told it was Obamacare they immediately knew what I was talking about and said they did not know it by that name. Check out that video here. It is probative.

The Obama administration has done a poor job of promoting the Affordable Care Act. The media has failed to effectively call out the lies on the Republican side thus given these lies plausibility and mental metastases. There is a lot of good news in states where politicians have made the concerted effort to support its citizens.

As people get rebates from insurance overcharges, as exchanges open that afford individuals affordable rates, and as states that have the best interests of their citizens expand Medicaid, many will see the benefits of having a healthier, humane and moral health care system. It is incumbent upon those on the right side of history to not allow those who would put corporate interest and greed over humanity to go unpunished for the sabotage they have effected on the wellbeing of the poor and the working middle class."

But the next unexploded scandal — a nuclear bomb in ObamaCare — is an opportunity for the media to redeem itself.

Thursday, Forbes reported that the Obama administration knew in 2010 that by the time the dust settles, 93 million Americans will lose their insurance due to ObamaCare. This time, instead of being caught off guard and surprised by something that is an open secret, maybe the media can get ahead of this story before it is too late — if it isn’t already:

Section 1251 of the Affordable Care Act contains what’s called a “grandfather” provision that, in theory, allows people to keep their existing plans if they like them. But subsequent regulations from the Obama administration interpreted that provision so narrowly as to prevent most plans from gaining this protection.

“The Departments’ mid-range estimate is that 66 percent of small employer plans and 45 percent of large employer plans will relinquish their grandfather status by the end of 2013,” wrote the administration on page 34,552 of the Register. All in all, more than half of employer-sponsored plans will lose their “grandfather status” and get canceled. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 156 million Americans–more than half the population–was covered by employer-sponsored insurance in 2013.

Another 25 million people, according to the CBO, have “nongroup and other” forms of insurance; that is to say, they participate in the market for individually-purchased insurance. In this market, the administration projected that “40 to 67 percent” of individually-purchased plans would lose their Obamacare-sanctioned “grandfather status” and get canceled, solely due to the fact that there is a high turnover of participants and insurance arrangements in this market. (Plans purchased after March 23, 2010 do not benefit from the “grandfather” clause.) The real turnover rate would be higher, because plans can lose their grandfather status for a number of other reasons.

How many people are exposed to these problems? 60 percent of Americans have private-sector health insurance–precisely the number that Jay Carney dismissed. As to the number of people facing cancellations, 51 percent of the employer-based market plus 53.5 percent of the non-group market (the middle of the administration’s range) amounts to 93 million Americans.

Dear Media: This is science, math, and law. How about digging in a little bit on this one? Because it is coming and we all know it.

The pace of sign-ups accelerated in November after the Obama administration worked to solve technical problems with healthcare.gov. Officials say there has been an even bigger increase in traffic in recent weeks.

Through November, just over 137,200 Americans have picked an insurance policy through healthcare.gov and nearly 227,500 through the 14 state-run exchanges, according to new federal figures released Wednesday. That's up from a total of 106,000 who signed up in October.

These figures reflect people who have selected an insurance plan, but not all have paid their first month's premium, which activates the coverage. An additional 1.94 million people have been determined eligible to enroll, but have not yet picked a policy.

Americans have until Dec. 23 to select a policy if they want coverage to start Jan. 1. They must start paying their premiums by the end of this year, or they may see their policy selection canceled. Open enrollment for those who want coverage in 2014 ends March 31.

Share your story: Are you signing up for Obamacare?

Federal officials said they think they are on track to reach their goals and noted that many people wait until the last minute to enroll.

""We're not exclusively focused on reaching a particular number. What we're focused on is reaching the millions of people who are really looking for affordable health care coverage,"" said Michael Hash, director of the Office of Health Reform in the Department of Health and Human Services.

Total enrollment is not the only important measure, Hash said. The viability of the exchanges depends on how many enrollees sign up in each state and the mix of participants.

""It's really about who signs up and where,"" he said.

Obamacare must attract younger, healthier people to offset the higher costs of the older and sicker. Otherwise, premiums could jump for 2015.

Only a handful of state exchanges have released demographic data of those picking plans. California, for instance, said that younger residents age 18 to 34 accounted for about 22.5% of the sign ups in October, just about the share they represent in the state population.

Sign-ups vary widely by state. More than 107,000 Californians have picked plans, while only 44 Oregonians have. Florida leads the way in the federal exchange, with nearly 18,000 people picking plans, while North Dakota has only 265 sign-ups.

Only about 41% of the total number eligible to enroll so far qualify for subsidies, less than half of initial projections.

Separately, just over 803,000 people have been determined eligible for Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Only half of states and the District of Columbia have opted to expand this public health program.

While federal officials have addressed many of the technical issues that plagued consumers' ability to sign up for a plan, they continue to wrestle with transmitting accurate applications to insurers. Officials say they think 90% of transaction forms are accurate, but are still working with insurers to match applicants records."
